BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by an abnormally high blood pressure in
the lung vasculature. It is a progressive, lethal disease that leads to heart failure and can occur
in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or pulmonary capillaries. Symptomatically patients
experience shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, and other symptoms, all of which are made
worse by exertion. There are multiple causes, and can be of unknown origin, idiopathic, and
can lead to hypertension in other systems, for example, portopulmonary hypertension in which
patients have both portal and pulmonary hypertension.
[0003] Pulmonary hypertension has been classified into five groups by the World Health
Organization (WHO). Group I is called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and includes
PAH that has no known cause (idiopathic), inherited PAH (i.e., familial PAH or FPAH), PAH
that is caused by drugs or toxins, and PAH caused by conditions such as connective tissue
diseases, HIV infection, liver disease, and congenital heart disease.         Group II pulmonary
hypertension is characterized as pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease.
Group III pulmonary hypertension is characterized as PH associated with lung diseases, such
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung diseases, as well as PH associated
with sleep-related breathing disorders (e.g., sleep apnea). Group IV PH is PH due to chronic
thrombotic and/or embolic disease, e.g., PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting
disorders. Group V includes PH caused by other disorders or conditions, e.g., blood disorders
(e.g., polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia), systemic disorders (e.g., sarcoidosis,
vasculitis), metabolic disorders (e.g., thyroid disease, glycogen storage disease).
[0004] Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) afflicts approximately 200,000 people globally
with approximately 30,000-40,000 of those patients in the United States. PAH

patients experience constriction of pulmonary arteries which leads to high pulmonary arterial
pressures, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. Patients stiffer from
shortness of breath and fatigue which often severely limits the ability to perform physical
activity.
[00051 The New York Heart Association (NYI-A) has categorized PAI patients into four
functional classes, used to rate the severity of the disease.        Class I PAH patients as
categorized by the NYHA, do not have a limitation of physical activity, as ordinary physical
activity does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope. Treatment is
not needed for class I PAH patients. Class II PAH patients as categorized by the NYHA have
a slight limitation on physical activity. These patients are comfortable at rest, but ordinary
physical activity causes undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope.       Class III
PAli patients as categorized by the NYIA have a marked limitation of physical activity.
Although comfortable at rest, class III PAH patients experience undue dyspnoea or fatigue,
chest pain or near syncope as a result of less than ordinary physical activity. Class IV PAHl
patients as categorized by the NYHA are unable to carry out any physical activity without
symptoms.     Class IV PAI patients might experience dyspnoea and/or fatigue at rest, and
discomfort is increased by any physical activity.       Signs of right heart failure are often
manifested by class IV PAH patients.
[00061 Patients with PAT] are treated with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA),
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor, a guanylate cyclase stimulator, a prostanoid
(e.g.,  prostacyclin), or a combination thereof.       ERAs include abrisentan (Letairis@),
sitaxentan, bosentan (Traclee     1),and macitentan (Opsumit 1).   PDE-5 inhibitors indicated
for the treatment of PAH include sildenafil (Revatio@), tadalafil (Adcirca@t).     Prostanoids
indicated   for the treatment of PA-I        include iloprost, epoprosentol    and treprostinil
(Remodulin@, Tyvaso@).         The one approved guanylate cyclase stimulator is riociguat
(Adempas@).        Additionally,   patients  are  often treated   with  combinations   of the
aforementioned compounds.
[00071 Portopulmonary hypertension is defined by the coexistence of portal and pulmonary
hypertension, and is a serious complication of liver disease. The diagnosis of portopulmonary
hypertension is based on hemodynamic criteria: (1) portal hypertension and/or liver disease
(clinical diagnosis-ascites/varices/splenomegaly), (2) mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25
mmHg at rest, (3) pulmonary vascular resistance > 240 dynes s/cm 5 , (4) pulmonary artery
occlusion pressure < 15 mm-ig or transpulmonary gradient > 12 mml-g. PP- is a serious

complication of liver disease, and is present in 0.25 to 4% of patients suffering from cirrhosis.
Today, PPH is conorbid in 4-6% of those referred for a liver transplant.
100081 Despite there being treatments for PAH and PPH, the current prostacyclin therapies
are associated with severe toxicity and tolerability issues, as well as the requirement for
inconvenient dosing schedules. The present invention overcomes addresses these factors by
providing compounds and treatment schedules that provide for less toxicity, better tolerability
and more convenient dosing schedules.

(Id"), (IT), (Ila), (Ib), (Ile) (lId), or (III), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is via
inhalation via an MDI or nebulizer. In one embodiment, where compound delivery is via a
nebulizer, the compound is provided to the patient as a composition, for example, as a lipid
nanoparticle composition, as described above.
[001701            Tn one embodiment, the method for treating PH, PAH or PPH comprises
administering to a patient in need thereof, an effective amount of the prostacyclin compound
or prostacyclin composition described herein. In a further embodiment, the compound,, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound, is administered to the patient via a
pulmonary (inhalation), a subcutaneous, oral, nasal or an intravenous route of administration.
In a further embodiment, administration is via inhalation and the prostacyclin compound or
composition is administered with a nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or MDI. In even a further
embodiment        the prostacyclin       composition or composition        comprises a prostacyclin
compound of Formula (I), (Ga), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ta'), (Ib'), (Ic'), (Id'), (a"), (Tb"), (Ic"),
(Id"), (II), (Ia), (Ilb), (Ile) (Id), or (TTT),            or a deuterated version thereof or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound.
[001711            In one embodiment, administration of an effective amount of a prostacyclin
compound or composition of the present invention for the treatment of PH, PAH or PPH via
inhalation, oral, nasal, subcutaneous or intravenous administration results in a decreased
number of side effects, or a reduced severity of one or more side effects (also referred to
herein as "adverse events"), compared to the administration of an effective amount of

treprostinil, when an effective amount of treprostinil is administered via inhalation, oral,
nasal, subcutaneous, or intravenous administration. For example, in one embodiment, a PH,
PAH or PPH patient experiences a reduced severity and/or frequency in cough or a reduced
cough response when administered a prostacylin compound or composition of the invention
via inhalation (e.g., nebulization, dry powder inhaler, or via a metered dose inhaler),
compared to the severity and/or frequency of cough or cough response elicited by inhalation
administration of treprostinil to the patient.
[001721          In another embodiment, oral, nasal, intravenous, subcutaneous or inhalation
administration of an effective amount of the prostacyclin compound or composition of the
invention, compared to oral, nasal, subcutaneous, intravenous or inhalation administration of
treprostinil, results in a reduced severity of one or more of the following adverse events, or a
decreased occurrence of one or more of the following adverse events: headache, throat
irritationlpha'ryngolaryngeal pain, nausea, flushing and/or syncope.
[001731          In another embodiment, oral, nasal, intravenous, subcutaneous or inhalation
administration of an effective amount of the prostacyclin compound or composition of the
invention, for the treatment of PH, PAH or PPH, compared to oral, nasal, subcutaneous,
intravenous or inhalation administration of treprostinil, results in a reduced severity of a
systemic adverse events, or a decreased occurrence of a systemic adverse event.
[001741          Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the improved
adverse event profile of the prostacylin compounds and compositions of the invention
exhibited patients, as compared to treprostinil, results in improved compliance of the patients.
[001751          In one embodiment, the prostacyclin compounds and compositions of the
present invention are administered on a less frequent basis, as compared to currently
approved therapies for PH, PAH (e.g., Tyvaso@, Remodulin@) or PPH, while still achieving
a substantially equivalent or better therapeutic response.      Routes of administration to the
patient include pulmonary (inhalation), subcutaneous, oral, nasal and intravenous.          The
therapeutic response of the patient, in one embodiment, is a reduction in the pulmonary
vascular resistance index (PVRI) from pretreatment value, a reduction in mean pulmonary
artery pressure from pretreatment value, an increase in the hypoxemia score from
pretreatment value, a decrease in the oxygenation index from pretreatment values, improved
right heart function, as compared to pretreatment or improved exercise capacity (e.g., as
measured by the six-minute walk test) compared to pretreatment. The therapeutic response,
                                                  AA

in one embodiment, is an improvement of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
40% or at least 50%, as compared to pretreatment values.          In another embodiment, the
therapeutic response is an improvement of about 10% to about 70%,. about 10% to about
60%, about 10% to about 50%, about 10% to about 40%, about 10% to about 30%, about
10% to about 20%, about 20% to about 70%, about 20% to about 60% or about 10% to about
50%, as compared to pretreatment levels.
[001761         Without wishing to be bound by theory, the less frequent administration of the
compounds and compositions of the invention allows for improved patient compliance, as
compared to the compliance of patients being administered a different PH, PAH or PPH
treatment (e.g., treprostinil - Tyvaso(@, Remodulin).
[001771         In one embodiment, a composition or compound of the present invention is
administered via a metered dose inhaler (MDI) to a patient in need of PH, PAH or PPH
treatment, The composition or compound, in one embodiment, is delivered via a MDI by the
use of a propellant, for example, a chloro-fluorocarbon (CFC) or a fluorocarbon.         In one
embodiment, where delivery is via an MI,         the compound is not formulated as a lipid
nanoparticle composition, and instead, is suspended or dissolved directly in a propellant
solution.  The patient, in one embodiment, is administered the prostacyclin compound or
composition of the invention once daily, twice daily or three times daily. In one embodiment,
the administration is wih food. In one embodiment, each administration comprises 1 to 5

administered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) to a patient in need of PH, PAH or PPH
treatment. The patient, in one embodiment, is administered the prostacyclin compound or
composition of the invention once daily, twice daily or three times daily. In one embodiment,
the administration is with food. In one embodiment, each administration comprises I to 5
doses (puffs) from a DPI, for example I dose (1 puff), 2 dose (2 puffs), 3 doses (3 puffs), 4

doses (4 puffs) or 5 doses (5 puffs). The DPI, in one embodiment, is small and transportable
by the patient.
1001801         In another embodiment, the prostacyclin compound administered to a patient
in need thereof via a pulmonary route by the PH, PAH or PAH treatment methods described
herein provides a greater pulmonary elimination half-life (tm2 ) of the prostacyclin compound
or its treprostinil metabolite, compared to the pulmonary elimination half-life (tm2) of
treprostinil, when treprostinil is administered via a pulmonary route (e.g., by nebulization,
dry powder inhaler, or a metered dose inhaler) to the patient in need of PH, PAH or PPH
treatment.
[001811         In another embodiment, the prostacyclin compound administered to a patient
in need thereof, via the PH, PAH or PPH treatment methods described herein provides a
greater systemic half-life (tj/) of the prostacyclin compound or its treprostinil metabolite,
compared to the systemic elimination half-life (t1 /2 ) of treprostinil, when treprostinil is
administered to the patient.    In a further embodiment, administration of the prostacyclin
compound and treprostinil comprises oral, nasal, subcutaneous or intravenous administration.
[001821         In another embodiment, the prostacyclin compound administered to a patient
in need of PH, PAH or PPH treatment provides a greater mean pulmonary CIax and/or lower
plasma Cmax of treprostinil for the patient, compared to the respective pulmonary or plasma
Cmax of treprostinil, when treprostinil is administered to the patient. In a further embodiment,
administration    of the prostacyclin     compound    and treprostinil    comprises   intravenous
administration.
[001831         In another embodiment, the prostacyclin compound administered to a patient
in need of P1-1, PA-1 or PP- treatment provides a greater mean pulmonary or plasma area
under the curve (AUCO     0 ) of the prostacyclin compound or its treprostinil metabolite,
compared to the mean pulmonary or plasma area under the curve (AUCoa) of treprostinil,
when treprostinil is administered to the patient. In yet another embodiment, the prostacyclin
compound administered to a patient in need thereof provides a greater pulmonary or plasma
time to peak concentration (tmax) of treprostinil, compared to the pulmonary or plasma time to
peak concentration (tmax) of treprostinil, when treprostinil is administered to the patient.

1001971          In one embodiment, a prostacyclin compound or composition provided herein,
for example, a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Tb), (Ic), (Id), (Ta'), (Ib), (Ic'), (Id'), (a"),
(lb"), (Ic"), (Id"), (II), (Ha), (Uib), (I)     (id), or (III), or a deuterated version thereof, or a
composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (a'), (b'), (Ic'),
(Id'), (Ia"), (Ib"'), (Ic"), (Id"), (II), (Iha), (fib), (ic) (Id), or (II), or a deuterated version
thereof, is administered in combination with one or more additional active agents. in some
embodiments, such one or more additional active agents can be also administered together
with a prostacyclin compound or composition provided herein using a metered dose inhaler.
In one emnbodimen, such one or more additional active agents can be administered
separately, i.e., prior to, or subsequent to, the prostacyclin compound or composition
provided herein. Particular additional active agents that can be administered in combination
with treprostinil may depend on a particular disease or condition for treatment or prevention
of which treprostinil is administered.       In some cases, the additional active agent can be a
cardiovascular agent such as a cox-2 inhibitor, a rho kinase inhibitor, a calcium channel
blocker, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, an endothelial antagonist, or an antiplatelet agent.
[001981          As provided above, the prostacyclin compounds and compositions of the
present invention can be delivered to a patient in need thereof via an oral, nasal, pulmonary,
intravenous or subcutaneous route.        With respect to the pulmonary route, the prostacyclin
compounds and compositions) of the present invention may be used in any dosage dispensing
device adapted for such administration. The device, in one embodiment, is constructed to
ascertain optimum metering accuracy and compatibility of its constructive elements, such as

container, valve and actuator with the formulation and could be based on a mechanical pump
system, e.g., that of a metered-dose nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, soft mist inhaler, or a
nebulizer.   For example, pulmonary delivery devices include a jet nebulizer, electronic
nebulizer, a soft mist inhaler, and a capsule-based dry powder inhaler.
[00199]         Suitable propellants, e.g., for MDI delivery, may be selected among such
gases as fluorocarbons,      chlorofluorocarbons   (CFCs), hydrocarbons, hydrofluoroalkane
propellants (e.g., HFA-134a and HFA-227), nitrogen and dinitrogen oxide or mixtures
thereof.
[002001         The inhalation delivery device can be a nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or a
metered dose inhaler (MDI), or any other suitable inhalation delivery device known to one of
ordinary skill in the art. The device can contain and be used to deliver a single dose of the
prostacyclin composition or the device can contain and be used to deliver multi-doses of the
composition of the present invention.
[002011         A nebulizer type inhalation delivery device can contain the compositions of
the present invention as a solution, usually aqueous, or a suspension.        For example, the
prostacyclin compound or composition can be suspended in saline and loaded into the
inhalation delivery device.      In generating the nebulized spray of the compositions for
inhalation, the nebulizer delivery device nay be driven ultrasonically, by compressed air, by
other gases, electronically or mechanically (e.g., vibrating mesh or aperture plate). Vibrating
mesh nebulizers generate fine particle, low velocity aerosol, and nebulize therapeutic
solutions and suspensions at a faster rate than conventional jet or ultrasonic nebulizers.
Accordingly, the duration of treatment can be shortened with a vibrating mesh nebulizer, as
compared to a jet or ultrasonic nebulizer. Vibrating mesh nebulizers amenable for use with
the methods described herein include the Philips Respironics I-Neb@, the Omron MicroAir,
the Nektar Aeroneb@, and the Pari eFlow@.
[002021         The nebulizer may be portable and hand held in design, and may be equipped
with a self contained electrical unit. The nebulizer device may comprise a nozzle that has
two coincident outlet channels of defined aperture size through which the liquid formulation
can be accelerated.     This results in impaction of the two streams and atomization of the
formulation. The nebulizer may use a mechanical actuator to force the liquid formulation
through a multiorifice nozzle of defined aperture size(s) to produce an aerosol of the

formulation for inhalation. In the design of single dose nebulizers, blister packs containing
single doses of the formulation may be employed.
1002031          In the present invention the nebulizer may be employed to ensure the sizing of
particles is optimal for positioning of the particle within, for example, the pulmonary
membrane.
[002041     Upon nebulization, the nebulized composition (also referred to as "aerosolized
composition") is in the form of aerosolized particles. The aerosolized composition can be
characterized by the particle size of the aerosol, for example, by measuring the "mass median
aerodynamic      diameter"    or  "fine  particle  fraction"   associated   with the    aerosolized
composition. "Mass media n aerodynamic diameter" or "MMAD" is normalized regarding the
aerodynamic separation of aqua aerosol droplets and is determined by impactor measurements,
e.g., the Anderson Cascade Impactor (ACI) or the Next Generation Impactor (NINGI). The gas
flow rate, in one embodiment, is 28 Liter per minute for the ACI and 15 liter per minute for
the NGI.
[00205]     "Geometric standard deviation" or "GSD" is a measure of the spread of an
aerodynamic particle size distribution.        Low GSDs characterize a narrow droplet size
distribution (homogeneously sized droplets), which is advantageous for targeting aerosol to
the respiratory system.      The average droplet size of the nebulized composition provided
herein, in one embodiment is less than 5 pm or about 1 pm to about 5 am, and has a GSD in
a range of 1.0 to 2.2, or about 1.0 to about 2.2, or 1.5 to 2.2, or about 1.5 to about 2.2.
[002061     "Fine particle fraction" or "FPF," as used herein, refers to the fraction of the
aerosol having a particle size less than 5 pm in diameter, as measured by cascade impaction.
FPF is usually expressed as a percentage.
1002071     In one embodiment, the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the
nebulized composition is about I pm to about 5 pm, or about I prn to about 4 pm, or about I
jam to about 3 pm or about I pm to about 2 pm, as measured by the Anderson Cascade
Impactor (ACI) or Next Generation Impactor (NGI). In another embodiment, the MMAD of
the nebulized composition is about 5 jm or less, about 4 pm or less, about 3 Im or less,
about 2 pm or less, or about 1 pm or less, as measured by cascade impaction, for example, by
the ACI or NGI.
[00208]      In one embodiment, the MAA ) of the aerosol of the pharmaceutical composition
is less than about 4.9 pm, less than about 4.5 pim, less than about 4.3 pm, less than about 4.2

pm, less than about 4.1 pm, less than about 4.0 pm or less than about 3.5 pm, as measured by
cascade impaction.
1002091      In one embodiment, the MMAD of the aerosol of the pharmaceutical composition
is about 1.0 pm to about 5.0 pm, about 2.0 pm to about 4.5 pm, about 2.5 am to about 4.0
pm, about 3.0 pm to about 4.0 pm or about 3.5 pm to about 4.5 pm, as measured by cascade
impaction (e.g., by the ACI or NGI).
[002101          In one embodiment, the FPF of the aerosolized composition is greater than or
equal to about 50%, as measured by the ACI or NGI, greater than or equal to about 60%, as
measured by the ACI or NGI or greater than or equal to about 70%, as measured by the ACI
or NGI. In another embodiment, the FPF of the aerosolized composition is about 50% to
about 80%, or about 50% to about 70% or about 50% to about 60%, as measured by the NGI
or ACT.
[002111          In one embodiment, a metered dose inhalator (MDI) is employed as the
inhalation delivery device for the compositions of the present invention.           In a further
embodiment,       the   prostacyclin    compound     is  suspended    in    a  propellant   (e.g.,
hydroflourocarbon) prior to loading into the MDL The basic structure of the MDI comprises
a metering valve, an actuator and a container.          A propellant is used to discharge the
formulation from the device. The composition may consist of particles of a defined size
suspended in the pressurized propellant(s) liquid, or the composition can be in a solution or
suspension of pressurized         liquid propellant(s). The propellants used are primarily
atmospheric friendly hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) such as 134a and 227. The device of the
inhalation system may deliver a single dose via, e.g.. a blister pack, or it may be multi dose in
design.    The pressurized metered dose inhalator of the inhalation system can be breath
actuated to deliver an accurate dose of the lipid-containing formulation. To insure accuracy
of dosing, the delivery of the formulation may be programmed via a microprocessor to occur
at a certain point in the inhalation cycle. The MDI may be portable and hand held.
[002121          In one embodiment, a dry powder inhaler (DPI) is employed as the inhalation
delivery device for the compositions of the present invention. In one embodiment, the DPI
generates particles having an MM AD of from about 1 pm to about 10 pm, or about I pm to
about 9 pm, or about 1 tpm to about 8 pm, or about 1 tpm to about 7 pm, or about 1 pm to
about 6 pm, or about I pm to about 5 pm, or about I pm to about 4 am. or about I pm to
about 3 pm, or about 1 pm to about 2 m in diameter, as measured by the NGI or ACI. In

another embodiment, the DPI generates a particles having an MMAD of from about I pm to
about 10 urn, or about 2 pm to about 10 pm, or about 3 pm to about 10 gm, or about 4 Pm to
about 10 pm, or about 5 pm to about 10 pm, or about 6 ptm to about 10 rn, or about 7 pum to
about 10 urn, or about 8 i to about 10 pm, or about 9 pm to about 10 pm, as measured by
the NGI or A C.
[002131         In one embodiment, the MMAD of the particles generated by the DPI is about
1 pm or less, about 9 pm or less, about 8 urn or less, about 7 pm or less, 6 pin or less, 5 pm

[002171         The present invention is further illustrated by reference to the following
Examples. However, it should be noted that these Examples, like the embodiments described
                                                   i;'7

above, are illustrative and are not to be construed as restricting the scope of the invention in
any way.
Example 1 - Synthesis of treprostinil alkyl esters
[00218]              Treprostinil compounds derivatized with alkyl groups at the carboxylic acid
moiety were prepared. Specifically, treprostinil was derivatized at the carboxylic acid moiety
with C2 , C3 , C4 , C3 , C6 , Cs, C10, Cu, Cie, and Ci alkyl chains (i.e., R 2 in Formula (A), below,
is C2 , C 3 , C 4 , C1, C6, Cs, CIO, C12 , C16 or Cjs alkyl) to make treprostinil alkyl esters of various
ester chain lengths. Treprostinil can be synthesized, for example, by the methods disclosed in
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,765,117 and 8,497,393.                  Synthesis of prostaglandin derivatives is
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,668,814.              The disclosures of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,765,117;
8,497,393 and 4,668,814 are each incorporated by reference in their entireties for all
purposes.

[00219]              Scheme 1:
[002201              Treprostinil esterification was catalyzed by strongly acidic resin Amberlyst@
15 (Rohm and Haas).             Treprostinil acid was dissolved in anhydrous dioxane/alcohol at a
concentration 10 mg/mL (typically 4 mL). Alcohol (R2 -OH) added was appropriate to make
corresponding chain length at the R 2 group.             By way of example, for the C2 (ethyl ester)
compound, the alcohol was ethanol. The molar amount of alcohol in the solvent was ten
times the molar amount of treprostinil.
[00221]              Treprostinil in dioxane/alcohol solution was added to washed and dry
Amberlyst resin. Per each 40 mg treprostinil, 1 g resin in a glass vial was added. The mixture
was placed on a shaker and incubated overnight at 40 C. Next, the liquid portion was taken
out of the vial, washed twice with 3 mL dioxane. All recovered solvent was then collected.
The solvent was dried by nitrogen stream until the evaporation stopped.                  The remaining
treprostinil alkyl ester and nonvolatile alcohol (if long chain alcohol used) was dissolved in 2

mL hexane/ethyl acetate 1:1, and cleaned by liquid-liquid extraction vs. equal volume of
phosphate buffer, and then water. Next, the organic layer was separated and dried by
nitrogen stream and further in vacuum.         If a long chain alcohol used, an additional
purification step was required to separate alcohol by liquid chromatography. ACE CN, 5 pi,
Ultra-Inert HPLC Column, 100x2iL2 mm was used, with mobile phase of hexane/propanol
98:2%.

[(3 S.)-3-hydroxyoctyl]-1H-benz[finden-5-yl]oxy]acetic     acid (treprostinil) (78.1 mg, 200
ptmoles) dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (2.0 mL) was added Amberlystf           15 resin (2.0 g) and
alcohol R2 -OH (2.0 mmoles, 10 equivalents). The reaction mixture was heated to 40 'C and
allowed to shake at approximately 100 rpm for 18-196 hours. Solvent was removed and the
resin was washed with acetonitrile (MeCN) (3 x 3 mL). The 1,4-dioxane and MeCN extracts
were combined and dried using a gentle stream of warmed N2 gas and gentle heat to yield a
thick waxy solid. The crude material was dissolved in 20% "PrOH-/1-exanes and submitted to
preparatory HPLC purification.      Solvent was removed from the purified material using a
gentle strearn of warmed N2 gas and gentle heat to yield an off-white waxy solid. The pure
material was suspended in ethyl lactate for storage and was submitted to analytical HPLC for
concentration determination.

[002271         Additionally, spontaneous hydrolysis was measured for 200 pM of treprostinil
compounds derivatized at the carboxylic acid group with either a C3, C4, C5 , C6 , Cs or C1
alkyl group in 20% ethanol at 40 'C at six time points (0 hr., 1 hr., 2 hr., 4 hr., 6 hr., 24 hr.).
[002281         Each sample was prepared as a 200 pM solution in 20% ethanol. At each time
point, an aliquot was removed for HPLC analysis to resolve remaining reactants (C3 , C4, C5 ,
C6 , Cs, CO) or their degradation product (treprostinil). For each sample, hydrolysis was
calculated from the measured reactant arid product peak areas:
       % hydrolysis   = (product peak area/(reactant peak area + product peak area)* 100).
1002291         The results of the time course experiment are provided at Figure IA.             The
results indicate that hydrolysis rate is correlated with the length of the alkyl ester moiety.
[00230]         Esterase mediated hydrolysis of treprostinil compounds and compositions was
measured for compounds derivatized at the carboxylic acid group with C2, C4, Cc, Cs and Cio
alkyl groups and compositions comprising the same. Experiments were conducted at 37 0 C.
and hydrolysis was measured at 15 min., 30 min., and 1 hour after addition of the esterase to
the compound solution. The reaction mixture for each sample was prepared at a final volume
of 500 pL containing, 200 pM treprostinil compound, 0.05 U esterase, 20% ethanol, and
PBS. Hydrolysis was measured as described above.
[002311         The results of this experiment are provided at Figure 1B. The results indicate
that compound degradation rate decreases with increasing alkyl ester chain length.
1002321         Treprostinil alkyl ester conversion to treprostinil was also measured in the
presence of rat, dog and monkey lung tissue homogenate at 37 'C. Here, data were calculated
based on fit of exponential increase to the maximum (experiments performed in duplicate).
The results of this study are provided below in Table 2A and Figure 37. Specifically, Figure
37 left, shows that conversion to treprostinil depends on alkyl chain length,                In this
experiment, treprostinil alkyl esters were incubated for 4 hours at a final concentration of 200
nM in I mL of tissue homogenate prepared in water and normalized to 10 mg/mL of protein.

[00235]           All particle size measurements were performed using a Wyatt Technology
MobiusTM Zeta Potential/ Particle Sizing Instrument in Quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS)
mode.        Composition aliquots were diluted 10-fold in pre-filtered (0.02 pm pore filter)
ultrapure of deionized H20. Light scattering data was collected and converted into particle

size and size distribution using Dynamics@ v. 7.2.4 instrument software. Reported average
particle size diameter is based on the cumulants model, which mathematically fits particle
diffusion constants (determined by the raw scattering intensities of particles in a suspension)
to obtain the particle size mean and a distribution of particle sizes around the mean diameter.
[00236]         It was fund that the particle size (average particle diameter) of treprostinil
compositions increases in size in compositions comprising C2-C5 alkyl ester derivatized
treprostinil, and decreases in size in compositions comprising C6 -C12 alkyl ester derivatized
treprostinil. These results are provided in Figure 2. The largest average particle diameter
was found for compositions comprising treprostinil pentyl ester (i.e., treprostinil derivatized
with a C alkyl ester) (316 nm).       Compositions comprising treprostinil ethyl ester had an
average particle diameter of 41 nm. It should be recognized that through manipulation of
processing parameters the same compositions could be produced with different mean
diameters and size distributions.        Manipulations of composition in combination with
manipulation of processing parameters could also be performed to produce particles of
various sizes.
[002371         Under the conditions utilized here it was also found that longer chain
derivatized treprostinil compounds formed more uniform particles than compounds having
shorter alkyl ester chains. Particle uniformity was determined using the software-calculated
polydispersity (%PD). Polydispersity is defined as the standard deviation of the particle size
distribution from the mean particle size value.     %PD normalizes the polydispersity to the
mean diameter by dividing by the nean size and multiplying by 100.             These parameters
indicate whether a particle suspension has one or more size populations of particles
(monomodal versus multimodal).          It also gives insight into the width of particle size
distribution (or degree particle uniformity) around the mean for the respective particle
populations.
[002381         Dynamics polydispersity parameter represents a monodisperse population of
particles if %PD 5 15.      A calculated %PD > 57% represents a polydisperse population of
particles.   For instance, the %PD data plotted in Figure 2 yields information about the
uniformity of particle size populations from the treprostinil compounds tested.           CS-TR
(TR=treprostinil), Cur=TR, C -TR, and Cw4 -TR alkyl esters yielded near monodisperse
particles with %PD at or around 15. C 2 -TR, C6 -TR, Cis-TR, and Cis-TR alkyl esters yielded
particles that have %PD slightly above the 15, suggesting that there is one population of
particles.   However, these particles possessed a wider distribution of particles sizes around

the mean particle size when compared to Cs-TR, Cio-TR, C 2-TR, and C           4 TR. C 3-*TR, C 4
TR, and C5 -TR showed much greater than 15 %PD and some ;> 57. These values indicate
that there are multiple populations of particles that possess wide particle size distributions.
Example 4 - Measurement of evelic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in CHO
KI cells in response to treprostinil compositions
[00239]         A cell based Chinese hamster ovary-Ki (CFI(-K)              assay based on the
GloSensorTM cAMP assay (Promega) was used to characterize the effect of treprostinil alkyl
ester compounds on cAAP levels.
[00240]         cANIP is a second messenger involved in signal transduction of (-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) acting through Gai-s and Ga-i proteins. Because the treprostinil
receptor is a GPCR, the assay provides an indication of whether the respective prostacyclin
compound (or metabolite thereof) binds its receptor and activates the GPCR cell signaling
cascade.
[00241]         The GloSensorTM assay harnesses a genetically modified form of firefly
luciferase into which a cAMP-binding protein moiety has been inserted. Upon binding of
cAN1P, a conformational change is induced leading to increased light output.
[00242]         The EP2 prostanoid receptor was co-transfected with the GloSensorTM plasmid
(Promega) into CHO-Ki         cells as follows.     CHO-K1 cells were harvested when the
monoloayer was at 50-90% confluence. First, cells were washed with 5 mL PBS. Two mL
of pre-warmed (37 cC) 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Cat #: 25300054) was
added, and cells were dislodged by tapping the flask on the side. Next, 10 mL of antibiotic
free growth media (Life Tech, Cat #: 31765092) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone, Cat #: SH30071.03) was added, and cells were centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 minutes
at room temperature. The media was aspirated, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL
of growth media.     Cell number was determined using a hemacytometer.            Each well of a
culture treated 96 well flat bottom plate (Costar, Cat #: 3917) was seeded with 1 x 104 cells
per 100 pL antibiotic-free growth media. The cells were incubated ovemight at 37 'C and
5% CO 2 in a water-jacketed incubator.
[00243]         For small scale transfections of up to 20 wells, the pGLoSensor-22F cAMP
plasmid (Promega, Cat #: E2301) (2 pg): (EP2) (10 ng) (Origene, Cat H': SC126558) : pGEM
3Zf(+) (10 ng) (Promega, Cat #: P2271) ratio was diluted to a final concentration of 12.6
ng/pL (total plasmid) in Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium (Life Technologies, Cat #:

 1985062). Next, 6 pL of FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega, Cat #: E2311) was
added to 160 pL of diluted plasrid and mixed carefully by gentle pipetting. The complex
was incubated at room temperature for 0 to 10 minutes, and then 8 pL of the complex was
added per well of a 96 well white assay plate (Costar, Cat #: 3917) and gently mixed without
disturbing the cell monolayer. The plates were incubated for 20-24 hours at 37 0 C and 5%
CO 2 in a water-jacketed incubator. Following incubation, cells were treated and analyzed.
[002441         For larger scale transfections, the aforementioned steps were scaled up
accordingly, and cells were frozen following the last incubation. In order to prepare frozen
transfected CHO-KI cells, the media was aspirated from culture flasks and cells were rinsed
with 5 mL PBS.       As above, 2 mL of pre-warmed (37 'C) 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Life
Technologies. Cat #: 25300054) was added, and cells were dislodged by tapping the flask on
the side. Next, 10 mL of antibiotic free growth media (Life Technologies, Cat #: 31765092)
containing 10% FBS (Hyclone, Cat #: SH3007 1.03) was added, and cells were centrifuged at
250 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cell number was determined using a
hemacytometer. The media was aspirated, and the cell pellet was resuspended in freezing
media (Millipore, cat #: S-002-5F) at 2.5 x 100 cells/ vial. Transfected cells were incubated
overnight at -80 C before transfer to liquid nitrogen for long term storage. 'he frozen stocks
were then thawed one day prior to use for assays, and cells were seeded at 2.5   x 104 cells per
well in 100 pL of antibiotic-free complete media (F12 (Life Technologies, Cat # : 31765092)
+-10%FBS (Hyclone, Cat #: SH30071.03)).       Following an overnight incubation at 37 'C and
5% CO2 in a water-jacketed incubator, the cells were ready for use in cAMP response assays.
100245]         In preparation for cAM P measurement, the cells were equilibrated with the
GloSensor cAMP reagent prior to treatment. For equilibration, the medium was carefully
removed from the individual well.        Next, 100 pL of equilibration medium (6%v/v of
Glosensor Reagent stock solution (Promega, Cat 4: E291), 10% FBS (Hyclone, Cat 4:
SH30071 .03) and 88% CO 2 independent medium (Life Technologies, Cat #: 18045088)) was
added per well of the 96-well plate, and added to the side of each well. The plate was then
incubated for 2 hours at rooni temperature. A first pre-read measurement was taken using a
microplate reader (MicroLumat Plus). Plates were incubated for an additional 10 minutes at
room temperature, followed by a second pre-read measurement.
[002461         Working solutions of free treprostinil and treprostinil alkyl ester compounds
were prepared at I OX concentration so that the final concentration was IX once added to the
cells. Following treatment, each plate was read every 5 minutes for the duration of the assay
                                                 i' i;

using a microplate reader (MicroLumat Plus). In order to determine the fold change in cAMP
relative to the control, the transfection efficiency was first determined by dividing the second
pre-read measurement by the average of the corresponding pre-read measurements. Next, the
normalized relative light units (RLUs) of the samples were determined by dividing the plate
read measurement by the transfection efficiency. The fold change in cAMP relative to the
control was then determined by dividing the normalized RLU of the samples by the
normalized RLLU of the control.
Validation of cAMP assay using free treprostinil
[002471         The cAMP assay was validated using free treprostinil. Treprostinil (10 pM, 1
pM, 0.1 pM, 0.01 pM, 0.001 pM, 0.0001 pM, 0.0001 pM, and 0.000001 pM) was added to
equilibrated CHO-K1 cells, and the cells were then incubated for 30 minutes. Luminescence
was then measured at room temperature.
Alklylester      ostinilcompositions
1002481         C-lO-Ki cells co-transfected with the EP2 receptor and GloSensorTM plasmid
were challenged with free treprostinil (10 pM, I pM, 0.1 pM, 0.01 pM, 0.001 pM, 0.0001
pM, 0.00001 pM, 0.00001 pM) and treprostinil alkyl ester compounds, i.e., compounds
having either a C6 , Cs or CO straight chain alkyl group at the R 2 position of the compound of
Formula (A), shown above.
1002491         The following concentrations of compounds were measured: 10 pM, 1 pM,
0.1 pM. 0.01 pM, 0.001 pM, 0.0001 pM, 0.00001 pM, 0.000001 pM. cAMP levels were
then measured every 5 mimites over a time course of 8 hours. Results from the three highest
concentrations are provided at Figure 3A (10 pM), Figure 3B (1 pM) and Figure 3C (0.1
pM). The components of the treprostinil compositions set forth in Figures 3A, 3B and 3C are
shown in Table 4 below.
[002501         cAMP levels in response to the treprostinil decyl ester (Ci 0-TR) (10 pM) were
equivalent to free treprostinil and the levels were sustained for at least 6 hours. The sustained
cAMP level was not exhibited in response to free treprostinil.
[002511         CHO-KI cells co-transfected with the EP2 receptor and GloSensorTM plasmid
were challenged with free treprostinil (5 pM) and treprostinil compositions having either a
treprostinil derivatized at the R2 position of the above compound with a C 2 , C6 , C, C10, or
C12 straight chain group (5 pM).         The components of the treprostinil compositions are

 provided in Table 5, below. cAMP levels were then measured every 5 minutes over a time
 course of 8 hours.
  1002521           Results of these experiments using the 5 pNi dose are provided at Figure 4 and
 Figure 5. cAMP response to the C2 and C1 Otreprostinil alkyl esters (5 pM) was greater than
 or equivalent to the response induced by free treprostinil (Figure 4). The cAMP levels in
 response to the C2 and Cio treprostinil alkyl ester compounds were sustained significantly
  longer than free treprostinil and the C6 , Cs, and C 2 treprostinil derivatives.

 Treprostinil compounds
  [002531               The cell based (CHO-KI) cAMP assay was also used to characterize the
 effect of unformulated treprostinil compounds (i.e., compounds without a hydrophobic
 additive and/or an amphiphilic agent such as a PEGylated lipid) on cAMP levels.
  1002541               CHO-Kl cells co-transfected with the EP2 receptor and GloSensorTM
 plasmid were challenged with free treprostinil (5 pM) and treprostinil derivatives having
 either a C2 , C3, C4, C5 , C6 , Cs, C-, or C 2 straight chain alkyl ester moiety (5 pM). cAMP
 levels were then measured every 5 minutes over a time course of 8 hours.

[002551              Results of these experiments are provided at Figure 5.                C2 and Cj,
treprostinil alkyl esters induced cAMP response levels equivalent to free treprostinil. The C1 2
derivatized treprostinil compound was found to induce the smallest cAMP response.
Nebulized Treprostinil Ester Compositions
[002561              The cell based (CHO-KI) cAMP assay described above was also used to
characterize the effect of nebulization of various treprostinil compositions on cAM P levels.
[002571              CHO-KI cells co-transfected with the EP2 receptor and GloSensorTM
plasmid were challenged with 10 ptM free treprostinil (control or nebulized) and 10 pM
treprostinil compositions comprising a compound derivatized with either a C2 , Cs, C1O, or C 1 2
straight chain alkyl group at position R2 of the compound of Formula (A), provided above
(control or nebulized).
[002581              The compositions tested in this experiment are provided in Table 6 below
(results in Figure 6). cAMP levels were then measured every 5 minutes over a time course of
8 hours.
[002591             Nebulizer Aeroneb       Pro (Aerogen) was used to nebulize treprostinil
derivative compositions. Desired volume of the formulation (usually 3 mL) was loaded to the
mesh head of the nebulizer. The head was connected directly to the glass impinger with air
tight seal. Nebulization was carried out using factory settings until the entire sample was
nebulized. After nebulization was complete, the head was disconnected; impinger capped
and centrifuged 5 mn       at 600 x g to settle the aerosol inside the impinger. The procedure
provided nearly 100% yield in collecting the nebulized sample.
[002601              As shown in Figure 6, nebulization             of the derivatized treprostinil
compositions did not have a deleterious effect on cAMP response levels, or duration of the
response.

 Example 5 - Determination of the effect of treprostinil compounds on cell proliferation
  [002621           In order to        determine      any effect of treprostinil       compounds          on   cell
 proliferation, cell based assays using CHO-K] cells and rat alveolar cells (NR8383 cells)
 were performed.
 CHO-KI Cells
  [002631               CHO-KI cells were harvested when the cell monolayer was 50-90%
 confluent (use passage 4-11).            Media was aspirated out of the flask, and cells were rinsed
 with 2 mL of F12 media. Next, I mL of pre-warmed (37 'C) 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Life
 Technologies, Cat#: 25300054) was added, and cells were dislodged from the flask by
 tapping it on the side. Complete growth media (F12 (Life Technologies, Cat #: 31765092)
 +10%FBS (Hyclone, Cat #: SF130071.03) + IX Pen-Strep (Life Technologies, cat # 15140
  122) was then added at a volume of 10 mL. Cells were centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 minutes
 at room temperature, and the media was aspirated. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL
 complete growth media. Cell number was determined using a hemacytometer. Cells were
 then seeded at 2000 cells per well of a 96-well plate in 100 pL of complete growth media.
 The plate was incubated overnight at 37 C and 5% CO2 in a water-jacketed incubator.
  [002641               The next day, 80 pL of fresh complete media was added to each well, and
 CfHO-K 1 cells were challenged with treprostinil compound and composition treatments. The
 working solutions were prepared at lOX concentration, and following 2 fold serial dilutions,
 20 pL aliquots were added per well to arrive at a final IX concentration. Following a 48 hour
                                                            '71

incubation at 37 'C and 5% CO 2 in a water-jacketed incubator, the inhibitory effect on cell
proliferation was determined. Plates were analyzed using 20 pl of Presto Blue reagent (Life
Technologies, cat #: A13262) per well. The reagent was mixed, and plates were incubated
for 1 hour at 37 'C and 5% C02 in a water-jacketed incubator. Plates were read using either a
CytoFluor Series 4000 (PerSeptive l3ioSystems) or Synergy Neo microplate reader (BioTek)
with emission 2: 590 nm and excitation ?: 560 nm. The percent inhibition was determined
using the following formula: % inhibition:= 100% - (treated samples/control x 100%).
NR8383 cells
[002651            Rat alveolar NR8383 cells were harvested when the monolayer was 50
90% confluent (use passage 5-11). Because the NR8383 cells include both adherent and non
adherent cells, media was transferred to a 50 mL Falcon tube. To obtain the cells remaining
in the flask, 2 mL of plain media was added, and the remaining cells were scraped out of the
75 cm 2 flask with a cell scraper and added to the 50 mL tube. Cells were centrifuged at 200 x
g for 5 minutes at room temperature, and the media was aspirated.           The cell pellet was
resuspended in 10 mL complete growth media (F12 (Life Technologies, Cat #: 31765092)
+15%     FBS - heat inactivated (Hyclone,        Cat #: SH30071.03) +        1XPen-Strep (Life
Technologies, cat #: 15410 - 122)). Cell number was determined using a hemacytometer.
Cells were then seeded at 4000 cells per well of a 96-well plate in 100 L of complete growth
media.     The plate was incubated overnight at 37 'C and 5% CO 2 in a water-jacketed
incubator.
1002661            The next day, 80 aL of fresh complete media was added to each well, and
the NR8383 cells were challenged with treprostinil compound treatments. Following a 72
hour incubation at 37 'C and 5% CO 2 in a water-jacketed incubator, the inhibitory effect on
cell proliferation was determined. Measurements and calculations were made as described
above for the CHIO-Ki cells.
Effect of treprostinil alkyl ester compositions on C HO-KI cell proliferation
[002671            CHO-KI cells were challenged with compositions comprising treprostinil
alkyl ester derivatives:

T543     (C 6 -TR  40   mol    %,   Toco   Acet   40  mol   %, Chol-PEG2k        10   mol   %).

at concentrations ranging from 0.55      M to 125 tM. Following a 48 hour incubation period,
the inhibitory effect of the treprostinil derivative compositions on cell proliferation was
determined.
[002681            Table 8 below summarizes the effect of the above treprostinil compositions

at the same concentrations (0.55 pM to 125 pM) as the CHO-Ki cells above. Following a 72
hour incubation period, the inhibitory effect of the treprostinil derivative compositions on cell
proliferation was determined.
[002711                 Table 8 above summarizes the effect of the above treprostinil compositions
on NR8383 cell proliferation. At the highest dose of 100 pM, all of the treprostinil derivative
compositions demonstrated some inhibition of cell proliferation, and T543 (C6-TR) exhibited
the greatest inhibitory effect.
Effect of treprostinil alkyl ester compounds on cell proliferation
[002721                 In order to determine any effect of treprostinil derivative compounds
(unformulated) on cell proliferation, the cell based assays described above, using CHO-KI
cells and rat alveolar cells (NR8383 cells) were performed.
CHO-Ki cell proliferation assay
[002731                 CHO-K1 cells were challenged with treprostinil alkyl esters, i.e., TR

[002761              Table 11 above summarizes the effect of the above treprostinil alkyl esters
on NR8383 cell proliferation. Similar to the CHO-Ki cell assay, only the treprostinil octyl
ester showed some inhibition of cell proliferation at the highest concentration.
Treprostinil derivative compositions - effect on cell proliferation
[002771              In order to determine the effect of treprostinil derivative compositions on
cell proliferation, cell based assays using CHO-Ki cells and rat alveolar cells (NR8383 cells)
were performed.
Effect of treprostinil compositions on CHO cell proliferation
[002781              CHO-KI cells were challenged with treprostinil derivative compositions:
T596 (C2-TR 45 mol %N,DSG-P2K 55 mol %N),T597 (C6-TR 45 mol %, DSG-P2K 55 mol
   T),1598 (Cs-TR 45 mol %, DSG-P2K 55 mol %/),T599 (C1 o-TR 45 mol%,. DSG-P2K 55
mol %), and 1600 (C 12-TR 45 mol %, DSG-P2K 55 mol %), 1612 (C2-TR 10 mol %, DMPE
P1K 90 mol %), T613 (Cs-TR 10 mol %, DMPE-PIK 90 mol %o),at concentrations ranging
from 0.23 pM to 29 pM. Following a 72 hour incubation period, the inhibitory effect on cell
proliferation was determined. Following a 48 hour incubation period, the inhibitory effect on
cell proliferation was determined.
[002791              Table 10 below summarizes the effect of the treprostinil compositions on
CHO-KI cell proliferation. None of the compositions tested exhibited a significant inhibitory
effect on CHO-IK1 cell proliferation.

[002811               Rat alveolar NR8383 cells were challenged with the same treprostinil

and at the same concentrations (0.23 pM to 29 pM) as the Cl-O-KI cells above. Following a
72 hour incubation period, the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was determined.
1002821               Table 10 above summarizes the effect of the treprostinil composition on
NR8383 cell proliferation. All of the treprostinil compositions demonstrated some (< 10%)
inhibition of NR8383 cell proliferation.
Example 6 -Treprostinil compounds in vivm
[002831               The effect of treprostinil derivative compounds in vivo was determined by
using rat models. Young male rats Sprague Dawley (Charles River) were used for the study.
                                                        '7'

Rats anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, placed on a heating pad and after surgical isolation
and catheterization of the trachea, mechanically ventilated throughout the study.
[002841           A catheter was placed in the femoral artery for measurement of systolic
(sys) and diastolic (dias) blood pressures.        A thoracotomy was performed and a catheter
inserted into the right ventricle and positioned in the pulmonary artery for the measurement
of pulmonary arterial systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) was
measured with a pulse oximeter placed on the paw.
[002851            With the rats ventilated on room air (FIO2                  =   0.21), cardiovascular
measurements were made tinder these nornioxic conditions. In order to induce hypoxia the
F102 was reduced over a 30 min period until SaO2 fell to values between 50-60%, and a
baseline hypoxia value for each of the parameters was determined.
1002861            Groups of four rats each received either PBS, free treprostinil (1.7 pg/kg
and 10 ptg/kg), or a composition comprising C 2 -TR (T554); Cs-TR (T555: Cs-TR 40 mol %,
squalane 40 mol %, Chol-PEG2k 10 mol %, DOPC 10 mol %) (38.6 ptg/kg), Cio-TR (T556:
Cio-TR 40 mol %, squalane 40 mol %, Chol-PEG2k 10 mol %, DOPC 10 mol%) (40.8
pig/kg)), Ci-TR (T568).
[002871            The target dose varied slightly by weight due to the differences in
molecular weight of the treprostinil derivative compositions as shown in Table 11 below.
The actual achieved lung dose was about 5x lower than provided in Table II (e.g.,
administration of 10 jig/kg yielded about 2 pg/kg in the lungs). The various treatments were
delivered (via inhalation of nebulized drug to the lungs of the rats. The puionary arterial
pressure (PAP), systemic arterial pressure (SAP), and heart rate of the rats were measured
continuously for 180 minutes. The PAP signal was collected at 200 points per second.

position of the above compound. cAMP levels were then measured every 5 minutes over a
time course of 8 hours. Dose response curves at 0.5hr, 1hr, 2hr, 3hr, 4hr, 5hr, 6hr, 7hr, and
8hr incubation time for 5-nonanyl-TR, C1 4-TR, and Ci 6 -TR are provided in Figures 18, 19,
and 20 ,respectively. Like C 14 -TR and C16-TR, the potency of 5-nonanyl-TR increases with
incubation time, indicating a delay-release profile. The half maximal effective concentrations
(EC 5 0 ) of the treprostinil compounds were determined using the results from the cAMP
assays. EC50 for 5-Nonanyl-TR, C 14 -TR, and C16 -TR are shown in Figures 18, 19, and 20,
respectively.

concentrations of C 12 -TR, C 14 -TR, Ci 6 -TR, or 5-nonanvl-TR are provided at Figure 21.
cAMP levels in response to C 12-TR, C 14-TR, and 5-nonanyl-TR at both concentrations
increased over the first 1-1.5 hours and were sustained for at least 8 hours. The ranking of
activity of the treprostinil compounds was C 12 -TR > C 14-TR > 5-nonanyl-TR > Cis-TR.
[002921          The results of the study showed that like the treprostinil alkyl ester compounds
having a C 12, C 14 or C16 straight chain alkyl ester group, 5-nonanyl-TR, is functional and
exhibits sustained cAMP activity. Thus, unlike free treprostinil (see Example 4), 5-nonanyl
TR has a delayed release profile.

potent compared to free treprostinil. However, unlike free treprostinil, cAMP activation
increased over time in response to both T631 and T679 and was sustained for at least 8 hours.
The results of the study showed that the 1679 formulation, which is a C 4-TR without DOPC,

GloSensorTM cAMP assay (Promega) was used as described above in Example 4 to
characterize the effect of treprostinil compositions on cAMP levels. The cAMP profiles of

1003001             CHO-IK1 cells co-transfected with the EP2 receptor and GloSensorTm
plasmid were challenged with the treprostinil alkyl ester compositions listed above. cAMP
levels were then measured every 5 minutes over a time course of 8 hours.
[003011             A dose response curve at 0.5hr, 1hr, 2hr, 3hr, 4hr, 5hr, 6hr, 7hr, and 8hr
incubation time for composition T637 (Cis-TR) is provided in Figure 26. The potency of
T679 increases over the initial incubation time and then remains at a sustained level for at
least 8 hours, indicating a delay-release profile. The half maximal effective concentration
(ECo) of T637 was determined using the results from the cAMP assays, and is also shown in
Fi gure 26.
[003021          Kinetic profile comparisons for free treprostinil, T555, T556, T568, T631,
T623, and 1637 at 10pM (top panel) and 5pM (bottom panel) are shown in Figure 27. Each
of the treprostinil alkyl ester compounds were less potent compared to free treprostinil.
However, unlike free treprostinil, cAMP activation increased and then remained at a
sustained level for at least 8 hours in response to each of the treprostinil alkyl ester
compounds, indicating that each of these compounds is functional and exhibits a delayed
release profile. The ranking order of activity for these compounds was 1555/1556 > T568 >
T631 > T623 > T637.
Example 10 - Enzymatic conversion kinetics of branched treprostinil compounds
[003031          A set of studies was conducted to determine the conversion kinetics to
treprostinil of linear treprostinil compounds versus various branched treprostinil compounds.

were administered (at 15 nmol/kg, or 6 mg/kg TlRE equivalent) to anaesthetised-ventilated
rats (6-hour studies) or to conscious rats by nose-only inhalation (24-hour studies). Blood
and lung samples were collected at specified time points. IRE and treprostinil alkyl ester
concentrations in blood plasma and hng tissue were measured by HPLC/MS/MS analysis.
Anaesthetize    Ve-nitlated Rats
[003131        Male Sprague Dawley rats were anaesthetised and prepared with endotracheal
tube for ventilation. The right femoral vein was cannulated to facilitate blood collections.
Terninal lung samples were taken for analysis only 6 hours after dosing.            Aeroneb@
nebulizer and a controller (Aerogen, Galway, Ireland) were used to produce aerosol of a mass
median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) between 2.5 pum and 4 im and at a rate of 0.1
mL/min to provide an estimated pulmonary dose of 6 pg/kg. A SAR-830/AP Small Animal
Ventilator (CWE Inc., Ardmore, PA) set up at ventilator tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg, rate
of 90 breaths/min, was used to deliver nebulized test articles of volume 250 pL. Systemic
blood pressure (mSAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). Physiologic
parameters were measured during normoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen [FrO2 ]: 0.21, Sa0      2
  90%) and for 2 to 3 hours during hypoxia (FrO2  = 0.10, SaO 2 = 50%).
Conscious Nose-Only Inhalation
[003141        Male Sprague Dawley rats were placed in restraining tubes and exposed to
nebulised drugs via the Jaeger-NYU Nose-Only Directed-Flow Inhalation Exposure System
(CH Technologies, Westwood, NJ) (Figure 31). Test articles (6 mL at specific concentration)
were nebulised using the Aeroneb nebuliser to deliver a predetermined estimated pulmonary
dose. Blood and lung tissue samples were taken at selected times after nebulization of the
drugs over a 24-hour period.
1003151        Ventilated rats treated with nebulized TRE solution had the highest blood
plasma concentration (Cmax) (3.5 ng/mL), which occurred immediately after dosing (Figure
32, left). Measurable levels of TRE were not seen beyond 4 hours in the blood plasma and
by 6 hours in the lungs. In contrast, ventilated rats treated with nebulized TPD-LNP had
lower blood plasma TRE Cmax values, ranging from 0.2 ng/mL to 0.6 ng/mL (Table 1-5,

Figure 32, left). At 6 hours, treprostinil alkyl ester remained in the lung at levels that ranged
from 100 ng/g to 400 ng/g tissue of TRE equivalent (Figure 33). Treprostinil detected in the
lung was speculated to be generated due to treprostinil alkyl ester hydrolysis during sample
preparation. When dosing with micellar TPD, blood plasma levels of TRE were higher than
with TIN) lipid nanoparticle formulations, indicating that nanoparticles play an additional role
in slow-release effect (Figure 32, comparison of left and right graphs).          In the 24-hour
studies in rats dosed with TPD-lipid nanoparticle formulations (nose-only inhalation), TRE
Cmax was higher than in ventilated animals and showed close to first-order exponential
decline. Blood plasma concentrations of TRE in rats that received dosing with Cw4 - and C16
treprostinil alkyl ester lipid nanoparticle formulations were maintained at greater than 0.1
ng/L for uip to 24 hours, (levels corresponding to activity in acute hypoxia studies) (Figure
34, top). Lung levels of total TRE + TPD were approximately 10' higher than plasma TRE
and also exhibited exponential decline in rats administered treprostinil alkyl ester lipid
nanoparticle formulations (Figure 34, bottom). Table 16 further shows the pharmacokinetics
of treprostinil in rats after dosing with the nose-only stystem with the nebulized treprostinil
alkyl ester lipid nanoparticle formulations at the estimated pulmonary dose of 6 pg/kg.
Figure 35 further shows that release kinetics of treprostinil from inhaled C16 -TR formulations
over 24 hours is independent of dose (nose only dosing). Time in figure 35 corresponds to
the time after beginning of nebulization of a 6 mL suspension (nebulization period was 30
nin. to 60 nun.). Figure 38 shows that animals treated with T568 and T623 had a survival
benefit (surviving beyond 200 minutes) compared with animals treated with free treprostinil
or PBS). Specifically, Figure 38 shows the pulmonary arterial pressure in animals treated
with various lipid nanoparticle formulations, PBS and treprostinil.       Furthermore, treatment
with T568 and T623 showed little impact on systemic haemodynamics (Figure 39). Finally,
treprostinil alkyl ester nanoparticle formulations were shown to convert sloly to treprostinil,
providing consistent blood plasma levels with reduced peak values (Figure 40).

Example 12 - Pharmacokinetic Profile of C 16 TR Alkyl Ester Lipid Nanoparticle
Formulation in Dogs
 1003171         Twelve beagle dogs of either sex were randomly assigned to different inhaled
doses of treprostinil     in PBS or         the compound      of Formula (A)      wherein R2  =

formulation (T623) that is suspended in PBS (see Table 14), with both given by nebulizer.
Formulations were nebulized with an Aeroneb nebulizer (MMAD: 2.5-4 pn) delivered into a
500 ml expansion chamber. Formulations were nebulized for 2 min at ventilator settings of
                                                   Q'7

90 ml/breath, 15 breaths/min (delivered volume       = 2.7 L) and collected on a filter. Drug
amount (pg) on the filter was measured by HPLC to calculate the concentration of drug
delivered through the ventilator circuit (jag/L).
[003181         Dosimetry was performed in propofol-anesthetized dogs in which nebulized
drugs were introduced into a mixing chamber interposed on the inspiratory limb of a canine
respirator.    Technical trials were performed before each experiment to measure the
concentration of drug (pg/L) delivered for each breath. The inhaled drug dose (jag/kg) was
calculated using the formula: Inhaled Drug Dose (pg/kg)       =  Drug Conc. (ag/L) x Minute
Ventilation (L/min.) x Time (Tin.) / Body Weight (kg). After delivery of the drugs, the dogs
were disconnected from the respirator and blood samples were collected over a 72 h period to
measure the treprostinil plasma concentrations by HPLC/MS/MS.             Clinical signs were
monitored over this 72 hr. period,
1003191         Use of the anesthetized, intubated and ventilated approach provided
reproducibility between dogs to achieve the targeted inhaled dose for both treprostinil (5  I
and 16 2 hg/kg) and C16 -TR 7       1, 22 i 1, 46  1 and 95   1 ag/kg), At inhaled doses of 5
and 16 pag/kg, treprostinil plasma Cmax values for dogs dosed with treprostinil (2.7 and 5.9
ng/mi, respectively) were between 15-20 fold higher compared to treprostinil levels achieved
upon dosing with similar inhaled doses (7 and 22 pg/kg) of Cw6-TR in the T623 formulation
(0.2 and 0.3 ng/mnL, respectively) (Figure 36). Furthermore, the plasma levels of treprostinil
were sustained over a 48 hour period with inhalation of T623 but disappeared within a few
hours following inhalation of treprostinil (Figure 36). Coughing and rapid shallow breathing
were absent during delivery of treprostinil to anesthetized, ventilated dogs but were present
during the recovery period. Dogs receiving T623 showed no signs of respiratory irritation
with inhaled doses as high as 46 pag/kg.

[003201         Twelve beagle dogs were exposed to inhaled treprostinil and three treprostinil
alkyl ester lipid nanoparticle formulations: T568 (dodecyl-treprostinil, C-TR), T631
                           1 -TR) and T623 (hexadecyl-treprostinil, C 16-TR). The components
(tetradecyl-treprostinil, Cw
of each formulation are provided in Table 14, above.
[003211         Dosinietry was performed in propofol-anesthetized, artificially ventilated dogs
in which nebulized drugs were introduced into a mixing chamber interposed on the

inspiratory limb of the respirator. Technical trials were performed before each experiment
measuring the concentration of drug (pig/L) per breath, minute ventilation and time required
to achieve a targeted pulmonary dose. After recovery from the anesthesia, blood samples
were collected over 72 h and plasma levels of TRE measured by HPLC/MS/MS.               Clinical
signs (cough, rapid shallow breathing, emesis and pale gums) were also monitored.
[003221         At a targeted pulmonary dose of 18 hg/kg, plasma levels of treprostinil were
highest for free treprostinil (Cmax           5.9 + 0.6 ng/nl) immediately after dosing but
corresponding Cmax values for C 2-TR, C 14 -TR and C16 -TR were 5-, 13- and 20-fold lower.
Plasma treprostinil was below the level of quantification by 4 h after inhaled free treprostinil,
but was sustained for 48-72 h after inhaled treprostinil alkyl ester formulations.
[003231         Dose-dependent increases in Cmax and AUC were seen with inhaled C 16 -TR
(6-90 pg/kg) with a prolonged presence of treprostinil in the plasma for up to 72 h at higher
doses. Adverse clinical signs were seen with free treprostinil and C12 -TR at a targeted dose
of 18 g/kg, but not with Cw-TR and C 6 -TR. In the dose-response study with Ci-TR,
adverse clinical signs were seen in only 1 dog at a targeted pulmonary dose of 90 pg/kg,
[003241         Based upon this PK study in dogs, inhaled C 16 -TR in a nanoparticle
formulation provides sustained presence of treprostinil in the plasma and lower side effect
potential than inhaled free treprostinil at comparable doses.

[003261         Assessment of the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Treprostinil in
Rats administerd T748 lipid nanoparticle fbrm ulation
[00327]         To assess whether repeated dosing with inhaled C 6 -TR is well tolerated and
alters PK, rats were exposed to C1 6 -TR for 14-consecutive days.
[003281         5 groups (n  =   4 per group) of Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to inhaled
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 4 doses of C 16 -TR (0.6, 1.8, 6 and 18 ag/kg) given by
                                                   S2o

nebulization in a nose-only inhalation chamber. Cohorts of rats were studied after 1, 7 and 14
daily inhaled doses of Cw-TR and blood samples were collected at 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr., and
kings harvested at 24 hr. after the last dose of the drug. Concentrations of treprostinil and
C 1 w-TR. in the plasma and lungs were measured by HPLC/MS/MS.                Body weights were
recorded daily and organ weights (lungs, heart, liver) were measured 24 hr. after the last drug
dose.
[003291         There were no tolerability issues or significant changes (relative to PBS) in
body weights and organ weights after inhalation of CwJTR for 14-consecutive days.
Increasing inhaled doses of C1 -TR (0.6-18 ptg/kg) increased the plasma Cmax and AUC but
this was not consistently affected upon repeated dosing. There was some variability in ALC
between days 1 and 14 within the different dosing groups with 2 of the 4 doses (1.8 and 18
pg/kg) showing no difference, and the other 2 doses (0.6 and 6 pg/kg) showing a 3- to 4-fold
increase in AUC by day 14. The presence of C1 6-TR was not detected in the plasma at any
dose.   However, relatively high concentrations of Cw-TR (approximately 1,000-fold higher
than plasma treprostinil) were found in the lungs. Inhaled C 16 -TR produced a dose-dependent
increase in the concentration of C 1w-TR in the lungs, but this was not changed by repeated
dosing for 14-consecutive days.
1003301         Inhaled CT6 -TR( (0.6-18 g/kg) was well tolerated with no evidence of body
weight and organ weight change after dosing for 14 consecutive days.
         Effect of C1 6 Alkyl Ester Lipid Nanoparticle Treprostinil Formulation on the
         Cough Reflex in Guinea Pigs
[003311         In this study, the tussive effects of inhaled treprostinil and a lipid nanoparticle
formulation of the alkyl ester hexadecyl-treprostinil (CT 1 6-R), were studied in guinea pigs.
1003321         Three groups of male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were placed in a whole
body plethysmograph and exposed to aerosolized phosphate buffered saline (PBS), TRE (1
300 pg/ml) and C 6 -TR lipid nanoparticle formulation T748 (30 pg/ml), respectively. T623
has the following components:
[003331         Aerosols were generated with an Ultra-Neb Pro nebulizer (nebulizer output
0.36 mL/min.) that was mixed with inspired air delivered at a rate of 2 L/min. The PBS or
drugs were delivered for 10 min. and the number of coughs recorded during and for 20 min.
after the delivery. Coughs were detected by visual observations, plethysmograph recordings
and cough sounds.
                                                   on

[003341         Exposure to aerosolized PBS did not induce cough. TRE exposure did not
consistently evoke cough in the animals tested until the exposure concentration was equal to
or greater than 30 ag/mL. The cough response was characterized by bouts of high frequency
cough with lowered cough sounds compared to the typical cough sound induced by citric acid
or capsaicin. TRE at a nebulized concentration of 30 pg/mL produced consistent cough in 7
of 7 guinea pigs with 1-4 cough bouts and a total number of coughs averaging 36  9 coughs.
In contrast, inhaled Cw-TR lipid nanoparticle formulation at a nebulized concentration of 30
go/ mL did not induce cough, no events, in 6 of 6 guinea pigs.
[003351         The results in this study demonstrate that inhaled TRE induces cough in
guinea pigs, the profile of which is somewhat similar to that previously described (Type 11
coughs) with inhaled prostaglandins in guinea pigs (Maher and Belvisi, 2010). On the other
hand, inhaled C 6 -TR lipid nanoparticle formulation, did not induce cough and suggests that
this formulation may eliminate some of the local adverse side effects such as cough seen with
inhaled TRE therapy in humans.
Example 14    - Acylation of Treprostinil Derivatives
[003361         Treprostinil or treprostinil ester derivatives (e.g., derivatized with alkyl or
alkenyl groups at the carboxylic acid moiety as prepared in Example 1) are acylated as
follows.
[003371         The compound of Example 1 (0.05 mol) or treprostinil is dissolved in 10 mL
of dichloromethane at 0 'C. Dimethylaminopyridine is added (20 mol%), and then a. solution
of an acyl chloride R(CO)Cl (2.1 equivalents) at 0 'C (wherein R is R5 or R6 as described
herein) is added to the compound of Example I or treprostinil. The solution is allowed to stir
and warm to 23 0C over 1 hour. The reaction is monitored by thin layer chromatography, and
when no further change is observed, the reaction is quenched with NaHCO 3 (sat), and the
quenched mixture is extracted with dichloromethane          x 10 ml). The combined organic
extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under vacuum
to afford the crude product. Purification is effected by column chromatography on silica gel
with 2% methanol in dichloromethane.

shown below (R 2 is described herein, for example as -i or a linear or branched alkyl group):

the secondary hydroxyl functionalities. Such protecting group strategies are well known to
those skilled in the art, and are described in, e.g., Peter G.M. Wutes and Theodora W.

Example 16 -Treprostinil amide derivative solubility in hydrofluoroalkane propellants
1003491          Selected treprostinil derivatives were evaluated for the use in a metered dose
inhaler (MDI). Four ester derivatives, dodecyl-treprostinil (C1 2-TR), tetrad ecyl-treprostinil
(C 4 -TR), hexadecyl-treprostinil (C 16 -TR), and the branched chain nonanyl-treprostinil (5C9
TR), and two amide derivatives, C 16 -TR-A and C 12-TR-A (see Table 17) were tested for
solubility in hydrofluoroalkane propellants HlFA-1 34a and HFA-227 with added ethanol.
1003501          5 mg of each treprostinil compound was added in a glass bottle.           Specific
amount of ethanol was added by weight. An MDI valve was crimped to each bottle, and
HFA propellant added through the valve to the total volume of 5 mL.             Compounds were
allowed to dissolve for 24 hours at room temperature.            The formulations were assessed
visually for solubility. The goal was to estimate the minimum ethanol concentration required
to solubilize each compound in propellant.
[003511          Soluble samples presented as clear and colorless solutions. Less than soluble
samples had a thin liquid-vapor ring of various density visible on the bottle surface at the
liquid-vapor interface.     Non-soluble samples had white precipitate or crystals formed.
Ethanol was added as a solubility aid. As it can be seen from the solubility tables below
(Table 18 and Table 19), compounds that were not soluble at 3% added ethanol became
soluble at 10 or 13% added ethanol.

Example 17 - Pharmacokinetis of Blood Plasma Treprostinil After Inhalation of C1 2
Amide Linked Treprostinil Nanoparticle Formulation in Ventilated Rats
[003521         Male Sprague Dawley rats (N:::3) were anesthetized and prepared with
endotracheal tube for ventilation. The right femoral vein was cannulated to facilitate blood
                                                   07

collections. Rats were administered the lipid nanoparticle formulation T763, which has the
following components: (Ci 2 -TR-A 45 mol %, squalane 45 mol %, DSPE-PEG2000 10 mol
%x).
[003531          Aeroneb@ nebulizer and a controller (Aerogen, Dangan, Galway, Ireland)
were used to produce aerosol of a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) between 2.5
am and 4 am and at a rate of 0. 1 mL/min.
[003541          A SAR-830/AP Small Animal Ventilator (CWE Inc., Ardmore. PA) set up at
ventilator tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg, rate of 90 breaths/min was used to deliver nebulized
test articles of volume 300 pL. The targeted dose was 6 ug/kg of Treprostinil equivalent.
[003551          The plasma level of treprostinil were significantly           lower than when
nanoparticle formulation T568 (C12 -TR 40 mol %, squalane 40 mol %, chol-PEG2k 10 mol
%, DOPC 10 mol %), containing Ci 2 -TR alkyl ester was used with the same dose. This
suggests that the conversion rate of the aide prodrug is much slower than the rate for the
ester prodrug of treprostinil.
