   In an actual current and electric degree measuring, the sampling lead R2 takes a red
20 cooper lead of $2.4mmn, 4cm long to measure an alternative current of 20A and display
   the COScP. After amplifying and detecting, the display value is 1400 (adjusted by the

   measuring range is large (infinite); at the same time, the online lead is directly used

                                                 12
   without considering the range and specification of the assistant component. As the
   measuring utilizes sampling, the absolute rating of the conductor of the sampling
   component is limited, thus providing a stable and reliable performance, and the
   consistency is easily guaranteed, the measuring costs low. In addition, the online lead
 5 measuring without any assistant components, like mutual inductor or high-resistance
   resistor, avoids security problems of the assistant component and provides high security.
   The present invention uses two stages of amplifying. On one hand, the alternative
   current at the sampling end is amplified at high magnification, the amplifying track is
   short, thereby ensuring the accuracy of signal amplifying; on the other hand, the
10 amplification factor of the detecting circuit 6 is variable under the control of the
   calibrating circuit 7, the first stage of signal is stable and not much influenced during
   calibrating. Therefore, the stability and accuracy are higher.

   current, the solution is easily to expand to many detecting devices and methods, for
15 example, low-resistance measuring instrument, electric degree meter, multimeter, AC
   nanovolt measurement, power meter, phase meter, fused switch, fuse, overcurrent switch,
   high-voltage transformer, etc; the solution has advantages of ultra low energy
   consumption and high reliability.
20 The second embodiment: an AC power dynamic detecting method comprises following
   steps:
   fixing two sampling points in a sampling lead in the length direction and putting the
   sampling lead and the sampling points in a detected AC power circuit;

25 frequency AC amplifying circuit 5, the output of the power frequency AC amplifying
   circuit 5 is connected to the input of the signal displayer 8 through the detecting circuit 6
   and the calibrating circuit 7, the signal displayer 8 displays the measured value of the
   alternate current between the two sampling points; the voltage of the power frequency
   AC amplifying circuit 5 is larger than the voltage of the signal displayer 8;

                                                13
   measuring the current between the two sampling points by a reference instrument (for
   example, a clamp meter) to obtain a reference value;
   comparing the measured value and the reference value and adjusting the calibrating
   circuit 6 (namely adjusting the potentiometer RP4 of the calibrating circuit 6) until the
 5 measured value is identical to the reference value;
   measuring the electric degree and phase signal of the alternate current between the two
   sampling points by an electromagnetic conversion COSO amplifying sampling
   measuring circuit; the electromagnetic        conversion    COSO amplifying        sampling

10 the small transformer is grounded, the other end is connected to an input of the power
   frequency AC amplifying circuit when an sampling voltage signal output of the
   sampling lead is disconnected to an input of power frequency AC amplifying circuit; the
   sampling lead passes through the coil of the small transformer; an input of the phase
   meter is connected to an output of the power frequency AC amplifying circuit to obtain
15 electric degree and phase signal.
   As the resistance value of the sampling lead can be determined, and the amplifying value
   and total magnification factor of the power frequency AC amplifying circuit are
   well-determined, the current value through the sampling lead can be determined
   according to ohm law, the current value is an estimated value. In the actual situation,
20 there is a small difference between the estimated value and the actual value due to the
   ohm contact between two ends of the sampling lead, error of the amplifying circuit,
   material or composition variation of the lead. Therefore, the calibrating circuit is used to
   adjust the measured value to make the value identical to the actual value (the reference
   value), thereby the actual current through the two ends of the sampling resistance can be
25 reflected. The calibrating circuit doesn't need to adjust at the next time of the AC
   dynamic detecting after the calibrating circuit calibrates.
   In this embodiment, the resistance value is calculated by the resistivity of the sampling
   lead RI and the geometrical feature between the sampling points, making the resistance,
   temperature/humidity of the sampling lead R2 easily controlled, thereby achieving

                                               14
   consistency of mass manufacturing; in addition, the solution is not influenced by the
   ohm contact of the sampling lead R2 and the circuit, the connection and detachment are
   convenient.
