               TOPICAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION OF ACITRETIN
                                           Field of the Invention
              The present invention relates to a topical pharmaceutical composition comprising
     acitretin and a process for its preparation. It also relates to a method of treating skin
  5  disorders by administering said topical phannaceutical composition.
                                       Background of the Invention
              Psoriasis is a chronic, non-contagious skin disorder. It appears in many different
     forns and can affect any part of the body.
              Currently, there is no cure for psoriasis. However, over the years a wide variety of
10  topical and systemic treatment methods that inhibit the inflammation, cell proliferation, or
     cell differentiation have been developed. Treatment of psoriasis remains a challenge
    because of its chronic recurrent nature. Various topical and systemic therapies include
    anti -inflammatory agents, e.g., glucocorticoids; analgesics; chemically synthesized
    disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), e.g., methotrexate and ciclosporin;
15  antiproliferative agents, e.g.. retinoids and vitamin D analogs; TNF-a blockers, e.g.,
    etanercept, infliximab. adalimumab, and efalizumab; monoclonal antibodies against B
    cells, e.g., rituximab: T-cell activation blockers, e.g., abatacept: IL-I blockers, e.g.,
    anakinra; coal tar: and phototherapy.
              These treatment methods have proven to be of limited value due to disadvantages
20  such as cosmetic liabilities, severe side effects, high cost, and minimal or short-term
    efficacy.
              Retinoids, as an alternative, are also known to influence keratinocyte
    differentiation and have proven to be effective in the treatment of a variety of
    keratinization disorders including psoriasis.
25            U.S. Patent No. 6,353,029 discloses a topical solution composition comprising
    tretinoin, 4-hydroxy anisole. polyethylene glycol. an antioxidant, a chelating agent, a
    lower alkanol, and water.
              U.S. Patent No. 5,643,584 discloses a topical aqueous gel composition comprising
    unsolubilized micronized tretinoin particles, a surfactant selected from the group
30  consisting of octoxynol and nonoxynol, a preservative, a gelling agent, and water.

                                                  2
            PCT Publication No. WO 90/14833 discloses an aqueous gel vehicle for topical
   application to the skin comprising active ingredients such as retinoids, in particular
   tretinoin. The composition also includes an aqueous medium, a gelling agent, and an
   antioxidant.
            U.S. Patent Nos. 5,914,334 and 6,258,830 disclose topical gel compositions of
   tazarotene comprising poloxamer 407, polysorbate 40, and hexylene glycol for the
   treatment of acne and psoriasis.
            A review of the prior art thus reveals topical pharmaceutical compositions of
   retinoids such as tretinoin and tazarotene for the treatment of skin disorders such as
10 psoriasis. However, irritancy to the skin remains the common side effect, leading to a
   high level of patient non-compliance.
            Acitretin, a metabolite of etretinate, is available as an oral capsule dosage fonn and
   is indicated for the treatment of severe psoriasis. As the use of acitretin is limited by its
   systemic side effects, and skin being the target organ for the treatment of psoriasis. there
15 remains an unmet need for topical pharmaceutical compositions of acitretin with minimal
   or no systemic side effects and with reduced irritancy to the skin.
            For a topical phannaccutical composition, the solubilization and release of a drug
   from the composition remain the essential prerequisites to ensure effective treatment. As
   acitretin is poorly soluble in water, it remains a great challenge to develop a topical
20 phannaceutical composition in which acitretin is maximally solubilized and readily
   released from the composition into the skin.
            The scientists of the present invention have now developed a topical
   phannaceutical composition of acitretin with an acceptable level of efficacy for treating
   psoriasis and with reduced irritancy. Further, acitretin is found to be readily released from
25 the composition into the skin. Also, said composition of the present invention is found to
   be stable.
                                      Summarv of the Invention
            The topical phannaceutical composition of the present invention is a significant
   advance over the currently available oral dosage fonn of acitretin, as there are minimal or
30 no systemic side effects. Further, the topical pharmaceutical composition of acitretin
   results in better patient compliance in comparison to the available oral dosage form. In

                                                  3
   particular, the topical pharmaceutical composition of acitretin is in the form of a gel and is
   found to be stable for at least three months.
            The present invention relates to a topical pharmaceutical composition comprising
   acitretin and a process for its preparation. It also relates to a method of treating a skin
 5 disorder by administering said topical pharmaceutical composition.

                                 Detailed Description of the Invention
            A first aspect of the present invention provides a stable topical pharmaceutical
   composition of acitretin comprising a therapeutically effective amount of acitretin and one
15 or more gelling agents.
            According to one embodiment of this aspect, the percentage of gelling agent ranges
   from about 0.05% wv/w to about 10% wA/w of the composition.
            According to another embodiment of this aspect, the gelling agent is a
   carboxyvinyl polymer.
20          According to another embodiment of this aspect, the topical pharmaceutical
   composition consists essentially of acitretin as the active ingredient, one or more gelling
   agents to fonn a gel, a solvent in which to disperse the gelling agent, and a co-solvent in
   which to dissolve the acitretin. Combining the one or more gelling agents and solvent for
   dispersing the gelling agent with the solution of acitretin/co-solvent provides a gel of
25 acitretin suitable for topical administration.
            The topical pharmaceutical composition may consist essentially of one or more
   gelling agents being present at a percentage ranging from about 0.05% w/w to about 10%

             (ii)  dispersing/dissolving acitretin and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
                   excipients in a suitable co-solvent; and
             (iii) mixing the dispersion of step (i) with the dispersionisolution of step (ii) to
                   form a gel.
25          A fourth aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating a skin
   disorder by administering a stable topical pharmaceutical composition of acitretin
   comprising a therapeutically effective amount of acitretin and one or more gelling agents.
             According to one embodiment of this aspect, the skin disorder is selected from the
   group comprising psoriasis, keratosis, eczema, rosacea, acne vulgaris, dermatitis, pruritus,
30  seborrhea, skin cancers, inflammation, other skin disorders which are responsive to
    acitretin or etretinate, and combinations thereof.

                                                 5
            According to another embodiment of this aspect, the skin disorder is psoriasis.
            According to another cmbodimcnt of this aspect, the skin disorder is keratosis.
            The term "topical," as used herein, refers to a composition meant for application to
   the skin, nail, or mucosal tissue.
 5          The term therapeuticallyy effective amount," as used herein, refers to an amount
   effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired result of
   treating skin disorders, in particular psoriasis and keratosis.
            The term "pharmaceutical composition," as used herein, refers to gels, solutions,
   suspensions, foams, lotions, or sprays. In particular, the phannaceutical composition of
10 the present invention is a gel.
            The term "acitretin." as used herein, refers to all-trans-9-(4-methoxy-2,3,6
   trimethylphenyl)-3,7-dimethl -2,4,6.8-nonatetraenoic acid. It further includes its salts,
   polymorphs, hydrates, solvates, prodrugs. chelates, or complexes. The topical
   pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises acitretin in an amount
15 from about 0.005% w/w to about 10% w/w, in particular from about 0.02% w/w to about
   5% w/w based on total weight of the composition.
            The term "about," as used herein, refers to any value which lies within the range
   defined by a variation of up to ± 10% of the value.
            The tern "stable," as used herein, means not more than 10% w/w of total related
20 substances are foned on storage at a temperature of 40C and a relative humidity of 7 5 %
   or at a temperature of 25C and a relative humidity of 60%. for a period of at least three
   months to the extent necessary for the sale and use of the composition without substantial
   change in the mean in-vitro release rate of acitretin from the composition. The mean in
   vitro release rate of acitretin from the topical pharmaceutical compositions of the present
25 invention upon storage at 40'C/75% relative humidity (RH) for at least three months is
   substantially similar to the initial mean in-vitro release rate of acitretin obtained as soon as
   practicable after preparation of topical phannaceutical compositions.
            The term "substantial," as used herein, refers to any value which lies within the
   range defined by a variation of up to ± 20% of the value.
30          The term "gelling agent," as used herein, refers to an agent which forms a gel when
   added to a suitable solvent. Suitable gelling agents are selected from the group comprising

                                                 6
   carboxvvinyl polymers. e.g., Carbopol* 980, Carbopol* 974P. Carbopol* 971P. and
   Carbopol* 934P; natural gums, e.g., karaya gum, locust bean gum. guar gum, xanthan
   gum, arabic gum. tragacanth gum, carrageenan. pectin, agar, alginic acid, and sodium
   alginate: cellulose derivatives, e.g.. hvdroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl
 5 cellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose;

   polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers; polyvinyl pyrrolidone: polyethylene
   glycol; polyethylene oxide; polyvinyl alcohol; silicon dioxide; and mixtures thereof. In
   particular, the gelling agent used in the topical phanraceutical composition of the present
10 invention is a carboxyvinyI polymer. The topical pharmaceutical composition of the
   present invention comprises a gelling agent in an amount of from about 0.05% w/w to
   about 10% w/w, in particular from about 0.l1 % w/w to about 5%w/w, based on total
   weight of the composition.
            Acitretin being poorly insoluble in water, a plurality of non-aqueous vehicles as
15 co-solvents has been used in the present invention to solubilize acitretin. The term "co
   solvent," as used herein, refers to an organic solvent which is used to disperse or dissolve
   acitretin. Suitable co-solvents are selected from the group comprising ethers, e.g.
   diethylene glycol monoethyl ether: glycols, e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,
   and glycerin: dimethyl isosorbide; fatty acid esters, e.g., isopropyl myristate, isopropyl
20 palmitate, isopropyl stearate, and ethyl oleate; fatty acids, e.g., capric acid, lauric acid,
   mvristic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid; polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters. e.g.,
   polysorbate 20. polysorbate 40, polysorbate 60, and polysorbate 80; and mixtures thereof
   Certain water-miscible solvents, e.g., glycerin or propylene glycol, also add beneficial
   humectant properties to the composition. The amount of co-solvent used in the present
25 invention ranges from about 15% w/w to about 45% w/w, more preferably from about
   20% w/w to about 30% w/w based on the total weight of the composition. In the present
   invention, the total amount of acitretin may be present as solubilized acitretin fraction and
   remaining as unsolubilized acitretin fraction.
            The selection of co-solvents remains an important factor as it determines the
30 solubility and release of acitretin from the composition. In a preferred embodiment, the
   co-solvent is a combination of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether present in a range of
   about 20% w/w to about 30% w/w, dimethyl isosorbide present in a range of about 1%
   w/w to about 10% w/w, and polysorbate 80 present in a range of about 0.1% w/w to about

   5% w/w, based on total weight of the composition. The solubility of acitretin increases to
   approximately 10,000 times in comparison to solubility in water, when dimethyl
   isosorbide, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and polysorbate 80 are used in a w/w ratio
   of about 3.3:24.1:1. Besides increasing the solubility to a remarkable level, the
 5 combination of these co-solvents also helps to provide the desirable release of acitretin
   from the composition into the skin.
           The term "solvent," as used herein, refers to a vehicle used to disperse or dissolve
   one or more gelling agents. Suitable solvents are selected from the group comprising

   Solubility Studies
            The saturation solubility of acitretin was determined by adding an excess amount
   of acitretin in a conical flask containing a mixture of dimethyl isosorbide, diethylene
   glycol monoethyl ether, and polysorbate 80, present in a w/w ratio of 3.3:24.1: 1-. The
 5 mixture was kept in a shaking water bath for 24 hours at 254C. The saturation solubility
   of acitretin was measured to be 2.5 mg/mL by HPLC method [YMC-Pack* DDS-A
   column C-18 (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 ptm); mobile phase of metbanol:ethanol:glacial acetic
   acid:water (74:21:5:0.5 v/v/v/v); flow rate of 1.5 mL/min; JV detection at 360 nm].
            The solubility of acitretin was found to be 0,7025 mg/g of the gel in given
10 compositions of Examples S through 10 containing 0.284 g of a mixture of dimethyl
   isosorbide, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and polysorbate 80, present in a wvw ratio

   Rhino Mouse Test
10 Efficacy Studies
            Rhino mouse utriculi reduction assay is a well-characterized animal model for the
   evaluation of retinoid activity (Kligman and Kligman, "The Effect on Rhino Mouse Skin
   of Agents which Influence Keratinization and Exfoliation,"..      Invest. Dermatol..
   73(5pI):354-358, 1979). Rhino mouse skin is characterized by the presence of keratin
15 containing utricles attached to the epidermis. The utricle size reduction in rhino mouse
   can be used to determine the efficacy of a composition for the treatment of psoriasis (Hsia
   et a/.. "Effects of Topically Applied Acitretin in Reconstructed Human Epidermis and the
   Rhino Mouse," . Invest. Dermatol.. 128(1):125-130, 2008). Acitretin gels of the present
   invention are compared with commercially available Tazorac* (tazarotene) gel 0.10% w/w
20 indicated for the treatment of psoriasis.
            Seven groups were made, each consisting of seven animals as described in Table 6.
   An amount of 100 mg ± 2% of placebo for acitretin gel, acitretin gels of various strengths,
   and reference Tazorac*g(tazarotene) gel 0.10% w/w was applied evenly on the entire
   dorsal trunk of the animals with a sterilized spatula/glass rod daily for 14 consecutive

                                                    15
   days. All the animals from Group I to Group VII were examined for detailed clinical signs
   once daily during treatment and during the treatment-free period.

           After about 72 ± 3 hours following last application (i.e., day 14), all surviving
   animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation and skin tissue samples (ventral side skin
   - untreated control site and dorsal side skin - application site) were collected and preserved
   in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology evaluation. In addition to this, some
10 portion of the dorsal side skin (i.e., application site) from all the animals was also
   collected in a 0.5% v/v acetic acid solution for whole mount slide preparations and
   measurement of utriculi diameter.
           For whole mount preparations, the skin samples (dorsal side skin, i.e., application
   site) were cut into approximately 1x 1 cm 2 size and soaked in 0.5% v/v acetic acid solution
15 for approximately 18 ± 1 hours at a temperature of 2'C to 8*C. The epidermis was
   carefully peeled off using a flat-ended spatula/blade/fine forceps and placed on a glass
   slide with the dermal side facing up, and the slides were allowed to air-dry. These tissue
   slides were later dehydrated by immersing into ascending grades of isopropyl alcohol
   (75%, 95%, and 100% for approximately 3 minutes to 5 minutes each), followed by
20 xylene, and then mounted. The diameter of at least 10 utriculi (2 utriculi/field) was
   measured by using a Leica* Application Suite QWin Image Processing and Analysis

                                                   16
   Software. Mean utricle diameter was calculated for each animal and subjected for group
   mean comparison by using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) if complied normality
   test using D'Agostino-Pearson omnibus. As ANOVA results showed significance, a
   Dunnett test was applied to compare Group II to Group VII with/over untreated control
 5 (Group I) and Group III to Group VII with/over placebo (Group II).
            The percentage reduction in utriculi diameter was calculated manually based on
   mean reduction in the utriculi diameter in different groups with respect to the untreated
   control (Group I) and placebo (Group 11) by using the following formula.
   Percentage Reduction in utricle diameter
         Mean Utricle Diameter in Untreated Control or Placebo - Mean Utricle
                                                                              Diameter in Group X x 100

   calculated.
            Table 7 describes the summary of utriculi size/diameter after application of various
   strengths of acitretin gels and Tazorac* (tazarotene) gel 0.10% w/w. In the untreated
   control (Group I) and placebo (Group II) animals, numerous circular-shaped utriculi were
15 noticed in the epidermal sheets (whole mount preparation) with an average diameter of
   255.38 ± 37.16 and 233.61 ± 35.41 pim. Application of acitretin gel at all concentrations
   (0.02% w/w, 0.05% w/w, 0. 10% w/w, and 0.20% w/w) produced a significant reduction in
   the utriculi diameter with an average diameter of 109.52 t 57.56, 60.30 ± 6.46, 63.64 ±
   5.19 and 57.46 ± 5.65 tm in Group III, Group IV, Group V. and Group VI, respectively.
20 Similarly, in Group VII (Tazorac gel 0.10% w/wy). the mean utriculi diameter was
   reduced up to 45.48 ± 7.33 pim. Figure I shows the mean utriculi size after the application
   of various strengths of acitretin gel and Tazorac* (tazarotene) gel 0.10% w/w. Figure 2
   shows the percentage reduction in utriculi size after the application of various strengths of
   acitretin gel and Tazorac* (tazarotene) gel 0. 10% w/w with respect to control.

   Histopathological Studies
            Histopathology scores were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by
   the Wilcoxon-Mann-Vhitney test for comparison of median histologic scores of Group II
   to VII with/over untreated control (Group I) and those of Group III to VII with/over
15 placebo (Group II - Placebo for Acitretin gel). Further, median histology scores for the
   ventral side skin (untreated control site) of each group were compared with that of the
   concurrent dorsal side skin (application site) by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All
   statistical analyses were performed at 5% level of significance using SAS* Institute's PC
   SAS 9.1.3.
20          As compared to untreated control (Group 1) and placebo (Group II - placebo for
   acitretin gel), the severity of dermal inflammation at the site of the application (dorsal side
   skin) revealed was increased in a concentration-dependent manner as given in Table 9.
