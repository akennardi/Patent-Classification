ABSTRACT
A closing dressing bolster and assembly for use with a system for treating a linear wound on a
patient includes a bolster body (46) formed from a flexible closing bolster material having
closing members (52, 54) that are operable to develop an inward closing force when the
closing dressing bolster is placed under reduced pressure. In one aspect, when the closing
dressing bolster is under reduced pressure, the system, dressing, or assembly develops an
inward force realized at the linear wound and a compression force. A wicking-material holder
(236) and wicking material (238) may be used as well. The member components may all be
see-through to allow visual inspection of the wound without requiring removal of the dressing.

BACKGROUND
[0002]     The present invention relates generally to medical treatment systems, and more
particularly, to reduced-pressure wound treatment systems suitable for use with linear wounds,
such as surgical wounds.
[0003]     Physicians perform millions of surgical procedures each year around the world.
Many of the procedures are performed as open surgery and an increasing number are

                                                 -2
performed using minimally invasive surgery, such as arthroscopic, laparoscopic, and
endoscopic procedures. As one example, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery
reports that there were more than 450,000 liposuction procedures in the United States in 2007.
[0004]       Surgical procedures involve acute wounds, e.g., an incision or linear wound, in the
skin and related tissue. In addition to surgical wounds, linear wounds are also caused by
trauma. In many instances, the linear wound is closed using a mechanical apparatus, such as
staples, suture, or adhesives, and then the wound is merely covered with a dry, sterile
bandage. Often the bandage must be removed to view the wound to monitor the wound's
progress and to check for infection or other issues. Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein,
"or" does not require mutual exclusivity.
BRIEF SUMMARY
[0005]       Shortcomings with aspects of linear wound care are addressed by the present
invention as shown and described in a variety of illustrative embodiments herein. "Linear
wound" refers generally to a laceration or incision whether in a line or not. According to an
illustrative embodiment, a closing dressing bolster for use with a system for treating a linear
wound on a patient includes a bolster body formed from a flexible closing bolster material and
having a center portion. The bolster body includes a top wall and a bottom wall that are
coupled in a spaced relationship. The bottom wall has a first lateral portion on one side of the
center portion and a second lateral portion on another side of the center portion. A first closing
member is formed on the first lateral portion, and a second closing member is formed on the
second lateral portion. The first closing member and second closing member are operable to
develop a directed force when the closing dressing bolster is placed under reduced pressure.
[0006]       According to another illustrative embodiment, a closing dressing bolster for use with
a system for treating a linear wound on a patient includes a bolster body formed from a flexible
closing bolster material. The closing bolster body includes a first closing member formed on a
second surface of the bolster body. The first closing member includes a first oblique wall. The
closing body includes a second closing member formed on the second surface of the bolster
body. The second closing member includes a second oblique wall. The bolster body may
further include a wicking-material holder coupled to the bolster body and a wicking material
associated with the wicking bolster holder. The wicking material has a fluid flow pathway for
removing fluids. The first closing member and second closing member are operable, when the
closing dressing bolster is under reduced pressure, to develop an inward force.

[0007]     According to another illustrative embodiment, a closing dressing bolster for use with
a system for treating a linear wound on a patient includes a bolster body formed from a flexible
closing bolster material, a first closing member, and a second closing member. The first
closing member is formed on a second surface of the bolster body. The first closing member is
formed on a first lateral side of a center area. The second closing member is formed on the
second surface of the bolster body. The second closing member is formed on a second lateral
side of a center area. The first closing member and second closing member are operable to
move towards each other when placed under reduced pressure. The bolster body is operable
to allow light to pass through sufficiently that color may be detected from a location external to
the closing dressing bolster.
[0008]     According to another illustrative embodiment, a dressing assembly for use with a
system for treating a linear wound on a patient includes a bolster body formed from a flexible
closing bolster material. The bolster body has a first surface and a second, tissue-facing
surface. The bolster body includes a first closing member on a first lateral side of a center
wound area of the bolster body and a second closing member on a second lateral side of the
center wound area of the bolster body. The first closing member and second closing member
are operable, when the closing dressing bolster is under reduced pressure, to move towards
one another and to develop a compressive force. The dressing assembly also includes an
over-drape for disposing adjacent to the first surface of the bolster body and operable to form a
seal over the bolster body.
[0009]     According to another illustrative embodiment, a method of manufacturing a closing
dressing bolster for use with a system for treating a linear wound on a patient includes the step
of: forming a bolster body from a flexible closing bolster material. The step of forming the
bolster body includes the steps of forming the bolster body with a first lateral side and a
second lateral side. The bolster body includes a central area and the first side is on one side of
the central area and the second side on the other side of the central area. The step of forming
the bolster body further includes forming a first closing member on the bolster body on the first
lateral side of the central area and forming a second closing member on the bolster body on
the second lateral side of the central area. The first closing member and second closing
member develop an inward closing force when the closing dressing bolster is placed under
reduced pressure.
[0010]      Other features and advantages of the illustrative embodiments will become apparent
with reference to the drawings and detailed description that follow.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0025]       In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made
to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of
illustration specific preferred embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These
embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the
invention, and it is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical
structural, mechanical, electrical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from
the spirit or scope of the invention. To avoid detail not necessary to enable those skilled in the
art to practice the invention, the description may omit certain information known to those skilled
in the art. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense,
and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.
[0026]       Referring to FIGURES 1-3, an illustrative embodiment of a reduced-pressure system
10 for treating a linear wound 12, such as a laceration or, more typically, an incision 14 is
presented. The reduced-pressure system 10 may hold or support peri-incisional tissue,
enhance tensile strength of the incision 14; compress subcutaneous tissue 20; remove
interstitial fluid, which may help reduce or eliminate edema; and isolate the linear wound 12
from infectious sources. The reduced-pressure system 10 may be particularly well suited for
use with at-risk patients, e.g., obese patients, diabetic patients, smokers, etc.
[0027]       While the linear wound 12 may extend to different depths, in this example the
incision 14 extends through epidermis 16, dermis 18, and into the subcutaneous tissue 20. An
damaged subcutaneous tissue 22 includes, in this illustration, a subcutaneous void 24 or dead
space. While not shown in this embodiment, the linear wound 12 may have any number of
closing devices employed on the linear wound, e.g., mechanical closing devices (suture,
staples, clamps, etc.), adhesives, bonding, etc. The wound may be or include a graft.
[0028]       The reduced-pressure system 10 may include a dressing assembly 40, which may
be placed over the linear wound 12 and used with reduced pressure to supply a directed force,
which may include a compressive force 42 or a closing force 44 (or an inward force with
respect to an outer edge of the dressing assembly). The dressing assembly 40 may include a
closing dressing bolster 46 that under reduced pressure develops the directed force, e.g., the

                                                 -6
compressive forces 42 or the closing forces 44. The closing dressing bolster 46 may be formed
with a bolster body 50. The closing dressing bolster 46 is preferably made from a material that
allows flexing and yet is rigid enough to deliver a closing force.
[0029]     The bolster body 50 may include a first closing member 52 and a second closing
member 54. Additional closing members, such as members 56, 58, 60, and 62 may be
included. A sealing subsystem 70 and a reduced-pressure subsystem 90 cooperate with the
closing dressing bolster 46 to develop the directed force, e.g., the closing force 44 or the
compressive force 42.
[0030]     The closing dressing bolster 46 may be made from a material that helps to distribute
reduced pressure to the linear wound 12, provides the compressive force 42, and, through the
closing members, e.g., closing member 56, provides a closing force 44 - preferably a force
that is substantially within the plane of the epidermis 16. In addition, the material for the closing
dressing bolster 46 is preferably translucent or see through to an extent that light may pass
through allowing one to view the linear wound 12 through the bolster material from a point
external to the reduced-pressure system 10. The material from which the closing dressing
bolster 46 may be formed is further described below.
[0031]     As previously noted, the reduced-pressure system 10 may allow wound color,
shades of color, wound edge, or other features to be perceived visually from a point external
the reduced-pressure system 10. As such, the color, shades of color, nature of the wound
edge, or other features may be determined by a healthcare provider without requiring removal
of the dressing assembly 40 and thereby may avoid the increased risk of complications and
pain of a dressing change. As such, the expense of another a dressing assembly 40 or part of
thereof may also be avoided. The reduced-pressure system 10 may also provide the
compressive force 42 to the linear wound 12 and that force may help the linear wound 12,
subcutaneous tissue 22, or subcutaneous void 24 to heal and may stabilize the linear wound
12 against shear. The reduced-pressure system 10 may also help remove exudates from the
linear wound 12 and may help close the void 24.
[0032]     The sealing subsystem 70 may include the sealing member 72. The sealing member
72 has a first side 74 and a second, inward-facing side 76. A portion of the sealing member 72
may extend beyond the closing dressing bolster 46, e.g., beyond edge 48, to form a flap, or a
drape extension 77, which has a first side 78 and a second, inward-facing side 79. The sealing
member 72 may be any material that provides a fluid seal that allows reduced pressure to be

                                                 -7
held. The sealing member may, for example, be an impermeable or semipermeable,
elastomeric material. "Elastomeric" means having the properties of an elastomer. It generally
refers to a polymeric material that has rubber-like properties. More specifically, most
elastomers have elongation rates greater than 100% and a significant amount of resilience.
The resilience of a material refers to the material's ability to recover from an elastic
deformation. Examples of elastomers may include, but are not limited to, natural rubbers,
polyisoprene, styrene butadiene rubber, chloroprene rubber, polybutadiene, nitrile rubber, butyl
rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene monomer, chlorosulfonated
polyethylene, polysulfide rubber, polyurethane, EVA film, co-polyester, and silicones. Specific
examples of sealing member materials include a silicone drape, 3M Tegaderm@ drape, acrylic
drape (such as one available from Avery Dennison), or an incise drape.
[0033]     A sealing apparatus 80, or attachment device, may be used to help provide a fluid
seal between the drape extension 77 and the patient's epidermis 16. In the present
embodiment, the sealing apparatus 80 may be an adhesive 82 that is applied to the second,
inward-facing side 79 of the flap extension 77 to provide such a seal against the epidermis 16.
The sealing apparatus 80 may be used to hold the sealing member 72 against the patient's
epidermis 16 or another layer, such as a gasket or additional sealing member. The sealing
apparatus 80 may take numerous forms. For example, the sealing apparatus 80 may be a
medically acceptable, pressure-sensitive adhesive that extends about a periphery of the
sealing member 72.
[0034]     The reduced-pressure subsystem 90 includes a reduced-pressure source 92, or
therapy unit. The reduced-pressure source 92 provides reduced pressure. The reduced
pressure source 92 may be any device for supplying reduced pressure, such as a vacuum
pump, wall suction, or other source. While the amount and nature of reduced pressure applied
to a tissue will typically vary according to the application, reduced pressure will typically be
between -5 mm Hg and -500 mm Hg and more typically between -100 mm Hg and -300 mm
Hg. In one embodiment, the reduced pressure is held around -200 mm Hg. The reduced
pressure source 92, for convenience and mobility purposes, may be a battery-operated unit
that is capable of providing a continuous and intermittent reduced pressure. The reduced
pressure source 92, or therapy unit, may include a canister 94, or reservoir, and may be
provided with windows 96 to allow the patient or healthcare provider to view the fill status of
the canister 94. The reduced-pressure subsystem 90 further includes a reduced-pressure
delivery conduit 98, or medical tubing, which if fluidly coupled to a reduced-pressure interface

                                                 -8
100, such as a port 102. The reduced-pressure delivery conduit 98 and the reduced-pressure
interface 100 allow reduced pressure to be delivered into the sealing subsystem 70.
[0035]     As used herein, "reduced pressure" generally refers to a pressure less than the
ambient pressure at a linear wound 12, tissue site, or treatment site that is being subjected to
treatment. In most cases, this reduced pressure will be less than the atmospheric pressure at
which the patient is located. Alternatively, reduced pressure may be less than a hydrostatic
pressure at the tissue site. Unless otherwise indicated, values of pressure stated herein are
gauge pressures. Reduced pressure delivered may be constant or varied (patterned or
random) and may be delivered continuously or intermittently. Although the terms "vacuum" and
"negative pressure" may be used to describe the pressure applied to the tissue site, the actual
pressure applied to the tissue site may be more than the pressure normally associated with a
complete vacuum. Consistent with the use herein, an increase in reduced pressure or vacuum
pressure typically refers to a relative reduction in absolute pressure.
[0036]     The closing dressing bolster 46 may be made from a polymer and is preferably a soft
polymer. In one illustrative embodiment, the closing dressing bolster 46 is a material having a
durometer of 50 Shore A, but other materials and characteristics are possible. The closing
dressing bolster 46 and the bolster body 50 may be made of a see-through material, as is a
sealing member 72, in order to allow the color, shades of color, wound edges, or other features
of the linear wound 12 to be viewed from a point external to the reduced-pressure system 10
(see FIG. 6). A color change, or change in the shade of a color, of the linear wound 12 can
signify the onset of infection or other issues, and such visual cues provide useful information to
the healthcare provider. The bolster body 50 may be made from a flexible closing bolster
material, e.g., a soft polymer, a medical grade silicone, or other suitable material. The closing
dressing bolster 46 may be extruded, pour molded, injection molded, blow molded, or formed
by other manufacturing techniques. "Flexible" means able to move enough to generate the
inward closing force.
[0037]      Referring now primarily to FIGURE 2, the closing dressing bolster 46 is shown with a
plurality of apertures 64 formed on a second, inward-facing side or surface 49 of a second wall
55, or bottom wall, of the bolster body 50. The apertures 64 are formed under a center portion
66, and in particular, near center line 68 of the bolster body 50. A detail showing one aperture
64 is shown in FIGURE 3C. A first wall 53, or top wall, and the second wall 55 are coupled in a
spaced relationship to form a hollow region or central compartment 57. Referring again
primarily to FIGURE 2, the apertures 64 facilitate the transmission of reduced pressure by the

                                                 -9
bolster body 50 to the linear wound 12. Additional apertures in various patterns may be
provided in the bolster body 50 to facilitate communication of reduced pressure to the patient's
epidermis 16, and, in particular, to the linear wound 12. One or more apertures, such as
aperture 65, may be formed on a first side 47 of the first wall 53 of the bolster body 50. Closing
members 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, and 62 are shown on the second, inward-facing side 49. Closing
members 52, 56, and 58 are on a first lateral side of the center portion 66 and closing
members 54, 60, and 62 are on a second lateral side of the center portion 66.
[0038]      As shown clearly in FIGURE 3A and 3B, an oblique surface 69 has an angle formed
with respect to an imaginary plane extending vertically (vertical for the orientation shown in
FIGURE 2). The oblique surface 69, which is opposite a surface 63, is shown making an angle
61 with respect to a reference vertical plane 59 formed at the apex of the oblique surface 69.
[0039]      In operation, when treatment is desired, the closing dressing bolster 46 is placed
over the linear wound 12 with the center portion 66 over the linear wound 12 proximate a
center wound area 45. If the closing dressing bolster 46 is not pre-manufactured with the
sealing member 72 applied on the first side 47, then the sealing member 72 is applied over the
first side 47 of the closing dressing bolster 46 and beyond the closing dressing bolster 46 to
form the flap extension or drape extension 77. The drape extension 77 is either taped down or
an adhesive 82 is applied to provide a fluid seal between the sealing member 72 and the
patient's epidermis 16. "Fluid seal," or "seal," means a seal adequate to hold reduced pressure
at the desired site given the particular reduced-pressure subsystem involved.
[0040]      The reduced-pressure subsystem 90 is fluidly coupled to the sealing subsystem 70
through the reduced-pressure interface 100. The reduced-pressure source 92 is activated and
develops and delivers reduced pressure through the reduced-pressure delivery conduit 98 to
the reduced-pressure interface 100. When activated, the reduced-pressure source 92 delivers
reduced pressure to the sealing subsystem 70 and reduced pressure causes the closing
dressing bolster 46 to develop the compressive force 42. The geometry of the closing dressing
bolster 46 may cause a bending moment to develop about the center portion 66 and thereby
cause the closing members 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, and 62 to develop a resultant force downward
and inward (for the orientation shown). This action produces the directed force, e.g., the
compressive force 42 or the closing force 44. These forces may be experienced at or near the
linear wound 12.

                                                 - 10
[0041]      Referring primarily to FIGURE 2, the development of the closing force or
compressive force is described in more detail. Each of the oblique surfaces 69 between
adjacent closing members, 58 and 56, 56 and 52, 52 and 54, 54 and 60, and 60 and 62, form
part of a triangle-shaped ridge, each having an apex: first apex 67, second apex 71, central
apex 75, third apex 83, and fourth apex 85. As the reduced pressure enters the aperture 65,
the central compartment 57 is evacuated until some or all of the apexes 67, 71, 75, 83, and 85
encounter the first wall 53. Reduced pressure is also delivered from the central compartment
57 through apertures 64 and may provide a force urging the apexes higher, or trying to make
the angle associated with each apex smaller. As a result of one or more of these actions, the
closing members 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, and 62 are urged toward the center line 68 and, through
friction against the patient's epidermis from the closing members 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, and 62,
the closing force is developed on the patient's epidermis. The compressive force may be
developed as the first wall 53 and second wall 55 are pulled by reduced pressure toward the
patient or in the direction going from the first wall 53 to the second wall 55.
[0042]      Referring now primarily to FIGURES 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D, another illustrative
embodiment of a closing dressing bolster 146 is presented. The closing dressing bolster 146
has a bolster body 150 formed with a first closing member 152 and a second closing member
154. A third closing member 156 and a fourth closing member 158 are also shown. The closing
members 152 and 156 are formed on a first side or first portion 153 which is one side of a
center plane 168, or center portion, and may extend the longitudinal length of the closing
dressing bolsterl46. The closing members 154 and 158 are formed on a second portion or side
155, which is on the other side of the center plane 168.
[0043]      A central trough area 157 may help the bolster body 50 to flex in that region as a
bending moment is developed under reduced pressure. The bending moment helps to press
the closing members 152, 154, 156, and 158 into the patient's epidermis and may provide the
directed force, e.g., the compressive force and closing force directed towards the central
wound area (e.g., area 45 in FIG. 1). The shape of the bolster body 50 in this illustrative
embodiment has been chosen for strength and ease in extruding from a material, e.g., silicone,
and so that the bolster body 50 collapses or moves in a desired way to develop the directed
force, e.g., the compressive or closing forces. The closing dressing bolster 146 may be made
of a see-through or at least partially transparent material so that the closing dressing bolster
146 may help the color, shades of color, wound edge, or other features of the linear wound
underneath the closing dressing bolster 146 be viewed from a point exterior to a system
utilizing the closing dressing bolster 146.

                                               - 11
[0044]      As shown in FIGURES 4A and 4B, a tubing connector 199 may be used to provide
reduced pressure to the closing dressing bolster. The tubing connector 199 is sized and
configured to mate with central trough area 157 on the closing dressing bolster 146. The tubing
connector 199 is fluidly coupled to a reduced-pressure delivery conduit 198 whereby reduced
pressure is delivered to the closing dressing bolster 146. Apertures 151 allow reduced
pressure to communicate inside the closing dressing bolster 146. As shown clearly in FIGURE
4C, an aperture 164 may be formed in a portion of the closing dressing bolster 146 to help
communicate reduced pressure to the linear wound below.
[0045]      Referring now primarily to FIGURES 4C-4D, the development of the closing force or
a compressive force will be described in more detail. In this illustrative embodiment, the bolster
body 150 has been extruded with a central compartment 123 and a plurality of compartments.
Six of the plurality of compartments 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, and 121 are formed on the first
portion 153. The central compartment 123 is formed substantially adjacent to the central
trough 157. Six of the plurality of compartments 125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, and 137 are
formed on the second portion 155. In this embodiment, only the central compartment 123
receives reduced pressure and does so through apertures 151.
[0046]      The plurality of compartments, e.g., compartments 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121,
125, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, and 137, are formed using a first wall 139 (or top wall), a second
wall 141 (or bottom wall), and a plurality of web members 143. The plurality of compartments
provides strength to keep the first wall 139 from collapsing against the second wall 141, except
that a lower portion 145 of the central trough 157 is designed to collapse under reduced
pressure against a shelf portion 161 of the central compartment 123. It should be noted that
first closing member 152 and second closing member 154 are spaced apart and sized and
configured to provide a treatment trough 163. The treatment trough 163 may have a dome
cutout 165 and oblique walls 167. The first closing member 152 is formed on a first lateral
portion with respect to the center plane 168, and the second closing member 154 is formed on
a second lateral portion with respect to the center plane 168.
[0047]      As reduced pressure is delivered to apertures 151 , the reduced pressure enters the
central compartment 123 and is delivered through aperture 164 into the treatment trough 163.
The reduced pressure causes the lower portion 145 of the central trough 157 to collapse and
touch the shelf portion 161 of the central compartment 123. In addition, reduced pressure in
the treatment trough 163 pulls the oblique walls 169 towards each other. One or more of these
actions causes the bolster body 150 to flex, or bend, about the center plane 164 and thereby

                                                - 12
urges the closing members towards the center plan 164. The plurality of compartments
preferably do not collapse and continue to provide strength. Moreover, as the reduced
pressure pulls the closing dressing bolster 146 inward, i.e., in the direction going from the first
wall 139 to the second wall 141, and a compressive force is developed.
[0048]      Referring now primarily to FIGURE 5, another embodiment of a closing dressing
bolster 246 is presented. The closing dressing bolster 246 includes a bolster body 250 formed
with a first closing member 252 on a first side 253, or first lateral side, and a second closing
member 254 on a second side 255, or second lateral side. The first and second closing
members 252 have oblique walls that angle up (for orientation shown) toward the wicking
material holder 236. With respect to a center portion 268, an overlay piece 265, or overlay,
may cover and hold the closing members 252 and 254. A gap between closing members 252
and 254 forms a wicking-material holder 236 that holds a wicking material 238. The shape of
the wicking material 238 and the substance of the wicking material 238 may be operable to
help keep an underlying linear wound (e.g., linear wound 12 in FIG. 1) dry and clean.
[0049]      The materials that may be used for the wicking material 238 include hydrophobic
materials, hydrophilic materials, and all the materials listed elsewhere that may be used for a
shaped dressing bolster 532 described below (see FIG. 8). The overlay piece 265 and closing
members 252 and 254 may be made of a see-through material that allows the closing dressing
bolster 246 to be used with a system that allows a healthcare provider to view the color,
shades of color, wound edges, or other features of the linear wound beneath the closing
dressing bolster 246 from a point external to the closing dressing bolster 246 (see FIG. 6 for an
example) and external to the system.
[0050]      In operation, the closing dressing bolster 246 may develop a bending moment under
reduced pressure causing the lower portion of the first closing member 252 and the lower
portion of the second closing member 254 to press downward (for the orientation shown) and
inward on the patient's epidermis causing both a compressive force or a closing force towards
the linear wound. Reduced pressure delivered to the wicking-material holder 236 may move
the first closing member 252 and the second closing member 254 closer together and thereby
provide the closing force. The closing dressing bolster 246 is sized and configured so that the
wicking material 238 may be in contact with the linear wound and thereby helps to remove any
fluids that might have emanated from the linear wound. Any such fluids would be delivered to a
reduced-pressure interface and then be delivered by a reduced-pressure conduit to a canister
under the influence of a reduced-pressure source.

                                                 - 13
[0051]     The illustrative closing dressing bolsters 46, 146, and 246 presented above may
provide for the visual determination of the color, shades of color, wound edge, or other
features of the wound from a location external to the closing dressing bolster. This feature is
also possible with other types of dressings as will now be discussed. Referring now to FIGURE
6, a portion of a reduced-pressure treatment system 310 is shown. The reduced-pressure
treatment system 310 includes a see-through dressing assembly 340, which has a bolster
body 350. The bolster body 350 may be made of any number of materials, such as a bolster
mesh or bolster foam, provided that the spacing of pores on the foam (non-opaque foam) or
between structural elements of the material allow for sufficient light to pass through the
material such that the color, shades of color, wound edge, or other features of a linear wound
312 can be seen from a point external to the reduced-pressure treatment system 310, e.g., can
be seen in a line of sight location shown by reference numeral 384. For example, the bolster
body 350 may be formed from silicone or porous foam, e.g., a GranuFoam@ material available
from Kinetic Concepts, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas. The pore size and density may be varied to
help provide the see-through characteristic.
[0052]     In an alternative illustrative embodiment, a window 386, such as a window made of
see-through silicone, may be placed over a portion of the bolster material such that when
reduced pressure is provided to the bolster body 350 and the window 386 is compressed down
further on the bolster material, the linear wound 312 becomes visible through the window 386
from a point exterior to the bolster body 350 and the system 310. For example, a patient or
healthcare provider may see the linear wound 312 on a line of sight 388.
[0053]     In another alternative, illustrative embodiment, clear beads may be used as or
included within bolster body 350. The beads may be arranged within the bolster body so that
under negative pressure, the beads come together over the wound allowing the patient or
healthcare provider to see through to the wound from a point exterior or external to the bolster
body 350 and the system 310. The body bolster 350 may be a mesh material that the beads
can displace as they come together under reduced pressure.
[0054]      In another embodiment, a window can be made such than when reduced pressure
is removed from the bolster body 350, a biased portion moves aside allowing one to view the
linear wound 312. For example, two portions of the bolster body 350 may overlap as reduced
pressure compresses the two portions, but when reduced pressure is removed, the portions
separate and allow a clear view of the linear wound. As such, it will be appreciated that
numerous visual inspection devices may be used to allow the color and other characteristics of

                                                  - 14
the wound to be visually detected. The visual inspection device may be a see-through bolster
and a see-through sealing member, a window 386, a bolster material that allows adequate light
to pass, a plurality of clear beads, or a moveable portion of a bolster that allows visual
inspection when not under reduced pressure.
[0055]     The bolster body 350 is shown covered by a sealing member 372 that extends
beyond the bolster body 350, e.g., beyond edge 348, to form a drape extension 377. The
drape extension 377 may be sealed to form a fluid seal between the sealing member 372 and
a patient's epidermis 314 using a sealing apparatus 380, such as a drape tape 383 or other
sealing device.
[0056]     Referring now primarily to FIGURE 7, a portion of an illustrative system 410 for
treating a linear wound 412 is presented. The system 410 includes a dressing assembly 440.
The dressing assembly 440 includes a dressing bolster 446, which has a dressing body 450.
The dressing body 450 may be formed with two portions: the first side, or first lateral portion
453, and a second side, or second lateral portion 455. The first portion 453 and second portion
455 may be integrally connected or may be two separate pieces. The first portion 453 is
formed with closing members 452 and 456. The second portion 455 is formed with closing
members 454 and 460. Under reduced pressure, the closing members 452, 454, 456, and 460
develop both a compressive force and a closing force towards the linear wound 412. The
dressing body 450 is shown covered by a sealing member 472 that is sealed with a sealing
apparatus 480 to provide a seal against a patient's epidermis 416.
[0057]     A first wall 437 on the first portion 453 and a second wall 439 on the second portion
455 together may form a wicking-material holder 436 for holding a wicking material 438. The
wicking material 438 may be held against the linear wound 412 to help to remove any fluids,
e.g., exudates, when the dressing assembly 440 is place under reduced pressure.
[0058]     Referring now primarily to FIGURE 8, an illustrative see-through wound treatment
system 510 is presented that allows a healthcare provider to view a treatment site, e.g., linear
wound 512, area wound, a portion of intact epidermis 514, etc., and may provide a
compressive force. The see-through wound treatment system 510 may provide for the
treatment of subcutaneous damaged tissue and may allow the treatment site to be viewed
from a place external to the see-through wound treatment system 510.

                                               -15
[0059]     The see-through wound treatment system 510 is shown in a peri-incisional region
around the linear wound 512, which is through the epidermis 514, dermis 516, and reaching
into a hypodermis, or subcutaneous tissue 518. The subcutaneous tissue 518 may include
numerous tissue types, such as fatty tissue or muscle. A damaged subcutaneous tissue site
520 is shown extending out from the linear wound 512 and includes, in this instance, a
subcutaneous defect, dead space, or void 522. The damaged subcutaneous tissue site 520
may be caused by surgical procedures, such as liposuction. The damaged subcutaneous
tissue site 520 may include voids, such as the void 522, open spaces, and various defects that
can be troublesome for a number of reasons, such as fluid accumulation that may result in
edema.
[0060]     The linear wound 512 may be closed using any closing device or technique, such as
staples, sutures, or adhesive, but is shown in this illustrative embodiment with a staple 513.
The see-through wound treatment system 510 may be used for treating an area and, in
particular, may be used for treating a subcutaneous tissue site 520 and the tissue around
subcutaneous tissue site 520, but the see-through wound treatment system 510 may also be
used to treat the more limited area of a linear wound 512.
[0061]     The see-through wound treatment system 510 includes a dressing assembly 530,
which includes the shaped dressing bolster 532, a sealing subsystem 560, and a reduced
pressure subsystem 580. In operation, the see-through wound treatment system 510 may
develop the directed force, which may include a net compressive force, represented by
reference numerals 524, that is realized in the subcutaneous tissue site 520. As described
further below, the shaped dressing bolster 532 may be shaped and configured to allow the
compressive force 524 to be distributed fairly evenly over the patient's epidermis 514.
Otherwise, if there are areas of substantially increased force as compared to other areas on
the epidermis 514, skin irritation may result.
[0062]     The directed force may also include the closing force, or inward force, i.e., a force
towards an interior portion of the dressing assembly 530. The closing force is represented by
reference numerals 526. The closing force 526 remains substantially within the plane of the
epidermis 514. In other words, the closing force 526 operates mainly within the epidermis 514.
In addition, the see-through wound treatment system 510 is operable to deliver reduced
pressure to the linear wound 512 and, depending on the phase of healing and the nature of the
linear wound 512, through the linear wound 512 such that reduced pressure is realized at the

                                                  - 16
level of any subcutaneous voids 522 to help approximate -           bring together - the tissues in
that region as well as to help remove any air or any other fluids.
[0063]      The dressing assembly 530 includes the shaped dressing bolster 532 that has a first
side 534 and a second, inward-facing side 536. The shaped dressing bolster 532 may be sized
and shaped to substantially match the estimated area of the damaged subcutaneous tissue
site 520 although a larger or smaller size may be used in different applications. The shaped
dressing bolster 532 has an edge 538. The shaped dressing bolster 532 may be made of a
number of different medical bolster materials, i.e., materials suitable for use in medical
applications and that may be made sterile. In one illustrative embodiment, the shaped dressing
bolster 532 is made from a medical bolster material that is a manifold material. In one
illustrative embodiment, the shaped dressing bolster 532 is made from bolster material that is a
porous and permeable foam-like material and, more particularly, a reticulated, open-cell
polyurethane or poly ether foam that allows good permeability of wound fluids while under
reduced pressure. One such foam material that has been used is the VAC* GranuFoam*
material available from Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (KCI) of San Antonio, Texas. Any material or
combination of materials may be used for the bolster material provided that the bolster material
is operable to distribute, or manifold, reduced pressure.
[0064]      The term "manifold" as used herein generally refers to a substance or structure that
is provided to assist in applying reduced pressure to, delivering fluids to, or removing fluids
from a tissue site. The bolster material may also be a combination or layering of materials; for
example, a first bolster layer of hydrophilic foam may be disposed adjacent to a second bolster
layer of hydrophobic foam to form the bolster material. The term "fluid" as used herein
generally refers to gas or liquid, but may also include any other flowable material, including but
not limited to gels, colloids, and foams.
[0065]      The reticulated pores of the Granufoam* material, which are typically in the range of
about 400 to 600 microns, are helpful in carrying out the manifold function, but other materials
may be used. The density of the medical bolster material, e.g., Granufoam* material, is
typically in the range of about 1.3 lb/ft3 - 1.6 lb/ft3 (20.8 kg/M 3 - 25.6 kg/M 3 ). A material with a
higher density (smaller pore size) than Granufoam@ material may be desirable in some
situations. For example, the Granufoam* material or similar material with a density greater
than 1.6 lb/ft3 (25.6 kg/m 3 ) may be used. As another example, the Granufoam* material or
similar material with a density greater than 2.0 lb/ft3 (32 kg/M 3 ) or 5.0 lb/ft 3 (80.1 kg/M 3 ) or even
more may be used. The more dense the material is, the higher compressive force that may be

                                                - 17
generated for a given reduced pressure. If a foam with a density less than the tissue at the
tissue site is used as the medical bolster material, a lifting force may be developed.
[0066]     The bolster material may be a reticulated foam that is later felted to thickness of
about 1/3 the foam's original thickness. Among the many possible materials, the following may
be used: GranuFoam@ material or a Foamex@ technical foam (www.foamex.com). In some
instances it may be desirable to add ionic silver to the bolster material in a microbonding
process or to add other substances to the bolster material, such as antimicrobial agents. The
bolster material may be isotropic or anisotropic depending on the exact orientation of the
directed force that is desired during reduced pressure. The bolster material may be made
anisotropic by adding filaments, felting a portion, adding adhesive selectively, etc. The bolster
material could be a bio-absorbable material.
[0067]     The sealing subsystem 560 includes a sealing member 562, or drape, which is
analogous to the sealing member 72. The sealing member 562 may be coupled to the shaped
dressing bolster 532. For example, the sealing member 562 and shaped dressing bolster 532
may be coupled using adhesives, such as an acrylic adhesive, silicone adhesive, hydrogel,
hydrocolloid, etc. As another example, the sealing member 562 and the shaped dressing
bolster 532 may be bonded by heat bonding, ultrasonic bonding, and radio frequency bonding,
etc. The coupling may occur in patterns or completely. Structure may be added to the bond to
make the sealing member 562 behave anisotropically in a desired direction, i.e., to make an
anisotropic drape material. An anisotropic drape material helps the dressing assembly 530 to
primarily move in a given direction, i.e., only about a certain axis or axes.
[0068]     In the illustrative embodiment of FIGURE 8, the sealing member 562 may be sized to
extend beyond the shaped dressing bolster 532, e.g., beyond the edge 538 on an extremity
533, to form a drape extension 564, or extension. The drape extension 564 has a first surface
566 and a second, inward-facing surface 568. The sealing member 562 may be sealed against
the epidermis 514 of the patient using a sealing apparatus 569, which helps to provide a seal
and allows reduced pressure to be maintained by the reduced-pressure subsystem 580 at the
treatment site. The sealing apparatus 569 may take numerous forms, such as an adhesive
570; a sealing tape, or drape tape or strip; double-side drape tape; paste; hydrocolloid;
hydrogel; or other sealing device. If a tape is used, the tape may be formed of the same
material as the sealing member 562 with a pre-applied, pressure-sensitive adhesive. The
pressure sensitive adhesive 570 may be applied on the second, inward-facing surface 568 of
the drape extension 564. The pressure-sensitive adhesive 570 provides a seal between the

                                                 -18
sealing member 562 and the epidermis 514 of the patient. Before the sealing member 562 is
secured to the patient, the pressure-sensitive adhesive 570 may have removable strips or
backing covering the pressure-sensitive adhesive 570.
[0069]     The reduced-pressure subsystem 580 includes a reduced-pressure source 582, or
therapy unit, which can take many different forms. The reduced-pressure source 582 provides
reduced pressure as a part of the see-through wound treatment system 510. The reduced
pressure source 582 may be any device for supplying reduced pressure, such as a vacuum
pump, wall suction, or other source. While the amount and nature of reduced pressure applied
to a tissue will typically vary according to the application, reduced pressure will typically be
between -5 mm Hg and -500 mm Hg and more typically between -100 mm Hg and -300 mm
Hg. In order to maximize patient mobility and ease, the reduced-pressure source 582 may be a
battery-powered, single-use reduced-pressure generator, which facilitates application in the
operating room and provides mobility and convenience for the patient during the rehabilitation
phase.
[0070]     In the illustrative embodiment of FIGURE 8, the reduced-pressure source 582 is
shown having a battery compartment 584 and a canister region 586 with windows 588
providing a visual indication of the level of fluid within the canister region 586. An interposed
membrane filter, such as hydrophobic or oleophobic filter, may be interspersed between a
reduced-pressure delivery conduit, or tubing, 590 and the reduced-pressure source 582.
[0071]     Reduced pressure developed by reduced-pressure source 582 is delivered through
the reduced-pressure delivery conduit 590 to a reduced-pressure interface 592, which may be
an elbow port 594. In one illustrative embodiment, the elbow port 594 is a TRAC* technology
port available from KCI of San Antonio, Texas. The reduced-pressure interface 592 allows
reduced pressure to be delivered to the sealing subsystem 560 and realized within an interior
portion of the sealing subsystem 560. In this illustrative embodiment, the elbow port 594
extends through the sealing member 562 and into the shaped dressing bolster 532.
[0072]     In operation, the see-through wound treatment system 510 is applied to the linear
wound 512. The see-through wound treatment system 510 may be applied to the linear wound
512 in the operating room after a surgical procedure on the patient. The second, inward-facing
side 536 of the shaped dressing bolster 532 is placed against the patient's epidermis 514 with
the shaped dressing bolster 532 over the damaged subcutaneous tissue site 520 and with a
portion of the shaped dressing bolster 532 over the linear wound 512. The dressing assembly

                                              -19
530 may be sized for the typical application involved in the procedure performed by a
healthcare provider. The dressing assembly 530 may be sized, shaped, and configured to
work with different anatomical applications, such as the abdomen, chest, arms, thighs, etc.
[0073]     If the sealing member 562 has not already been coupled, the sealing member 562 is
placed over the first side 534 of the shaped dressing bolster 532 with a portion extending
beyond the shaped dressing bolster 532 to form the drape extensions 564. The drape
extensions 564 may then be taped down or an adhesive 570 used to form a seal between the
sealing member 562 and the patient's epidermis 514. The seal need only be adequate to allow
the see-through wound treatment system 510 to hold reduced pressure on the desired
treatment area. The reduced-pressure interface 592 and the reduced-pressure source 582 are
fluidly coupled using the reduced-pressure delivery conduit 590. The reduced-pressure source
582 may then be activated and reduced pressure delivered to the shaped dressing bolster 532.
[0074]     As the pressure is reduced in the shaped dressing bolster 532, the shaped dressing
bolster 532 compresses and contracts laterally and forms a semi-rigid substrate, and a number
of beneficial forces and actions may take place. Reduced pressure is transmitted further still
through the shaped dressing bolster 532 so that reduced pressure delivered to the linear
wound 512. At least at the early stages of the healing process, reduced pressure may also be
realized through the linear wound 512 and into the subcutaneous tissue site 520. As such,
reduced pressure may help close defects, such as subcutaneous void 522, and generally
provides stability to the area. Reduced pressure delivered to the shaped dressing bolster 532
also develops the compressive force 524 that again may provide stability and therapy. The
compressive force 524 is more than just at the top of the epidermis 514. The compressive
force 524 extends down deeper and may be experienced at the level of the subcutaneous
tissue site 520. The compressive force may help close defects and provide stability.
[0075]     It may be desirable to apply the see-through wound treatment system 510 in the
operating room and allow the see-through wound treatment system 510 to remain on the
patient until adequate healing has taken place. In this regard, it may be desirable to form the
sealing member 562, shaped dressing bolster 532, and any other layers from see-through
materials that allow the healthcare provider to gain visual cues about the healing of the linear
wound 512 and damaged subcutaneous tissue site 520 without having to remove the dressing
assembly 530.

                                                 - 20
[0076]      According to one illustrative embodiment, a see-through dressing assembly for use
with a reduced-pressure system for treating a linear wound on a patient includes a closing
dressing bolster for providing a closing force when under reduced pressure and a sealing
member for covering the closing dressing bolster and providing a seal over the closing
dressing bolster. The closing dressing bolster and sealing member are formed from see
through materials sufficient to allow perception of color from a point external to the see-through
dressing assembly. The closing dressing bolster may include a top wall and a bottom wall. The
top wall and bottom wall are coupled in a spaced relationship. The bottom wall includes a
center portion, a first lateral portion, and a second lateral portion. A first closing member is
formed on the first lateral portion, and a second closing member is formed on the second
lateral portion. When placed under reduced pressure, the first closing member and the second
closing member move towards each other.
[0077]      According to one illustrative embodiment, a system for treating a wound on a patient
with reduced pressure and that allows visual observation of the wound during treatment
includes a dressing bolster for placing on a portion of the patient's epidermis over the wound.
The dressing bolster is formed from a see-through material. The system further includes a
sealing subsystem for providing a seal over the closing bolster and the patient's epidermis and
a reduced-pressure subsystem for delivering a reduced pressure to the sealing subsystem.
The sealing subsystem and reduced-pressure subsystem are operable to deliver reduced
pressure to the dressing bolster. The dressing bolster, sealing subsystem, and reduced
pressure subsystem are operable to develop a directed force and to deliver reduced pressure
to the wound. The sealing subsystem includes a see-through sealing member. The dressing
bolster and sealing subsystem are operable to allow light to pass such that shades of color of
the wound may be perceived from a place external to the system. The dressing bolster has a
first surface, a second, inward-facing surface and includes an oblique extremity formed a
portion of the dressing bolster. The dressing bolster is formed from a medical bolster material
that has a density greater than 20 kg/m3. The dressing bolster has the characteristic of evenly
distributing a directed force when under a reduced pressure.
[0078]      Although the present invention and its advantages have been disclosed in the
context of certain illustrative, non-limiting embodiments, it should be understood that various
changes, substitutions, permutations, and alterations can be made without departing from the
scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. It will be appreciated that any
