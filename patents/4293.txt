TECHNICAL FIELD
[04]     The present disclosure generally relates to a device for dispensing a product into the
bowl of a toilet. In particular, it relates to a device adapted to be hooked on the rim of a toilet
bowl such that as the toilet is flushed the product is dispensed directly into the toilet bowl.
BACKGROUND
[05]     Agents for treating (e.g., cleaning, sanitizing, deodorizing, fragrancing, etc.) surfaces
of bathroom appliances such as toilets can be in the form of solids, pastes, gels, powders and
liquids. Liquid formulations delivered in squeeze bottles allow for periodic treating of the
appliance and typically require a consumer to reapply the sanitary agent each time the
appliance is to be cleaned. Other products that demand less time by the consumer allow for
automatic or continuous treating of the appliance.
[06]     A rimblock is a solution for continuous treatment every time when an appliance such
as a toilet is flushed. For example, disintegrating blocks containing various components can
be used for cleaning, sanitizing, deodorizing and/or fragrancing toilets or urinals. Such
disintegrating blocks generally are immersed in the water tank (also known as the cistern) of
a toilet or urinal, or are placed in a holder of some sort and then put "under-the-rim" (UTR)
of the toilet bowl or urinal. Once put into place, either in the cistern or in the toilet bowl or
14437539 1

                                                  2
urinal, the block slowly releases active ingredients and disintegrates into the water. In the
case of a disintegrating block placed into the cistern, the block may fall to the bottom of the
cistern, and then constantly be bathed with water. Such constant contact with the water
requires a formulation of a certain type to ensure that the disintegrating block releases active
ingredients and disintegrates at an appropriate rate. In the case of UTR products, such
disintegrating blocks will disintegrate and release active ingredients each time that the toilet
is flushed and the block is rinsed with the flush water. Many disintegrating blocks may be
placed into the toilet tank (cistern), either by placing the block into a dispenser, or by simply
placing the block in the tank.      Automatic or continuous cleaning may also afforded by
suspending a sanitary agent in baskets that hang from the appliance or toilet rim.
[06a]   It is an object of the present invention to improve upon existing arrangements or to
provide an alternative thereto.
SUMMARY
[07]    This Summary provides an introduction to some general concepts relating to this
disclosure in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.
This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the disclosure.
[08]    Aspects    of the disclosure herein relate to dispensers having             one or more
compartments for receiving material formulations. The formulations can be different from
each other, to provide different functions or can be similar to each other. For example, the
formulations can include one or more of a cleaner or fragrance, can be in a gel, paste or solid
form, and can be different colors to appeal to customers.        A hanger can be configured to
suspend the tray from a toilet bowl rim. In one example, the cover can be incorporated into a
packaging such that when the tray is removed from the packaging, the at least one
compartment is exposed. Additionally, in certain examples, the tray and the at least one
compartment can be transparent and can form part of the packaging.
[09]    In another example, a dispenser system may include a tray having at least one
teardrop-shaped compartment having a formulation.            The compartment may include an
aperture for receiving fluid, and the formulation may include one of a cleaner or fragrance. A
hanger can be provided for suspending the tray from a toilet bowl rim. A casing may also be
provided that may be configured to cover at least a portion of the at least one compartment
and at least a portion of the formulation to allow for fluid to interact with the formulation and
14437539 1

                                                 3
dissolve the formation into the fluid.      In one example, the tray and the cover can be
thermoformed.      In another example, the tray can be thermoformed and the casing can be
injection molded. Alternatively, the tray and the cover can both be injection molded. In
certain examples, a hinge can connect the casing to the tray, and the hinge can be configured
to open to remove the casing from the tray
[09a]   In a further example a dispenser system for treating a toilet, the dispenser system
comprising: a tray having a rim at least partially surrounding a plurality of compartments
housing a treatment composition, each compartment having a first side and a second side, the
second side defining an aperture for receiving the treatment composition; and a hanger
configured to suspend the tray from a toilet bowl rim; wherein the dispenser system further
comprises a cover coupled to the rim for sealing the aperture of each compartment and
configured to be removed by a user prior to use, wherein the cover is configured to seal each
compartment from moisture and fragrance.

departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Also, while the terms "top," "bottom,"
"upper," "lower," "rear," "front," and the like may be used in this specification to describe
various example features and elements of the invention, these terms are used herein as a
matter of convenience, e.g., based on the example orientations shown in the figures and/or the
orientations in typical use. Nothing in this specification should be construed as requiring a
specific three dimensional or spatial orientation of structures in order to fall within the scope
of this invention. Moreover, the figures of this disclosure may represent the scale and/or
dimensions according to one or more embodiments, and as such contribute to the teaching of
such dimensional scaling. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the
disclosure herein is not limited to the scales, dimensions, proportions, and/or orientations
shown in the figures.
[21]    Figs. 1A and 1B depict an example dispenser 100. The example dispenser 100, when
mounted to a toilet, is configured to provide a continuous treating (e.g., cleaning, sanitizing,
deodorizing and/or fragrancing, etc.) each time the toilet is flushed.       Fig. 1A shows the
dispenser 100 in a first product packaging arrangement, and Fig. 1B shows the dispenser in a
second product packaging arrangement.      As can be seen from Figs. 1A and 1B, the dispenser
100 can be in the form of a toilet rim block and can include a body or tray 102 having a wall
120 forming a rim 122 and an array of visually discrete and individual compartments 104.
[22]    The individual compartments 104 can be configured to receive individual sections of
a treatment composition or material 112, which can be in the form of a gel, paste, and/or
solid. The material 112 is formulated to provide one or more functions when exposed to
flush water from the toilet.    For example, the material 112 may be configured to clean,
sanitize, deodorize and/or fragrance the toilet and/or its surroundings. The material 112 can
also be configured to color the water within the toilet bowl and/or provide any other function
that may be desirable for a user. Moreover, each section or block of material 112 can provide
the same function as the other preparations of material 112 or can provide a different
14437539 1

                                                 5
function. For example, in a first product form, all of the preparations of the material 112 may
be formulated to clean and fragrance the toilet, while in a second product form, one or more
preparations of the material 112 may be formulated to clean and the remaining preparations
of the material 112 may be formulated to provide fragrancing. In both cases, the material 112
can be provided in different colors and/or fragrances in order to appeal to consumers. Each
section or block of material can have a different material and/or chemical composition (e.g.
different or additional active ingredient(s) and/or additives), and/or form (e.g. a gel or solid
material for one block or a paste material for another). In one example, the tray 102 can be
packaged pre-filled with material. It is also contemplated that the user can fill the tray 102 at
home with a filling kit and/or other sources of a material, for example a bottle, reservoir, or
container storing a larger amount of material that a user may store elsewhere. The tray 102
can be provided with a cover 110, which seals the individual sections of material 112 by
providing a barrier against moisture and odor or fragrance prior to use. In one example, the
cover 110 can be sealed to the rim 122 of the wall 120.
[23]    The dispenser 100 can also be provided with a hook or hanger 106 to hang the
dispenser 100 in the toilet bowl during use. As shown in Fig. IB, the hook or hanger 106 can
be attached near an upper portion of the dispenser 100.         The hook or hanger 106 may be
attached to a front or a rear portion of the rim of a toilet bowl. During use, the tray 102 can be
arranged such that the individual compartments 104 and the individual sections of material
112 are exposed to water when the toilet bowl is flushed, thereby causing the formulations in
the individual sections of material 112 to release within the water of the toilet bowl. In an
alternative example, the body 102 can additionally be provided with holes or apertures by
which water may enter and/or leave the body 102 when the toilet bowl is flushed.
[24]    The individual compartments 104 can be oblong or oval shaped. However, other
shapes are contemplated, e.g. circular, rectangular, triangular, spherical, teardrop, etc. In one
example, the individual compartments 104 can be arranged in a horizontal row. It is also
contemplated that the individual compartments 104 of the dispenser 100 can be arranged in a
vertical column or in a diagonal arrangement. In addition, the body 102 can be formed with a
degree of flexibility to accommodate for the curvature of the toilet bowl and may also include
a predetermined degree of curvature to accommodate for the curvature of the toilet bowl.
[25]    The body 102 and the hook 106 can be formed in separate molding operations or in a
single molding operation from a suitable material as discussed in further detail below, such as
14437539 1

                                                  6
flexible or rigid plastic including, but not limited to, thermoformed plastic. In addition, the
body 102, the compartments 104, and the hanger 106 can be formed by thermoforming or
injection molding. The material used to form the body 102 and the compartments 104 can be
formed of a temperature-appropriate material for a 70 'C formulation/material such that the
compartments 104 can be filled with a hot solution to form the material 112.
[26]     In the example shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, prior to use of the dispenser 100, the user
detaches the cover 110 from the body 102 to expose the material 112 disposed in the
individual compartments 104. The user then places the hanger 106 supporting the body 102
over the rim of a toilet such that the material 112 disposed in the individual compartments
104 faces inward toward the bowl or outwardly from the bowl. When the toilet is flushed,
water will come into contact with the material 112 in the individual compartments, to cause
the material 112 to dissolve and release into the bowl. In this way, each time the toilet is
flushed, the material 112 can treat the bowl in a continuous manner.           In particular, the
sections or blocks of material 112 may help to remove stains, remove odors, sanitize the
toilet, color the toilet water and/or provide a fragrance to the user depending on the particular
formulation for each of the sections of the material 112.
[27]      As shown in Fig. 1A, in one example, to help to improve the appearance of the
dispenser 100 on the shelf and to stand out to prospective consumers, the body or tray 102
can be mounted to cover 110, which can be a film or backing for sealing the openings of the
tray 102.      The cover 110, in combination with the material 112 in the individual
compartments 104, can help the dispenser 100, packaged as a consumer product, stand out.
In one example, the tray 102 is formed of a transparent or translucent material and the
material 112 is formed as a transparent or translucent gel. In such an example, the cover 110
is formed of a foil/lidstock or other colored material that provides a reflective and/or
contrasting background to the material 112.         In this way, when the consumer shops the
dispenser 100, the user will be able to see the material 112 through the tray 102 and the cover
110 will help highlight the material 112 in the dispenser 100. For example, the surface finish
of the cover 110 may allow the material 112 to appear brighter or shinier on the shelf than
when the dispenser 100 gets installed on a toilet. In another example, wherein the material
112 has different colors, the consumer will readily see the different colored material 112 and
may infer that each section or block of material 112 serves a different function where
different materials are disposed in the compartments 104.
14437539 1

                                                7
[28]     In one example, the cover 110 can be made of multilayer foil, a metalized barrier film
such as a metal foil for example aluminum foil, plastic film, or combinations thereof.
Examples of polymers used to form plastic films include, but are not limited to, polyethylene,
polypropylene,     polyethylene   terephthalate,   polybutylene     terphthalate,   polyethylene
naphthalate, polyesters, polycarbonates, polystyrene, acrylics, polyurethanes,         polyvinyl
chloride, polyvinyl fluoride, and mixtures and copolymers thereof. In one embodiment, the
cover 110 can be formed to have a tab (not shown) that can used to facilitate the removal of
the cover 110. It is also contemplated that the cover 110 can be formed of a biodegradable or
other environmentally compatible materials.
[29]     In another example, as shown in Fig. 1B, the cover 110 can be incorporated into
secondary packaging 108, which can be a cardboard backing, blister card, or cardstock, and
the body 102 can be mounted directly to the secondary packaging 108. In this example, to
use the dispenser 100, a user peels the body or tray 102 off of the secondary packaging 108 to
expose the material 112.     In this example, since the cover 110 is incorporated into the
secondary packaging 108, a separate seal does not need to be applied to the body or tray 102
to seal the material 112 in the individual compartments 104.        Additionally, mounting the
body or tray 102 directly to the secondary packaging 108, and arranging the body 102 facing
outwardly, eliminates the need for a separate blister card on the outer side of the packaging to
cover the tray 102. Therefore, in this example, the body or tray 102 itself can function as the
blister card and reduce packaging costs.
[30]     The dispenser 100 can be designed such that when the cover 110 is removed, the user
does not inadvertently remove the contents of the tray 102. In one example, the individual
compartments 104 can be partially filled or filled near to the rim 122 of the tray 102 such that
the user does not inadvertently remove the material 112 from the tray 102.            In another
example, the cover 110 can have a low friction surface that does not adhere to the material
112 of the tray 102 or the cover 110 can adhere to the material 112 such that the bond
between the cover 110 and the material is weaker than the bond between the material 112 and
the tray 102. Including a coating or additional layer on the cover 110 or the material 112 to
reduce the adhesion between the cover 110 and the material 112 is also contemplated to
prevent the user from inadvertently removing the material 112.
14437539 1

                                                8
[31]    In addition, one or more ramps can be incorporated into the top portion of the tray to
direct water into and over the tray to ensure that the material disposed in the compartments is
adequately exposed to water.
[32]    In another example, the individual compartments and material can be formed in
alternate ornamental shapes in order to attract the consumer. For example, the shapes of the
compartments and the material can be formed in a shape of a graphic mark, symbol, company
logo, design, lettering, etc. Moreover, in addition to the above examples, the material can
also be in the form of an extruded cylinder or extruded cylinders, coins, and/or blocks. The
material can also have alternating colors or layered colors.
[33]    Figs. 2A-2C depict another example dispenser 200, which is similar to the example
dispenser described in relation to Figs. 1A and 1B, where similar reference numbers are used
to identify similar components. Fig. 2A shows a front view of the example dispenser 200.
Fig. 2B shows a rear view of the dispenser 200. Fig. 2C shows a right-side view of the
dispenser 200. The example dispenser 200 has similar features as the dispenser described in
relation to Figs. 1A and 1B; however, in this example, both the tray 202 and an optional
casing, e.g., membrane, film, etc., (not shown) can be thermoformed, e.g., formed from
plastic material in the form of one or more sheets of material by heating the plastic material
to a malleable forming temperature such that the plastic material can be formed into the
specific shape of a mold in the shape the dispenser 200 and casing. The materials can be
formed of any suitable plastic in any desired color or can, like in the examples discussed
herein, be formed of a transparent or translucent plastic material. The dispenser 200 and
casing once formed may also be trimmed to create the final product.
[34]    Like in the above examples, the example dispenser 200, when mounted to a toilet, is
configured to provide a continuous treatment each time the toilet is flushed. The dispenser
200 can also include a body or tray 202 which includes an array of individual compartments
204, and a wall 220. The dispenser 200 can also be provided with a hook or hanger 206,
which can be attached near an upper portion of the dispenser 200.
[35]     Similar to the above examples, as shown in Fig. 2B, the individual compartments 204
can be configured to be formed open on one side to receive individual sections of material
212, which can be in the form of a gel, paste, and/or solid. In this example, however, an
optional casing (not shown), which can be clear, opaque, or colored can be placed over the
individual compartments 204.      The casing, in this example is intended to remain on the
14437539 1

                                                 9
dispenser 200 during use and may be provided with openings (not shown) to allow for the
fluid from the toilet bowl to interact with the individual sections of material 212. The casing
can be formed of any suitable material for thermoforming or other manufacturing techniques
and may be formed of any of the materials discussed herein.
[36]    Additionally, the individual compartments 204 can be formed without openings on the
opposite side of the dispenser to control the rate that the sections of material 212 dissolve in
the toilet water. The compartments 204 can also be provided with ornamental patterns or
shapes to enhance the appearance of the dispenser 200 to entice the consumer into purchasing
the dispenser 200. Alternatively, like in certain examples discussed herein, both sides of the
compartments 204 can also be provided with openings to allow for a quicker rate of release of
the material 212 within the toilet bowl.
[37]    In this example, the individual compartments 204 can be formed in a teardrop shape;
however, any other shape is contemplated in accordance with the disclosure herein.          The
teardrop shape of the individual compartments 204 provides a hydrodynamic shape of the
dispenser 200 and ensures that the water flushing over the dispenser 200 does not dislodge
the dispenser 200 from the toilet rim and into the toilet while adequately exposing the
individual compartments 204 and their respective sections of material 212 to water.
[38]    The material 212 releases a treatment agent during use when exposed to water from a
toilet. In this example, as shown in Fig. 2B, the compartments 204 can be provided with
alternating material 212 of two different formulations and colors. However, each section or
block of material 212 can provide a different function (e.g., cleaning, fragrancing, etc.) and
can be provided in different colors and/or fragrances in order to appeal to consumers. In one
example, the material 212 may fill less than 100% of the entire volume of the individual
compartments. In particular, the individual compartments 204 may be filled to approximately
50% to 95% of the individual compartments 204.            This creates head space between the
optional casing and the individual blocks of material 212 to allow for the water to enter into
the individual compartments 204 and to dissolve the individual blocks of material 212.
[39]    The wall 220 supports the individual compartments 204. In addition, as shown in
Figs. 2A-2C, the rim 222 can provide the tray 202 with one or more flat surfaces 232, which
can form a sealing surface for sealing the tray 202 in packaging. As shown in Fig. 2A, the
wall 220 can be formed with undulations that can correspond to the upper portions of the
individual compartments 204. The wall 220 and the undulations help to direct water around
14437539 1

                                               10
the front and the rear of the dispenser 200. When the water is directed to the rear of the
dispenser, it can interact with each section or block of material 212 and dissolve and release
the treatment agent.
[40]    The hook or hanger 206 can be injection molded and may be attached to a front or a
rear portion of the rim of a toilet bowl to hang the dispenser 200 in the toilet bowl. In this
example, the dispenser 200 can be provided with a slot 230 for receiving an end of the hanger
206. Also as shown in Fig. 2C, the end of the hanger may also be provided with a bent or
tapered portion 207 for preventing the hanger 206 from becoming detached from the
dispenser 200.     In this example, the hanger 206 can be attached to a retaining ring 272,
which has one or more tabs 274 for securing the retaining ring 272 and the hanger 206 to the
tray 202.
[41]    Although in the orientation shown, the blocks of material 212 will face the toilet
bowl, it is contemplated that the hanger 206 can be attached to the dispenser 200 in the
opposite orientation. Moreover, as is discussed in accordance with the examples below, it
may in certain instances be desired to configure the dispenser 200 such that the blocks of
material face inward toward the center of the toilet bowl, so the consumer can see the
flushing water enter the compartments and interact with the material 212.
[42]    Figs. 3A-3G depict another example dispenser 300, which is similar to the example
dispenser described in relation to Figs. 2A-2C, where similar reference numbers are used to
identify similar components. Fig. 3A shows a front view of the example dispenser 300. Fig.

[43]    The example dispenser 300 has similar features as the dispensers above; however, in
this example, the tray 302 and the casing 350 can be injection molded together as one
component or unit. The material forming the dispenser can be formed of any suitable plastic
in any desired color or can like in the examples discussed herein be formed of a transparent
or translucent plastic material. Also in this example, as shown in Figs. 3D and 3B, the
dispenser 300 can be formed to include a radius of curvature that conforms to a radius of
curvature of a toilet bowl.

[44]    Also in this example, a casing 350 is placed over the tray 302 to cover each of the
individual compartments 304. The casing 350 can be placed over the front portion of each of
the individual compartments 304 and can be provided with a series of openings or slits 309,
such that the consumer can view the section of material 312 during use of the dispenser 300
in the toilet.  In this example, as shown in Fig. 3A, the casing 350 can be raised above each
cavity to create additional headspace between the material (not shown) and the casing 350.
This allows for additional water to contact the material to enhance the treatment of the toilet
bowl, to again create a visual effect for the user to see that the sections of material are
working in the toilet bowl.
[45]    Unlike the example shown in Figs. 2A-2C, the individual compartments 304 can be
formed with openings 309a, 309b on both sides of the individual compartments 304. This
may increase the rate that the sections of material dissolve in the toilet water. Again, the
individual compartments 304 can be formed in a teardrop shape; however, any other shape is
contemplated in accordance with the disclosure herein. The teardrop shape of the individual
compartments 304 provides a hydrodynamic shape of the dispenser 300 and ensures that the
water flushing over the dispenser 300 does not dislodge the dispenser 300 from the toilet rim
and into the toilet while adequately exposing the individual compartments 304 and their
respective sections of material 312 to water.
[46]    As in the previous examples, the compartments 304 can be provided with material of
different formulations and colors, where each section or block of material 312 can provide a
different function (e.g., cleaning, fragrancing, etc.) and can be provided in different colors
and/or fragrances in order to appeal to consumers. Like in the above examples, the material
may fill less than the entire volume of the individual compartments.         In particular, the
individual compartments 304 may be filled to approximately 50% to 95% of the reservoirs
forming the individual compartments 304. This creates head space between the casing 350
and the individual blocks of material to allow for the water to enter into the individual
compartments 304, to create a turbulent flow, and to dissolve the individual blocks of
material 312.
[47]    In this example, as shown in Figs. 3A and 3B, the wall 320 is formed integral with the
casing 350 and the individual compartments 304 of the tray 302. Like in the above examples,
the wall 320 can be configured to support the individual compartments 304 and can be
formed with multiple undulations. In this example, however, the wall 320 can be formed of a
14437539 1

                                                12
smaller strip of material, and the individual compartments 304 and the wall 320 can define
gaps in between each of the compartments.
[48]    The wall 320 and the undulations may allow for the dispenser to capture additional
water flow from the toilet bowl during flushing and direct water into the openings 309a, 309b
in the front and the rear of the individual compartments. In this way, the water flows into the
openings 309a, 309b in the dispenser and interacts with each section or block of material.
This causes each section of material to dissolve and release the treatment agents into the toilet
bowl. Furthermore, water is allowed to flow in and around the gaps defined by the wall 320
and into the individual compartments 304.
[49]    Like in the above example described in relation to Figs. 2A-2C, the hook or hanger
306 can be injection molded and may be attached to a front or a rear portion of the rim of a
toilet bowl to hang the dispenser 300 in the toilet bowl. However, it is contemplated that the
hanger be formed integral with the casing 350 and or tray 302. Also similar to the above
examples, the dispenser 300 can be provided with a slot 330 for receiving an end of the
hanger 306. Also the end of the hanger may also be provided with a bent or tapered portion
(not shown) for maintaining the hanger from becoming detached from the dispenser. Since
the openings 309a, 309b are provided in both the front and rear portions of the dispenser 300,
the material in the individual compartments 304 can be viewed from either side and exposed
to fluid on either side of the dispenser. Therefore, the consumer can see the blocks of material
acting to treat the toilet bowl during use, which may in certain examples be desired.
[50]    In alternative examples, one or more of the above dispensers can be provided with a
predetermined angle, which angles the tray of the dispenser toward the center of the toilet
bowl. Additionally, the wall can be provided with the same predetermined angle.          In one
example, the angle can be approximately 45 degrees relative to the rim.          However, it is
contemplated that the angle could be anywhere from 0 degrees to 180 degrees depending on
the desired water flow over the dispenser. The angled wall and the undulations help to direct
water to the front of the dispenser. When the water is directed to the front of the dispenser, it
can interact with each section or block material and dissolve and release the treatment agents.
[51]    Figs. 4A-4E depict another example dispenser 400, which is similar to the example
dispensers described in relation to Figs. 2A-3G.       Fig. 4A shows an exploded view of the
assembly of the example dispenser 400.         Fig. 4B shows a front perspective view of the
example dispenser 400.        Fig. 4C shows another front perspective view of the example
14437539 1

dispenser 400. Fig. 4D shows a rear perspective view of the example dispenser 400 with the
cover 410 in place. Fig. 4E shows a rear perspective view of the example dispenser 400 with
the cover 410 removed. Figs. 4El-4E3 show example opening patterns for example casings.
Fig. 4F shows a left side view of the example dispenser 400.
[52]     The example dispenser 400 includes similar features and functionality as the example
dispensers described in relation to Figs. 2A-3G, where similar reference numbers are used to
identify similar components and features. Like in the above examples, the example dispenser
400, when mounted to a toilet, is configured to provide a continuous treatment each time the
toilet is flushed. Instead of forming each of the individual compartments 404 entirely open as
in other examples discussed herein, the casing 450 (e.g., membrane, film, etc.) can be
provided to cover the compartments 404 of the dispenser 400.
[53]     As shown in 4A, the dispenser 400 generally includes a tray 402, a casing 450, and a
hook 406 integrally formed with a clip 470. As shown in Figs. 4A-4F, like in the above
examples, the tray 402 can include a wall 420, which can support the individual
compartments 404. In this example and as discussed in more detail below, the clip 470 is
configured to snap over a central compartment 404 to hold the hook 406 into place onto the
tray 402. Also the casing 450 is configured to secure to the tray 402 over the compartments
404.
[54]     The hook or hanger 406 can be attached near an upper portion of the dispenser 400
and may be attached to a front or a rear portion of the rim of a toilet bowl to hang the
dispenser 400 in the toilet bowl. The hook or hanger 406 can be injection molded together
with the clip 470. In this example, as shown by Fig. 4D, the hook 406 and clip 470 can be
positioned so that the casing 450 faces the wall of the toilet bowl when installed. However, it
is also contemplated that the casing 450 can be configured to face toward the center of the
toilet bowl when installed as illustrated by the other examples discussed herein. In certain
examples, such as where the tray 402 and the casing 450 are formed transparent or opaque,
the consumer can see the blocks of material 412 acting to clean and/or provide fragrance
during use regardless of the orientation of the dispenser 400 in the toilet.
[55]     Referring specifically to Figs. 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4E and as discussed above, the hook
406 can be integrally formed with a clip 470, which can be removably secured to the tray
402, for example, by an interference fit. In one example, the clip 470 can be provided with a
retaining ring 472, which extends around a circumference of a central compartment 404. As
14437539 1

                                                 14
shown in Fig.4C, the central compartment 404 is configured to extend through the retaining
ring 472.
[56]      The clip 470 can also be provided with a tab 474 for securing the clip 470 onto the
tray 402. The tab 474 can extend over the tray 402 and past rim 422 such that the clip 470 is
secured to the tray 402. In addition the tray 402 can include locating slots 403 for receiving
corresponding projections 407 of the hook assembly. The projections 407 can be formed
slightly larger in diameter than the slots 403 such that the clip remains in place on the tray
402. In this way, the tab 474 and the retaining ring 472 help to secure the clip 470 to the tray
402 by a friction or interference fit. Also, the casing 450 can be adhered to the tray 402. It is
also contemplated that the hanger 406 and clip 470 could be formed reversible such that the
user can adjust the orientation of the dispenser 400 in the toilet such that either the tray 402 or
casing 450 faces the center of the toilet bowl.
[57]     It is also contemplated that in certain examples, the hanger 406 and clip 470 can be
configured to snap into place over either the casing 450 or the tray 402 where it is desired to
change the orientation of the dispenser 400 in the toilet bowl. In other examples, the hanger
406 and the clip 470 can be separately formed and then secured to the dispenser 400.             In
further alternate examples, the hanger could be integrally molded with the tray 402 or the
dispenser 400 with or without a projection or clip.
[58]     Additionally, a cover 410 can be provided to seal the individual sections of material
412 by providing a barrier against moisture and odor or fragrance prior to use. The cover 410
can be configured to be removed by the user before the tray 402 is placed onto the toilet rim
and may include a tab 411 or multiple tabs to facilitate the removal of the cover 410 from the
tray 402. The casing 450 and/or the tray 402 can also be provided with a corresponding tab
for supporting the tab 411 on the cover 410. The cover 410 can be made of any suitable
materials, which can in one example be formed of any of the materials discussed in relation
to the covers discussed herein. Additionally, the cover can be provided with certain indicia
413 to indicate to the user that the cover 410 is to be removed before use.
[59]     In this example, the tray 402, the casing 450, and the hook 406 can be thermoformed,
e.g., formed from plastic material in the form of one or more sheets of material by heating the
plastic material to a malleable forming temperature such that the plastic material can be
formed into the specific shape of the molds forming the dispenser 400 and the casing 450.
The materials can be formed of any suitable plastic in any desired color or can, like in the
14437539 1

                                                15
examples discussed herein, be formed of a transparent plastic material. Furthermore, in one
example, the example dispenser 400 can be formed of PET. The tray 402 and casing 450
once formed may also be trimmed to create the final product. It is also contemplated that the
tray 402 and the casing 450 can be formed with a predetermined radius of curvature in order
to accommodate for the curvature of a toilet or formed flexible so as to accommodate for the
curvature of the toilet bowl.
[60]    The casing 450, in this example, is intended to remain on the dispenser 400 during
use, and the series of openings 409 allow for the fluid from the toilet bowl to interact with the
individual sections of material 412 to dissolve the sections of material 412 into the toilet.
The casing 450 can be placed over the rear portion of the tray 402 and can be secured to the
tray 402 by an adhesive. In this example, the wall 420 and the rim 422 provide the tray 402
with one or more flat surfaces 432 for receiving the casing 450. In one example, the casing
450 can be sealed to the rim 422 of the wall 420. In this example, the wall 420 and the rim
422 can define an area of 4 in 2 . In other examples, the area may be between approximately 2
in and 6 in . In still other examples, the area may be greater or less than the dimensions
provided.
[61]    The casing 450 can be configured to at least partially cover the openings of each of
the individual compartments 404.        The casing 450 can be provided with a plurality of
openings or slits 409 in the areas covering the individual compartments 404. In one example,
the size of the openings or slits 409 relative to the size of the openings of each of the
individual compartments 404 can vary depending on the desired amount of formulation that
is to be released into the toilet. In certain examples, the open area of the slits 409 over the
total area of the apertures ranges from 40% to 60%. In other specific examples, the open area
over the apertures 409 can be approximately 45%, 50%, or 52% of the total area of the
products.   The slits 409 can be formed elongated and/or may also be provided with a degree
of curvature. As shown in the example in Figure 4D, certain openings 409 can be formed in a
triangular shape and certain openings can be formed as elongated openings extending parallel
to each other.
[62]    Also as shown in Fig. 4E, in this example, the casing 450 can include a face 451,
which can be formed substantially flat so as to reduce the profile of the dispenser 400 in the
toilet. In contrast with certain examples discussed herein, the flat profile of the casing 450
can limit the amount of fluid exposure for each of the individual compartments 404, thereby
14437539 1

                                               16
slowing the rate that the formulations dissolve. The thinner profile of the dispenser 400 can
also make the dispenser more economical to package.
[63]    In this example, the optional casing 450 can be formed of a clear material. However,
the casing 450 can also be opaque or colored. The casing 450 can also be formed as a film.
The casing 450 can be formed of any suitable material for thermoforming or other
manufacturing techniques and may be formed of any of the materials discussed herein.
[64]    In this example, the compartments 404 can be provided with material 412 of the same
formulation and color.     However, like in the above examples, each section or block of
material 412 can provide a different function (e.g., cleaning, fragrancing, etc.) and can be
provided in different colors and/or fragrances in order to appeal to consumers. In certain
examples, the compartments 404 can be filled to a certain percentage volume of formulation
that is less than 100% and in one example, the percentage volume can range from 50% to
95%.    This provides a certain headspace between the casing and the formulation, which
allows for the water from the toilet to interact with the formulations.      Additionally, the
percentage volume can vary with respect to the particular compartment.
[65]    Other opening arrangements are contemplated depending on the desired water flow,
desired dissolving rate of the formulations in the toilet, and appeal to the consumer. Figs.
4El-4E3 show additional alternative opening arrangements for exemplary casings. As shown
in Fig. 4E1, the openings 409A in the casing 450A can be formed similar to the casing 450
above but can be formed at a slanted angle. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4E2, the openings
409B of the casing 450B can be formed in a ribbon configuration where the openings are
formed in the loop of the ribbon and the bottom portion of the ribbon can be embossed on the
casing 450B. Moreover, in another example casing 450C shown in Fig. 4E3, the openings
409C can be formed in similar shapes as the example shown in Fig. 4E, however, the
openings 409C on the bottom can be formed larger, and the number of openings can be fewer
in numbers.
[66]    Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4B, the individual compartments 404 can be formed
without openings on the opposite side of the dispenser to control the rate that the sections of
material 412 dissolve in the toilet water.     Moreover, the compartments 404 can also be
provided with ornamental patterns or shapes to enhance the appearance of the dispenser 400
to entice the consumer into purchasing the dispenser 400. Specifically, the front of the tray
402 can be provided with a series of embossments 466. Alternatively, like in certain
14437539 1

                                               17
examples discussed herein, both sides of the compartments 404 can also be provided with
openings to allow for a quicker rate of release of the material 412 within the toilet bowl. For
example, the embossments 466 could be formed as openings or slots instead of embossments.
[67]    Like in above examples, the individual compartments 404 can be formed in a teardrop
shape; however, any other shape is contemplated in accordance with the disclosure herein.
Like in the above examples, the teardrop shape of the individual compartments 404 provides
a hydrodynamic shape of the dispenser 400 and ensures that the water flushing over the
dispenser 400 does not dislodge the dispenser 400 from the toilet rim and into the toilet while
adequately exposing the individual compartments 404 and their respective sections of
material 412 to water. Also as shown in Fig. 4E, the flat profile of the dispenser 400 can
ensure that more water flows over the front side of the dispenser 400 than over the rear side,
which can help control the rate that the material 414 within the compartments 404 dissolves
in the toilet. It is contemplated that any number of compartments 404 can be used depending
on the desired amount of formulation that is to be dispensed into the toilet. In this example,
five compartments 404 are shown. Each of the compartments 404 can define a volume of
approximately 0.4 in 3 and can have an internal cup area of approximately 2.3 in 2 . In other
examples, the volume may be between approximately 0.2 in 3 and approximately 0.6 in 3 and
                                                                 2            2
the internal cup area may be between approximately 0.1 in and 0.3 in . In still other
examples, the volume and the internal cup area may be greater or less than the dimensions
provided. To use the dispenser 400, the user can pull on an optional the tab 411 of the cover
and peel the cover 410 from the casing 450 and the tray 402 to expose the material 412 in the
individual compartments 404. The user can then place the dispenser 400 onto the rim of a
toilet, and the material 412 in the compartments 404 releases a cleaning agent and/or
fragrance evenly during use when exposed to water from a toilet.
[68]    Figs. 5A-5D depict another example dispenser 500, which includes similar features
and functionality as the example dispenser described in relation to Figs. 4A-4F, where similar
reference numbers are used to identify similar components and features.       Fig. 5A shows a
front view of the example dispenser 500 with the cover 510 in place. Fig. 5B shows a front
view of the example dispenser 500 with the cover 510 removed. Fig. 5C shows a rear view
of the dispenser 500. Fig. 5D shows a left-side perspective view of the example dispenser
500.

[69]     The example dispenser 500 has similar features as the dispensers above; however, in
this example, the tray 502 can be thermoformed, and the casing 550 can be injection molded.
The material forming the tray 502 can be formed of any suitable plastic suitable for
thermoforming in any desired color or can, like in the examples discussed herein, be formed
of a transparent or translucent plastic material. Furthermore, in one example, the example tray
502 can be formed of PET. The material forming the casing 550 can be formed of any
suitable plastic, including any of the examples discussed herein, in any desired color or can
like in the examples discussed herein be formed of a transparent plastic material. Also like in
the above examples, it is contemplated that the tray 502 and the casing 550 can be formed
with a predetermined radius of curvature in order to accommodate for the curvature of the
toilet or formed flexible so as to flex or bend to accommodate for the curvature of the toilet
bowl.
[70]     Unlike the example discussed above in relation to Figs. 4A-4F, as shown by Fig. 5B,
the hook 506 can be positioned so that the casing 550 faces toward the center of the toilet
bowl when installed. In this example, the consumer can see the blocks of material 512 acting
to clean and/or provide fragrance during use through the slots or openings 509 formed in the
casing 550. However, it is also contemplated that the casing 550 can be configured to face in
the opposite direction when installed as illustrated by the other examples discussed herein.
[71]     Like in the above examples described in relation to Figs. 4A-4F, the hook or hanger
506 can be injection molded and may be attached to a front or a rear portion of the rim of a
toilet bowl to hang the dispenser 500 in the toilet bowl. However, in this example, instead of
providing a clip to retain the hanger 506 on the dispenser, a projection 555 for receiving the
hanger 506 can be integrally molded into the casing 550 through the injection molding
process. As shown in Figs. 5B and 5D, the projection 555 extends from the wall 520 of the
casing 550 and provides a mount for the hook 506. The projection 555 can be provided with
a slot 557 for receiving an end of the hanger 506 to secure the hanger 506 in place on the
dispenser 500.     However, it is contemplated that the hanger be formed integral with the
casing 550.
[72]     Similar to the above examples, before the dispenser 500 is placed into the toilet, the
user removes the cover 510 from the dispenser 500 by pulling on the tab 511 adjacent the
corresponding tab 552 on the casing 550. Once the cover is removed, the user can then hang
the dispenser by the hook 506 in the toilet.

[73]    Figs. 6A-6F depict another example dispenser 600, which is similar to the example
dispenser described in relation to Figs. 4A-4F including similar features and functionality,
where similar reference numbers are used to identify similar components. Fig. 6A shows a
front perspective view of the example dispenser 600 with the cover 610 in place. Fig. 6B
shows a rear perspective view of the dispenser 600 with the cover 610 in place. Fig. 6C
shows a bottom perspective view of the example dispenser 600 showing the casing 650 in an
opened position. Fig. 6D shows a left-side view of the example dispenser 600 with the casing
650 in the closed position.     Fig. 6E shows a left-side view of the example dispenser 600
with the casing 650 in an opened position.      Fig. 6F shows a left-side view of the example
dispenser 600 with the casing in an opened position, and the cover 610 partially removed.
[74]    Again, the example dispenser 600 can have similar features and functionality as the
dispensers discussed above. However, in this example, the casing 650 can be connected to
the tray 602 by several hinges 660 such that the casing 650 can be opened to remove the
cover 610. Also, the cover 610 is provided in between the casing 650 and the tray 602 such
that the user must open the casing 650 before removing the cover 610. Once the cover 610 is
removed, the casing 650 can be closed to cover the tray 602 and the dispenser 600 can be
placed into a toilet. Additionally, unlike the examples discussed above in relation to Figs.
4A-5D, the casing 650 can be formed with exterior curvature such that it projects outwardly
from the front of the dispenser 600 instead of extending flat like in the above examples.
[75]    As shown in Figs. 6A and 6B, several hinges 660 are provided so that the user can
open the casing 650 and peel off the cover 610 from the tray 602 before using the dispenser
600. As shown in Fig. 6B, in one example, the hinges 660 can be formed as rings or hook
like elements that extend into corresponding openings 621 on the tray 602 wall 620.
However other hinge types are also contemplated, for example, living hinges, continuous
hinges, and the like, to connect the casing 650 to the tray 602.
[76]    Also as shown in Fig. 6C, the casing 650 can be provided with a locking tab 662
positioned on the bottom center of the casing 650 which can be used to secure the casing 650
to the tray 602. Referring to Figs. 6E and 6F, the locking tab 662 can include a portion 663
that extends downwardly from the casing 650 to provide the user with a grasping portion for
easing the removal of the casing 650 from the tray 602. The casing 650 can be provided with
several locking tabs along the length of the casing to secure the casing 650 in place on the
tray 602. Additionally, although not shown, the locking tab 662 can include a tapered surface
14437539 1

                                               20
and/or the tray 602 can be provided with a corresponding opening or recess for the locking
tab 662 which can help maintain the casing 650 in place on the tray 602. In other further
examples, a locking tab could also be placed on the tray 602 for securing the casing 650 to
the tray 602 or the tray 602 and casing 650 can be provided with alternative clasping systems
or devices, which provide accessibility to the cover 610 and the individual compartments 604
for removal and use of the dispenser 600. In other alternative examples, the casing 650 could
be formed of individual sections that each can include a hinge and a locking tab such that the
individual sections can be opened separately.
[77]    Also like in the above example, the tray 602 can be thermoformed, and the casing 650
can be injection molded. The material forming the tray 602 can be formed of any suitable
plastic suitable for thermoforming in any desired color or can, like in the examples discussed
herein, be formed of a transparent or translucent plastic material. Furthermore, in one
example, the example tray 602 can be formed of PET.       The material forming the casing 650
can be formed of any suitable plastic, including any of the examples discussed herein, in any
desired color or can like in the examples discussed herein be formed of a transparent plastic
material. Also, like in the above examples, it is contemplated that the tray 602 and the casing
650 can be formed with a predetermined radius of curvature in order to accommodate for the
curvature of the toilet or formed flexible so as to flex or bend to accommodate for the
curvature of the toilet bowl.
[78]    Like in the above example described in relation to Figs. 4A-4F, the hook or hanger
606 can be injection molded and may be attached to a front or a rear portion of the rim of a
toilet bowl to hang the dispenser 600 in the toilet bowl. However, it is also contemplated that
the hanger 606 be formed integral with the casing 650. An injection molded projection 655,
which extends from the wall 620, can provide a mount for the hook 606. In particular, the
projection 655 can be provided with a slot for receiving an end of the hanger 606 to secure
the hanger 606 onto the dispenser 600.
[79]    As shown by Figs. 6A and 6B, the hook 606 can be positioned so that the casing 650
faces toward the center of the toilet bowl when installed. In this example, the consumer can
see the blocks of material 612 acting to clean and/or provide fragrance during use through the
slots or openings 609 formed in the casing 650. However, it is also contemplated that the
casing 650 can be configured to face in the opposite direction when installed as illustrated by
the other examples discussed herein.
14437539 1

                                                21
[80]     Additionally, similar to the example shown above, the individual compartments 604
are configured to receive individual sections of material 612, which can be in the form of a
gel, paste, and/or solid. The casing 650 can be provided with a degree of curvature to form a
head space between the tray 602 and the casing 605. This allows for additional water to come
into contact with the individual sections of material 612, which can increase the rate that the
sections of material 612 dissolve in the toilet water.
[81]     Like in the above examples, the tray 602 and the casing 650 can also be provided with
ornamental patterns or shapes to enhance the appearance of the dispenser 600 to entice the
consumer into purchasing the dispenser 600. Like in the above examples, the front of the tray
602 can be provided with a series of embossments 666, which may correspond to or can be
similar to the openings 609 formed in the casing 650. Alternatively, like in certain examples
discussed herein, both sides of the dispenser 600 could be provided with openings to allow
for a quicker rate of release of the material 612 within the toilet bowl.
[82]     To use the dispenser 600, the user can remove the casing 650 by rotating the casing
650 away from the tray 602 to release the locking tab 662 and opening the dispenser 600 to
expose the cover 610. As shown in Figs. 6E and 6F, once the casing 650 is rotated away
from the tray 602, the user can remove the cover 610 by pulling on the tab 611 adjacent the
corresponding tab 652 on the casing 650 to peel the cover 610 away from the tray 602. After
the cover 610 is removed from the tray 602, the user can then secure the tray 602 and the
casing 650 by pushing the tray 602 and the casing 650 together thereby engaging the locking
tab 662.     The user can then place the dispenser 600 in the toilet for use.        It is also
contemplated that the user can refill the compartments 604 with formulation by removing the
casing 650 from the tray 602.        For example, refill formulation can be supplied with or
supplied separately from the dispenser 600. In this way, the user could reuse the dispenser
600 repeatedly.
[83]     Fig. 7 shows an alternative example dispenser 700, which is similar to the example
dispensers described above which can include similar features and functionality, where
similar reference numbers are used to identify similar components.            In this example,
however, the tray 702 wall 720 can be provided with a series of water deflectors 780 which
help the dispenser 700 to operate in both open-rim and box-rim style toilets. Box-rim style
toilets typically have a closed water rim with holes around the underside of the rim that direct
water into the bowl of the toilet. The water deflectors 780 can help to deflect water over the
14437539 1

                                               22
front or rear of the dispenser depending on their orientation to ensure that the water goes into
the slots 709 of the casing 750.        The water deflectors 780 can be provided with a
predetermined angle such that the water is properly guided over the dispenser and into the
slots 709.   In one example, the water deflectors 780 can be orientated at 30 degree to 60
degree angles in relation to the wall 720. In one specific example, the water deflectors 780
can be orientated at a 45 degree angle in relation to the wall 720. The water deflectors 780
can also be formed tapered from the top to the bottom, which helps to collect the desired
amount of water for the slots 709. In other examples, the water deflectors 780 can be formed
in a triangular shape.    However, other suitable shapes are contemplated depending on the
amount of water that is desired to be directed into the slots 709.
[84]    Fig. 8 shows another example dispenser 800, which is similar to the example
dispensers described above which can include similar features and functionality, where
similar reference numbers are used to identify similar components.      This example is similar
to the example discussed above in relation to Fig. 7.       However, in this example, a single
water deflector 880 can be provided to help to deflect water over the front or rear of the
dispenser 800 depending on its orientation to ensure that the water goes into the slots 809 of
the casing 850. Like in the above example, the water deflector 880 can be provided with a
predetermined angle such that the water is properly guided over the dispenser and into the
slots 709. In one example, the water deflector 880 can be orientated at 30 degree to 60
degree angles in relation to the wall 820, and in one specific example the water deflector 880
can be orientated at a 45 degree angle in relation to the wall 720. In addition to the specific
dispensers shown in Figs. 7 and 8, it is contemplated that the water deflectors of Figs. 7 and 8
can be used in conjunction with any of the example dispensers discussed herein to
accommodate for both open-rim and box-rim style toilets.
[85]    In relation to the examples discussed herein, each section or block of the material can
provide a different function (e.g., cleaning, fragrancing, etc.) and can be different colors.
Forming the rimblock of different materials could convey different benefits to consumer. For
example, consumers want to keep toilet clean and always presentable for family to use. By
forming the sections of the material of different materials, the rimblock can effectively
remove stains, remove odors and provide a nice fragrance to the user.          Also one of the
sections could be configured to foam, which is a visual cue to the user to reassure product is
working.
14437539 1

                                                23
[86]    The dispenser components of the examples discussed herein can be made of single
layer sheets or multi-layer laminate sheets. The materials can be transparent, translucent, or
opaque as deemed desirable for various product supply, packaging, marketing, and various
other business considerations. A non-limiting example of material includes heat salable
thermoplastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or RPET. Layered laminates
having generally a sandwich construction can include any combination or order of
polyethylene, cellophane, paper, polyester, and so forth including variations thereof.
Selection of materials, and the thickness thereof, is determined by the nature of the material
being packaged. The selection of biodegradable materials generally includes consideration of
decomposition in both natural aerobic and anaerobic environments. Specifically for plastics
material,   biodegradability    is achieved   by   materials   that can   be   metabolized   by
microorganisms into inert material having minimal impact on the environment. In addition,
biodegradable or other environmentally compatible materials can include water-soluble
material. Without being limited by any particular theory, water-soluble materials are
materials that disintegrate or dissolve in the presences of water. Non-limiting examples of
water-soluble material include, but is not necessarily limited to water-soluble polymers,
particularly polymers that are useful in film forming, such as poly-vinyl alcohol, cellulose
ether, and so forth either individually or in various combinations. As generally known in the
art, various   additives can be incorporated into the water-soluble polymers to alter
disintegration and dissolution as desired.
[87]    In one example, a dispenser system may include a tray comprising at least one
compartment containing a formulation.        The formulation can include one of a cleaner or
fragrance. A hanger can be configured to suspend the tray from a toilet bowl rim such that
when the toilet is flushed, the water from the toilet comes into contact with the formulation to
release the one of a cleaner or fragrance. A cover can be configured to seal the at least one
compartment from moisture and fragrance. In one example, the tray can include a plurality
of compartments with a plurality of formulations contained therein, and at least one of the
plurality formulations can be different from another one of the plurality of formulations. At
least one of the plurality of formulations can have a different color than another one of the
