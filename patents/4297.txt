FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention provides long-acting injectable formulations comprising at least
one isoxazoline active agent, a block co-polymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide
(poloxamer) and, optionally, a co-solvent; the use of these formulations against parasites
(including ectoparasites (e.g., fleas or ticks) and/or endoparasites), and methods for preventing or
treating parasitic infections and infestations in animals.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        Animals such as mammals and birds are often susceptible to parasite infestations/
infections. These parasites may be ectoparasites, such as fleas, ticks and parasitic flies, and
endoparasites such as nematodes and other worms. Domesticated animals, such as cats and dogs,
are often infested with one or more of the following ectoparasites:
        - fleas (e.g. Ctenocephalides spp., such as Ctenocephalidesfelisand the like);
        - ticks (e.g. Rhipicephahs spp., Ixodes spp., Dermacentor spp., Aiblyoinia spp., and the
like);
        - mites (e.g. Demodex spp., Sarcoptes spp., Otodectes spp., and the like);
        - lice (e.g. Trichodectes spp., Cheyletiella spp., Linognathus spp. and the like);
        - mosquitoes (Aedes spp., Culex spp., Anopheles spp. and the like); and
        - flies (Haematobiaspp., Musca spp., Stoioxys spp., Dermatobiaspp., Cochlionyiaspp.
and the like).
        Fleas are a particular problem because not only do they adversely affect the health of the
animal or human, but they also cause a great deal of psychological stress. Moreover, fleas may
also transmit pathogenic agents to animals and humans, such as tapeworm (Dipylidium
                                                    1

canlinum).
        Similarly, ticks are also harmful to the physical and psychological health of the animal or
human. However, the most serious problem associated with ticks is that they are vectors of
pathogenic agents in both humans and animals. Major diseases which may be transmitted by
ticks include borrelioses (Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi), babesiosis (or
piroplasmoses caused by Babesia spp.) and rickettsioses (e.g. Rocky Mountain spotted fever).
Ticks also release toxins which cause inflammation or paralysis in the host. Occasionally, these
toxins are fatal to the host.
        Likewise, farm animals are also susceptible to parasite infestations. For example, cattle
are affected by a large number of parasites. A parasite which is prevalent among cattle in some
regions are ticks of the genus Rhipicephaus, especially those of the species icrop/us (cattle
tick), decoloratus and annulatus. Ticks such as Rhipicepha/us mincrop/us (formerly Boophi/us
mincrop/us) are difficult to control because they lay eggs in the pasture where farm animals graze.
This species of ticks is considered a one-host tick and spends immature and adult stages on one
animal before the female engorges and falls off the host to lay eggs in the environment. The life
cycle of the tick is approximately three to four weeks. In addition to cattle, Rhipicepha/us
mincrop/us may infest buffalo, horses, donkeys, goats, sheep, deer, pigs, and dogs. A heavy tick
burden on animals can decrease production and damage hides as well as transmit diseases such
as babesiosis ("cattle fever") and anaplasmosis.
        Animals and humans also suffer from endoparasitic infections including, for example,
helminthiasis which is caused by of parasitic worms categorized as cestodes (tapeworm),
nematodes (roundworm) and trematodes (flatworm or flukes). These parasites adversely affect
the nutrition of the animal and cause severe economic losses in pigs, sheep, horses, and cattle as
well as affecting companion animals and poultry. Other parasites which occur in the
gastrointestinal   tract  of animals    and humans      include Ancylostona, Necator, Ascaris,
Strongy/oides, Trichinella, Capillaria,Toxocara, Toxascaris, Trichuris, Enterobius and parasites
which are found in the blood or other tissues and organs such as filarial worms and the extra
intestinal stages of Strongy/oides, Toxocara and Trichinella.
        Recently, isoxazole and isoxazoline-containing compounds have been demonstrated to be
effective against parasites that harm animals. For example, US 7,964,204 (to DuPont,

        In additional to topical and oral dosage forms, it is sometimes possible to formulate
active agents as long-acting formulations, depending upon, for example, the physiochemical
properties of the individual active agent; these properties include, for example, solubility,
bioavailability, etc. For example, US 6,733,767 and US 8,362,086 (both incorporated herein by

        Notwithstanding the compositions comprising isoxazoline active agents alone or in
combination with other active agents described in the documents above, there is a need for
veterinary compositions and methods with improved efficacy, bioavailability, and spectrum of
coverage to protect animals against endoparasites and/or ectoparasites. More specifically, there is
a need to develop a long-acting injectable formulation comprising an isoxazoline compound,
which has good bioavailability and exhibits a reduced irritation at the injection site while still
being effective against parasites (e.g., fleas and ticks) for a long duration (e.g., from three (3) to
six (6) months or longer).

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention for novel and inventive long-acting injectable formulations for the
treatment or prevention of parasite infections or infestations in an animal comprising an
antiparasitic effective amount of at least one isoxazoline compound, a poloxamer and, optionally,
a co-solvent in which the formulation does not contain a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer,
as defined herein, other than a poloxamer. As used herein, the term "poloxamer" means a block
copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Different grades, sources, and brands of block
copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may be used in the long-acting injectable
formulations of the invention. Likewise, for the purposes of this application, liquid polyethylene
glycols (PEGs) are considered to be a co-solvent and are not considered to be a pharmaceutically
acceptable polymer
                                                   4

      WO 2016/138339                                                               PCT/US2016/019688
          In accordance with this invention, it has been discovered that the inventive formulations
generally show desirable bioavailability and duration of efficacy, while causing minimal
irritation at the injection site. The compositions also provide desirable safety profiles toward the
warm-blooded and bird animal recipients. In addition, it has been discovered that a single
administration of such formulations generally provides potent activity against one or more
parasites (e.g., ectoparasites), while also tending to provide fast onset of activity, long duration
of activity, and/or desirable safety profiles.
          The invention encompasses uses or veterinary uses of the isoxazoline compositions for
the treatment or prevention or prophylaxis of parasitic infections and infestations of animals
(either wild or domesticated), including livestock and companion animals such as cats, dogs,
horses, chickens, sheep, goats, pigs, turkeys and cattle, with the aim of ridding these hosts of
parasites commonly encountered by such animals.
          The invention also provides methods for the treatment or prevention of parasitic
infections and infestations in animals, comprising administering an effective amount of long
acting injectable formulations comprising an antiparasitic effective amount of at least one
isoxazoline compound together with a poloxamer and a co-solvent, wherein the formulation does
not contain a pharmaceutically               acceptable biodegradable polymer        as defined herein.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the inventive isoxazoline-containing formulations described
herein exhibit superior broad spectrum efficacy against harmful parasites (e.g. ectoparasites such
as fleas and ticks) more rapidly, and over a long duration compared to other injectable
formulations containing isoxazoline active agents known in the art while exhibiting minimal
irritation at the injection site.
          This invention also provides for the use of an isoxazoline in the preparation of a long
acting injectable formulation for the treatment or prevention of an animal against parasites.
          In one embodiment, the invention provides for long-acting injectable formulations
comprising antiparasitic effective amounts of at least one isoxazoline of formula (I) below, in
combination and a pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable liquid carrier, where variables A1 ,
A2 , A3 , A4 , A5 , A', B , B2 , B3, R1 , R2, R4, R5 , W and n are defined herein.

         The compounds of formula (I) through formula (VIa) can exist as stereoisomers where
there is a chiral center and these individual stereoisomers are encompassed by the structural
formulas depicted herein.      Hence, in an     another embodiment, the long-acting injectable

Formula (Va), Formula (VI) or Formula (VIa)           which is enriched in one enantiomer, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In an embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) to
formula (VIa) present in the compositions of the invention are enriched in one enantiomer (either
(S)- or (R)-configuration) in a weight:weight ratio of at least 1.5, at least 2, at least 5 or at least
 10. In another embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) to formula (VIa) present in the
compositions of the invention are essentially pure enantiomers.
         Processes to prepare individual stereoisomers of the compounds of formula (I) through
formula (VIa) (e.g., the stereoisomers for formula I-la and formula I-lb below) from a racemic
mixture comprising the same are well with the skill level of one of ordinary skill in this art.
Processes include, for example, recrystallization or chiral chromatography using, for example a
Chiralpak* AD column, and processes to prepare individual stereoisomers of an isoxazoline
compound are found in the prior art (see, e.g., WO 2014/090918 Al, WO 2011/104089 Al or

skill in the art will understand that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit
beneficial properties in when enriched relative to the other enantiomer. In addition, the skilled
person in the art knows how to separate, enrich, and/or selectively prepare a stereoisomer of the
isoxazoline compounds described herein. The isoxazoline compounds of formula (I) to formula

         In one embodiment of the invention, the more biologically active enantiomer is believed
to be Formula I-la. Formula I-Ia has the (S) configuration at the chiral carbon of the isoxazoline
ring and Formula I-lb has the (R) configuration at the chiral carbon. Similarly, the more
biologically active enantiomers of isoxazoline compounds of formula (II) to (VIa) are believed to
have the (S)-configuration at the chiral carbon of the isoxazoline ring. In certain embodiments,
an isoxazoline compound of the invention or compositions comprising the compound which are
enriched in an enantiomer that displays significant in vitro and in vivo activity (the eutomer)
with a favorable toxicity profile whereas a compound or composition enriched with the other
corresponding enantiomer displays significantly far less in vitro and in vivo activity (the
distomer).
         This invention comprises racemic mixtures, for example, equal amounts of the
enantiomers of isoxazoline compounds of Formulae (I) to (VIa). The invention includes
compounds of Formula (I), Formula (Ia), Formula (Ib), Formula (II), Formula (11-1.1001) to
Formula (11-1.025), Formula (11-2.001) to Formula (11-018), Formula (III), Formula (IV),
Formula (V), Formula (Va), Formula (VI) or Formula (VIa) that are enriched in one enantiomer
compared to the racemic mixture. Also included are the essentially pure enantiomers of the
compounds of Formula (I), Formula (Ia), Formula (Ib), Formula (II), Formula (11-1.1001) to
Formula (11-1.025), Formula (11-2.001) to Formula (11-018), Formula (III), Formula (IV),
Formula (V), Formula (Va), Formula (VI) or Formula (VIa).
         When enantiomerically enriched, one enantiomer is present in greater amounts than the
other, and the extent of enrichment may be defined by an expression of enantiomeric excess
("ee"), which is defined as (2x-l) 100 %, where x is the mole fraction of the dominant
enantiomer in the mixture (e.g., an ee of 20 % corresponds to a 60:40 ratio of enantiomers). In
some embodiments, the compositions of the invention comprise compounds that have at least a
50 % enantiomeric excess. In other embodiments, the compositions of the invention comprise
compounds that have at least a 75 % enantiomeric excess, at least a 90 % enantiomeric excess, or
at least a 94 % enantiomeric excess of the more active isomer. Of particular note are
enantiomerically pure embodiments of the more active isomer (the eutomer).
         Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more conformational isomers due to
restricted rotation about the amide bond bonded to the aryl or heteroaryl ring (e.g. the amide
bonded to the naphthyl group in Formula (I)). This invention comprises mixtures of

racemic forms. Compounds having one or more chiral centers as those of formula (I) to formula
(VIa) above, including at a sulfur atom, may be present as single enantiomers or diastereomers or
as mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers. For example, it is well known in the art that
sulfoxide compounds may be optically active and may exist as single enantiomers or racemic
mixtures. In addition, compounds within the compositions of the invention may include one or
more chiral centers, which results in a theoretical number of optically active isomers. Where
compounds within the compositions of the invention include n chiral centers, the compounds
may comprise up to 2" optical isomers. The present invention encompasses compositions
comprising the specific enantiomers or diastereomers of each compound as well as mixtures of
different enantiomers and/or diastereomers of the compounds of the invention that possess the
useful properties described herein. In addition, the invention encompasses compositions
comprising one or more conformational isomers (e.g. rotamers) as well as mixtures of
conformational isomers. Conformational isomers of the isoxazoline compounds may be
produced by a restriction of rotation about the amide bond bonded to the aryl or heteroaryl ring
(e.g. the amide bonded to the naphthyl group in Formula (I)). The optically active forms can be
prepared by, for example, resolution of the racemic forms by selective crystallization techniques,
by synthesis from optically active precursors, by chiral synthesis, by chromatographic separation
using a chiral stationary phase or by enzymatic resolution.

                                                           i N~
         Nitenpyram is active against adult fleas when given daily as an oral tablet. Nitenpyram
works by interfering with normal nerve transmission and leads to the death of the insect.
Nitenpyram has a very fast onset of action against fleas. For example, CAPSTARTM Tablets
begin to act against fleas in as early as 30 minutes after administration and is indicated for use as
often as once a day. However, nitenpyram is only known to be effective when administered orally as
a systemic parasiticide, as with CAPSTARTM Tablets.

        The long-acting formulations of the present invention, which include at least an
isoxazoline active agent, a poloxamer and a co-solvent, have been surprisingly discovered to be
stable and effective against a broad spectrum of ectoparasites, and possibly also endoparasites if
another active is included, for an extended period of time; e.g., a period from three (3) to six (6)
months while exhibiting favorable properties with respect to the site of injection.
        Poloxamers are a family of synthetic block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene
oxide. Poloxamers may be liquid, a milky white paste or a powder and are represented by the
following structure:
where a is an integer between 2 and 130 and b is an integer between 15 and 67 (see, US
3,740,421). Poloxamer are available from commercial sources such as BASF and Croda. An
example of a poloxamer is P-124 which is a solid at room temperature. In one embodiment,
poloxamer P-124 has the values a = 12 and b   =  20. Other poloxamers include P-128 (a = 38 and
b = 29), P-181 (a= 3 andb =30) P-188 (a= 80 andb =27), P-237 (a = 64 andb = 37), P338(a=
141 and b = 44,) and P407(a= 101 and b = 56,).
        Pharmaceutically acceptable polymers other than poloxamers are specifically excluded
from the inventive long-acting formulations.       For the purposes of this application, liquid
polyethylene glycols, which function herein as co-solvents, are not defined as or considered to be

         In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for the treatment and prevention of
parasitic infections and infestations of animals (either wild or domesticated), including livestock
and companion animals such as cats, dogs, horses, birds including chickens, sheep, goats, pigs,
deer, turkeys and cattle, with the aim of ridding these hosts of parasites commonly encountered
by such animals.
         In an embodiment, the invention provides methods and compositions for the treatment or
prevention of parasitic infections and infestations in companion animals including, but not
limited to, cats and dogs. The methods and compositions are particularly effective for preventing
or treating parasitic infestations of cats and dogs with fleas and ticks.
         In another embodiment, the methods and compositions of the invention are used for the
treatment or prevention of parasitic infections and infestations in cattle or sheep. When treating

againstRhipicepha/us (Boophius)micropus,Haeiatobiairritans(horn fly), Stomoxys
calcitrans(stable fly), and sheep myiasis such as Lucilia sericata,Lucilia cuprina (known as
blowfly strike in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa).
        The terms "treating" or "treat" or "treatment" are intended to mean the administration of
a long-acting formulation of the present invention to an animal that has a parasitic infestation for
the eradication of the parasite or the reduction of the number of the parasites infesting the animal
undergoing treatment. It is noted that the compositions of the invention may be used to prevent
such a parasitic infestation.
        The terms "prevent",       "prevention"   or "prophylaxis"    are intended to mean the
administration of the long-acting formulations of the present invention to the animal before the
parasitic infection or infestation has occurred in order to keep said infection or infestation from
occurring.
        The formulations of the invention are administered in parasiticidally effective amounts
which are which are suitable to control the parasite in question to the desired extent, as described
below. In each aspect of the invention, the compounds and compositions of the invention can be
applied against a single pest or combinations thereof
         By "antiparasitic effective amount" is intended a sufficient amount of a composition of
the invention to eradicate or reduce the number of parasites infesting the animal. In some
embodiments, an effective amount of the active agent achieves at least 70% efficacy against the
target parasite compared to an untreated control. In other embodiments, an effective amount of
the active agent achieves at least 80%, or at least 90% efficacy against the target pests.
Preferably, an effective amount of the active agent will achieve at least 95%, at least 98% or
100% efficacy against the target parasites.
        Generally, a dose of from about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg of body weight given as a
single dose or in divided doses for a period of from 1 to 5 days will be satisfactory but, of course,
there can be instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are indicated, and such are within the
scope of this invention. It is well within the routine skill of the practitioner to determine a
particular dosing regimen for a specific host and parasite.
        In some embodiments for companion animals, the dose of the isoxazoline active agent
administered from the topical compositions of the invention is between about 0.1 to about 50 mg
per kg of body weight. More typically the dose of the isoxazoline active agent administered is

about 0.5 to about 30 mg/kg or about 0.5 to about 30 mg/kg body weight. In another
embodiment, the dose of the isoxazoline active agent administered is about 10 to about 30
mg/kg, about 15 to about 30 mg/kg or about 20 to about 30 mg/kg of body weight.
         In other embodiments, the dose administered may be lower depending on the animal and
the isoxazoline administered. For example, if the composition comprises the more active
enantiomer of the isoxazoline compounds a lower dose may be administered. In some
embodiments, the dose is from about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg of body weight. In another
embodiment, the dose may be from about 0.1 to about 20 mg/kg or about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg
of body weight. In other embodiments, the dose may be from about I to about 20 mg/kg of body
weight or about 1 to about 10 mg/kg. In yet another embodiment, the dose may be from about 5
to about 20 mg/kg or about 10 to about 20 mg/kg of body weight.
         In other embodiments for the treatment of livestock animals such as cattle or sheep, doses
of the isoxazoline active agent administered may be about 0.1 to about 40 mg/kg of body weight.
More typically the doses administered will be about 1 to about 30 mg/kg, about 1 to about 20
mg/kg or about I to about 10 mg/kg of bodyweight. In yet another embodiment, the dose may be
from about 10 to about 25 mg/kg, about 15 to about 30 mg/kg of body weight or about 20-30
mg/kg of body weight.
         In one embodiment of the method of use in dogs or cats, the long-acting formulations of

Efficacy against fleas on Day 193, 24 hours after infestation, was 85.6%.
Example 21
         The efficacy      of a long-acting      injectable composition    of the invention   against
Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus in cattle was tested. Two groups of cattle were studied, a
non-treated control group and a test group treated with a long-acting injectable of the invention
comprising 15% (w/v) of Formula la in a carrier comprising a mixture of poloxomer 124 (QS)
and 20% (w/v) ethanol to deliver a dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight. Cattle in the treatment
group were treated on Day 0 with the long-acting injectable composition. Each animal was
infested with 5000 tick larvae on days 7, 21, and every 14 days thereafter. Adult ticks dropping
from each animal are collected daily from Day 1 until the end of the study. The efficacy of the
treatment is determined by collecting and counting the number of ticks dropping from each
animal and comparing with the number of ticks collected from the control group. The efficacy of
the long-acting composition was found to be about almost 100% for infestations conducted on
day 7, 21, 35, and 49; 95% at for infestations conducted at Day 63; and greater than 70% at for
infestations conducted at Day 91.
