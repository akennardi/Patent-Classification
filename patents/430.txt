                      METAL-COATED STEEL STRIP
             The present invention relates to the production
   of metal strip, typically steel strip, which has a
 5 corrosion-resistant metallic coating that contains
   aluminium-zinc-silicon-magnesium as the main elements,
   although not necessarily the only elements, in the coating
   alloy, and is hereinafter referred to as an "Al-Zn-Si-Mg
   alloy" on this basis.
10
             In particular, the present invention relates to a
   hot-dip coating method of forming a metallic coating on a
   strip that includes dipping uncoated strip into a bath of
   molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy and forming a coating of the
15 alloy on the strip.
             Typically, the composition of the molten Al-Zn
   Si-Mg alloy comprises the following ranges in % by weight
   of the elements Al, Zn, Si, and Mg:
20           Zn:         30 to 60%
             Si:         0.3 to 3%
             Mg:         0.3 to 10%
             Balance     Al and unavoidable impurities.
25           More typically, the composition of the molten
   Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy comprises the following ranges in % by
   weight of the elements Al, Zn, Si, and Mg:
             Zn:         35 to 50%
             Si:         1.2 to 2.5%
30           Mg           1.0 to 3.0%
             Balance     Al and unavoidable impurities.
             The composition of the molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   may contain other elements that are present in the molten
35 alloy as deliberate alloying additions or as unavoidable
   impurities.   Hence, the phrase "Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy" is
   understood herein to cover alloys that contain such other
                                              10371653_1 (GHMatters) P90355.AU.2 14/06/18

                               - 2
   elements as deliberate alloying additions or as
   unavoidable impurities.   The other elements may include by
   way of example any one or more of Fe, Sr, Cr, and V.
 5           Depending on the end-use application, the
   metallic coated strip may be painted, for example with a
   polymeric paint, on one or both surfaces of the strip.                        In
   this regard, the metallic coated strip may be sold as an
   end product itself or may have a paint coating applied to
10 one or both surfaces and be sold as a painted end product.
             The present invention relates particularly but
   not exclusively to steel strip that has a metallic coating
   formed from the above-described molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
15 composition and is also optionally coated with a paint and
   thereafter is cold formed  (e.g. by roll forming) into an
   end-use product, such as building products      (e.g. profiled
   wall and roofing sheets).
20           One corrosion resistant metal coating bath
   composition that is used widely in Australia and elsewhere
   for building products, particularly profiled wall and
   roofing sheets, is a 55%Al-Zn alloy coating composition
   that also contains Si.  The profiled sheets are usually
25 manufactured by cold forming painted, metal alloy coated
   strip.  Typically, the profiled sheets are manufactured by
   roll-forming the painted strip.
             The addition of Mg to this known composition of
30 55%Al-Zn-Si alloy coating composition has been proposed in
   the patent literature for a number of years, see for
   example US patent 6,635,359 in the name of Nippon Steel
   Corporation, but Al-Zn-Si-Mg coatings on steel strip are
   not commercially available in Australia.
35
             It has been established that when Mg is included
   in a 55%Al-Zn-Si alloy coating composition, Mg brings
                                             10371653_1 (GHMatters) P90355.AU.2 14/06/18

                               -   3
   about certain beneficial effects on product performance,
   such as improved cut-edge protection.
             The applicant has carried out extensive research
 5 and development work in relation to Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   coatings on strip such as steel strip.    The present
   invention is the result of part of this research and
   development work.
10           The above discussion is not to be taken as an
   admission of the common general knowledge in Australia and
   elsewhere.
             The present invention is based on a finding of
15 the applicant during the course of the research and
   development work that forming an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coating
   on a steel strip so that there is an intermediate alloy
   layer having a selected composition and preferably a
   selected crystal structure between an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
20 coating overlay layer and the steel strip can improve the
   corrosion performance of the coated strip.         The research
   and development work also found that the selected
   composition and preferred crystal structure of the
   intermediate alloy layer that can improve corrosion
25 performance of the coated strip   is not an inevitable
   outcome of the selection of the Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   composition for use in a hot dip coating bath, and a
   number of factors such as but not limited to molten Al-Zn
   Si-Mg alloy bath composition and hot dip process
30 conditions, typically strip immersion time and coating pot
   temperature, are relevant factors to forming the
   intermediate alloy layer having the required composition
   and the preferred crystal structure.

   provided a metallic coated steel strip that includes a
   steel strip and a metallic coating on at least one side of

10           With reference to the continuous production line
   for coating steel strip shown diagrammatically in Figure
   1, in use, coils of cold rolled low carbon steel strip are
   uncoiled at an uncoiling station 1 and successive uncoiled
   lengths of strip are welded end to end by a welder 2 and
15 form a continuous length of strip.
             The strip is then passed successively through an
   accumulator 3, a strip cleaning section 4 and a furnace
   assembly 5.  The furnace assembly 5 includes a preheater,
20 a preheat reducing furnace, and a reducing furnace.
             The strip is heat treated in the furnace assembly
   5 by control of process variables including:(i) the
   temperature profile in the furnaces,  (ii) the reducing gas
25 concentration in the furnaces,  (iii) the gas flow rate
   through the furnaces, and  (iv) strip residence time in the
   furnaces (i.e. line speed).
             The process variables in the furnace assembly 5
30 are controlled so that there is removal of iron oxide
   residues from the surface of the strip and removal of
   residual oils and iron fines from the surface of the
   strip.
35           The heat treated strip is then passed via an
   outlet snout downwardly into and through a molten bath
   containing an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy held in a coating pot 6
                                             10371653_1 (GHMatters) P90355.AU.2 14/06/18

   and is coated with molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy.          The Al-Zn
   Si-Mg alloy is maintained molten in the coating pot at a
   selected temperature by use of heating inductors             (not
   shown) or other suitable heating options.      Within the bath
 5 the strip passes around a sink roll  (not shown) positioned
   in the bath and is taken upwardly out of the bath.                  The
   line speed is selected to provide a selected immersion
   time of strip in the coating bath.  Both surfaces of the
   strip are coated with the molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy as it
10 passes through the bath.
             After leaving the coating bath 6 the strip passes
   vertically through a gas wiping station  (not shown) at
   which its coated surfaces are subjected to jets of wiping
15 gas to control the thickness of the coating.
             The coated strip is then passed through a cooling
   section 7 and subjected to forced cooling.
20           The cooled, coated strip is then passed through a
   rolling section 8 that conditions the surface of the
   coated strip.
             The coated strip is thereafter coiled at a
25 coiling station 10.
             As discussed above, the applicant has conducted
   extensive research and development work in relation to Al
   Zn-Si-Mg alloy coatings on steel strip and found that
30 forming a metallic coating that includes an overlay alloy
   layer and an intermediate alloy layer having a selected
   composition and preferably a selected crystal structure
   between the overlay alloy layer and the steel strip can
   improve the corrosion performance of the metallic coated
35 strip.

   carried out by hot dip coating steel strip samples with
   the following molten alloy compositions:          (a) a known Al
   Zn-Si alloy    (hereinafter referred to as "AZ"),              (b) an Al
 5 Zn-Si-Mg alloy      (hereinafter referred to as "MAZ") in
   accordance with the invention and (c) a MAZ alloy plus 0.1
   wt.% Cr in accordance with the invention, having the
   following molten alloy compositions, in wt.%:

               The molten alloys were coated onto exposed
   surfaces   of steel    strip   samples with a  double-sided
                                2             2
   coating mass of 125 g/m        and 150 g/m   . One group of
20 samples was produced on a metal coating line                ("MCL") at
   the Wollongong operations of the applicant and another
   group of samples was produced on a Hot Dip Process
   Simulator    ("HDPS") at research facilities of the applicant
   in Wollongong.       Experimental work was primarily conducted
25 on the HDPS.      The HDPS is a state-of-the-art unit purpose
   built to the specifications of the applicant by Iwatani
   International Corp (Europe) GmbH.          The HDPS unit comprises
   a molten metal pot furnace, an infrared heating furnace,
   gas wiping nozzles, de-drossing mechanisms, gas mixing and
30 dewpoint management functions, and computerized automatic
   control systems.       The HDPS unit is capable of simulating a

              It is evident from Figure 2 that the MAZ alloy
   coating samples had significantly longer Q-Fog lives and

   the AZ alloy coating sample, with the MAZ+0.1%Cr sample

   same metal coating line.    The SEM images show that the
   samples have different coating microstructures due to the
   presence of Mg in the MAZ alloy.       The SEM images also show
20 that the coating of both samples includes an overlay alloy
   layer 11 and an intermediate alloy layer 12            (referred to
   as an "Alloy layer" in this and other Figures) between the
   steel strip 13   (referred to as "Base steel" in the
   Figures) and the overlay layers 11.       The intermediate
25 alloy layer is an intermetallic layer formed from elements
   in the molten alloy bath    and the steel strip.              The graph
   shows that the MAZ alloy coating sample had a
   significantly longer Q-Fog life and therefore
   significantly better corrosion resistance than the AZ
30 alloy coating sample, possibly attributed to the presence
   of Al/Zn/MgZn2 eutectic  and Mg2Si phases     in     the
   microstructure of the MAZ alloy coating overlay, although
   the intermediate layer may have also contributed to the
   difference in corrosion performance.

   same molten alloy composition -     MAZ alloy.       One sample was
   produced on the metal coating line and the other sample
20 was produced on the Hot Dip Process Simulator.              Both
   samples had substantially the same coating thickness
   approximately 18 microns.     The graph shows that the HDPS
   MAZ125 alloy coating sample had a significantly longer Q
   Fog life and therefore significantly better corrosion
25 resistance than the MCL MAZ125 alloy coating sample.                        The
   SEM images show that the HDPS MAZ125 coating sample had a
   thicker intermediate alloy layer than the MCL MAZ125
   coating sample due to a longer immersion time             (2.5 seconds
   on the HDPS versus 1.0 second on the MCL).          Figure 4 is an
30 indication that the intermediate alloy layer 12
   contributed to the better corrosion resistance of the HDPS
   MAZ125 coating sample, i.e. a thicker intermediate alloy
   layer 12 produced a longer Q-Fog life.

   same coating thickness and substantially the same
   intermediate alloy layer thickness.      In effect, the only
20 difference between the samples is the 0.1% Cr in one of
   the samples.  It is evident from the graph that the Cr
   resulted in the HDPS MAZ125+0.1%Cr alloy coating sample
   having a significantly longer Q-Fog life and therefore
   significantly better corrosion resistance than the HDPS
25 MAZ125 alloy coating sample.      It is also evident from the
   SEM-EDS maps that there was a higher concentration of Cr
   in the intermediate alloy layer of the HDPS MAZ125+0.1%Cr
   alloy coating sample.    It follows that the Cr in the
   intermediate alloy layer of the HDPS MAZ125+0.1%Cr coating
30 sample contributed to the improved corrosion resistance of
   this sample.

   composition of the intermediate alloy layer or by virtue
   of the crystal structure of the intermediate alloy layer.
             This work identified the following composition
 5 range of the intermediate alloy layer, by weight, that
   offers the optimum Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coating corrosion
   performance:
        Zn   4.0-12.0%,
        Si   6.0-17.0%,

        Mg   0.02-0.50%,
        Balance   Al and unavoidable impurities.
             The corrosion performance of the Al-Zn-Si-Mg
15 alloy coating is inferior outside the above composition
   range of the intermediate alloy layer of the coating.
             The above composition range of the intermediate
   alloy layer was determined by extensive testing (including
20 but not limited to, coating corrosion through Q-Fog test
   and outdoor exposure, coating ductility through T bend
   tests etc) of Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coatings on steel samples
   with molten alloy bath compositions across the ranges of
   AZ + 0-5.0%Si, 0-5.0%Mg, 0-0.1%Cr, 0-0.4%Mn, 0-0.1%V, and
25 0-0.1%Ca at strip immersion times of 0.3-20 seconds and
   pot temperatures of 595-640 0 C to identify samples that
   delivered desirable performances. A wide range of
   analytical techniques were employed to   (a) study the
   chemical compositions, thicknesses and crystal structures
30 of the intermediate alloy layers and (b) develop an
   understanding of critical properties of the intermediate
   alloy layer that contribute to the performances of the
   final coated product.  Figures 2-9 are a sample of the
   results of this research and development work.

             The research and development work also found that
   the above composition range of the intermediate alloy
                                              10371653_1 (GHMatters) P90355.AU.2 14/06/18

   layer is not an inevitable outcome of the selection of the
   molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy bath composition and that factors
   such as but not limited to molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   composition and hot dip process conditions, typically
 5 strip immersion time and coating pot temperature, are
   relevant factors to forming an intermediate alloy layer
   having a required composition. In particular, although it
   may not necessarily be obvious to a person skilled in the
   art, the chemical compositions, thicknesses and crystal
10 structures of the intermediate alloy layers illustrated in
   the Figures are interrelated and contribute to the
   performance of the coated strip as a whole.
               Figures 6 is a graph showing the effect of
15 coating pot temperature on the compositions of the
   intermediate alloy layers and, in turn, on the Q-Fog mass
   losses, of two Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coatings.            Samples were
   prepared at two different pot temperatures, 600 0 C and
   620 0 C respectively, using the same molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg
20 alloy in the coating bath and the same immersion time                        (1
   second).    The coated samples were analysed to determine
   the compositions of the intermediate alloy layers.                      The
   intermediate alloy compositions are set out in the table
   below the bar graph in Figure 6.       The thicknesses of the
25 intermediate alloy layers are also presented in the table.
   The samples were subjected to the same Q-Fog corrosion
   test procedure.    Figure 6 shows that the 610 0 C and 620 0 C
   pot temperatures produced different intermediate alloy
   layer compositions.    At 620 0 C pot temperature the
30 intermediate alloy layer composition was outside the
   invention composition range      (Si<6% in particular).                 As a
   result, the corrosion performance of the Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   coating suffers, despite a greater intermediate alloy
   layer thickness, which would otherwise have been
35 advantageous if the composition of the intermediate alloy
   layer was the same as that at 600 0 C pot temperature                    (or
   within the invention range).       The compositions of the
                                                 10371653_1 (GHMatters) P90355.AU.2 14/06/18

   intermediate alloy layers were analysed using an
   inductively-coupled plasma spectrometry        (ICP) technique.
   In accordance with this technique, firstly the Al-Zn-Si-Mg
   alloy coating overlay was removed by submerging the sample
 5 in a 1:9 aqueous HCl solution inhibited by sodium arsenite
    (9g per litre).   The intermediate alloy layer was then
   dissolved using a RODINEO inhibited HCl solution and the
   resultant solution was analysed by ICP.

   alloy layers of samples of metallic coated steel strip
   obtained under the same hot dip process conditions                      (1

   accordance with the invention versus concentrations of Mg
15 and Si in coating baths of an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy used to
   form the coatings on the samples.      Figure 7 shows that the
   mass of the intermediate alloy layer decreased with
   increasing Mg and Si concentrations in coating baths.

   intermediate alloy layers of samples of metal coated strip
   in accordance with the invention versus immersion time in

   on the samples.    Figure 8 presents the results of work on
25 3 different molten alloy bath compositions.              One molten
   alloy is a known Al-Zn-Si alloy     (the "AZ" alloy in the
   Figure).    Another molten alloy is an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   that also includes Ca in accordance with the invention
    (the "AMCa  alloy in the Figure").    The  3 rd  molten alloy                   is
30 a known Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy having 5.0% Mg and 4.0% Si                        (the
   "5.0%Mg4.0%Si" alloy in the Figure).       Figure 8 shows that
   the molten alloy bath composition and the immersion time
   in the molten alloy bath have an impact on the thickness
   of the intermediate alloy layer of coated steel strip.

               Figure 9 is a graph of the thicknesses of
   intermediate alloy layers of coatings of metallic coated
                                                  10371653_1 (GHMatters) P90355.AU.2 14/06/18

   strip samples in accordance with the invention versus the
   thicknesses of the overlay alloy layers of the coatings on
   the samples.   Figure 9 shows that the intermediate alloy
   layer thickness increased with the overlay alloy layer
 5 thickness.   It follows from Figure 9 that it is therefore
   desirable to minimize any coating mass variation across
   the surface of the entire coated strip to maintain uniform
   corrosion performance.
10           Apart from the direct contribution of the
   intermediate alloy layer to the corrosion performance of
   the Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coating by virtue of the composition
   and/or thickness of the intermediate alloy layer, the
   applicant has also found that the crystal structure of the
15 intermediate alloy layer can have an indirect impact on
   the corrosion performance of the overall MAZ alloy coating
   by way of cracking.   The applicant has found that the
   intermediate alloy layer is one significant source of
   crack initiation when the Al-Zn-Mg-Si alloy coated strip
20 is subjected to high strain operations such as roll
   forming.   Coarse intermediate alloy layer crystal
   structures result in wider and more numerous cracks
   penetrating through the overlay alloy layer of the coating
   and the corrosion performance of the Al-Zn-Mg-Si alloy
25 coated strip will suffer.     Although the intermediate alloy
   layer can include equiaxial, columnar or a mixture of
   equiaxial and columnar crystals, to minimise cracking, it
   is desirable to control the size of columnar crystals to
   be no more than 1000nm in a short diameter as measured on
30 a cross section through the thickness of the coating,
   and/or the size of equiaxial crystals to be no more than
   4000nm in a long diameter as measured on a cross section
   through the thickness of the coating.
35           Although, from the corrosion performance point of
   view, it is desirable to have the presence of a
   substantial intermediate alloy layer    (or no thinner than
                                               10371653_1 (GHMatters) P90355.AU.2 14/06/18

                               - 20
   0.1 pm), it is disadvantageous if the intermediate alloy
   layer is too thick  (or thicker than 5 pm),    as this induce
   cracking and impair the roll formability of the coated
   strip.

             Many modifications may be made to the present
   invention described above without departing from the
   spirit and scope of the invention.
