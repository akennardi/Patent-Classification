                                   BACKGROUND
[0002] Levulinic acid, or 4-oxopentanoic acid, is an organic compound with the
formula CH 3 C(O)CH 2CH 2 CO 2H.    It is a keto acid.     Levulinic acid is typically
prepared chemically, for example, by heating sucrose with concentrated hydrochloric
acid. The process proceeds via the intermediacy of glucose, which is isomerized to
fructose and then hydroxymethylfurfural.
[0003] Levulinic acid is a potential precursor to nylon-like polymers, synthetic
rubbers, and plastics. Levulinic acid is a versatile synthetic intermediate, e.g., in the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals, and is a precursor in the industrial production of other
chemical commodities such as methyltetrahydrofuran, valerolactone, and ethyl
levulinate.
                          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0004] In certain aspects and embodiments, the invention provides a chemical
pathway for the conversion of pyruvate obtained from sugars or other carbon sources,
to valuable C5 materials such as levulinic acid. Exemplary C5 compounds are shown
in Figure 1 and 2. When used with sugars as a carbon source, the key to the pathway
is to convert C6 sugars (such as, but not limited, to glucose, fructose, galactose)
and/or C5 sugars (such as, but not limited to, xylose, arabinose) into pyruvate, and
subsequently convert pyruvate into one or several valuable C5 compounds through
chemical or biochemical aldol addition, oxidation, reduction, dehydration and
                                           1

WO 2012/030860                                                                PCT/US2011/049788
cyclization reactions. When used with another carbon source such as, but not limited
to, fatty acids and glycerol, the carbon source is first converted into pyruvate, and
subsequently converted to one or several valuable C5 compounds, which include
linear C5 keto acids or esters or cyclized derivatives thereof of the following general
formula: C5 C4 (X)C 3 C2 (Y)C 1 (=0)(Z), where X is either a hydroxyl or ketone oxygen,
Y is either a hydrogen, a hydroxyl or ketone oxygen, the bond between the C3 and C2
carbons is either single of double (e.g. saturated or unsaturated) and Z is an alkoxy,
sulfide or phenoxy group as to make either an ester, thioester or carboxylic acid
functional        group.         In    some    embodiments,      the   C5      compound      is
C 5 C4 (0 1)C 3 C 2 (Y)C 1(=0)(0 1 ), wherein the indice "01" denotes the same oxygen atom
such that there is a cyclic ester, or lactone formed, and Y is either a hydrogen or a
hydroxyl or ketone oxygen. All other atomic valences, or bonds, are assumed to be
hydrogen atoms unless otherwise denoted above.
[0005] In one aspect, the invention provides a method for making a compound that
is a C5 keto acid or ester, or a C5 hydroxy acid or ester, or cyclic derivative
thereof. The method comprises converting pyruvate to a C5 intermediate by
aldol addition, and converting the C5 intermediate to said compound through
chemical or enzymatic steps or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments,
the     C5    compound        has    the general    formula  C5 C4 (X)C3 C 2 (Y)C 1 (=0)(Z) or
C 5 C4 (0 1 )C 3 C2 (Y)C 1 (=0)(0 1 ) as described above.     In certain embodiments, the
compound is prepared from 5-carbon and/or 6-carbon sugars or feedstock suitable as
carbon source for a microbial host. In these embodiments, the method comprises
formation of pyruvate from the sugar or feedstock (e.g., by the microbial host), and
aldol addition of acetylaldehyde to the pyruvate (e.g., in the microbial host or in a
cell-free system), to thereby prepare a 5-carbon keto acid as an intermediate for the
preparation of the desired C5 compound. Acetylaldehyde for aldol addition may be
prepared by decarboxylation of pyruvate in the microbial host. The aldol addition
product may be further subjected to one or more reduction, oxidation, dehydration,
group transfer, hydrolysis and/or lactonization reactions (e.g., each independently in
the microbial host or cell free system) to prepare the desired C5 product.

WO 2012/030860                                                         PCT/US2011/049788
[0006] Such products may be used as building blocks to prepare commercially
valuable chemicals and fuels.     For example, lactones such as 2-oxo-valerolactone
(compound L7 in Fig. 2), 2-hydroxy-valerolactone (compound L6 in Fig. 2), angelica
lactones (compound L2, L3 and L10 in Fig. 2) and 4-valerolactone (y-valerolactone,
compound L1 in Fig.2) can be used as solvents. Angelica lactone and 4-valerolactone
can also be converted chemically to methylene methyl butyrolactone (MeMBL) (see
for example WO/2006/015023,         WO/2006/015024 for methods to catalyze this
conversion).     Methylene methyl butyrolactone can be used as a monomer or
copolymer to increase the thermal tolerance of polymethylacrylate (PMMA) polymers
used widely in electronics and automotive applications, or to manufacture polymers
altogether (such as Poly(MeMBL), see for instance WO/2005/028529).           In addition,
4-valerolactone can be converted using chemical catalysis to valeric acid and further
valerate esters, as well as isomeric butenes, butadiene and other alkenes, including
alkenes of eight carbons or more, as reviewed in Bozell J., Connecting Biomass and
petroleum Processing with a chemical bridge, Science 329:522-523 (2010). Levulinic
Acid (compound P1 in Fig. 1) can be converted to 1,4 pentanediol and diphenolic
acid, both of which can be used to manufacture polymers. 6-amminolevulinic acid (a
derivative from Levulinic Acid) is a herbicide with an estimate market in excess of
300 pounds per year. Further still, Levulinic Acid can be converted to pyrrolidones
(WO/2004/085048),                                                          pyrrolidinone
(WO/2010/065833,WO/2004/085390,WO/2004/085349,WO/2004/084633),                   angelica
lactone (WO/2005/097723),       4-valerolactone and 2-methyl-THF, which are end
products or can be further transformed into other compounds with various utilities
such as anionic liquids (WO/2010/065833), biofuels and fuel additives.         Levulinic
Acid can further be employed as a material for batteries (e.g. JP09190820), inks (US
5,769,929), coatings (JP06280041), anti-corrosion coatings (EP496555) Levulinic
esters (or levulinate esters, compounds P9 in Fig. 1) are polymer building blocks by
themselves and after transformation to ketals (US 2008/0242721) and can also be
used as fuel additives (as described in US Patent 7,153,996, which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety). In addition, levulinic esters can be used in
personal care products (e.g. Japanese patent JP 05320023), surfactants and lubricants
(EP882745), absorbents (see WO/1998/9843684).             All references cited in this
paragraph are hereby incorporated by reference.

WO 2012/030860                                                        PCT/US2011/049788
[0007] Both levulinic acid, levulinic esters, and some of the lactones listed in Fig. 2
can also be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically active ingredients, and
pharmaceutical applications, some of which being listed in Bozell J., Production of
levulinic acid and use as a platform chemical for derived products, Resources,
Conservation and Recycling 28:227-239 (2000).         For instance, WO/1995/022524
         reports the use of levulinate methyl ester for the synthesis of novel indole
derivatives used as anti-cancer agents. Levulinic acid and 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid
can also by used a chiral reagent, with a wide array of potential applications (see for
example Meyers et al., Stereoselective alkylations in rigid systems. Effect of remote
substituents on p-facial additions to lactam enolates. Stereoelectronic and steric
effects, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120:7429-7438 (1998). Pharmaceutical applications of the
C5 produced by the invention may include the use of butyro- and valero-lactone
derivatives as antibiotic and anti-biofilms agents through there interference with the
quorum sensing molecular mechanism in bacteria (see for instance EP 1716131 and
WO/2006/117113).       Additional uses may derive from the biologically active proto
anemonin (compound L4 in Fig. 2). Finally, Levulinic Acid and esters have been
used for food, flavor and fragrances (EP1533364) as well as additives in numerous
consumer products. For example, Levulinic Acid is used as an additive in cigarettes
(WO/2010/051076).       All references in this paragraph are hereby incorporated by
reference.
[0008] In certain embodiments of the invention, the method comprises converting
pyruvate into 4-valerolactone.      In another embodiment, the method comprises
converting pyruvate into levulinic acid.        In another embodiment, the method
comprises converting pyruvate into levulinic esters (levulinates) such as, but not
limited to, ethyl levulinate and propyl levulinate. In another alternative embodiment
of the invention, the method comprises converting pyruvate into angelica lactone,
alpha- and alpha'- angelica lactones.       In still other embodiments, the method
comprises converting pyruvate into 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid or its cyclized form,
2-hydroxy-4-valerolactone.      In yet another embodiment, the method comprises
converting pyruvate into 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid or its cyclized form, 2-oxo
4-valerolactone.

WO 2012/030860                                                        PCT/US2011/049788
In some embodiments of the invention, the method comprises multiple enzymatic
steps integrated into a single metabolic pathway in a eukaryotic, prokaryotic or
archaea fermentation host, including but not limited to Saccharamyces sp., Pichia sp.,
Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., Chrysosporiumsp., and Escherichiacoli. In these and
other embodiments, the method involves one or more enzymatic steps carried out in a
cell-free system, or chemical catalysis steps, or a combination thereof, the various
intermediates in the pathway being optionally separated and/or purified from the
fermentation broth as necessary to complete the process.
[0009] An advantage of certain embodiments of the invention is that it builds on top
of central metabolism. For instance, both C5 and C6 metabolism in eukaryotes,
prokaryotes and archea can employ glycolysis to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate is one
of the most important intermediates of central metabolism, and in addition to
glycolysis can be obtained from lipid metabolism as well as amino-acid metabolism.
The method of the invention takes pyruvate, and converts two molecules of pyruvate
into one C5 molecule such as levulinic acid and 4-valerolactone. In the case of C6
sugars the carbon yield can be up to 80%. In the case of C5 sugars the carbon yield
can be theoretically up to 100%. If the method employs a microbial strain capable of
simultaneously fermenting C5 and C6 such as, but not limited to, engineered
Saccharomyces Cerevisae and Pichia Stipitis, it allows the direct fermentation of
sugars to levulinic acid, 4-valerolactone or any of the C5 compounds depicted in Fig.
1 and Fig. 2. This high achievable yield presents a decisive industrial advantage when
compared to alternative thermochemical methods of obtaining levulinic acid or
gamma-valerolactone which typically produce molar yields of 40% or less.
[0010] In one embodiment of the invention, the method converts a stream of sugars
into one or several of the C5 compounds listed in Figure 1 and 2.            In another
embodiment, starch is used as feedstock for the process. In another embodiment, the
method converts lignocellulosic feedstock (including, but not limited to, corn stover,
wood chips, municipal waste, Pulp and Paper mill sludge) into at least one of the C5
compounds listed in Figure 1 and 2.
[0011] In one embodiment of the invention, the method converts C6 sugars into one
or several of the C5 compounds listed in Figure 1 and 2, preferably in fermentation
                                            5

strains highly efficient at uptake and fermentation of C6 sugars, such as, but not
limited to, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cargill's CB1           strain (as described in
WO/2007/106524), Pseudomonas, Chrysosporium and Escherichia coli (E.coli). In
another embodiment of the invention, the method converts C5 sugars to one or several
of the C5 compounds listed in Figure 1 and 2, preferably in fermentation strains
highly efficient at uptake and fermentation of C5 sugars, such as, but not limited to,
engineered Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis. In an embodiment of the
invention, the method simultaneously converts C5           and C6 sugars to the C5
compound,     preferably in fermentation strains highly efficient at uptake and
fermentation of both C5 and C6 sugars (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In another
embodiment of the invention, the fermentation strains show high level of tolerance to
biomass hydrolysate inhibitors such as, but not limited to, furans and to low pH or
high organic acid titer media.
[0012] In certain embodiments, the feedstock comprises one or more C6 sugars
selected from allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, talose, galactose,
fructose, psicose, sorbose, and tagatose. In these or other embodiments, the feedstock
comprises one or more C5 sugars selected from xylose, arabinose, ribose, lyxose,
xylulose, and ribulose.
[0013] When the method of the invention is used to convert C5 and C6 sugars to 4
hydroxy-pentanoic acid or 4-valerolactone, the pathway is designed to be redox
(reduction-oxidation) balanced: two reducing equivalents (formation of NAD(P)H)
are produced during glycolysis to yield pyruvate (one glucose molecule to two
pyruvate molecules) and two reducing equivalents are consumed (formation of
NAD(P)) by the downstream process from pyruvate to 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid or 4
valerolactone (y-valerolactone). The fact that this pathway is redox balanced for the
production of these two molecules will result in optimized conversion in the case of
fermentation process, and reduce or remove the need to further engineer the
fermentation host to counter inbalance. For the fermentation of sugars directly to all
the other compounds or building blocks (Fig. 1), the fermentation host will rely on
separate side reactions to balance the pathway or an external source of redox
equivalent suitable to balance the pathway.

                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0023] In certain aspects and embodiments, the invention provides a chemical
pathway for the conversion of pyruvate obtained from sugars or other carbon sources,
to valuable C5 materials such as levulinic acid.     Conceptually, the method of the
invention provides a pathway that is organized in at least two steps, and in some
embodiments, from 4 to 8 steps, such as 7 to 8 steps (see the core 8 steps depicted in
Fig. 3), with up to 4 additional cyclization steps of intermediates obtained along the
pathway. Attachment of the intermediate at multiple stages to a Co-enzyme A (CoA)
moiety allows the pathway to lead to CoA intermediates such as levulinyl-CoA (see
Fig. 6). In addition, four optional steps can lead to the cyclized variants of the key
intermediates in the pathway (see again Fig. 6).
[0024] According to various embodiments, a first step is glycolysis, which converts
sugars (such as from biomass) to pyruvate, or alternatively any chemical conversion
from sugars to pyruvate. A second step converts two molecules of pyruvate into one
molecule of 4-hydroxy 2-oxo-pentanoic acid and CO 2 . An optional cyclization step
produces the corresponding lactone, 2-oxo-4-valerolactone.          An optional CoA
attachment step can lead to 4-hydroxy-2-oxo pentanoyl-CoA. A third step reduces 4
hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid into 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid, or 4-hydroxy-2-oxo
pentanoyl-CoA to 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoyl-CoA,         or 2-oxo-4-valerolactone to 2

WO 2012/030860                                                        PCT/US2011/049788
hydroxy-4-valerolactone.     An optional cyclization step produces the corresponding
lactone, 2-hydroxy-4-valerolactone, from either 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid or 2,4
dihydroxy-pentanoyl-CoA. An optional CoA attachment step leads to 2,4-dihydroxy
pentanoyl-CoA from 2,4-dihydroxy pentanoic acid.           A fourth step oxidizes 2,4
dihydroxy-pentanoic    acid to 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentanoic acid, or 2,4-dihydroxy
pentanoyl-CoA to 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentanoyl-CoA.          An optional CoA attachment
step converts 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentanoic acid to 2-hydroxy-4-oxo pentanoyl-CoA. A
fifth step dehydrates 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentanoic acid to 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid, or 2
hydroxy-4-oxo-pentanoyl-CoA        to  4-oxo-2-pentenoyl-CoA.       An optional CoA
attachment step converts 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid to 4-oxo-2-pentenoyl-CoA. An
optional step reduces further 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-2-pentenoic acid,
or 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid to 4-hydroxy-2-pentenoyl-CoA, both of which can be
optionally cyclized to produce angelica lactone. Another optional CoA attachment
step leads to 4-hydroxy-2-pentenoyl-CoA from 4-hydroxy-2-pentenoic acid, which
again can be optionally cyclized to produce angelica lactone.           An alternative
embodiment of the invention "collapses" the fourth and fifth step into one single step.
A sixth step yields levulinic acid (4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid) through the reduction of
4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid in a similar manner as aboce. An optional step attaches
coenzyme A (CoA) to levulinic acid leading to levulinyl-CoA. Levulinyl-CoA can
then be transformed into a variety of levulinic esters through the use of a transferase
reacting with the appropriate alcohol. In some embodiments, a seventh step further
reduces levulinic acid to produce 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid. An eighth step cyclizes
4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid to yield 4-valerolactone.
[0025] In certain embodiments, steps 4 and 5 can be carried out in a single
transformation, an oxidative dehydration. In another embodiment of the invention,
steps 3 and 4 are reversed in order so that 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-pentanoic acid is first
oxidized into 2,4-dioxo-pentanoic acid, and further reduced to 2-oxo-4-hydroxy
pentanoic acid, so that the pathway of Fig. 3 becomes the one represented in Fig. 4.
[0026] In another embodiment of the invention, steps 3, 5 and 6 (Fig. 3) are carried
out directly on the respective lactones L1, L2, L6, L7, L8, L9 and L10, where the
branching    from   linear   intermediates  produced    initially from  pyruvate     and
acetaldehyde occurs at any one of the cyclization steps described in Figure 6. This

embodiment of the invention can be used either to obtain lactones directly, or, after
hydrolysis, to obtain back any of the compounds P1 to P16 (including levulinic acid).
[0027] In yet another aspect of the invention, steps 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (Fig. 3) are carried
out on the CoA intermediates, where the branching from linear intermediates
produced initially from pyruvate and acetaldehyde occur at any one of the CoA
attachment steps described in paragraph Figure 6. This embodiment of the invention
can be used to obtain any of the compounds P1 to P16 (including levulinic acid)
through the use of thioesterases. Levulinic esters (P9) can be obtained from levulinyl
CoA and the appropriate alcohol by the use of a transferase.
Step 1: conversion of sugars to pyruvate
[0028] The conversion of sugars to pyruvate is part of the well-studied metabolic
pathway, glycolysis.    In glycolysis, the action of multiple enzymes results in the
conversion of each molecule of C6 sugar such as glucose to two molecules of
pyruvate, two molecules of ATP and two reducing equivalent in the form of two
NAD(P)H molecules.
[0029] In one embodiment of the invention, pyruvate is obtained from glycolysis in a
fermentation organism and subsequently used in the downstream pathway in the
fermentation host.    In an alternative embodiment, pyruvate is separated from the
fermentation broth and subsequently processed according to the downstream pathway.
Step 2: conversion ofpyruvate to 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid
[0030] 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid can be produced by the aldol addition of
acetaldehyde (an aldehyde) to pyruvate (an a keto-acid).        The addition reacts one
equivalent of acetaldehyde with one equivalent of pyruvate. Acetyladehyde can be
obtained in various ways. For example, pyruvate decarboxylase catalyzes the non
oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde. Pyruvate decarboxylase from
multiple eukaryotic or prokaryotic sources (e.g. Saccharomcyes cerevisiae) can
therefore be used. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, acetyladehyde is
produced from pyruvate with the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase.
                                           11

WO 2012/030860                                                      PCT/US2011/049788
[0031] Multiple aldolase have been isolated that have been shown to catalyze the
aldol addition between pyruvate and acetaldehyde. A class I aldolase, 4-hydroxy-2
keto- pentanoic acid aldolase (HKP aldolase) is an aldolase employing a Schiff base
lysine and catalyzes the forward and reverse reaction. In one embodiment of the
invention, the aldol addition between pyruvate and acetaldehyde is catalyzed by HKP
aldolase from E. coli described in Pollard, JR et al., Substrate selectivity and
biochemical properties of 4-hydroxy-2-keto-pentanoic acid aldolase from E. Coli,
Apple. And Environ. Microbiology, 64(10):4093-4094 (1998), or a homolog thereof, or
mutants thereof (those mutants optionally being obtained by protein engineering using
computational design, directed evolution techniques or rational mutagenesis, or a
combination thereof). Computational design techniques are disclosed in US 2009
0191607 and WO 2010/077470, which are hereby incorporated by reference in its
entirety.
[0032] There are at least two class II aldolases known to catalyze the addition
between pyruvate and acetaldehyde, and two (BphI and HpaI) have been
characterized in some level of detail in Wang W et al., Comparison of two metal
dependent pyruvate aldolases related by convergent evolution: substrate specificity,
kinetic mechanism and substrate channeling, Biochemistry, 49:3774-3782 (2010).
These enzymes employ a metal co-factor (either Zn or Mn are common). BphI and
HpaI share no detectable sequence similarity. Whereas BphI is stereoselective and
leads to the 4S adduct, HpaI, due to its very open active site, produces a racemic
mixture (4R and 4S adducts). BphI is allosterically coupled to BphJ, an acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase, and is not active and stable when expressed in isolation.         HpaI
however, is expressable in E. coli by itself and shows activity.      In an alternate
embodiment of the invention, the aldol addition between pyruvate and acetaldehyde is
catalyzed by HpaI or BphI, or mutants thereof (those mutants optionally being
obtained by protein engineering using computational design, directed evolution
techniques or rational mutagenesis, or a combination of the three).
[0033] As an extension, any suitable pyruvate aldolase and other similar aldolases
(e.g. KDPG aldolase) catalyzing the aldol addition of an aldehyde to a ketone can
conceivably be reengineered to catalyze the aldol addition of acetaldehyde to
                                          12

WO 2012/030860                                                          PCT/US2011/049788
pyruvate.   The redesign may include, but is not limited to, achieving the desired
substrate specificity for both pyruvate and acetaldehyde, controlling the desired
stereoselectivity to produce either a racemic or enantiopure adducts ((R)4-hydroxy-2
oxo-pentanoic acid and (S)4-hydroxy-3-oxo-pentanoic acid), stabilizing the enzyme
to obtain the desired catalytic activity in the industrial conditions in which the
invention is practiced (e.g. thermostabilization or stabilization in higher organic titer),
and/or improving the enzyme expressability and solubility in the context of the
industrial conditions in which the invention is practiced (e.g. in a metabolic pathway
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In another embodiment of the invention, the aldol
addition between pyruvate and acetaldehyde is catalyzed by pyruvate aldolase, or any
homologs and mutants thereof (those mutants optionally being obtained by protein
engineering using computational design, directed evolution techniques or rational
mutagenesis, or a combination of the three).
[0034] Finally, using the technique of de novo enzyme design such as the one
described in Zanghellini, A et al, New Algorithms and an in silico Benchmark for
Computational Enzyme Design, Protein Science 15:2785-2794 (2006), it is possible
to design new aldolase enzymes for substrates that may or may not exist in nature.
Up to 70 such aldolases have been designed de novo as described in US 2009
0191607, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The application of
this methodology to the substrates pyruvate and acetaldehyde can lead to aldolases
with the desired activity. In another embodiment of the invention, the aldol addition
between pyruvate and acetaldehyde is catalyzed by a de novo designed aldolase.
Step 2': cyclization of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid to 2-oxo-4-valerolactone
[0035] 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid is cyclized into 2-hydroxy-4-valerolactone
(compound L7 in Figure 1).         In acidic to neutral solutions, the thermodynamical
equilibrium lies towards the cyclization to the lactone. The cyclization to the lactone
can be kinetically enhanced by the use of either chemical or biochemical catalysis.
Homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for lactonization include strong acid
conditions    (e.g.  sulfuric  acid),  metal   catalysts  (e.g.  palladium, rhubidium).
Biochemical catalysis can be obtained by the action of lipases, esterases, proteases
                                            13

WO 2012/030860                                                        PCT/US2011/049788
and lactonases under conditions that favor the forward lactonization reaction (low to
neutral pH / high organic solvent titer) as demonstrated for example in Martin CH, et
al, Integrated bioprocessing for pH-dependent of 4-valerolactone from levulinate in
Pseudomonas Putida KT2440, Appl. and Environ, Microbiology 76(2):417-424.
[0036] In one embodiment of the invention, 2-oxo-4-valerolactone is produced from
4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid, in the presence of a catalyst, after separation of 4
hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid from the fermentation broth or cell-free solution. In
another embodiment of the invention, the lactonization of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic
acid to 2-oxo-4-valerolactone is catalyzed directly by a lipase or esterase or protease
or lactonase, or mutants thereof (those mutants being optionally obtained by protein
engineering using computational design, directed evolution techniques, rational
mutagenesis, or a combination of the three).
Step 3: reduction of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid to 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid
[0037] Among the wide variety of natural dehydrogenases,              in silico and/or
experimental screening can select dehydrogenases with substrate specificity that
tolerates 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid and 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid.             In
addition, computational design, directed evolution techniques or rational mutagenesis,
or a combination of the three, can be used to alter or increase the substrate specificity
of existing dehydrogenase towards 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic             acid and 2,4
dihydroxy-pentanoic acid.      Examples of suitable dehydrogenase starting points
include L- and D-lactate dehydrogenases (NAD(P)H- or Heme-dependent, from
eukaryotic or bacterial origin), malate, aspartate and glutamate dehydrogenases
(NAD(P)H-dependent from eukaryotic or bacterial origin), as well as alcohol
dehydrogenases     (such   as    NAD(P)H-dependent        alkyl    or  phenyl    alcohol
dehydrogenases). Examples of such dehydrogenases are listed in the example section.
[0038] In one embodiment of the invention, 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid is
selectively   reduced to    2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic     acid    using  homogenous      or
heterogeneous chemical catalysis. 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid may or may not be
separated/purified from the fermentation or cell-free solution to complete this step.

WO 2012/030860                                                      PCT/US2011/049788
Preferably,   2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic     acid  is separated  from the    solution  or
fermentation broth before being subsequently subjected to said reduction.
[0039] In one embodiment of the invention, a NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase is
used to catalyze the reduction of the ketone at the 2 position in 4-hydroxy-2-oxo
pentanoic acid. In another embodiment, said dehydrogenase reduces the ketone with
a high degree of substrate specificity for 4-hydroxy-2-oxo pentanoic acid and high
regioselectively for the ketone at the 2 position. In one embodiment of the invention,
said dehydrogenase is not stereoselective and can accept both 4R and 4S enantiomers.
In another embodiment of the invention, said dehydrogenase reduces selectively
either the 4R or 4S enantiomeric form of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid.
[0040] In another embodiment of the invention, a FAD-dependent dehydrogenase is
used instead of a NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase, preferably with a high degree
of substrate and regioselectivity.      In one embodiment of the invention, said
dehydrogenase is not stereoselective and can accept both 4R and 4S enantiomers. In
another embodiment of the invention, said dehydrogenase reduces selectively either
the 4R or 4S enantiomeric form of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid.
[0041] In another embodiment of the invention, a FMN-dependent dehydrogenase is
used instead of a NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase, preferably with a high degree
of substrate and regioselectivity.      In one embodiment of the invention, said
dehydrogenase is not stereoselective and can accept both 4R and 4S enantiomers. In
another embodiment of the invention, said dehydrogenase reduces selectively either
the 4R or 4S enantiomeric form of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid.
[0042] In yet another embodiment of the invention, a ferricytochrome-dependent
dehydrogenase is used instead of a NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase, preferably
with a high degree of substrate and regioselectivity.      In one embodiment of the
invention, said dehydrogenase is not stereoselective and can accept both 4R and 4S
enantiomers.    In another embodiment of the invention, said dehydrogenase reduces
selectively either the 4R or 4S enantiomeric form of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid.

[0043] In   yet   another   embodiment    of the    invention,  a   quinone-dependant
dehydrogenase is used instead of a NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase, preferably
with a high degree of substrate and regioselectivity.      In one embodiment of the
invention, said dehydrogenase is not stereoselective and can accept both 4R and 4S
enantiomers.    In another embodiment of the invention, said dehydrogenase reduces
selectively either the 4R or 4S enantiomeric form of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid.
Step 3': cyclization of 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoicacid to 2-hydroxy 4-valerolactone
[0044] 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic     acid is cyclized into 2-hydroxy-4-valerolactone
(compound L6 in Figure 1).       In acidic to neutral solutions, the thermodynamical
equilibrium lies towards the cyclization to 4-valerolactone. The same remarks about
thermodynamic equilibrium and chemical and biochemical catalysis hold as described
above.
[0045] In one embodiment of the invention, 2-hydroxy-4-valerolactone is produced
from 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid, in the presence of a catalyst, after separation of
2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid from the fermentation broth or cell-free solution.     In
another embodiment of the invention, the lactonization of 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic
acid to 2-hydroxy-4-valerolactone is catalyzed directly by a lipase or esterase or
protease or lactonase, or mutants thereof (those mutants being obtained by protein
engineering using computational design, directed evolution techniques or rational
mutagenesis, or a combination of the three).
Step 4: oxidation of 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid to 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid
[0046] In one embodiment of the invention, 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic            acid is
selectively  oxidized to 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic       acid using homogenous      or
heterogeneous chemical catalysis. 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid may or may not be
separated/purified from the fermentation or cell-free solution to complete this step.
Preferably, 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic      acid is separated from the solution or
fermentation broth before being subsequently subjected to said oxidation.

[0047] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, an NAD(P)H-dependent
dehydrogenase is used to catalyze the oxidation of the hydroxyl at the 4 position in
2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid.      In a preferred embodiment, said dehydrogenase
oxidizes the hydroxyl with a high degree of substrate specificity for 2,4-dihydroxy
pentanoic acid and high regioselectively for the hydroxyl at the 4 position.
Preferably, said dehydrogenase accepts the four different enantiomers (2R4R, 2R4S,
2S4R, 2S4S) of 2,4-dihydroxy pentanoic acid. In an alternative embodiment, said
dehydrogenase     is oxidizing selectively either the 2R (2R4R, 2R4S)          or 2S
(2S4R,2S4S) enantiomers of 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid, whichever is the most

[0050] In yet another embodiment of the invention, a ferricytochrome-dependent

2S4S) enantiomers of 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid, whichever is the most abundant
enantiomer resulting from the reduction of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid.
[0051] In yet another      embodiment     of the invention, a     quinone-dependent
dehydrogenase is used to catalyze the oxidation of the hydroxyl at the 4 position in
2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid.     In a preferred embodiment, said dehydrogenase
oxidizes the hydroxyl with a high degree of substrate specificity for 2,4-dihydroxy

(2S4R,2S4S) enantiomers of 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid, whichever is the most
abundant enantiomer resulting from the reduction of 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic acid.
Step 5: dehydration of 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid to 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid
[0052] Classically, chemical dehydration is achieved with either homogeneous or
heterogeneous catalysis, such as temperature > 100 0 C, concentrated acid (4.OM
sulfuric acid) and/or metal oxide catalyst (zinc or aluminium oxides).         In one
embodiment of the invention, 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid obtained after the
reduction and oxidation steps is dehydrated chemically to 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid by
homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis.      4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid may or
may not be separated/purified from the fermentation or cell-free solution to complete
this step. Preferably, 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid is separated from the solution
or fermentation broth before being subjected to said dehydration.

WO 2012/030860                                                         PCT/US2011/049788
[0053] The dehydration of organic compounds can alternatively be catalyzed by a
dehydratase enzyme. Several classes of dehydratase have been characterized and rely
on different mechanisms: radical based mechanism such as in vitamin B 12-dependent
or SAM-dependent dehydratases (e.g. diol dehydratase, glycerol dehydratase), Lewis
acid mechanism such Iron-Sulfur containing dehydratases (e.g. dihydroxy-acid
dehydratase, aconitase) and enolate ion intermediate mechanism such as diacid
dehydratase (e.g. tartrate dehydratase). Whereas all mechanisms are applicable to the
dehydration of 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid, mechanisms relying on an enolate
intermediate are preferred because the formation of an enolate anion on the carbonyl
P to the hydroxyl being eliminated  lowers the pKa of the a-proton, thereby allowing it
to be readily abstracted by a general acid/base group. An additional general acid/base
group protonates the leaving water molecule. This mechanism is exploited by a wide
variety of natural dehydratases: Magnesium-dependent dehydratases from the enolase
superfamily, such as tartrate dehydratase, gluconate dehydratase, use this mechanism
for the dehydration of structurally diverse diacids with high substrate specificity, as
described for instance in Gerlt et al., Divergent evolution in the enolase superfamily:
the interplay   of mechanism and specificity, Biochemistry, 433:59-70           (2005).
Fumarase (also known as fumarate hydratase) catalyzes the enolate-based reversible
hydration of malate to fumarate. Enoyl dehydratase (also known as crotonase) uses
the enolate anion of a CoA thioester to catalyze the reversible hydration of various
CoA substrates (see for instance Holden et al., The Crotonase              Superfamily:
divergently related     enzymes that    catalyze   different reactions  involving   acyl
Coenzyme A thioesters, Acc. Chem. Res. 34:145-157.(2001))
[0054] In one embodiment of the invention, the dehydration of 4-oxo-2-hydroxy
pentanoic acid to 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid is catalyzed by a dehydratase. In a preferred
embodiment of the invention, said dehydratase uses an enolate intermediate to
catalyze the dehydration.    Preferably, said dehydratase is a member of the enolase
superfamily, fumarase or enoyl-coA dehydratase superfamilies, or mutants thereof
obtained by protein engineering.     In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said
dehydratase exhibits a high level of substrate specificity for 4-oxo-2-hydroxy
pentanoic acid. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, said dehydratase

dehydrates equally the 2R and 2S enantiomers of 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid. In
an alternative embodiment of the invention, said dehydratase dehydrates selectively
either the 2R or 2S enantiomer of 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid.
Alternative to Step 4 and 5:
[0055] Alternatively to a 2-step conversion of 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid to 4-oxo
2-pentenoic acid, a 1-step conversion can be achieved using an oxidative dehydration.
Oxidative dehydrations are common in the metabolism of sugars. The so-called 4,6
dehydratase    enzymes,   such as UDP-GlcNAc-inverting         4,6-dehydratase  which
structural details are described in Ishiyama et al., Structural studies of FlaA1 from
helicobacter pylori reveal the mechanism for inverting 4,6-dehydratase activity, J.
Bio. Chem. 281(34):24489-24495 (2006). In one embodiment of the invention, such a
4,6-dehydratase is used to catalyze the oxidative dehydration of 2,4-dihydroxy
pentanoic acid to 4-oxo-2-pentanoic acid. In one aspect of the invention, said 4,6
dehydratase is enantioselective and dehydrates preferably one of the enantiomers of
2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid (either 2R4R, 2R4S, 2S4R or 2S4S). In another aspect
of the invention, said 4,6-dehydratase is not enantioselective and dehydrates with
similar catalytic efficiency two or more of the enantiomers of 2,4-dihydroxy
pentanoic acid. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the 4,6-dehydratase is
highly active on 2,4-dihydroxy-pentanoic acid is obtained from a natural 4,6
dehydratase by protein engineering using computational design, directed evolution
techniques or rational mutagenesis, or a combination thereof.
Step 6: reduction of 4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid to 4-oxo-pentanoic acid (levulinic acid)
[0056] Double bonds on substituted alkenes can be reduced (hydrogenated) to obtain
the corresponding saturated alkanes.      Substituted alkenes can be reduced using
chemical catalysis or, generally asymmetrically, using biocatalysts such as enoate
reductases as reviewed in Stuermer et al., Asymmetric bioreduction of activated C=C
bonds using enoate reductases from the old yellow enzyme family, Curr. Opin. In
Chem. Bio. 11:203-213 (2007). Enoate reductases have been characterized from both
eukaryotic, such as Sacharomyces cerevisiae and Marchantia and prokaryotic
organisms, such as Clostridium.        The family of enoate reductase enzymes is
                                          20

WO 2012/030860                                                         PCT/US2011/049788
dependent on a flavin cofactor (FMN) that gets oxidized at each turnover of the
enzyme. Except for one known case, which is nicotinamide-independent, the flavin
cofactor is in turned reduced by a nicotinamide cofactor, either NADH or NADPH,
that also binds in the active site. Upon completion of one turnover, the substrate has
been reduced whereas the cofactor NAD(P)H has been oxidized to NAD(P)+. Enoate
reductases differ in their substrate specificity.    However, several enoate reductases
such as yeast and Clostridium enoate reductases have a broad substrate specificity and
can accommodate linear substituted alkenes (with acids or ketone functional groups)
as well as substituted lactones such as 4-valerolactone.
[0057] In one embodiment of the invention, 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic             acid is
separated from the separation broth or cell-free solution and the double bond
selectively reduced using homogenous or heterogeneous catalysis.
[0058] In another embodiment of the invention, an enoate reductase enzyme is used
to reduce 4-hydroxy-2-oxo-pentanoic          acid into levulinic acid.   In a preferred
embodiment, said enoate reductase is dependent on both FMNH2 and NAD(P)H
cofactors, said NAD(P)H cofactor being used in the active site to regenerate FMNH2
to its oxidoreduction state before catalysis.        In a preferred embodiment of the
invention, said enoate reductase is cloned and expressed in the fermentation host. In a
alternative embodiment, said enoate reductase is used extracellularly, or in a cell-free
system with an adequate cofactor regeneration system.             In another alternative
embodiment, said reduction is catalyzed by a whole cell catalyst expressing one or
several enoate reductases, such that said cell is different from the fermentation host
cell(s) in which part or the totality of the pathway is used.
Step 7: reduction of 4-oxo-pentanoic acid (levulinic acid) to 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid
[0059] Similarly to step 3 (paragraphs [0037] to [0043]), the reduction of the ketone
at the 4 position on levulinic acid can be achieved either by chemical catalysis means
or by the use of a dehydrogenase biocatalyst. In the context of a metabolic pathway,
this last reduction (and corresponding oxidation of one reducing equivalent) ensures
the redox balance of the whole pathway from C5 and/or C6 sugars.
                                              21

WO 2012/030860                                                          PCT/US2011/049788
[0060] In one embodiment of the invention, levulinic acid is separated from the broth
or cell-free solution and the ketone at the 4 positions is selectively reduced using
homogenous or heterogeneous catalysis to yield 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid.
[0061] In an alternate       embodiment of the invention, an NAD(P)-dependent
dehydrogenase is used to catalyze the reduction of the ketone at the 4 position on
levulinic acid to the corresponding hydroxyl to yield 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid. In a
preferred embodiment, said dehydrogenase reduces the ketone with a high degree of
substrate specificity for levulinic acid and high regioselectively for the ketone at the 4
position. Preferably, said dehydrogenase is the same enzyme as for the oxidation of
the hydroxyl at the 4 position of 4-oxo-2-hydroxy-pentanoic acid, or a mutant thereof
(the mutant being obtained by computational design or experimental mutagenesis, or a
combination of the two).         In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said
dehydrogenase produces selectively one of the enantiomers (4R or 4S) of 4-hydroxy
pentanoic acid. In a alternative embodiment, said dehydrogenase produces a racemic
mixture of the 4R and 4S enantiomers of 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid.
Step 8: Cyclization of 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid to 4-valerolactone
[0062] 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid is cyclized into 4-valerolactone (also known as y
valerolactone, compound L1 in Fig. 1). In acidic solutions, the thermodynamical
equilibrium lies towards the cyclization to 4-valerolactone. The same remarks about
thermodynamic equilibrium and chemical and biochemical catalysis hold as in
paragraph [0035].
[0063] In one embodiment of the invention, 4-valerolactone is produced from 4
hydroxy-pentanoic acid, in the presence of a catalyst, after separation of 4-hydroxy
pentanoic acid from the fermentation broth or cell-free solution.          In a preferred
embodiment of the invention, an enantiopure 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid (either the 4R
or 4S enantiomer) is converted by said catalyst into the enantiopure 4-valerolactone.
In an alternative embodiment, a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers for 4
                                            22

WO 2012/030860                                                          PCT/US2011/049788
hydroxy-pentanoic acid (4R and 4S) is converted by said catalyst into a racemic
mixture of 4-valerolactone.
[0064] In another embodiment of the invention, the lactonization of 4-hydroxy
pentanoic acid to 4-valerolactone is catalyzed directly by a lipase or esterase or
protease or lactonase, or mutants thereof (those mutants being obtained by protein
engineering using computational design, directed evolution techniques or rational
mutagenesis, or a combination of the three) within a cell or outside of a cell. In a
preferred embodiment of the invention, said lipase or esterase or protease or lactonase
acts on the enantiopure 4-hydroxy-pentanoic acid substrate to yield an enantiopure 4
valerolactone.   In a alternative embodiment, said lipase or esterase of protease or
lactonase acts on a racemic mixture of the 4R and 4S enantiomers of 4-hydroxy
pentanoic acid to yield a racemic mixture of the 4R and 4S enantiomer of 4
valeralactone.

[0072] Dehydratases of the enolate superfamily: these dehydratase enzymes, which
are structurally related to the "enolase" family of enzymes, stabilize the enolate ion
formed after abstraction of one of the hydrogen a to the acid functional group.
Because these enzymes rely on the stabilization of the enolate anion to decrease the
activation energy for the dehydration reaction, they can be active on substrate with the
hydroxyl to be eliminated      P with either a carboxylic acid, ketone or ester functional
groups. Several examples of this class of dehydratase is provided in the table below:

enzymes can catalyze the reversible addition/elimination of a water molecule to/from
a a,p unsaturated thio-esters (coenzyme A derivatives).               Because they rely on
stabilization of the enolate anion formed after proton abstraction, the enzymes are also

[00831 Examples of non-biocatalytic methods to catalyze the lactonization of 4
hydroxy acids into their corresponding cyclic esters (lactones): there are multiple non
biocatalytic ways to catalyze the 1,4-lactonization of hydroxacids. For instance, it is
well-known that such lactonization is acid-catalyzed and therefore lowering the pH of
the medium (whether inside or outside of living cells) increases the rate of the
lactonization reaction.  Additionally, it has been reported in PCT/US2010/055524
(which is hereby incorporated by reference) that activation through group transfer on
the acid functional group of the 4-hydroxy acid is sufficient, under reasonable
conditions such as pH 2.5 to 7.0 and room temperature, to yield the lactone form
quantitatively.   For instance, PCT/US2010/055524              lists (1) activation with a
phosphate group (by producing in this case 4-hydroxylbutyryl phosphate) and (2)
activation with coenzyme A (by producing 4-hydroxylbutyryl-CoA). Synthesis of the
intermediates 4-hydroxylpentanoyl-phosphate or 4-hydroxylpentanoyl-CoA, using a
natural or engineered kinase enzyme or CoA synthetase respectively, or chemical
synthesis, is expected to result in similar activation and spontaneous lactonization
under appropriate conditions.
