                 THERAPEUTIC CUSHION SYSTEMS AND METHODS
                           Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[1001]      This application claims priority to and the benefit from U.S.          Provisional
Application No. 61/594,840, entitled "Therapeutic Cushion System," filed February 3, 2012,
U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/683,935, entitled "Therapeutic Cushion Systems and
Methods," filed August 16, 2012, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/710,913, entitled
"Therapeutic Cushion Systems and Methods," filed October 8, 2012, each of the disclosures
of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                                         Background
[1002]       Some embodiments described herein relate to therapeutic cushion systems and
methods, and in particular, to therapeutic cushion systems and methods for use in the
treatment of various medical conditions, such as, for example, gastro-esophageal reflux
disease.
[10031      Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a medical term that describes a
malady in which acid-laden, partially digested stomach contents reflux - i.e., flow in an
abnormal backward fashion - from the stomach into the esophagus.             Reflux of gastric
contents into the esophagus is most common, and does the most damage, when the GERD
sufferer is sleeping and unaware that the reflux is occurring.
[1004]       Some known systems use pillows or other supportive apparatuses to effectively
manage or control symptoms of conditions that otherwise would have required a medical
prescription or surgery to alleviate.   For example, some known pillow options include an
elevated pillow with a protrusion within the pillow focused on the cervical region of the neck,
which is intended to provide comfort or better resting conditions for individuals suffering
from cardiac conditions, emphysema or other respiratory difficulties. Such a pillow does not
allow for an extended support below the sacrum region of the spine; nor does the pillow
provide for any comfortable position other than supine.
[1005]       Some known devices include an orthopedic pillow that can be used to minimize
snoring in an individual.   While such a pillow can be used to address conditions such as
snoring, such a pillow may not be configured to treat conditions such as GERD. In fact, such
                                                I

an orthopedic pillow typically only provides an elevation component and fails to address any
other component that may be desired for the relief of symptoms of a GERD sufferer.
[1006]      Another known system includes a support pillow including a body with a central
section and two wings for use in controlling symptoms associated with head and neck
hyperextension, which is often seen in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or other
related conditions. Another known system includes an apparatus that can be used to prevent
positional plagiocephaly in an infant by distributing loads otherwise borne by the head of the
infant across a horizontal surface. While these systems may provide a benefit to infants, their
specific design and structural engineering is based on the user of the pillow being an infant.
Such pillows are not disclosed as providing a benefit for an adult or adolescent user suffering
from GERD.
[1007]      Most of the above described known systems focus on conditions relating to infants
and/or the head-only region, without regard to addressing support of, or interaction with, the
entire body. Other known systems include a pillow meant to accommodate an adult person
(as a general body pillow) or an infant (to assist in supporting the infant in a seated position).
Such systems, however, do not contemplate use of the pillow to alleviate symptoms relating
to gastric or esophageal disorders. Additionally, such a pillow may not accommodate the
necessary features specific for controlling or managing such disorders.          Another known
system includes a large, contoured body pillow to facilitate relief from persistent back and
neck pain, respiratory and digestive disorders; however, the bulk of such a pillow is typically
in excess of what is practical for use by a normal individual in a bed.
[1008]      Thus, a need exists for therapeutic cushion systems and methods that can address
the shortcomings of the known pillow systems identified above, and that can be used to
manage and/or control symptoms associated with GERD and/or other medical conditions,
while maintaining a practical, accommodating fit for the user.
                                            Summary
[1009]      Apparatus and methods for providing therapeutic treatment for symptoms
associated with GERD and/or other digestive disorders and/or other medical conditions are
described herein. In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a support element that has a
first end portion and a second end portion and a top surface disposed at an angle relative to a
                                                2

bottom surface of the support element. The second end portion has a height greater than the
first end portion. A riser element is configured to be coupled proximate to the second end
portion of the support element. A body element is configured to be disposed on at least one
of the support element or the riser element. The body element has a first arm and a second
arm connected together by an arc portion.

                                        Detailed Description
[1072]       Apparatus and methods for providing therapeutic treatment for symptoms
associated with GERD and/or other digestive disorders and/or other medical conditions or
ailments are described herein.        In some embodiments, a therapeutic cushion system as
described herein can allow the user to sleep comfortably for an extended period of time in a
substantially flat or an inclined right-side lateral decubitus (RLD) position, or a substantially
flat or an inclined left-side lateral decubitus (LLD) position. In the inclined RLD position or
the inclined LLD position, the therapeutic cushion system can serve to minimize, or
eliminate, gastro-esophageal reflux. For example, the inclined RLD position can facilitate
the emptying of the stomach into the duodenum, and the inclined LLD position can facilitate
the reduction of reflux episodes.
[1073]       In some embodiments, a method of using a therapeutic cushion system can
include coupling a riser element of a cushion system to a support element of the cushion
system such that the riser element and the support element collectively define a receiving
portion between the riser element and the support element. The support element includes a
top surface disposed at an angle relative to a bottom surface.         A body element can be
provided for placement on at least one of a portion of the support element or a portion of the
riser element.    The body element has a first arm and a second arm connected by an arc
portion. The support element, riser element and body element are collectively configured to
support a user in an inclined side position with the user's arm disposable within the receiving
portion.
[10741       In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a support element having a first end
portion, a second end portion and a top surface disposed at an angle relative to a bottom
surface. The second end portion has a height greater than a height of the first end portion. A
riser element is coupled to a body element such that the body element can be moved between
a first position in which a first portion of the body element extends from a side portion of the
riser element and a second portion of the body element is disposed substantially
perpendicular to the first portion, and a second position in which the first portion of the body
element is disposed on top of the riser element. The second portion of the body element
configured to be disposed at least partially on the support portion when the riser element is
disposed adjacent the second end portion of the body element.
                                                  8

[1075]     In some embodiments, a method of treating symptoms associated with gastro
esophageal reflux disease (GERD) can include positioning a user's body on a therapeutic
cushion system such that the user is disposed on the therapeutic cushion system in an inclined
right-side lateral decubitus (RLD) position or inclined left-side lateral decubitus (LLD)
position such that the user's pyloric sphincter is disposed at an elevation lower than an
elevation of the user's esophageal sphincter. For example, the user can be disposed on a
support member of a therapeutic cushion system having an inclined top surface of between 6
degrees and 30 degrees. In such an embodiment, the user can be positioned on the support
member at an angle between about 5 and 20 degrees depending on factors, such as, for
example, the density and/or deflection properties of the support member, and/or the weight of
the user. The user's right arm or left arm can be positioned within a receiving portion of the
therapeutic cushion system defined between the support member and a riser member of the
therapeutic cushion system. The user of the therapeutic cushion system can be maintained in
the inclined RLD position or LLD position for a sufficient time period to treat symptoms
associated with GERD. In some embodiments, the time period is at least one hour. In some
embodiments, the maintaining includes positioning a body element of the therapeutic cushion
system proximate at least one of the riser element or the support element of the therapeutic
cushion system.
[1076]     In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a cushion system including a support
element portion and a riser element portion. The support element portion has a first end
portion and a second end portion and a top surface disposed at an angle relative to a bottom
surface. The second end portion has a height greater than a height of the first end portion.
The support element portion and the riser element portion collectively define a receiving
portion configured to receive a user's arm therein and a side support member is configured to
be disposed on a portion of the top surface of the support element portion. The side support
member is configured to maintain the user in a side position on the cushion system.
[1077]     In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a frame member and a sling member
coupled to the frame member. The sling member defines an opening between a first portion

configured to support a user's head and the second portion of the sling member is disposed at
an angle between about 6 and about 30 degrees relative to the first portion. The opening is
configured to receive at least a portion of the user's arm therethrough.    A pad member is
                                               9

disposed below the opening and configured to support at least a portion of the user's arm
when disposed through the opening.        The apparatus is configured to be supported on a
support surface and support a user in an inclined side position.
[10781      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a body element that has a first end
portion including an arc portion, and a first arm and a second arm each extending away from
the arc portion. The body element is configured to maintain a user in a side position. The
body element includes an outer sleeve member and a pillow insert. The outer sleeve member
includes stitching along an outer edge portion and is free of stitching along an inner edge
portion.
[1079]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a support element that includes a
first end portion and a second end portion that has a height greater than a height of the first
end portion. The support element also includes a top surface disposed at an angle relative to
a bottom surface, a cushion portion, and an inflatable chamber configured to adjustably
modify a firmness and/or height of the support element.       The apparatus further includes a
riser element.   The riser element and the support element collectively define a receiving
portion configured to receive a user's arm.
[1080]      In some embodiments, a kit includes a cushion system that includes multiple
support elements and multiple riser elements.       Each support element from the multiple
support elements includes a first end portion and a second end portion and a top surface
disposed at an angle relative to a bottom surface. Each support element from the multiple
support elements is selectively stackable on top of another of the support elements to vary at
least one of a thickness or a firmness of a support portion of the cushion system. Each riser
element from the multiple riser elements is selectively stackable on top of another riser
element to vary at least one of a thickness or a firmness of a riser portion of the cushion
system. The riser portion and the support portion are collectively configured to support a
user in an inclined side position with an arm of the user disposed within a receiving portion
defined between the support portion and the riser portion.
[1081]      In some embodiments, a kit includes a cushion system that includes multiple
stackable elements. Each stackable element from the multiple stackable elements includes a
support element and a riser element. Each support element includes a first end portion and a
second end portion and a top surface disposed at an angle relative to a bottom surface. At
                                                10

least one stackable element from the multiple stackable elements includes an opening defined
between the support element and the riser element. Each stackable element from the multiple
stackable elements is selectively stackable on top of another stackable element to vary at least
one of a thickness or a firmness of cushion system.
[1082]      In some embodiments, an apparatus includes a support element and a riser
element.   The support element has a first end portion and a second end portion and a top
surface disposed at an angle relative to a bottom surface. The second end portion has a height
greater than a height of the first end portion. The top surface is disposed at an angle between
about 6 degrees and about 30 degrees relative to the bottom surface.          The riser element
includes straps configured to adjustably couple the riser element proximate to the second end
portion of the support element.
[1083]      FIG. I is a schematic illustration of a therapeutic cushion system according to an
embodiment. A therapeutic cushion system (also referred to herein as "cushion system") 100
includes a support element 120 (also referred to herein as "wedge support" or "wedge
element"), a riser element 122 and a body element 124 (also referred to herein as a "body
pillow").   As described above, the cushion system 100 can be used, for example, for the
treatment of symptoms associated with GERD and/or other digestive disorders and/or other
medical conditions. For example, the cushion system 100 can allow the user to sleep for an
extended period of time in an inclined right-side lateral decubitus (RLD) position (as
described in more detail below), which can minimize, or eliminate, gastro-esophageal reflux
while facilitating the emptying of the stomach into the duodenum, or an inclined left-side
lateral decubitus (LLD) position, which can facilitate the reduction of reflux episodes.
[1084]      The support element 120 can have a variety of different shapes and/or sizes. In
some embodiments, the support element has a wedge shape (e.g., in side view). For example,
the support element 120 can include an angled top surface (not shown in FIG. 1). In some
embodiments, the angled top surface can be disposed, for example, at an angle between 6
degrees and 30 degrees relative to a bottom surface of the support member 120. Said another
way, the support member 120 can have a height dimension that varies from a caudad end
portion (also referred to herein as "first end portion") of the support element 120 to a
cephalad end portion (also referred to herein as "second end portion") of the support element
120 (e.g., nearest the user's head), with the greatest height dimension being, for example, on
the cephalad end portion of the support element 120. The support element 120 can include a
                                                11

concave or indented portion (not shown in FIG. 1) disposed on the top surface of the support
element 120, for example, at or near the cephalad end as described in more detail below with
reference to specific embodiments. The concave portion can be used, for example, to relieve
pressure in the user's downside axilla when the user is lying in a lateral decubitus position on
the cushion system 100.
[1085]      The support element 120 can also have a shape that can promote an appropriate
torso angle for a user to comfortably maintain a lateral decubitus position on the support
element 120 during use. For example, the support element 120 can include a curved exterior
portion that can help increase the comfort of a user lying in a lateral decubitus position for an
extended period of time without uncomfortable pressure or pain in a downside shoulder or
arm.    In some embodiments, the support element 120 can include beveled corners on the
cephalad end of the support element 120 that can accommodate additional ergonomic arm
and elbow placement during use of the cushion system 100.
[1086]       The support element 120 can be a variety of different lengths, widths and/or
thicknesses. For example, in some embodiments, the support element 120 can have a length
that is shorter than a typical sized bed, such that the user's legs extend at least partially off the
support element 120 during use. Such a support element 120 can be referred to as having a
torso length. In some embodiments, the support element 120 can be the length of a typical
bed and can be referred to herein as having a bed length. In some embodiments, the support
element 120 can include multiple portions that can be stacked together.
[1087]      The support element 120 can include an outer casing 121 and a cushion member
123 that can be disposed within the outer casing 121. The outer casing 121 of the support
element 120 can be formed with one or more materials. For example, in some embodiments,
the outer casing 121 can include a top portion on which the user contacts during use of the
cushion system 100 that is formed with a first material, and a bottom portion that contacts the
support surface (e.g., top surface of a bed) on which the support element 120 is disposed
during use that is formed with a second material. The top portion (e.g., the top surface) of the
outer casing 121 can be formed with, for example, a four-way stretch material that is highly
conformable, such as, for example, cotton/spandex, nylon/spandex, polyester/spandex or
blends of any blend of cotton, nylon or polyester combined with spandex or elastane, and the
bottom portion can be formed with a more robust material, such as, for example, poplin,
                                                 12

canvas, gabardine or twill made using any combination of cotton, polyester or nylon, to
provide durability.
[1088]      The outer casing 121 of the support element 120 can include an opening through
which the cushion member 123 can be inserted and can include a fastener such as, for
example, a zipper, buttons, snaps, flaps, hook and loop fasteners or other suitable coupling
method to close or partially close the opening. The cushion member 123 can be formed with
one or more foam materials, such as, for example, polyurethane or rubber latex, or visco
elastic polyurethane (e.g., memory foam). In some embodiments, the cushion member 123
can include multiple different foam materials each having a different density and/or a
different deflection property.   In alternative embodiments, the cushion member 123 can
include one or more inflatable chambers.       In other alternative embodiments, the cushion
member 123 can include a filler material, such as a polyester material, disposed within an
inner casing. In some embodiments, the support element 120 can include multiple cushion
members 123. For example, multiple cushion members 123 can be stacked together within
the outer casing 121.
[1089]      The riser element 122 can be removably coupled to the support element 120. For
example, the riser element 122 can be coupled to the support element 120 near or proximate
the second end portion (i.e., cephalad end portion) of the support element 120 and can be
used to support a neck and head of a user. The riser element 122 can be coupled to the
support element 120 with a variety different coupling methods.         For example, in some
embodiments, the riser element 122 can include straps along lateral side edges of the riser
element 122 that can be coupled to the support element 120 along lateral side edges of the
support element 120.     The straps can include a coupling portion that can be coupled to a
mating coupling portion disposed on the support element 120. For example, the coupling
portion on the support element 120 can be buttons, and the coupling portion on the riser
element 122 can be holes or openings configured to be coupled to the buttons. In alternative
embodiments, other types of coupling portions can be included.        For example, the riser
element 122 can be coupled to the support element 120 with hook and loop fasteners, snaps,
strings or ties, zippers, or any other suitable coupling method.       In another alternative
embodiment, the straps can be on the support element 120 and can be coupled to the riser
element 122.    In another alternative embodiment, the support element 120 and the riser
element 122 can be formed as or incorporated within a single, uniform component.
                                               13

[1090]       In some embodiments, the straps can include multiple coupling portions such that
the riser element 122 and the support element 120 can be adjustably coupled together. For
example, straps on the riser element 122 (as described above) can include multiple openings
disposed at different locations along a length of the straps that can be selectively coupled to
buttons on the support element 120.      In alternative embodiments the support element can
include multiple coupling portions to which the coupling portions on the straps can be
selectively coupled. The adjustability of the position of the riser element 122 relative to the
support element 120 allows the user to adjust an angle of the user's head and/or neck when
supported on the riser element 122. In addition, the adjustability of the riser element 122
relative to the support element 120 can compress the riser element 122 to change or affect,
for example, a height of the user's head when supported on the riser element 122. Thus, a
user can position the riser element 122 to achieve a desired position and/or compression of
the riser element 122 and/or to accommodate users having different sized arms.
[1091]       In some embodiments, the riser element 122 can be coupled to the support
element 120 such that a receiving portion is formed between the second end portion of the
support element 120 and an end portion of the riser element 122. The receiving portion can
be, for example, an opening, void, cavity, pocket, space or gap, etc. between the support
element 120 and the riser element 122, in which a user can insert at least a portion of the
user's arm. The receiving portion can be defined by flexible or conformable portions of the
cushion system 100 such that the size of the receiving portion can vary as the user inserts an
arm. For example, in some embodiments, a portion of the support member 120 can contact a
portion of the riser element 122 such that as the user inserts an arm into the receiving portion,
the user moves or flexes a portion of the support element 120 and/or a portion of the riser
element 122.
[1092]       During use of the cushion system 100, a user can place a downside shoulder and
arm within the receiving portion when lying in a side position. Insertion of the user's arm
within the receiving portion between the support element 1210 and the riser element 122 can
also mitigate the tendency of the user from sliding downward on the angled top surface of the
support element 120 and can help stabilize the user in the lateral or side position during use
of the cushion system 100. A position of the user's arm and shoulder can be adjusted within
the receiving portion between the support element 120 and the riser element 122, such that
user's downside axilla rests within the concave portion of the support element 120.
                                               14

[1093]      The riser element 122 can include a pillow insert 125 that can be disposed within
an outer casing 127. The outer casing 127 can include an opening through which the pillow
insert 125 can be inserted, and can include a fastener such as, for example, a zipper, buttons,
snaps, flaps, hook and loop fasteners or other suitable coupling method to close or partially
close the opening. The outer casing 127 can be formed with the same or similar materials as
the outer casing 121 described above for the support element 120. For example, the outer
casing 127 can include a first portion formed with a four-way stretch material and a second
portion formed with a more robust material such as described for support element 120. The
pillow insert 125 can include an inner casing (not shown in FIG. 1) that can contain a filler
material (not shown in FIG. 1) therein. The filler material can be, for example, a clustered
polyester fiber material, such as, for example, any combination of polyester fibers, clustered
polyester fiber, down alternative made from synthetic fibers, polystyrene beads/pellets,
shredded foam, or down feathers.        The inner casing of the pillow insert 125 can also be
formed with a four-way stretch material as described above for the outer casing 127. The
inner casing of the pillow insert 125 can also include an opening through which the filler
material can be inserted, and can include a fastener such as, for example, a zipper, buttons,
snaps, or other suitable coupling method to close or partially close the opening. In alternative
embodiments, the inner casing may not include such an opening. For example, after the filler
material has been inserted into the inner casing, the inner casing can be closed with, for
example, stitching.
[1094]      The four-way stretch material of the outer casing 127 of the riser element 122
described above, in conjunction with the pillow insert 125 having an inner casing formed
with the four-way stretch material and having a clustered polyester fiber filler material can
allow the riser element 122 to be malleable and shape-retaining. For example, in such an
embodiment, the user can conform the riser element 122 to a desired thickness and/or shape
for that user's needs and preference. For example, the user can conform or adjust the riser
element 122 to form cavities or to otherwise fit or conform to the user's face, ear, arm, etc.
The conformed shape can be maintained for an extended time period and/or until the user
disperses the filler material of the pillow insert 125 by, for example, shaking or fluffing the
riser element 122.
[1095]      The body element 124 can include a pillow insert 129 that can be disposed within
a sleeve member 131. The sleeve member 131 can include an opening or openings through
                                                15

which the pillow insert 129 can be inserted, and can include a fastener such as, for example, a
zipper, buttons, snaps, or other suitable coupling method to close or partially close the
opening(s). The pillow insert 129 can be formed the same as or similar to the pillow insert
 125 described above for the riser element 122.       For example, the pillow insert 129 can
include an inner casing (not shown in FIG. 1) containing a filler material (not shown in FIG.
 1). The filler material can be, for example, a clustered polyester fiber material, such as, for
example, the materials described above for the riser element 122. The inner casing of the
body element 124 can be formed with, for example, a four-way stretch material as described
above for the inner casing of the riser element 122. The sleeve member 131 can be formed
with, for example, a four-way stretch material as described above for the riser element 122
and the support element 120, or can be constructed of a two-way stretch material, such as, for
example, jersey or interlock. Thus, as described above for the riser element 122, the body
element 124 can also be manipulated, conformed, adjusted, dispersed, etc., to conform to a
desired shape and/or thickness. The inner casing of the pillow insert 129 can also include an
opening through which the filler material can be inserted, and can include a fastener such as,
for example, a zipper, buttons, snaps, or other suitable coupling method to close or partially
close the opening.    In alternative embodiments, the inner casing may not include such an
opening.    For example, after the filler material has been inserted into the inner casing, the
inner casing can be closed with, for example, stitching.
[1096]      The body element 124 can have a variety of different shapes and be a variety of
different sizes. For example, in some embodiments, the body element 124 can include an arc
portion at a cephalad end connecting a first arm and a second arm of the body element 124.
In some embodiments, the arc portion can have a curvature of, for example, substantially 180
degrees. In other embodiments, the arc portion can have a different curvature, for example,
between about 30 degrees and 180 degrees.         In some embodiments, the first arm and the
second arm can extend parallel to each other away from the arc portion.                In some
embodiments, the first arm of the body element 124 can have a length that is about half a
length of the second arm of the body element 124. In some embodiments, the first arm can
be substantially the same length as the second arm.
[10971      The body element 124 can be reconfigurable into a variety of different shapes and
configurations for use on the support element 120 and/or riser element 122 as described in
more detail below. Optionally, in some embodiments, the body element 124 can be used
                                               16

independently of the support element 120 and the riser element 122. In some embodiments,
the body element 124 and the riser element 122 can be integrally formed or incorporated
within a single component. In such an embodiment, the body element 124 can be moved
from a first position in which the body element 124 is unfolded and a second configuration in
which the body element 124 is folded and such that a portion of the body element 124 is
disposed on a portion of the riser element 122. In some embodiments, the body element 124
and the riser element 122 can be coupled by a flexible hinge such that the body element 124
can be moved between the folded configuration and the unfolded configuration.           In some
embodiments, the flexible hinge can be formed with, for example, a fabric material.
[1098]       The sleeve member 131 of the body element 124 can be formed in a tubular shape
such that the pillow insert 129 can be inserted therein through an opening defined on one end
of the sleeve member 131. The sleeve member 131 can include stitching along a single outer
edge such that the body element 124 can be free of stitching along an inner edge portion of
the sleeve member 131 where a user typically contacts the sleeve member 131 during use.
Such an embodiment can provide increased comfort for the user as many known body pillows
that have such inner stitching can tend to become taut when tension is applied, resulting in an
awkward and potentially painful fit for the user. In addition, the stitching being along an
outer edge portion the sleeve member 131 can eliminate or reduce distortion of the body
element 124 during use, which can further provide improved feel and comfort to the user. In
some embodiments, stitching can be included on the body element 124 at additional targeted
areas of the body element 124 as described, for example, with reference to FIGS. 26-28. The
inner casing of the pillow insert 129 of the body element 124 can also be constructed in a
tubular shape in the same or similar manner as the sleeve member 131. For example, the
inner casing of pillow insert 129 can include stitching along an outer edge of the inner casing,
and be free of stitching along an inner edge.
[10991       As described above, the user can manipulate, conform, disperse, etc., the clustered
polyester fiber filler material within the body element 124 and/or the riser element 122 to
create cavities or bulges to accommodate specific body parts and/or portions to accommodate
the user's needs and/or preferences.     The shape and/or cavity formed by the user can be
maintained for an extended time period and/or until the user disperses the filler material of
the riser element 122 and/or the body element 124 by, for example, shaking the riser element
122 and/or body element 124.         The combination of the four-way stretch material and
                                               17

clustered polyester filler material can allow for the redistribution of the filler material in an
equalized manner throughout the body element 124 and/or riser element 122.                    The
reconfigurable filler material of the body element 124 and/or the riser element 122 can also
minimize undesirable and irreversible migration of the filler material, which can occur in
some known cushion systems due to their non-pliable stuffing and non-stretch material. In
addition, the clustered polyester fiber filler material of the body element 124 and/or the riser
element 122 can be machine washed and dried without causing clumping of the filler
material.   The combination of the filler material and the four-way stretch outer casing 127
and inner casing of pillow insert 125 of the riser element 122, and sleeve member 131 and
inner casing of the pillow insert 129 of the body element 124, provides for post-laundering
redistribution of the filler material to substantially its original state.
[1100]      In some embodiments, the cushion system 100 can include a side support member
or portion (not shown in FIG. 1) that can be used as an alternative to the body element 124.
In some embodiments, the riser element 122 and the support element 120 are formed as
single component and define a receiving portion (e.g., space or opening) in which the user's
ann can be disposed during use.         In some embodiments, the cushion system 100 can be
implemented in an adjustable bed, such as, for example, a bed used in a medical facility. In
some embodiments, the cushion system 100 can be implemented with a sling-type support
element and riser element.      For example, in such an embodiment, the sling-type support
element and riser element can include a sling portion coupled to a frame member. In some
such embodiment, support legs or feet and/or or wheels, such as castors, can be coupled to
the frame member. In some embodiments, the cushion system 100 can include one or more
inflatable chambers that can allow a user to adjust a height and/or firmness of the cushion
system 100.
[1101]      In some embodiments, the cushion system 100 can include stackable elements.
For example, in some embodiments, the support element 120 can include multiple separate
stackable support portions each having a cushion member and an outer casing, and multiple
stackable riser elements 122 each having a cushion member or pillow insert within an outer
casing.   In some embodiments, the cushion system 100 can include multiple stackable
elements that each include a support element and riser element formed as a single component.
Example embodiments of cushion systems including such stackable elements are described in
more detail below.
                                                  18

[1102]      To use the cushion system 100, a user can removably couple the riser element 122
to the support element 120 as described above. The user can place the riser element 122 and
the support element 120 on a support surface (e.g., a top surface of a bed) either before or
after being coupled together. The body element 124 can be positioned on the support element
120 or with a portion of the body element 124 on the support element 120 and a portion on
the riser element 120. The user can then lie on the assembled cushion system 100 in a RLD
or LLD position such that the user is aligned in approximately a center portion of the support
element 120. The user inserts the user's right or left arm beneath the body element 124 and
within the receiving portion formed between the support element 120 and the riser element
122. Optionally, the user can adjust the position of the user's right or left arm and shoulder
within the receiving portion between the support element 120 and the riser element 122, such
that user's downside axilla rests within the centered concave portion of the support element
 120.
[1103]      With the user's arm within the space between the support element 120 and the
riser element 122, the cushion system 100 can maintain the user in the inclined RLD or LLD
position. Thus, the tendency of the user to slide down the angled portion of the support
member 120 can be reduced or eliminated. Further illustrations and details of how a user can
be positioned on the cushion system 100 are described below. In some embodiments, the
support element 120 and the riser element 122 can be used without the use of the body
element 124. In some embodiments, use of only the body element 124 may be desirable.
[1104]      As described above, the cushion system 100 can be used as a method of treatment
for GERD and/or other digestive disorders. To use the cushion system 100 for this purpose,
the user can follow the steps described above for being positioned on the cushion system 100
in an inclined RLD position or an inclined LLD position. For example, in the inclined RLD
position, the therapeutic cushion system 100 can serve to minimize, or eliminate, gastro
esophageal reflux while it facilitates the emptying of the stomach into the duodenum. For
example, in the inclined RLD position, the exit valve (i.e., the pyloric sphincter) of the user's
stomach will be positioned substantially at a bottom right side of the user's abdomen below
or at an elevation lower than an elevation of the user's esophageal sphincter. Thus, when the
user remains in the inclined RLD position for a sufficient period of time, the stomach
contents of the user can drain out of the stomach and into the duodenum. For example, a time
period between about 1-4 hours may be needed to empty the contents of the stomach into the
                                               19

duodenum such that the user feels relief from symptoms associated with GERD and/or other
digestive disorders.    The time frame can vary depending on various factors such as for
example, the user's overall health, other conditions the user may have such as diabetes, or
gastroparesis, or the type and amount of food the user has consumed prior to resting on the
cushion system, etc. In another example, in the inclined LLD position, a reduction in the
frequency of reflux episodes of the user can result.
[1105]      FIGS. 2-25 illustrate a therapeutic cushion system and methods of using the
therapeutic cushion system, according to an embodiment. A therapeutic cushion system 200
(also referred to herein as a "cushion system") includes a support element 220, a riser element
222 and a body element 224. As described above for cushion system 100, the cushion system
200 can be used, for example, for the treatment of symptoms associated with GERD and/or
other digestive disorders.
[1106]      The support element 220 can have a variety of different shapes and/or sizes. In
this embodiment, the support element 220 has a substantially wedged shape as shown in the
side view of, for example, FIG. 7.       Specifically, the support element 220 includes a top
surface 237 that is disposed at an angle 0 relative to a bottom surface 239 as shown in FIG. 7.
In some embodiments, the angle 0 can be, for example, between about 6 degrees and about 30
degrees. Said another way, the support element 220 has a height HI at a first end portion 215
of the support element 220 and a height H2 at a second end portion 216 of the support
element 220 and the height H2 is greater than the height H1 as shown, for example, in FIG. 7.
The height HI can be for example, up to 2 inches, and the height H2 can be between, for
example, about 6 inches and 14 inches. The support element 220 also has a length L that can
be, for example, between about 20 inches and 40 inches, such that the support element 220
has a torso length (as described above) and can promote an appropriate torso angle for user to
comfortably maintain a lateral decubitus position on the support element 220 during use.
[1107]      The support element 220 also includes a concave portion 230 (see, e.g., FIGS. 4,
5, 8 and 9) disposed on the top surface 237 of the support element 220. As described above,
the concave portion 230 can be used to relieve pressure in the user's downside axilla when
the user is lying in a lateral decubitus position on the cushion system 200.       The support
element 220 also includes curved exterior portions that can help increase the comfort of a
user lying in the lateral decubitus position for an extended period of time without
uncomfortable pressure or pain in a downside shoulder or arm. In this embodiment, the
                                                20

support element 220 also includes beveled corners 233 on the second end portion of the
support element 220 (see, e.g., FIGS. 4 and 6) that can accommodate additional ergonomic
arm and elbow placement during use of the cushion system 200.
[11081      The support element 220 includes an outer casing 221, as shown, for example, in
FIGS. 4 and 6-8, and a cushion member 223, as shown in FIG. 9 that can be disposed within
the outer casing 221. The outer casing 221 of the support element 220 can be formed with
one or more materials as described above for support element 120. For example, the outer
casing 221 can include a top portion 238 (see, e.g., FIGS. 7-8) on which the user contacts
during use of the cushion system 200 that is formed with a first material, and a bottom
portion 236 that contacts the support surface (e.g., top surface of a bed) on which the support
element 220 is disposed during use that is formed with a second material that is different than
the first material. The top portion of the outer casing 221 can be formed with, for example, a
four-way stretch material and the bottom portion can be formed with a more robust material
as described above for support element 120. The top portion 238 and the bottom portion 236
can be coupled together with, for example, stitching.         In this embodiment, the support
element 220 includes buttons 228 on lateral side edges of the support element 220 (see., e.g.,
FIGS. 2, 3 and 6-8) that can be used to removably couple the riser element 222 to the support
element 220 as described in more detail below.
[1109]      The outer casing 221 of the support element 120 can also include an opening (not
shown) through which the cushion member 223 can be inserted and can include a fastener
(not shown) such as, for example, a zipper, buttons, snaps, flaps, or other suitable coupling
method to close or partially close the opening. In this embodiment, the cushion member 223
is formed with, for example, one or more foam materials as previously described.            The
cushion member 223 includes a cavity 244 defined on top surface portion of the cushion
member 223, as shown in FIG. 9.        The cavity 244 forms the concave portion 230 of the
support element 220 when the cushion member 223 is disposed within the outer casing 221.
[1110]      The riser element 222 includes a pillow insert 225 that can be disposed within an
outer casing 227. The outer casing 227 can include an opening 242 through which the pillow
insert 225 can be inserted as shown in FIG. 11. The outer casing 227 can include a fastener
(not shown) such as, for example, a zipper, buttons, snaps, or other suitable coupling method
to close or partially close the opening, as previously described for cushion assembly 100.
The outer casing 227 can be formed with the same or similar materials as the outer casing
                                               21

221 described above for the support element 220. For example, the outer casing 227 can
include a first portion 232 formed with a four-way stretch material and a second portion 234
formed with a more robust material. The pillow insert 225 can include an inner casing 235
that can be formed with a four-way stretch material as described above and that can contain a
filler material (not shown) therein.     The filler material can be, for example, a clustered
polyester fiber material, such as, for example, a material described above for pillow insert
 125. The inner casing 235 of the pillow insert 225 can also include an opening (not shown)
through which the filler material can be inserted, and can include a fastener (not shown) such
as, for example, a zipper, buttons, snaps, or other suitable coupling method to close or
partially close the opening. In alternative embodiments, the inner casing 235 may not include
such an opening. For example, after the filer material has been inserted into the inner casing
235, the inner casing 235 can be closed with, for example, stitching.
[1111]       As described above for cushion assembly 100, the four-way stretch material of the
outer casing 227 of the riser element 222, in conjunction with the four-way stretch material of
the inner casing 235 and the clustered polyester fiber filler material of the pillow insert 225
can allow the riser element 222 to be malleable and shape-retaining. For example, the user
can conform the riser element 222 into a desired thickness and/or shape and/or form cavities
or bulges to meet that user's needs and preference, as previously described.
[11121       The riser element 222 can be removably coupled to the support element 220 as
shown, for example in FIGS. 2-4. For example, in this embodiment, the riser element 222
includes straps 226 along lateral side edge portions of the riser element 222 and the straps
226 each include multiple sets of button holes 240 that can be selectively coupled to the
buttons 226 on the support element 220. The riser element 222 can also include bands 219
(see, e.g., FIGS. 10-12) that can be used to hold the straps 226 against the lateral side edge of
the riser element 222. In this manner, the riser element 222 and the support element 220 can
be adjustably coupled together to meet a user's particular needs, as described in more detail
below.    For example, as previously described, the riser element 222 can be coupled to the
support element 220 such that a receiving portion 258 (e.g., space, opening, void, pocket,
etc.) (see, e.g., FIG. 4) is defined between the second end portion 216 of the support element
220 and the riser element 222. A user can place a downside shoulder and arm within the
receiving portion 258 when lying in a RLD or LLD position. The straps 226 can be formed
with, for example, the same material as the bottom portion 234 (e.g., poplin, canvas,
                                                22

gabardine or twill made using any combination of cotton, polyester or nylon) of the riser
element 222 to provide strength to the straps 226. Similarly, the buttons 228 of the support
element 220 can be disposed on the bottom portion 236 of the support element 220, which
can be formed with the same material as the bottom portion 234 of the riser element 222.
[1113]      As shown in FIGS. 5 and 13, in this embodiment, the body element 224 includes
an arc portion 241 that has a substantially 180 degree curvature at a cephalad end portion, a
first arm 247 and second ann 248 each extending from the arc portion 241 in a caudad
direction. In this embodiment, the first arm 247 has a length that is shorter than a length of
the second arm 248. For example, the first arm 247 can have a length, for example, about
half a length of the second arm 248. The body element 224 is reconfigurable into a variety of
different shapes for use on the support element 220 and/or riser element 222 as described in
more detail below.     Optionally, in some embodiments, the body element 224 can be used
independently of the support element 220 and the riser element 222.
[1114]      The body element 224 includes a pillow insert 229 (see e.g., FIG. 12) that can be
disposed within a sleeve member 231.      The sleeve member 231 can be formed in a tubular
shape and includes a first opening 243 and a second opening 245 through which the pillow
insert 229 can be inserted. The opening 243 can include a fastener (not shown) such as, for
example, a zipper that can be used to close the opening 243. The fastener can also extend
along an outer edge of the sleeve member 231 such that a portion 251 of the sleeve member
231 along the outer edge portion 249 can be opened to aid in insertion and removal of the
pillow insert 229, as shown in FIG. 12.     Optionally, a second fastener (not shown) can be
included that can be used to open and close the opening 245 in a similar manner.
[1115]      The tubular shape of the sleeve member 231 can be formed, for example, by
sewing or stitching along an outer edge portion 249 of the sleeve member 231.        Thus, the
sleeve member 231 can be free of stitching along an inner edge portion 250 of the sleeve
member 231 where a user typically contacts the sleeve member 231 during use. As described
above, having the inner edge portion 250 free of stitching can provide increased comfort for
the user and can eliminate or reduce distortion of the body element 224 during use. In this
embodiment, the sleeve member 231 also includes stitching features 252 that extend at an
angle from the inner edge portion 250 to the outer edge portion 249. The stitching 252 can
extend, for example, at a 45 degree angle.
                                              23

[1116]      The pillow insert 229 can be formed the same as or similar to the pillow insert 225
described above for the riser element 222. For example, the pillow insert 229 can include an
inner casing 246 that can contain a filler material (not shown). The filler material can be, for
example, a clustered polyester fiber material, as previously described for pillow insert 129.
The inner casing 246 can be formed with, for example, a four-way stretch material as
described above.     The sleeve member 231 can be formed with, for example, a four-way
stretch material as described above for the riser element 222 and the support element 220, or
alternatively can be formed with, for example, a two-way stretch material as described for
sleeve member 131.      Thus, as described above for the riser element 222, the body element
224 can also be manipulated, conformed, adjusted, dispersed, etc., to conform to a desired
shape and/or thickness. Although not shown, the inner casing 246 of the pillow insert 229
can also include an opening through which the filler material can be inserted, and can include
a fastener (not shown) such as, for example, a zipper, buttons, snaps, or other suitable
coupling method to close or partially close the opening.        In alternative embodiments, the
inner casing 246 may not include such an opening. For example, after the filler material has
been inserted into the inner casing 246, the inner casing 246 can be closed with, for example,
stitching.
[1117]      To use the cushion system 200, the user can removably couple the riser element
222 to the support element 220 as shown in FIGS. 13, 14 and 15A-15C.             Specifically, the
user can select one of the set of openings 240 on the straps 226 to couple to the buttons 228
on the support element 220 such that the riser element 222 is disposed at a desired position
relative to the support element 222. For example, the riser element 222 can be positioned
relative to the support element 220 such that the riser element 222 is at a desired height to
place the user's head and neck and at a desired longitudinal distance from the support
element 220. As shown in FIG. 15A, if the user couples the first set of button holes 240 (the
set furthest from an end of the straps 226) to the buttons 228, the riser element 222 will be at
a maximum height. If the user uses the second set of button holes 240, as shown in FIG.
 15B, the riser element 222 will be at a medium height, and if the user uses the third set of
button holes 240 (the set closest to the end of the straps 226) the riser element 222 will be at a
lowest height. The user can place the riser element 222 and the support element 220 on, for
example, a bed or other surface on which the user intends to use the cushion system 200
either before or after coupling the riser element 222 to the support element 220.
                                                24

[1118]      With the riser element 222 coupled to the support element 220, the user can place
the body element 224 on top of the riser element 222 and the support element 220, as shown
for example, in FIG. 14. Specifically, the arc portion 241 is placed on the riser element 222
and the second arm 248 of the body element 224 is positioned on a left side of the riser
element 222 and support element 220 (as viewed in a top view of the cushion system) such
that a portion of the second arm 248 (depending on its length) extends off the support element
220, as shown, for example, 2, 3, 14 and 15A-15C.        Although the cushion system 200 is
described below for a user positioned in a RLD position, it should be understood that the
cushion system 200 can alternatively be assembled for a user to be positioned in a LLD
position on the cushion system 200 in a similar manner.
[1119]      The user can then lie on the assembled cushion system 200 in the RLD position
such that the user is aligned in approximately a center portion of the support element 220.
For example, the user can insert the user's right arm below the arc portion 241 of the body
element 224 and within the receiving portion 258 between the riser element 222 and the
support element 220, as shown in FIG. 16, and then out through the space on an outer side of
the second arm 248 of the body element 224, as shown in FIG. 17. In other words, the user's
arm can be positioned within the receiving portion 258 and the user's hand can extend out of
the space. The user can check to ensure the user's body is in approximately the middle of the
support element 220. Optionally, the user can adjust the position of the user's right arm and
shoulder within the space between the support element 220 and the riser element 222, such
that user's downside axilla rests within the centered concave portion 230 of the support
element 220. The user can then place the second arm 248 (i.e., the long arm) between the
user's legs and place or tuck the first arm (the short arm) behind or under the user's back,
hips and/or buttocks with the user's knees in a bent position, as shown in FIG. 18. The user
can situate the user's head, neck and arms until the user is in a comfortable position, as
shown in FIG. 19. In some embodiments, the user's hip can be anchored or supported on the
bed or support surface on which the cushion system 200 is disposed to help limit or prevent
the user from sliding down the support element 220, and maintain the user in a desired
position on the cushion system 200. For example, in some embodiments, the support element
220 can have a length such that the user's hip is positioned at least partially on the bed or
support surface when the user is positioned on the cushion system 200.
                                              25

[1120]      With the user's arm within the space between the support element 220 and the
riser element 222, the cushion system 200 can maintain the user in an inclined RLD position.
Thus, the tendency of the user to slide down the angled top surface portion 237 of the support
member 220 can be reduced or eliminated. As described above, the user can also manipulate,
conform, disperse, etc., the clustered polyester fiber filler material within the body element
224 and/or the riser element 222 to create cavities or bulges to accommodate specific body
parts and/or portions related to its use for GERD or other medical conditions to accommodate
the user's needs and/or preferences, for example, a user may accommodate a breathing
apparatus or other similar device.
[1121]      FIGS. 20-23 illustrate different alternative configurations for using the cushion
system 200. FIG. 20 illustrates the body element 224 disposed with the second arm 228
folded over the arc portion 241.      FIG. 21 illustrates the body element 224 with the second
arm 248 folded toward the first arm 247 such that the second arm 248 does not extend
substantially off the support element 220.       FIGS. 22 and 23 illustrate use of the cushion
system 200 with the riser element 222 and the support element 220 disposed in an alternative
position. Specifically, FIG. 22 illustrates the support element 220 disposed in an upright
position with the second end portion 216 supported on a support surface (e.g., a bed or a
floor) and the riser element 222 disposed in an upright position proximate to the support
element 220. As shown in FIG. 23, the body element 224 can be positioned against the riser
element 222 and the support element 220 such that a user can use the cushion system 200 as a
back rest in a seated or semi-seated position. FIG. 24 illustrates use of the cushion system
200 without the riser element 222. As shown in FIG. 24, the body element 224 can be placed
on the support element 220.
[1122]      FIGS. 24(A)-24(J) each illustrate a user using the cushion system 200 in various
configurations and positions. FIG. 24(A) illustrates the user positioned in an inclined LLD
position. In other words, the body element 224 is positioned on the support element 220 and
the riser element 222 with the second arm 248 (i.e., the long arm) on a right side of the
cushion system 200 (as viewed from a top view of the cushion system 200). FIGS. 24(B) and
24(C) illustrate the user in an inclined RLD position, as described above, for example, with
reference to FIGS. 16-19. FIGS. 24(D) and 24(E) illustrate the body element 224 in a folded
position similar to the configuration shown with reference to FIG. 20, and the user positioned
in an inclined supine position on the cushion system 200. FIGS. 24(F) and 24(G) illustrate
                                                 26

the body element 224 folded position similar to the configuration shown with reference to
FIG. 21 and the user positioned in a prone position on the cushion system 200. FIG. 24(I)
illustrates the cushion system 200 in an upright reclined configuration similar to the
configuration shown with reference to FIGS. 22 and 23, and FIG. 24(H) illustrates the
cushion system 200 in a similar configuration as with FIG. 24(I) but with the body element
224 wrapped around to the front of the user. This position can be used, for example, to
support the user's hand(s), a book, or in the case of a nursing mother, a nursing infant.
[1123]      FIG. 24(J) illustrates the cushion system 200 with a user in a right side inclined
position similar to the position shown in FIG. 24(C), except in FIG. 24(J) the second arm 248
(the long arm) of the body element 224 running along the user's back and tucked or placed
forward between the user's knees. This position can allow the user to change from a RLD
position to a LLD position (and vice versa) without having to flip over the body element 224.
[1124]      FIG. 25 illustrates use of a cushion system 200' that is similar to the cushion
system 200. The cushion system 200' includes a support element 220' that can be configured
the same as or similar to the support element 220. In this embodiment, the support element
220' has a longer length than the support element 220 and can be used without a riser
element. As shown in FIG, 25, the support element 220' can be used with a body element
224 described above, or with another body element as described herein.
[1125]      FIGS. 26-28 each illustrate different embodiments of a body element showing
various stitching features.   The body elements of FIGS. 26-28 can each be configured the
same as or similar to and function the same as or similar to the embodiments of a body
element described above. FIG. 26 illustrates a body element 324 that is similar to the body
element 224 described above and includes a sleeve member 331 that has stitching 353 along
an outer edge portion 349 of the body element 324 and a pair of stitching features 352
disposed at angles and extend from an inner edge portion 350 of the body element 324 to the
outer edge portion 349. FIG. 27 illustrates a body element 424 that includes a sleeve member
431 that has stitching 453 along an outer edge portion 449 and a pair of stitching features 452
each disposed at an angle and extending from an inner edge portion 450 to the outer edge
portion 449. The body element 424 also includes a stitching feature 454 that extends from
the inner edge portion 450 to the outer edge portion 449 and is disposed between the stitching
features 452. FIG. 28 illustrates a body element 524 that includes a sleeve member 531that
has stitching 553 along an outer edge portion 549 of the body element 524 and four stitching
                                                27

features 552 that extend at an angle from an inner edge portion 550 of the body element 524
to the outer edge portion 549 of the body element 524.
[1126]      The stitching features 352, 452, 454, 552 described above can be disposed on the
respective body elements 324, 424, 524 at a substantially equal distance from each other or at
different distances from each other.      Further, in alternative embodiments, more or less
stitching features can be included on a body element of a cushion system described herein.
[1127]      FIGS. 29 and 30(A)-30(1) illustrate different embodiments of a body element that
can be used alone or within a cushion system as described herein. Each of the body elements
described with respect to FIGS. 29 and 30(A)-30(I) can be configured the same as or similar
to and function the same as or similar to the embodiments of a body element described above.
FIG. 29 illustrates a body element 624. The body element 624 includes a first arm 647 and a
second arm 648 and a sleeve member 631 that has an inner edge portion 650 and an outer
edge portion 649 in which a pillow insert (not shown) can be disposed. The sleeve member
631 includes stitching features 652 similar that extend at an angle from the inner edge portion
650 to the outer edge portion 649 and can include stitching (not shown along the outer edge
portion 649 as described above for previous embodiments. In this embodiment, the second
arm 648 includes an end portion 655 that is disposed at an angle relative to a remainder of the
second arm 648. The end portion 655 can be disposed, for example, at an angle of up to
about 25 degrees. A stitching feature 656 can be disposed at the start of the bend portion 655.
The first arm 647 includes a rounded or curved end portion 657, and the end of the end
portion 655 can optionally be similarly rounded. FIGS. 30(A)-30(I) each illustrate different
embodiments of a body element having different shapes and sizes.
[1128]      FIGS. 31(A)-31(E) each illustrate further different embodiments of a body
element that can be used alone or within a cushion system as described herein and that
include various different filler zoning options. Filler zoning can allow various filler materials
and/or filler materials with different densities to be placed at targeted locations within the
body element. Filler zones can be formed, for example, by way of internal fabric baffles,
sewn-in segmentation, or by self-contained individual insert members. Each zone within a
body element can be accessed and/or inserted within a body element during manufacturing,
for example, via a semi-permanently stitched closure.         Alternatively, each zone can be
accessed by a user (e.g., during in-home use) via a closure member, including, for example,
zipper(s), snap(s), button(s), hook and loop fasteners, etc.      Each embodiment of a body
                                                28

element described with reference to FIGS. 31(A)-31(E) can include the same or similar
features, and can function the same or similar to, other embodiments of a body element
described herein, and therefore certain details are not described with reference to FIGS.
3 1(A)-3 1(E).
[1129]        FIG. 3 1(A) illustrates a body element 2124 that includes a first filler zone A and a
second filler zone B. FIG. 31(B) illustrates a body element 2224 that includes a first filler
zone A and a second filler zone B. FIG. 31(C) illustrates a body element 2324 that includes a
first filler zone A, a second filler zone B, and a third filler zone C. FIG. 31(D) illustrates a
body element 2424 that includes a first filler zone A, a second filler zone B, and a third filler
zone C.      FIG. 31(E) illustrates a body element 2524 that includes a first filler zone A, a
second filler zone B, a third filler zone C, a fourth filler zone D and a fifth filler zone E.
[1130]        The fillers zones shown and described with respect to FIGS. 31(A)-31(E) are
example embodiments of body elements having various quantity and types of filler zones. It
should be understood that alternative embodiments can include a different quantity, size
and/or shape of filler zone. Further, although not shown with respect to other embodiments
of a body element described herein, it should be understood that other embodiments of a body
element can include filler zones.
[11311        FIGS. 32(A), 32(B) and 33-35 illustrate another embodiment of a therapeutic
cushion system. A therapeutic cushion system 700 (also referred to herein as a "cushion
system") includes a support element 720, a riser element 722 and a body element 724. The
support element 720, riser element 722 and body element 724 can each be constructed the
same as or similar to, and can function the same as or similar to, the support elements, riser
elements, and body elements described above for previous embodiments.               Therefore, some
details are not described below with respect to support element 720, riser element 722 and/or
the body element 724.
[1132]        The support element 720 can be formed the same as or similar to the support
elements described above.        For example, the support element 720 can include a first end
portion 715 and a second end portion 716 and a top surface 737 that is angled relative to a
bottom surface 739, as shown, for example, in FIG. 33.
[1133]        In this embodiment, the body element 724 and the riser element 722 are formed as
a single component and the body element 724 can be moved between a first unfolded
                                                 29

configuration, as shown in FIG. 32(B), and a second folded configuration, as shown in FIG.
32(A). A fabric hinge portion 763 is formed between a portion of the body element 724 and
a portion of the riser element 722 that allows a user to fold a portion of the body element 724
for use.  Specifically, the body element 724 includes a first arm 747 connected to the riser
element 722 by the fabric hinge portion 763, and a second arm 748. When in the second
folded configuration, the first arm 747 is substantially disposed on the riser element 722 as
shown in FIGS. 32(A), 32(B) and 33-35.
[1134]      A user can use the cushion system 700 in the same or similar manner as described
above for previous embodiment. For example, as shown in FIG. 34 the user can place the
cushion system 700 on bed, and position the combination riser element 722 and body element
724 proximate to the second end portion 716 of the support element 720. For example, the
riser element 722 can be positioned at a desired distance from the support element 720 such
that a receiving portion (e.g., a gap, opening, pocket, etc.) 758 is defined between the riser
element 722 and the support element 720. The body element 724 can be folded over the riser
element 722 as described above and as shown for example, in FIGS. 34 and 35. As shown in
FIG. 35, the user can be positioned on the cushion system 700 in an inclined side position
with the user's arm disposed within the receiving portion 758.
[1135]      FIGS. 36-41 illustrate an embodiment of a therapeutic cushion system that
includes a bed length support element. A therapeutic cushion system 800 (also referred to
herein as a "cushion system") includes a support element 820, a riser element 822 and a side
support member 864.       The support element 820 and the riser element 822 can each be
constructed the same as or similar to, and can function the same as or similar to, the support
elements and riser elements, respectively, described above for previous embodiments.
Therefore, some details with respect to the support element 820 and riser element 822 are not
described below.     The cushion system 800 can also include an optional pillow 859 or the
pillow 859 can be a pillow provided by a user.
[1136]      In this embodiment, the support element 820 and the riser element 822 are formed
as a single component and define a receiving portion 858 between the support element 820
and the riser element 822. The receiving portion 858 can be used as a shoulder relief area for
the user to place a portion of a user's arm when using the cushion system 800.           In this
embodiment, the support element 820 and the riser element 822 can collectively have a
wedge shape. Specifically, the support element 820 includes a top surface 837 that is angled
                                               30

portion (not shown). The riser foam portion can be integral with the cushion member of the
support element 820 or can alternatively be a separate foam portion or portions constructed
the same as or similar to the cushion member. An outer casing 861 can encase both cushion
member of the support member and the pillow insert and foam portion of the riser element.
The outer casing 861 can be formed with one or more materials as described above, for
example, for outer casing 121 and outer casing 127.
[1139]      The pillow insert can be disposed, for example, within a pocket formed in the riser
foam portion or can be disposed on top of the riser foam portion.       The pillow insert can
include an inner casing (not shown) and filler material (not shown) as described above for
previous embodiments such that the riser element 822 can include a compliant region to
allow a user to form cavities or bulges to accommodate specific body parts and/or portions to
accommodate the user's needs and/or preferences.
[1140]      The side support member 864 can be placed on the support element 820 during
use and used to help maintain a user in a lateral position. In alternative embodiments, the
side support member 864 can be fixedly attached to the support element 820 or integrally
formed with the support element 820. In this embodiment, the side support member 864 has
a wedge shape with a substantially triangular cross-section as shown in FIG. 40.             In
                                               31

alternative embodiments, the side support member 864 can have different shapes, sizes, and
cross-sections, such as, for example, the cross-sectional views of alternative embodiments of
a side support member 864-1, 864-2, 864-3 and 864-4 illustrated in FIGS. 42(A)-(D). The
side support member 864 can include an outer casing 865 (see, e.g., FIG. 39) and an insert
member 866 (see, e.g., FIG. 40). The outer casing 865 can be constructed, for example, the

and/or preferences.
[1157]      The inflatable air chamber 1270 can be coupled to an air pump device 1273. The
air pump device 1273 can be, for example, a manual pump in which the user can manually
pump air in and out of the inflatable air chamber 1273 and adjust the air pressure within the
inflatable air chambers 1270. In alternative embodiments, the air pump device 1273 can be
an automated pump and include controls (not shown) for the user to adjust the air pressure
within the inflatable air chamber 1270. In alternative embodiments, the riser element 1222
and the support element 1220 can each include an inflatable air chamber and two separate air
pump devices (e.g., manual or automated) can be used to pump air into and out of both the
inflatable air chambers, in a similar manner as described above for cushion system 1100.
[1158]      The cushion system 1200 can be used the same as or similar to the cushion
systems described above for previous embodiments. In this embodiment, the user can place
the cushion system 1200 on a support surface S (e.g., a bed) and can adjust the air pressure
within the air chamber 1270 such that the support element 1220 and the riser element 1222

substantially the same as a length of the support surface (e.g., bed) on which it is to be used,
or can alternatively have a torso size length as described above, for example, for cushion
systems 200 and 700.
[1159]      FIGS. 57 and 58 illustrate an embodiment of a cushion system that includes
stackable portions to allow a user to assemble the cushion system to have a desired thickness
and/or firmness. A therapeutic cushion system 1300 (also referred to herein as a "cushion
                                               37

system") includes a support element 1320 and a riser element 1322. Although not shown, the
cushion system 1300 can also include a body element as described above for previous
embodiments.     In this embodiment, the support element 1320 includes multiple stackable
support elements 1375, 1376 and 1377 and the riser element 1322 includes multiple stackable
riser elements 1378, 1379 and 1380 (collectively also referred to herein as stackable
elements).    Although the support element 1320 is shown with three stackable support
elements and the riser element 1322 is shown with three stackable riser elements, it should be
understood that more or less stackable support elements and stackable riser elements can
alternatively be included.   In addition, the support element 1320 can include a different
number of stackable support elements than the stackable riser elements of the riser element
1322.
[1160]      The stackable elements 1375-1380 can each include a cushion member encased
within an outer casing as described above for previous embodiments of a support element
(e.g., support element 123). The cushion members can be formed with, for example, one or
more foam materials, as described above, for example, for cushion member 123.            Each
stackable element 1375-1380 can have a cushion member formed with a foam material
having the same or different density.    The stackable support elements 1375-1377 can be
selectively stacked to form the support element 1320 such that the support element 1320 has
a desired height or thickness and/or a desired firmness.        Similarly, the stackable riser
members 1378-1380 can be selectively stacked to form the riser element 1322 such that the
riser element 1322 has a desired height or thickness and/or a desired firmness.
[1161]      Each of the stackable support elements 1375-1377 of the support element 1320
can include an angled top surface such that the support element 1320 has a wedge shape with
a top surface 1337 that is angled relative to a bottom surface 1339 from a first end portion
1315 to a second end portion 1316, as shown in FIG. 57. In alternative embodiments, each of
the stackable elements 1375-1377 can have a top surface that is substantially horizontal or
flat, or can have a top surface that is tiered or stepped.     Each of the stackable support
elements 1375-1377 of the support element 1320 can also include a concave portion (not
shown) at, for example, a substantially center location on the highest or second end portion
1316 of the support element 1320, and beveled or angled corners (not shown) as described
above for previous embodiments.
                                               38

[1162]      Each of the stackable elements 1378-1380 include a top surface that is at least
partially substantially horizontal or flat. In alternative embodiments, each of the stackable
elements 1378-1380 can have a top surface that is angled or can be tiered or stepped. In
some embodiments, the riser element 1322 can also include a pillow insert portion (not
shown) that can be disposed, for example, within a pocket formed in at least one of the
stackable riser elements, such as, the stackable riser element 1378 intended to be used as a
top of the riser element 1322. The pillow insert portion can include an inner casing (not
shown) and filler material (not shown) as described above for previous embodiments such
that the stackable riser element 1378 of the riser element 1322 can include a compliant region
to allow a user to form cavities or bulges to accommodate specific body parts and/or portions
to accommodate the user's needs and/or preferences. In some embodiments, the stackable
riser element 1378 may not include a pillow insert, but instead include filler material
disposed on a top portion of the cushion member of the stackable riser element 1378.
[1163]      The cushion system 1300 can be used the same as or similar to the cushion
systems described above for previous embodiments. In this embodiment, the user can place
the support element 1320 and the riser element 1322 on a support surface S (e.g., a bed) such
that the second end portion 1316 (e.g., the highest end) of the support element 1320 is
disposed at a desired distance from the riser element 1322. Thus, a receiving portion 1358
between the support element 1322 and the riser element 1320 can be defined such that the
user can place an arm within the receiving portion 1358 during use of the cushion system
 1300. For example, the user can stack one or more of the stackable support elements 1375
 1377 of the support element 1320 such that the support element 1320 is at a desired height (or
has a desired thickness), and has a desired firmness. The user can also stack one or more of
the stackable riser elements 1378-1380 of the riser element 1322 such that the riser element
1322 is at a desired height (or has a desired thickness), and has a desired firmness. The user
can stack the stackable elements 1375-1380 on the support surface S, or can stack the
stackable elements 1375-1380 first then place the assembled support element 1320 and
assembled riser element 1322 on the support surface S. As described above for previous
embodiments, the support element 1320 and the riser element 1322 can collectively have a
bed size length that is substantially the same as a length of the support surface (e.g., bed) on
which it is to be used, or can alternatively have a torso size length as described above, for
example, for cushion systems 200 and 700.
                                                39

[1164]      FIGS. 59 and 60 illustrate another embodiment of a cushion system that includes
stackable portions to allow a user to assemble the cushion system to have a desired thickness
and/or firmness. A therapeutic cushion system 1400 (also referred to herein as a "cushion
system") includes a support element 1420 and a riser element 1422 and can also include a
body element (not shown) as described above for previous embodiments.                  In this
embodiment, the support element 1420 and the riser element 1422 are formed as a single
cushion element and include multiple stackable cushion elements 1475, 1476 and 1477 that
can be stacked on top of each other to formi the support element 1420 and riser element 1422.
At least one of the stackable cushion elements 1475-1477 can define a receiving portion 1458
between the riser element 1422 and the support element 1420 in which a user can place an
arm during use of the cushion system 1400. For example, as shown in FIGS. 59-60, the
stackable cushion element 1475 defines the receiving portion 1458. Although the combined
support element 1420 and the riser element 1422 is shown with three stackable cushion
elements, it should be understood that more or less stackable cushion elements can
alternatively be included.
[1165]      The stackable cushion elements 1475-1477 can each be formed, for example,
similar to the stackable support elements and stackable riser elements described above for
cushion system 1300.      For example, the stackable cushion elements 1475-1480 can each
include a cushion member formed with one or more foam materials, as described above, for
example, for cushion member 123. Each of the cushion members 1475-1477 can be formed
with a foam material having the same or different density.
[1166]      Each cushion member 1475-1477 can also include an outer casing formed with,
for example one or more materials, as described above, for example, for outer casing 121 and
outer casing 127. Each of the cushion members 1475-1477 can include a top surface angled
relative to a bottom surface such that the support element 1420 has a wedge shape with a top
surface 1437 that is angled relative to a bottom surface 1439 from a first end portion 1415 to
a second end portion 1416, as shown in FIG. 59. In alternative embodiments, each of the
stackable elements 1475-1477 can have a top surface that is substantially horizontal or flat, or
can have a top surface that is tiered or stepped. Each of the stackable cushion elements 1475
1477 can also include a concave portion (not shown) at, for example, a substantially center
location on the highest portion of the stackable cushion element and beveled or angled
corners (not shown), as described above for previous embodiments.
                                                40

[1167]      Each of the stackable elements 1478-1380 includes a top surface that is at least
partially substantially horizontal or flat. In alternative embodiments, each of the stackable
elements 1478-1480 can have a top surface that is angled or can be tiered or stepped. As
described above for riser element 1322, the riser element 1422 can also include a pillow
insert portion (not shown) that can be disposed, for example, within a pocket formed in the
stackable cushion element 1475. The pillow insert portion can include an inner casing (not
shown) and filler material (not shown) as described above for previous embodiments such
that the riser element 1422 can include a compliant region to allow a user to form cavities or
bulges to accommodate specific body parts and/or portions to accommodate the user's needs
and/or preferences.    In some embodiments, the stackable cushion element 1475 may not
include a pillow insert, but instead include filler material disposed on a top portion of the
cushion element 1475.
[1168]      The cushion system 1400 can be used the same as or similar to the cushion system
 1300 described above. In this embodiment, the user can place the cushion system 1400 (i.e.,
collectively the support element 1420 and the riser element 1422) on a support surface S
(e.g., a bed). For example, the user can stack one or more of the stackable cushion elements
 1475-1477 such that the support element 1420 and the riser element 1422 are at a desired
height (or have a desired thickness), and have a desired firmness. As described above for
previous embodiments, the support element 1420 and the riser element 1422 collectively can
have a bed size length that is substantially the same as a length of the support surface (e.g.,
bed) on which it is to be used, or can alternatively have a torso size length as described
above, for example, for cushion systems 200 and 700.
[1169]      FIGS. 61-64 illustrate an embodiment of a cushion system that includes a support
element with side bolster portions that can be used to help maintain a user in a lateral position
on the cushion system.      A therapeutic cushion system 1500 (also referred to herein as a
"cushion system") includes a support element 1520 that can be used with a riser element
1522 (see FIG. 62), such as, for example, the riser element 1122 or 1322.           The cushion
system 1500 also includes a first side bolster portion 1582 and a second side bolster portion
 1583 disposed on an opposite side of the support element 1520. The side bolster portions
1582 and 1583 can be used to help maintain a user in a lateral position during use of the
cushion system 1500.      In this embodiment, the side bolster portions 1582 and 1583 each
include a first top surface portion 1585 and a second top surface portion 1586 disposed at a
                                               41

different angle than the first top surface portion 1586 relative to a bottom surface 1539 of the
support element 1520. The side bolster portions 1582 and 1583 also each include an angled
or beveled portion 1581 as shown for example in FIGS. 61 and 62.
[1170]      The support element 1520 also includes an angled top surface 1537, a concave
portion 1530 and beveled or angled portions 1533 at a second end of the support element
1520.    As with previous embodiments, the support element 1520 can include a cushion
member (not shown) that can be formed with, for example, one or more foam materials, and
an outer casing 1521 that can encase the cushion member and the side bolster portions 1582
and 1583. In some embodiments, the side bolster portions 1582 and 1583 can be formed with
a foam material that has a different density than the foam material forming the support
element 1520. In alternative embodiments, the side bolster portions 1582 and 1583 can each
be formed as separate components (i.e., separate from the support element 1520 similar to the
side support members 864 and 964 described above).
[1171]      The cushion system 1500 can be used the same as or similar to the cushion
systems described above for previous embodiments. For example, in this embodiment, the
user can place the support element 1520 on a support surface such that the second end (e.g.,
the highest end) of the support element 1520 is disposed at a desired distance from the riser
element 1522 (shown in FIG. 62).         Thus, a receiving portion 1558 between the support
element 1520 and the riser element 1522 can be defined such that the user can place an arm
within the receiving portion 1558 during use of the cushion system 1500. For example, the
user can position the user's body in a lateral position (i.e., either a right-side lateral position
or a left-side lateral position) and place the user's arm within the open space 1558.            An
optional body element (not shown) can also be used in the same or similar manner as
described above for previous embodiments. As described above for previous embodiments,
the support element 1520 can be sized such that the support element 1520 and the riser
element 1522 collectively have a bed size length, or can alternatively have a torso size length.
[1172]      FIGS. 65 and 66 each illustrate an embodiment of a cushion system that includes
side bolster portions. FIG. 65 illustrates a therapeutic cushion system 1600 (also referred to
herein as a "cushion system") that includes a support element 1620 and a riser element 1622
formed as a single component.         The support element 1620 and the riser element 1622
collectively define a receiving portion 1658 in which a user can place an arm during use of
the cushion system 1600. As with the previous embodiment, the cushion system 1600 also
                                                42

includes a first side bolster portion 1682 and a second side bolster portion (not shown in
FIG.65) on an opposite side of the support element 1620 that can each be used to help
maintain a user in a lateral position during use of the cushion system 1600. As with the
previous embodiment, the first side bolster portion 1682 and the second side bolster portion
(not shown) each include a first top surface portion 1685 and a second top surface portion
 1686 disposed at a different angle than the first top surface portion 1685 relative to a bottom
surface 1639 of the support element 1620. The first side bolster portion 1682 (and the second
side bolster portion) also each include an angled or beveled portion 1681.
[1173]      The support element 1620 includes an angled top surface 1637, and can include a
concave portion (not shown) at a second end of the support element 1620, as described above
for previous embodiments. As with previous embodiments, the support element 1620 can
include a cushion member (not shown) that can be formed with, for example, one or more
foam materials, and an outer casing 1661 can encase the cushion member, the first side
bolster portion 1682 and the second side bolster portion (not shown). The outer casing 1661
can also encase a cushion member (not shown) and pillow insert portion (not shown) of the
riser element 1622.
[1174]      FIG. 66 illustrates a therapeutic cushion system 1700 (also referred to herein as a
"cushion system") that includes a support element 1720 and a riser element 1722 formed as
single component. The support element 1720 and the riser element 1722 collectively define a
receiving portion 1758 in which a user can place an arm during use of the cushion system
1700. As with the previous embodiment, the cushion system 1700 also includes a first side
bolster portion 1782 and a second side bolster portion (not shown in FIG.66) on an opposite
side of the support element 1720 that can each be used to help maintain a user in a side
position during use of the cushion system 1700. As with the previous embodiment, the first
side bolster portion 1782 and the second side bolster portion (not shown) each include a first
top surface portion 1785 and a second top surface portion 1786 disposed at a different angle
than the first top surface portion 1785 relative to a bottom surface 1739 of the support
element 1720. The first side bolster portion 1782 (and the second side bolster portion) also
each include an angled or beveled portion 1781.
[1175]      The support element 1720 includes an angled top surface 1737, and can include a
concave portion (not shown) at a second end of the support element 1720 as described above
for previous embodiments. As with previous embodiments, the support element 1720 can
                                                43

include a cushion member (not shown) that can be formed with, for example, one or more
foam materials, and an outer casing 1761 can encase the cushion member, the first side
bolster portion 1782 and the second side bolster portion (not shown). The outer casing 1761
can also encase a cushion member (not shown) and pillow insert portion (not shown) of the
riser element 1722.
[1176]       The cushion systems 1600 and 1700 can each be used in the same or similar
manner as described above for previous embodiments of a cushion system. For example, the
user can place the cushion system 1600 or 1700 (i.e., the support element 1620, 1720 and the
riser element 1622, 1722) on a support surface and the user can position the user's body in a
side position (i.e., either a right-side lateral position or a left-side lateral position) and place
the user's arm within the receiving portion 1658 or 1758. As described above for previous
embodiments, the cushion system 1600 (i.e., the support element 1620 and the riser element
1622 collectively) and the cushion system 1700 (i.e., the support element 1720 and the riser
element 1722 collectively) can have a bed size length, or can alternatively have a torso size
length.   An optional body element (not shown) can also be used in the same or similar
manner as described above for previous embodiments.
[1177]       FIGS. 67-70 illustrate another embodiment of a cushion system with a side bolster
portion. In this embodiment, a therapeutic cushion system 1800 (also referred to herein as a
"cushion system") includes a support element 1820 and a riser element 1822 formed as a
single component. The support element 1820 and the riser element 1822 collectively define a
receiving portion 1858 in which a user can place an arm during use of the cushion system
 1800. The cushion system 1800 also includes a side bolster portion 1882 disposed on one
side of the support element 1820. The side bolster portion 1882 can be used to help maintain
a user in a right-side position during use of the cushion system 1800. In this embodiment, the
side bolster 1882 includes a first top surface portion 1885 and a second top surface portion
 1886 disposed at a different angle than the first top surface portion 1885 relative to a bottom
surface 1839 of the support element 1820.
[1178]       The support element 1820 includes an angled top surface 1837 and a concave
portion 1830 at a second end of the support element 1820 as described above for previous
embodiments.      As with previous embodiments, the support element 1820 can include a
cushion member (not shown) that can be formed with, for example, one or more foam
materials, and an outer casing 1861 (see, e.g., FIGS. 67 and 70) can encase the cushion
                                                  44

member and the side bolster portion 1882. The outer casing 1861 can also encase a cushion
member (not shown) and pillow insert portion (not shown) of the riser element 1822. In this
embodiment, the side bolster 1882 includes a first top surface portion and a second top
surface portion angled at a different angle than the first top surface portion relative to a
bottom surface 1839 of the support element 1820.
[1179]      The cushion system 1800 can be used in the same or similar manner as described
above for previous embodiments of a cushion system. For example, the user can place the
cushion system 1800 (i.e., the support element 1820 and the riser element 1822) on a support
surface. In this embodiment, the user can position the user's body in a right-side position and
place the user's right arm within the open space 1858. An optional body element (not shown)
can also be used in the same or similar manner as described above for previous embodiments.
[1180]      The cushion system 1800 (i.e., the support element 1820 and the riser element
1822 collectively) has a bed size length. FIGS. 71-74 illustrate a cushion system 1900 (also
referred to herein as a "cushion system") that can be configured the same as or similar to the
cushion system 1800 but has a torso size length. The cushion system 1900 includes a support
element 1920, a riser element 1922, and a side bolster 1982. The support element 1920 and
the riser element 1922 are formed as a single component and collectively define a receiving
portion 1958 in which a user can place an arm during use of the cushion system 1900. The
side bolster portion 1982 is disposed on one side of the support element 1920 and can be used
to help maintain a user in a right-side position during use of the cushion system 1900. In this
embodiment, the side bolster 1982 includes an angled top surface 1985 that is angled relative
to a bottom surface 1939 of the support element 1920. As shown for example, in FIGS.71
and 72, the side bolster 1982 extends beyond a tail or foot end of the support element 1920.
[1181]      The support element 1920 includes an angled top surface 1937 and a concave
portion 1930 at a second end of the support element 1920 as described above for previous
embodiments.      As with previous embodiments, the support element 1920 can include a
cushion member (not shown) that can be formed with, for example, one or more foam
materials, and an outer casing 1961 (see, e.g., FIGS. 71 and 74) can encase the cushion
member and the side bolster portion 1982. The outer casing 1961 can also encase a cushion
member (not shown) and pillow insert portion (not shown) of the riser element 1922.
                                                45

[1182]      The cushion system 1900 can be used in the same or similar manner as described
above for previous embodiments of a cushion system. For example, the user can place the
cushion system 1900 (i.e., the support element 1920 and the riser element 1922) on a support
surface. In this embodiment, the user can position the user's body in a right-side position on
the cushion system 1900 and place the user's right arm within the open space 1958. An
optional body element (not shown) can also be used in the same or similar manner as
described above for previous embodiments.
[1183]      Although cushion system 1800 and cushion system 1900 are described above as
having a side bolster portion on one side of the cushion system 1800, 1900 such that the user
can be positioned on the cushion system 1800, 1900 in a right-side position with the user's
right arm within the open space 1858, 1958, in alternative embodiments, the cushion systems
1800 and 1900 can be configured such that the user can be positioned in a left-side position
on the cushion system 1800, 1900. For example, the cushion system 1800 and the cushion
system 1900 can each alternatively include a side bolster portion on the left side of the
cushion system and an open space disposed such that a user can be positioned on the cushion
system in a left-side position with the user's left arm within the open space. An example of
such an embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 75. As shown in FIG. 75, a therapeutic cushion
system 2000 (also referred to herein as a "cushion system") can include a support element
2020 and a riser element 2020 that collectively define a receiving portion 2058 and a side
bolster portion 2082. The cushion system 2000 can include features the same as or similar to,
and function the same as or similar to, the cushion systems 1800 and 1900.
[1184]      FIGS. 76, 77 and 78(A)-78(E) each illustrate a different embodiment of a support
element that includes a non-slip feature and that can be included in a cushion system as
described herein. The non-slip surface feature(s) can be disposed on a top surface of support
element and/or on a bottom surface of a side support member (e.g., 864, 964) or a bolster
member (e.g., 1582, 1583).     For example, a non-slip surface feature can be disposed on a
bottom surface of a side support member (or separate bolster member) and/or on a top surface
of the support element on which the side support element is to be disposed. Thus, a non-slip
surface feature(s) can also be used, for example, to maintain a side support member (e.g.,
864, 964) or a separate bolster member (e.g., 1582, 1583) in a desired position on a support
element. A non-slip surface feature(s) can also be used, for example, to maintain a body
                                               46

element in a desired position on a support element and/or to help maintain a user in a desired
position on the support element.
[1185]       A non-slip feature can include, for example, a patterned tactile treatment used to
create a non-slip surface.     The patterned treatment can include, for example, ink, rubber,
silicone, or other suitable material(s), which can be, for example, digitally printed, screen
printed, sprayed, brushed, ironed on, sewn on, or otherwise applied to at least a portion of the
material on the top surface of a support element. The non-slip surface treatment can include,
for example, straight lines, curved lines, diagonal lines, various shapes, such as, for example,
squares, circles, rectangles, blocks, polygons, ellipses, etc. and/or other ambiguous shapes. In
some embodiments, the non-slip surface treatment can include a grooved or grid-like pattern.
In some embodiments, the non-slip surface treatment can be applied as a flat or smooth
surface, or can be applied such that the non-slip surface is raised with respect to the surface to
which it is applied. FIGS. 76, 77 and 78(A)-78(E) illustrate some example patterns and
configurations for a non-slip surface, and it should be understood that other patterns and
configurations can alternatively be included.
[1186]       Each embodiment of a support element described with reference to FIGS. 76, 77
and 78(A)-78(E) can include the same or similar features, and can function the same or
similar to, other embodiments of a support element described herein, and therefore certain
details are not described with reference to FIGS. 76, 77 and 78(A)-78(E).       Further, although
not shown with respect to other embodiments of a support element described herein, it should
be understood that other embodiments of a support element can include non-slip features as
described with respect to FIGS. 76, 77 and 78(A)-78(E).
[1187]       FIG. 76 illustrates a support element 2620 that includes two non-slip surface
features A disposed on lateral sides of the top surface of the support element 2620, and a non
slip surface feature B disposed on a center portion of the top surface. In this embodiment, the
non-slip surface feature A can be used, for example, to help maintain a body element (not
shown) in a desired position on the support element 2624. The non-slip surface treatment B
can be used, for example, to retain a user of the support element 2524 in a desired position
substantially centered on the support element 2624 and also can help prevent or reduce the
tendency of the user to slide down an angled top surface of the support element. FIG. 77
illustrates a support element 2720 that includes only two non-slip surface features A disposed
on lateral sides of the top surface of the support element 2720. In this embodiment the non
                                                47

slip surface features A can function in the same manner as described above for the non-slip
surface features A of support element 2620. This embodiment also illustrates an example of
an applied non-slip pattern.    FIGS. 78(A)-78(F) each illustrate a top view of a different
embodiment of a support element having various different non-slip surface features.
[1188]      FIGS. 79 and 80 illustrate a therapeutic cushion system that includes a side
extension element. A side extension element can be coupled to a support element to provide
a larger width to support the user's body and/or to support a body element if the user's body
is occupying a large portion of the support element. As shown in FIG. 79, a therapeutic
cushion system 2800 includes a support element 2820, a riser element 2822 and a side
extension element 2887. The support element 2820 and the riser element 2822 can be formed
the same as or similar to, and function the same as or similar to, previous embodiments (e.g.,
support element 220 and riser element 222) described herein and are, therefore, not described
in detail with reference to FIGS. 79 and 80.
[1189]      The side extension element 2887 includes a first extension member 2888, a
second extension member 2889, and a connecting strap 2890 extending between the first
extension member 2888 and the second extension member 2889, as shown in FIG. 80. The
side extension element 2887 can be fixedly or removably coupled to the support element
2820, as shown in FIG. 79, such that the first extension member 2888 is disposed on a first
lateral side of the support element 2820 and the second extension member 2889 is disposed
on an opposite second lateral side of the support element 2820.
[1190]      The first extension member 2888 and the second extension member 2889 can each
be constructed the same as or similar to a support element (e.g., support element 120) as
described herein. For example, the first extension member 2888 and the second extension
member 2889 can each have an angled top surface (e.g., wedge shape), for example, that
substantially matches the angle of the support element 2820.           For example, in some
embodiments, the first extension member 2888 and the second extension member 2889 can
each have a top surface that has an angle between 6 degrees and 30 degrees relative to a
bottom surface.
[1191]      The first extension member 2888 and the second extension member 2889 can each
be a variety of different lengths, widths and/or thicknesses. For example, the first extension
member 2888 and the second extension member 2889 can each have a torso length or can
                                               48

(not shown in FIGS. 79 and 80) on the support element 2820 (e.g., similar to the buttons 228
on support element 220 described above).         For example, in some embodiments, the side
extension element 2887 can be coupled to the support element 2820 using the same buttons
as used to couple the riser element 2822 to the support element 2820. In some embodiments,
a different set of buttons can be used. In alternative embodiments, other coupling methods
                                                49

can be used to couple the straps 2892 to the support element 2820, such as, for example, hook
and loop fasteners, snaps, strings or ties, zippers, or any other suitable coupling method.
[1195]       The connecting strap 2890 can be formed with, for example, an elastic material,
such that the connecting straps 2890 can hold each of the first and second extension members
2888 and 2889 substantially tight against the support element 2820. Each of the first and
second extension members 2888 and 2889 can also include a non-slip surface treatment 2894
(only shown on extension member 2889 in FIG. 80) as described above for previous
embodiments of a support element.
