 [0 0 0 6]
           Accordingly, the present invention has its                  aim to provide
an illumination          device that       can fully   meet the demand of viewers
who want to enjoy viewing paintings or the like with sound
providing a great sense of ambience,                   and a frame provided with
the illumination device.
SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS
 [0007]
           (1) An illumination device of the present invention
includes a signal reception unit                   capable of receiving an audio
signal from outside, a musical piece extraction unit capable
of extracting          continuous consonant sounds in              the audio signal
as a musical piece,            a performance state         detection unit      capable
of detecting start/end of performance of the musical piece
according to a result of extraction by the musical piece
extraction       unit,    a first   illumination        lamp capable of radiating
ultraviolet rays, a second illumination lamp capable of
radiating       white light,      and an illumination        control unit      capable
of controlling on/off of the first illumination lamp, and of
                                               3

controlling on/off and illuminance of the second illumination
lamp,   where the illumination control unit controls the second
illumination lamp to repeat a pattern in which illuminance is
gradually increased in a first   predetermined period of time that
is set in advance starting from an off state, maximum
illuminance is maintained in a second predetermined period of
time that is set in advance and that follows the first
predetermined period of time, the illuminance is gradually
reduced in a third predetermined period of time that is      set in
advance and that follows the second predetermined period of time,
and the off state is maintained in a fourth predetermined period
of time that is set in advance and that follows the third
predetermined period of time,     controls the first  illumination
lamp to repeat a pattern of being turned off in a fifth
predetermined period of time that is set in advance and that
is during a time when the second illumination lamp is turned
on, and being turned on in a sixth predetermined period of time
that is   set in advance and that includes a time when the second
illumination lamp is turned off, causes the first    and the second
illumination lamps to be turned on in     response to detection of
the start   of performance by the performance state detection unit,
and causes the first and the second illumination lamps to be
turned off in    response to detection of the end of performance
by the performance state detection unit.        The "audio signal"
here refers to a signal of a musical piece to which noises are
                                  4

added, and in the present invention, continuous                           consonant
sounds in      the audio signal are extracted                 by the musical piece
extraction unit as the sound of a musical piece, but
discontinuous dissonant sounds in               the audio signal are treated
as the sound of people walking or environmental sound and are
not extracted by the musical piece extraction unit.
 [0008]
           According to the configuration of                   (1), the second
illumination       lamp,   which is    capable of radiating            white light,
repeats a predetermined control pattern of increasing and
reducing the illuminance over time,                 and the first      illumination
lamp, which is       capable of radiating         ultraviolet       rays,    is   turned
off during a predetermined period of time when the second
illumination       lamp is   turned on.      Accordingly, by being used on
a painting      or the like      which is  partially          painted with special
paint that emits light or reflects ultraviolet rays when
irradiated      with ultraviolet       rays,     the illumination          device may
allow a viewer to perceive a change in the expression of the
painting      or the like    with a great sense of ambience and a great
sense of surprise, and may thus offer the viewer deep
relaxation.
 [0009]
           Furthermore,    according to the configuration of                    (1), the
illumination control unit causes the first and the second
illumination       lamps to be turned on in            response to detection of
                                          5

the start       of performance by the performance state             detection unit,
and causes the first and the second illumination lamps to be
turned off in          response to detection of the end of performance
by the performance state detection unit,                     and thus the past
demand of viewers who wanted to enjoy viewing a painting                        or the
like     while listening       to a musical piece,         with sound providing
a great sense of ambience, may be fully met.                        Accordingly,
viewers may experience even deeper relaxation                      by listening      to
a musical piece while viewing a painting or the like.
 [0010]
           (2) According to the illumination device of                      (1),
preferably,        the musical piece extraction            unit    includes a data
conversion unit capable of generating frequency data by
applying Fourier transform on data of the audio signal,                         a band
extraction        unit    capable of extracting         data of a specific        band
corresponding to the continuous consonant                       sounds from the
frequency data, and a musical piece presence determination unit
for determining that           the musical piece is        present in       the audio
signal,      in   response to extraction           of the data of the specific
band by the band extraction unit.
 [0011]
           According to the configuration of                (2),   since there is
provided the band extraction           unit     that   is capable of extracting
data of a specific band corresponding to the continuous
consonant sounds            from the frequency data, the musical piece
                                          6

presence determination unit may easily determine whether a
musical piece is      present in      the audio signal or not simply based
on the result of extraction by the band extraction unit.
 [0012]
            (3) According to the illumination device of               (2),
preferably, the performance state detection unit detects the
start of performance when the musical piece presence
determination unit       determines that       the musical piece is      present
in    the audio signal,     and detects       the end of performance when
a state where the data of the specific band is not extracted
by the band extraction        unit     continues for a period of time that
is set in advance.
 [0013]
          According to the configuration of              (3),  the performance
state     detection unit  may easily       detect start/end      of performance
according to each output of the musical piece presence
determination unit/the band extraction unit.
 [0014]

by selecting      from the plurality      of control patterns      and performs
control according to the one control pattern selected.
 [0015]
          According to the configuration of               (4),  since there is
                                          7

provided the storage device storing a plurality of control
patterns, and one of the plurality of control patterns is
selected     and control is performed according to the one control
pattern selected, variations in the temporal changes of one
painting or the like may be increased.
 [0016]

transmission device, where the illumination control unit
performs selection of a control pattern according to the
operation signal.
 [0017]
         The configuration of      (5) is quite convenient in that,
because the control pattern       may be selected    by operation of the
transmission device, an arbitrary control pattern may be
selected     by operation from a sofa away from the painting      or the
like, for example.

on the rear side surface of the front-side attachment member
8.

        Furthermore,      the ultraviolet           lamp 15 and the incandescent
lamps 16 to 19 of the illumination                   device 1 are controlled          by
the control circuit       built    into    the device main body 2.             As shown
in Fig. 4, the control circuit includes a CPU                           (Central
Processing Unit) 23, and operating power is supplied thereto
by a power supply circuit 22 to which power is supplied by a
commercial power supply 20 via a main switch 21.                         Furthermore,
the CPU 23 includes a storage unit,                   which is    a storage device
 (memory), as described later, and is connected to the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 by a first                    driver    circuit      24 to a
fourth driver     circuit     27,  respectively.            Also, the ultraviolet
lamp 15 is    connected to the commercial power supply 20 via the
main switch 21 and a switching element 30.                         The switching
element 30 is controlled by the CPU 23.
 [0034]
        Moreover,      as shown in      Fig.     4,   a remote control receiver
unit  28 serving as a reception device is                     connected to the CPU
                                           14

23.      The remote control receiver unit 28 receives operation
signals issued by a remote control transmitter                       unit    29 serving
as a transmission device,         and supplies the signals to the CPU
23.      The CPU 23 is configured to enable various settings
described later according to the operation signals.
Furthermore,       as shown in  Fig.    4,   a signal reception unit                50 is
connected to the CPU 23.        The signal reception unit                  50 receives
an analog audio signal,        which is       a musical piece with noises
added thereto, from outside via a microphone                          (not shown),
converts the signal into        a digital       audio signal,             and supplies
the digital audio signal to the CPU 23.
 [0035]
           Each of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 is                   controlled      by
the CPU 23 and the corresponding one of the driver                         circuits     24
to 27 to repeat turning on and off (see the graphs in                         Figs.  8 (a)
to 8(c))     .   As shown in Fig.   4,     each of the driver              circuits     24
to 27 is configured from an NPN control transistor 24a whose
base terminal is connected to the CPU 23, and a PNP driver
transistor       24b whose base terminal is          connected to a collector
terminal       of the control transistor          24a.        An emitter terminal
of the control transistor       24a is     grounded.          Also, a power supply
voltage Ve is supplied to an emitter terminal of the driver
transistor       24b.   Moreover,   as shown in            Fig.    4,    each of the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 has its            positive         terminal connected
to a collector        terminal of the driver            transistor         24b and its
                                        15

negative terminal grounded.
 [0036]
          Furthermore,      the CPU 23 is    provided with a storage unit
 (not shown) serving as a storage device (memory).                For example,
the illuminance values of the ultraviolet lamp 15 and the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 responsive to temporal changes,                   that
is,    the control patterns,       are stored in      advance in   the storage
unit as first to third control patterns.                  Moreover, as shown
in   Fig.  2,   a first    switch 31 to a third       switch 33 are provided
to the remote control transmitter unit 29.                    The first switch
31 is for issuing operation signals for starting or stopping
operation of the CPU 23.           The second switch 32 is         for issuing
operation signals for stopping each of the incandescent lamps
16 to 19 whose illuminance is being gradually increased or
reduced and the ultraviolet           lamp 15 which is        turned on or off
so that the illuminance at the time is maintained, and for
releasing      the stopped state.       The third    switch 33 is   for issuing
an operation signal for selecting a specific control pattern
from a plurality        of control patterns,      stored in the storage unit,
regarding the timings of turning on or off the incandescent
lamps 16 to 19 and the ultraviolet            lamp 15.     Moreover,   as shown
in   Fig.   2,  the remote control transmitter           unit   29 is  provided
with an error lamp 34           for displaying to an effect that a
predetermined operation of the illumination device 1 is not
performed due to short-circuiting              of the circuit     or the like.

 [0037]
          Furthermore,       the illumination         device 1 is        provided with
a first lamp 35          (see Fig. 1) serving as an indicator lamp for
displaying, by being in a light-on state or light-off state,
that     the CPU 23 is      operating,       and that     the incandescent lamps
16 to 19 and the ultraviolet lamp 15 are maintained at the
illuminance at the time point.                  That is, the first lamp 35 is
configured to be on in            a case where the incandescent                  lamps 16
to 19 and the ultraviolet lamp 15 are maintained at the
illuminance at the time point by operation of the second switch
32 provided to the remote control transmitter                      unit      29 (stopped
state),      and to be off when the stopped state                  is    released.       In
addition to the first           lamp 35,    the illumination         device 1 is     also
provided with a second lamp 36,                as shown in      Fig. 1.        The second
lamp 36 is     for indicating,        by the emission color, which control
pattern     the control pattern         which is      currently       selected     by the
third     switch 33 provided to the remote control transmitter                       unit
29 is, and is an indicator lamp constituting the present
invention.        Moreover, the second lamp 36 is configured to be
turned on in red when the first control pattern is selected,
to be turned on in green when the second control pattern is
selected,      and to be turned on in           orange when the third             control
pattern     is selected,       for example.       Additionally, the first            lamp
35 and the second lamp 36 provided to the illumination                             device
1 in    the above manner may alternatively                 be provided to a frame

         Fig. 5 is a block diagram showing an internal
configuration of the CPU 23.                   As shown in Fig. 5, the CPU 23
includes a musical piece extraction                    unit   60,   and a performance
state    detection unit           70.   The musical piece extraction            unit 60
is for extracting, as a musical piece, continuous consonant
sounds     (hereinafter          also referred     to as continuous sounds)          in
a digital audio signal which has been digitally converted by
the signal reception unit 50,                   and includes a fast Fourier
transformer         (hereinafter       also referred        to as FFT)    61 as a data
conversion unit,           a band extraction       unit     62,   and a musical piece
presence determination unit 63.                    The FFT       (Fast Fourier
Transformer) 61 receives the digital audio signal from the
signal reception unit              50,  applies the Fourier transform on the
digital     audio signal,           and generates frequency data.              The band
extraction unit 62 extracts data of a specific band
corresponding to the continuous sounds from the frequency data.
Here,    as the specific           band,   the audible range of human beings
may be cited.           As the audible range of human beings,              a frequency
band of 27.5 Hz to             4186 Hz,   which is      the range of the notes of
a piano, may be cited, but the frequency band is not limited
to 27.5 Hz to 4186 Hz as long as it                 is   audible to human beings.
The musical piece presence determination unit 63 determines
that    the musical piece is            present in       the digital     audio signal
                                              18

in    response to extraction          of data of the specific        band by the
band extraction unit 62.               When the musical piece presence
determination unit 63 determines that the musical piece is
present in the digital audio signal, the performance                        state
detection unit         70 detects     start     of performance of the musical
piece.        On the other hand,      in    a case where the state      where data
of the specific band is not extracted by the band extraction
unit     62 continues for a period of time that              is  set in  advance,
the performance state detection unit 70 detects end of
performance of the musical piece.                   The period of time that       is
set in advance here may be three seconds,                     for example.
Furthermore, the CPU 23 turns on the ultraviolet lamp 15 and
the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 at the same time as start of
performance of the musical piece is                detected, and turns off the
ultraviolet        lamp 15 and the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 at the
same time as end of performance of the musical piece is                 detected.
Additionally, the timing of turning off the lamps is                  not limited
to the time of end of performance,                 and the lamps may be turned
off when a predetermined period of time has passed from the end
of performance.          It is   also possible to turn off the lamps before
the end of performance by a predetermined period of time.

            Fig.  6 is  a flow chart showing operation of the control
circuit       of the illumination           device.    As shown in    Fig.   6,
according to the illumination device 1, when the main switch
                                             19

21 is     switched on,      the CPU 23 starts       operation in          step Sl,       and
in    step S2,   determines whether the first             switch 31 is         operated
or not.      Then,    if  there is   no operation of the first               switch 31,
the process stays in          step S2,     and if   there is      operation of the
first     switch 31,     the process proceeds to step S3.                   In step S3,
the process proceeds to a routine process 1 (see Fig. 7) .                           Then,
when the routine process 1 is complete, the process proceeds
to step S4.       In step S4,    the CPU 23 performs a light-on               operation
according to an initial           condition stored in            the storage unit.
Then, in step S5, whether execution of a control pattern is
selected by the second switch 32 or not is determined.                                   If
execution of a control pattern is not                   selected, the process
proceeds to step S10,          and if   execution of a control pattern                     is
selected,      the process proceeds to step S6.                In   step S6,       the CPU
23 determines which control pattern                is  selected,         and proceeds
to step S7 if       the first     control pattern        is   selected,        proceeds
to step S8 if the second control pattern is selected, and
proceeds to step S9 if           the third      control pattern          is   selected.
In    step S7,   data of the first        control pattern          is   read from the
storage unit       and is    executed,     and the process proceeds to step
S10.      In step S8,      data of the second control pattern                     is    read
from the storage unit          and is  executed,      and the process proceeds
to step S10.        In   step S9,   data of the third          control pattern             is
read from the storage unit and is executed, and the process
proceeds to step S10.            Then,   in   step S10,     the current lighting
                                           20

state is   stored in     the storage unit        as the initial           condition,
and the process returns after proceeding to step Sl.

        Fig.   7 is   a flow chart showing operation of the control
circuit in the routine process 1.               As shown in Fig. 7, in the
routine process 1,       the CPU 23 starts        operation in         step T1,      and
in step T2,      determines whether the digital audio signal is
received by the FFT 61.           Then,    if  the digital        audio signal is
not received,      the process stays in         step T2,      and if    the digital
audio signal is       received,    the process proceeds to step T3.                    In
step T3, the FFT 61 applies the Fourier transform on the digital
audio signal,      and generates frequency data.                Then,    in  step T4,
the CPU 23 determines whether data of the specific band is
extracted from the frequency data by the band extraction                           unit
62 or not.      If   data of the specific         band is       extracted,      it     is
determined that the musical piece is present in the digital
audio signal,       and the process proceeds to step T8,                 and if    data
of the specific       band is   not extracted,        the process proceeds to
step T5.     In   step T5,    the performance state            detection unit          70
determines whether a state           where data of the specific               band is
not extracted has continued for a period of time that is set
in  advance     (three seconds)       or not.      If    this    state     has not
continued for the period of time that                 is   set in     advance,     step
T5 is   repeated,     and if   it  has continued for the period of time
that is set in advance, the process proceeds to step T6.                               In
                                        21

step T6, the performance state detection unit 70 detects end
of performance of the musical piece,              and the process proceeds
to step T7.      In   step T7,   the CPU 23 turns off the incandescent
lamps 16 to 19 and the ultraviolet             lamp 15.   Then, in  step T8,
the performance state detection unit 70 detects start of
performance of the musical piece,             and the routine process 1 is
ended,     and the process proceeds to step T9 to proceed to step
S4    in Fig. 6.

          Figs. 8(a) to 8(c) are graphs showing examples of a change
over time in the illuminance of the ultraviolet lamp and the
incandescent lamps.           Fig. 8(a) shows a change over time at the
time of execution of the first        control pattern.      Fig. 8(b) shows
a change over time at the time of execution of the second control
pattern.      Fig.   8(c)   shows a   change over time at the time        of
execution of the third control pattern.                 According to the
illumination device 1, at the time of execution of the first
control pattern, as shown in Fig. 8(a),               when the main switch
21 is switched on to operate the power supply circuit 22 and
also the first      switch 31 of the remote control transmitter         unit
29 is    operated, each of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 is         placed
in   an on state    (is  turned on)    after    a lapse of a predetermined
period of time        (in this example,        20 seconds),  and the
illuminance is gradually increased in a first predetermined
period of time a (in      this   example,    20 seconds) to reach its  peak.
                                       22

Then, when a second predetermined period of time b                             (in this
example,      25 seconds) has passed after               the peak has been reached,
each of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 has                           its illuminance
gradually reduced in           a third    predetermined period of time c (in
this     example,   20 seconds)         to reach an off state            (to be turned
off),     and is placed in an on state after a lapse of a fourth
predetermined period of time d (in                    this    example,    20 seconds),
and control is performed to repeat these states.

          Also, as shown in       Fig. 8 (a),     in    the first    control pattern,
the ultraviolet lamp 15                is controlled to repeat a control
pattern     in  which it    is   turned off during a fifth              predetermined
period of time e,         which is       set in    advance and which is          during
the time when the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 are turned on (i.e.
the fifth      predetermined period of time e is                    the time from the
lapse of half of the first predetermined period of time a to

remote control transmitter unit 29 is operated, each of the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 is           placed in    an on state    (is    turned
on) after a lapse of a predetermined period of time                      (in this
example, 50      seconds),      and the illuminance is gradually
increased in     the first      predetermined period of time a           (in  this
example,    30 seconds)      to reach its     peak.    Then,  when the second
predetermined period of time b             (in   this  example,    35 seconds)
has passed after the peak has been reached, each of the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 has its illuminance gradually
reduced in     the third      predetermined period of time c             (in  this
example,    30 seconds)      to reach an off state       (to be turned off),
and is placed in an on state after a lapse of the fourth
predetermined period of time d (in              this  example,    50 seconds),
and control is performed to repeat these states.
 [0044]
        Also, as shown in Fig. 8(b),        in the second control pattern,
the ultraviolet lamp 15            is controlled to repeat a control
pattern   in which it     is  turned off during the fifth       predetermined
period of time e,        which is    set in    advance and which is         during
the time when the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 are turned on (i.e.
the fifth    predetermined period of time e is             the time from the
                                        24

lapse of half of the first predetermined period of time a to
the lapse of half        of the third      predetermined period of time c:
in  this   example,     65 seconds),    and is      turned on during the sixth
predetermined period of time f,            which is      set in advance and which
includes the time when the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 are turned
off (i.e.     the sixth     predetermined period of time f is                the time
from the lapse of half        of the third       predetermined period of time
c to   the lapse of half      of the first       predetermined period of time
a of the next control pattern:               in   this    example,    80 seconds)
 [0045]
         Moreover,    according to the illumination              device 1,        at the
time of execution of the third           control pattern,         as shown in       Fig.
8 (c),   when the main switch 21 is         switched on to operate the power
supply circuit 22 and also the first switch 31 of the remote
control transmitter unit 29 is operated, each of the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 is            placed in       an on state    (is     turned
on) after a lapse of a predetermined period of time                          (in this
example, 100 seconds),           and the illuminance is gradually
increased in      the first    predetermined period of time a                 (in   this
example,     60 seconds)     to reach its        peak.     Then,  when the second
predetermined period of time b                (in   this   example,    40 seconds)
has passed after the peak has been reached, each of the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 has its illuminance gradually
reduced in      the third     predetermined period of time c                 (in    this
example,     60 seconds)     to reach an off state            (to be turned off),
                                         25

and is placed in an on state after a lapse of the fourth
predetermined period of time d (in                 this   example,   100 seconds),
and control is performed to repeat these states.
 [0046]
           Also, as shown in      Fig. 8 (c),    in   the third   control pattern,
the ultraviolet lamp 15             is controlled to repeat a control
pattern      in which it    is  turned off during the fifth          predetermined
period of time e,          which is    set in     advance and which is        during
the time when the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 are turned on (i.e.
the fifth       predetermined period of time e is                the time from the
lapse of half of the first predetermined period of time a to
the lapse of half         of the third       predetermined period of time c:
in   this   example,     100 seconds),      and is     turned on during the sixth
predetermined period of time f,              which is     set in advance and which
includes the time when the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 are turned
off (i.e.       the sixth     predetermined period of time f is            the time
from the lapse of half          of the third      predetermined period of time
c to the lapse of half          of the first      predetermined period of time
a of the next control pattern:                in  this    example,   160 seconds)
 [0047]
           Additionally, the time when the ultraviolet lamp 15 is
turned off         (the fifth predetermined period of time e) may be
controlled        to be longer than the time when the illuminance of
each of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 is maintained at its
peak, that is, the second predetermined period of time b as
                                           26

described above, but it may alternatively coincide with the
second predetermined period of time b,                       as shown in   Fig.   9(a),
or it may be controlled to be shorter than the second
predetermined period of time b,                  as shown in       Fig.  9(b) .   Also,
the illuminance of the ultraviolet lamp 15 may be controlled
to be higher, equal to, or lower than the peak of the illuminance
of each of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19.
 [0048]
            That is,   according to the illumination              device 1,   when the
main switch 21 is            operated to be on and the first             switch 31 of
the remote control transmitter unit 29 is operated, the
ultraviolet         lamp 15 is   turned on, and also the CPU 23 is           operated
by the power supply circuit               22,    and the incandescent lamps 16
to 19 and the ultraviolet              lamp 15 are repeatedly turned on and
off according to any of the first                 to the third      control patterns
shown in      Figs.    8 (a)   to 8 (c),  respectively,          which are stored in
the     storage unit         (not shown)     of the CPU 23.          At this    time,
illuminance values are read from the storage unit                         (not shown)
by the CPU 23 according to the lapse of time, and the base current
of the control transistor              24a is     controlled      by a DA converter,
not shown,       provided to the CPU 23.                 Then,  the current flowing
from the emitter of the driver                transistor       24b to the collector
is    changed,      and the value of current              (illuminance)    flowing to
each of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 is controlled.
 [0049]
                                            27

        Additionally, to stop changing the illuminance of the
incandescent lamps 16 to 19 and the ultraviolet                         lamp 15 during
control of the illuminance and to maintain the illuminance at
the time point, the second switch 32 provided to the remote
control transmitter          unit     29 is      operated.      Moreover,     to change
 (select) the control pattern of change of the illuminance of
the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 and the ultraviolet lamp 15,
the third switch 33 is operated.
 [0050]
        As described above,            according to the illumination             device
1 of the present invention including each of the incandescent
lamps 16 to 19 whose illuminance is changed according to a
predetermined control pattern                 and the ultraviolet         lamp 15 which
is turned on or off according to a change in the illuminance
of the incandescent          lamps 16 to 19,             when only the ultraviolet
lamp 15 is turned on and the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 are
turned off,       the entire      painting        P is    seen to be quite dark,      as
shown in    Fig. 10.      Also, at this          time,     the crescent moon-shaped
figure P2,      the figure P3 indicating               light   of a light    house,  and
the figure P4, which is a reflection of the moonlight on the
surface of the sea, which are painted with special painting                         that
is  caused to emit or reflect              light    by the ultraviolet        rays from
the ultraviolet       lamp 15,       are shown shining brighter              than other
parts painted with other paints.                      Accordingly, at this time,
the painting P is viewed as showing a nighttime scenery.
                                              28

 [0051]
        Then, when a predetermined period of time passes from this
state,   the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 are turned on and their
illuminance is    gradually increased,        as shown in      Figs.    8(a) to
8 (c) .  When the illuminance of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19
is increased, the brightness of the entire painting P is
increased little    by little.   At this      time,   the figures P2,        P3,
and P4 painted with the special paint gradually become
unrecognizable,    and then, when the ultraviolet          lamp 15 is    turned
off and the illuminance of the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 reach
its maximum, the figures P2,        P3, and P4 become entirely
unrecognizable.     Accordingly,     the entire     painting      P is   viewed
as showing a daytime scenery.
 [0052]
        As described above, when the illumination            device 1 is    used
on the painting P which is at least partially drawn with the
special paint that   emits light  or reflects     ultraviolet        rays when
irradiated with ultraviolet rays, the scenery shown in the
painting P may be caused to gradually change according to a
change in   the nature over time,      from a nighttime scenery to a
morning scenery,    a daytime scenery,        an evening scenery,          and a
nighttime scenery.     Accordingly,     the illumination         device 1 and
a frame provided with the illumination         device may offer        a viewer
a sense of ambience and a sense of surprise            due to the change,
and may thus offer deep relaxation.
                                   29

 [0053]
          Furthermore,  according to the illumination           device 1,   the
CPU 23 turns on the incandescent lamps 16 to 19 and the
ultraviolet lamp 15 in response to detection of start of
performance by the performance state detection unit 70,                     and
turns off the incandescent          lamps 16 to 19 and the ultraviolet
lamp 15 in     response to detection of end of performance by the
performance state detection unit 70, and thus it is possible
to fully     meet the demand of viewers who want to enjoy viewing
the painting     P while listening       to a musical piece,       with sound
providing a great sense of ambience.               Accordingly,   viewers may
experience greater      relaxation      by listening     to a musical piece
while viewing the painting P.

          While the embodiment of the present invention has been
described with reference to the attached drawings, specific
configurations are not limited to the embodiment.                   The scope
of the present invention is          defined not by the description           of
the embodiment, but by the appended claims, and includes all
the equivalents and modifications falling               within the scope of
the appended claims.
 [0055]
          Additionally,   in  the embodiment described above,         a first
illumination      lamp, which is     the ultraviolet      lamp,  and a second
illumination     lamp, which is    the incandescent lamp, constituting
                                       30

the illumination         device of the present invention are described
to be provided to the illumination unit 5 which is rotatably
supported at the tip             ends of the first         and the second arms 3,
4.    However, the first illumination lamp and the second
illumination      lamp do not necessarily             have to be provided to the
illumination unit 5, and for example, the ultraviolet lamp,
which is     the first       illumination        lamp,   may be attached to each
of the left and right               sides of a frame, not           shown, where a
painting is fixed, and the incandescent lamp, which is the
second illumination             lamp,     may be attached to each of the upper
and lower sides of the frame.
 [0056]
          Furthermore,         in the embodiment described above, the
second illumination lamp is described to include four
incandescent       lamps 16 to 19.             However,     the number of
incandescent lamps is              not limited     to four,      and may be changed
to three or less, or five or more.
 [0057]
          Moreover,     in   the embodiment described above,              an example
is described where the first illumination lamp is configured
by an ultraviolet lamp, and the second illumination lamp is
configured by an incandescent lamp,                  but the present invention
is   not limited     thereto,        and the first     illumination      lamp may be
configured by an ultraviolet LED                   (Light Emitting Diode),       and
the second illumination               lamp may be configured by a white LED.
                                              31

 [0058]
           Moreover,        in the embodiment described above,           an example
is   described where an operation signal is                  issued by the remote
control transmitter               unit    29 serving as a transmission device
to the remote control receiver unit                    28 serving as a reception
device to control on and off of the incandescent lamps 16 to
19 and the ultraviolet lamp 15,                    but the present invention is
not limited          thereto.        For example,     a mobile terminal        capable
of executing an application                  including a function of narrating
information about a painting                  (guide function) or a function of
reciting a poem written for each painting may be used to
constitute the remote control transmitter unit serving as a
transmission device, and the narration function or the
recitation         function may be executed according to an operation
of selecting          a painting        by a viewer of paintings.      The "mobile
terminal" here may be configured by using a mobile information
terminal or the like             such as a smartphone,      a cell phone,     a tablet
PC (Personal Computer)                 or a PDA (Personal Digital      Assistant).
The "narration           of information about a painting"           or "recitation
of a poem" may be realized                 by output of audio from headphones
connected to an earphone jack                   (a hole for plugging in      the cord
of an earphone) of a mobile terminal, or by performing
transmission/reception                 of audio information by using near field
communication compliant with near field communication
standards such as Bluetooth or transmission/reception of
                                               32

infrared rays and by outputting audio from a speaker of the
transmission device.            Additionally,    a viewer of paintings may
freely     switch between on and off of the narration           function or
the recitation function.             Also, the viewer of paintings may
freely change the pitch or              speed of audio of the narration
function or the recitation              function.    Furthermore,  the
narration      function or the recitation         function may be enhanced
by realizing       narration     or recitation    in  multiple languages in
consideration of            foreigners viewing the paintings.
