                                          THERAPEUTIC CHAIR
   Field of the Invention
            The present invention relates to a chair presenting potential therapeutic benefits.
   Background of the Invention
 5          It is known that physical sensations and sensory experiences can alter a person's
   emotional state. For example, vestibular stimulation achieved by swinging or swaying
   in a seat or hammock can have a calming effect on overstimulated or energetic
   individuals, such as those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.            In another
   example, the application of physical pressure via products such as weighted blankets
10 and vests can have a calming and soothing effect on individuals such as those with
   autism. The pressure applied to the body by such products can simulate the feeling of
   a hug and help to pacify an agitated or overly excited person.
            Examples of the present invention seek to provide a therapeutic chair that
   provides one or more sensory experiences that can help to calm and sooth an individual.
15 Summary of the Invention
            According to the present invention, there is provided a hammock chair configured
   to apply pressure to a bodily location of a person seated thereon, a back and/or seat of
   the chair comprising an elastic portion configured to stretch and thus be tensioned in
   response to a pressure applied to the chair by the seated body of the person, which
20 tension causes the elastic portion to be contoured to the bodily location so as to apply
   pressure thereto.
            Preferably, the back and/or seat comprise(s) a flexible material in which the
   elastic portion is embedded, and, when the hammock chair is loaded (e.g. by a seated
   body), the elastic portion is configured to stretch to a greater extent than the flexible
25 material.     In a preferred embodiment, the elastic portion forms part of the back of the
   chair and is tensioned so as to apply pressure to the seated person's back, shoulders
   and/or upper arms. Of course, the elastic portion can also form part of the seat of the
   chair wherein it is configured to be tensioned so as to apply pressure to the seated
   person's thighs.

            In certain embodiments, the hammock chair includes a strap extending from the
   back of the chair and being configured to be stretched and thus tensioned across the
   front of the seated person's torso so as to apply pressure thereto.
            According to the present invention, there is also provided a chair configured to
 5 apply pressure to a bodily location of a person seated thereon, a portion of the back
   and/or seat of the chair being formed of a flexible material and comprising an elastic
   portion configured to stretch and thus be tensioned in response to a pressure applied
   to the chair by the seated body of the person, which tension causes the elastic portion
   to be contoured to the bodily location so as to apply pressure thereto.
10          Preferably, the elastic portion is embedded in the flexible material and, when the
   chair is loaded (e.g. by a seated body) the elastic portion is configured to stretch to a
   greater extent than the flexible material.       In certain embodiments, the elastic portion
   forms part of the back of the chair and is tensioned so as to apply pressure to the seated
   person's back, shoulders and/or upper arms.            Of course, the elastic portion can also
15 form part of the seat of the chair and is tensioned so as to apply pressure to the seated
   person's thighs.
            A strap may extend from the back of the chair and be configured to be stretched
   and thus tensioned across the front of the seated person's torso so as to apply pressure
   thereto.
20          The back of the present chair may be defined by spaced apart frame members
   between which the flexible material extends. Preferably, the seat of the chair is also
   defined by spaced apart frame members between which the flexible material extends.
            In at least one embodiment, the back and seat of the chair together form an
   assembly that is pivotally connected to a base of the chair such that the assembly can
25 swing/rock back and forth relative to the base.

   Detailed description
            Figures 1 and 2 depict a hammock chair 5, preferably one suspended above the
   ground, in which a person can sit and swing/sway.                      The hammock chair 5 is also
   configured to apply pressure to and cocoon around a bodily location of the seated
10 person.
            In the depicted embodiment, the back 10 of the hammock chair 5 comprises an
   elastic portion 20 which, when a person sits in the hammock chair 5, stretches and is
   thus tensioned so as to be contoured to the person's back, arms and/or shoulders. In
   this way, the elastic portion 20 can cocoon around and squeeze the body of the
15 individual, so as to simulate a hugging sensation.                   It has been found that such a
   sensation can have therapeutic benefits, for example by soothing an agitated person.
            The back 10 of the hammock chair 5 comprises a flexible material such as fabric
   in which the elastic portion 20 is embedded; in the present example, the elastic portion
   20 is sewn to the flexible material. When the hammock chair 5 is loaded by the body
20 of the seated person, the elastic portion 20 is configured to stretch to a greater extent
   than the flexible material, such that the elastic portion 20 applies more pressure to the
   seated person's body than that applied by the flexible material, thereby forming a partial
   cocoon around the person so as to comfort them.
            The seat 15 of the hammock chair 5 can also be made of a flexible fabric material
25 in which an elastic portion is similarly embedded and configured to be tensioned so as
   to apply pressure to a seated person's legs.
            In the depicted embodiment, rigid rods 50 are secured to respective outer ends
   of the back 10 and seat 15 of the hammock chair 5 via roping 55; the rigid rods help to
   maintain the form of the seat 15 and back 10. Further roping 60 can be used to suspend
30 the back 10 and seat 15 above the ground so as to allow a seated person to swing or
   sway in the hammock chair 5. In the depicted embodiment, a horizontal rigid rod 65 is

   D: s \ a  p   o  \  De  pCDE  7 a - 7-8 3  e    P1i03.AUipcifcation_2dox-4/12/2017
                                               -4
   secured to this roping 60 and helps to maintain the form of the seat 15 and back 10 in
   a widthways direction.
            A non-hammock chair providing similar therapeutic benefits is illustrated in
   Figures 3 to 8. Figures 3 to 5 depict a first embodiment of the chair 105 wherein the
 5 back 110 and the seat 125 of the chair 105 are defined by spaced apart frame members
   135 and flexible material (such as a fabric) extending therebetween.               The frame
   members 135 are connected to and extend from opposed sides of a base 140 of the
   chair 105.      Elastic portions 120 and 130 are embedded (e.g. sewn) into the flexible
   material and are configured to stretch and thus be tensioned in response to a pressure
10 applied to the chair by the seated body of the person.
            In a manner similar to the hammock chair 5 described above, when the chair
   105 is loaded (e.g. by a seated body) the elastic portions 120 and 130 are configured
   to stretch to a greater extent than the flexible material, such that the elastic portions
   120 and 130 apply more pressure to the seated person's body than that applied by the
15 flexible material.
            In a second embodiment of the chair 205 depicted in Figures 6 to 8, the back
   210 and seat 215 of the chair 205 are also defined by spaced apart frame members 225
   and flexible material extending therebetween.      In this embodiment, the back 210 and
   seat 215 form an assembly that is pivotally connected to a base 235 of the chair 205
20 via a pivot point 240 such that the assembly can rock back and forth relative to the
   base 235.
            In certain embodiments of the chairs 5, 105 and 205 disclosed herein, it is
   envisaged that one or more elastic straps can extend from the back of the chair and be
   configured to be stretched and thus tensioned across the front of the seated person's
25 torso so as to apply pressure thereto and further simulate a hugging sensation around
   the seated person's torso.
            The embodiments have been described by way of example only and modifications
   are possible within the scope of the invention disclosed.
