   to implement and maintain. This adds significant cost and reduces the ease with
   which a user without such        knowledge    can undertake       such       monitoring.
   Additionally, devices for such measurement may be cumbersome to manoeuvre
10 and install.

         According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
   measurement device comprising a housing including: a processor interfaced with
   a wireless communication module and a memory; and one or more sensors,
15 wherein the processor is configured to: establish communications between the
   measurement device and a monitoring server via the wireless communication
   module; receive, from the one or more sensors, environment data generated by the
   sensor(s); communicate the environment data to the monitoring server via the
   wireless communication module.
20       The processor may be further configured to communicate the environment
   data to the monitoring server via a gateway, wherein the measurement device
   communicates directly with the gateway. Alternatively, the processor may be
   further configured to communicate the environment data to the monitoring server
   via a gateway, wherein the measurement device communicates via a network with
25 the gateway.

   carbon dioxide sensor; a volatile organic compounds sensor; a wind-speed sensor;
   and a sound sensor.
10       The housing preferably includes a securing means for securing the housing
   to a surface. The securing means may comprise a back portion for affixing to the
   surface, and wherein the housing is configured to slidably attach to the back
   portion.
         According to another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided
15 an environment      monitoring system comprising:      one or more measurement
   devices; a gateway; and a monitoring server, wherein each of the one or more
   measurement devices includes a wireless communication module and one or more
   sensors, and is configured to: establish communications between the measurement
   device and the monitoring server via the wireless communication module; receive,
20 from its one or more sensors, environment data generated by the sensor(s);
   communicate the environment data to the monitoring server via the wireless
   communication module, and wherein the gateway is configured to communicate
   the environment data to the monitoring server, and wherein the monitoring server
   is configured to record received environment data in a memory of the monitoring
25 server in association with an identifier identifying the particular one of the one or
   more measurement devices from which the environment data was received.
         The, or each, measurement device of the system may be a measurement
   device of the previous aspect.
                                                              9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

   with either all, or a subset of all, of the environment data stored within the
   monitoring server and wherein the monitoring server is configured to provide only
   associated environment data to a requesting user terminal.

   Description of Embodiments
         Figures 1a and 1c show embodiments of an environment monitoring system
   10. The system 10 in each embodiment includes one or more measurement
10 devices 11, a gateway 14, and a monitoring server 12. Each measurement device
   11 is configured for data communication via a wireless channel with the gateway
   14, and the gateway 14 is configured for data communication with the monitoring
   server 12. In this way, each measurement device 11 is in data communication with
   the monitoring server 12.
15       Figure 2 shows a schematic view of a measurement device 11 according to
   an embodiment. The measurement device 11 includes a processor 20 interfaced
   with a memory 21.        The processor 20 is also interfaced with a wireless
   communication module 22 configured to enable the measurement device 11 to
   communicate data via a wireless channel. The processor 20 is also interfaced with
20 one or more sensors 23 (for example, via optional sensor I/O port 25)-in the
   embodiment shown, these include a temperature sensor 23a, a humidity sensor
   23b, a luminescence sensor 23c, and an occupancy detector 24d. The sensors 23
   are themselves configured to obtain measurement data related to an environment
   ("environmental data") of the measurement device 11 and to communicate this
25 data to the processor 20. The particular sensor(s) 23 utilised may depend on the
   embodiment. Additional sensors may be selected from one or more of (for
   example): a carbon dioxide sensor; a volatile organic compounds sensor; a
   wind-speed sensor; and a sound sensor.
                                                            9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                              5
          Figure 3 shows a schematic view of a monitoring server 12 according to an
   embodiment. Monitoring server 12 includes a processor 50 interfaced with a
   memory 51. The processor 20 is also interfaced with a communication module 52
   configured to enable the monitoring server 12 to communicate with measurement
 5 devices 11 via a gateway 14. In general, the monitoring server 12 may be
   embodied in any suitable hardware. For example, the monitoring server 12 may be
   a standalone single- or multi-processor device. In another example, the monitoring
   server 12 constitutes a virtual server implementation, either on dedicated hardware
   or via a cloud architecture. The processor 50 is configured to maintain a record in
10 the memory 51 of environment data received from the measurement devices 11
   this may be conceptualised as a database.
          Referring back to the embodiment of Figure 1a, the data communication is a
   direct communication between a measurement device 11 and the gateway 14. In
   the embodiment of Figure 1b, measurement devices 11 can be enabled to
15 communicate with the gateway 12 either directly or via one or more other
   measurement devices 11 (in each case, via a direct wireless communication).
   Additionally, it is envisioned that the system 10 may comprise wireless relays (not
   shown) for extending a distance of communication between a measurement device
   11 and the monitoring server 12. In the context of the present application, the term
20 "direct communication" indicates that the communication does not include a wide
   area network, such as the Internet. Referring to Figure ic, in a variation to the
   embodiments of Figures la and 1b, measurement devices 11 communicate with
   the gateway 14 via a network 15. In this way, the measurement devices 11 are not
   in direct communication with the gateway 14.
25        In an embodiment, the measurement devices              11    are configured to
   communicate with a gateway 14 via a wireless channel, such as via Wi-Fi (e.g.
   IEEE 802.11g or IEEE 802.1ln), ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc. In an embodiment, the
   measurement devices        11  are configured to    communicate          over a digital
   telecommunications network, such as defined by the 3G or 4G mobile standards.
                                                              9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                               6
   In this case, the gateway 14 may be the cellular receiver to which a measurement
   device 11 is in communication.
          In an embodiment,        each measurement      device    11     is configured             to
   communicate with one gateway 14. For example, a particular measurement device
 5 11 may be permanently configured to communicate with one particular gateway
   14, or specific one or more gateways 14. In another example, a particular
   measurement device 11 may be configurable such as to specify one particular
   gateway 14, or specific one or more gateways 14, for communication. Such
   configuration may occur via a user interface of the measurement device 14 or via
10 insertion of a device providing said configuration (for example, a SIM card).
          Referring to Figure Id, the monitoring server 12 is in data communication
   with the gateway 14 via a network 15, such as the Internet. The network 15 may
   also, or alternatively, include an intranet. Referring to Figure                   le, in an
   implementation, one monitoring server 12 is in data communication with a
15 plurality of gateways 14 (three gateways 14a, 14b, and 14 c are shown). In this
   embodiment, the monitoring server 12 is configured to distinguish between data
   received from each gateway 14 (e.g. each gateway 14 communicates a unique
   gateway ID which may comprise its IP address, MAC address, or any other
   suitable identifier). In a variation, the gateway 14 is implemented within the same
20 hardware as the monitoring server 12 and may constitute a software module of the
   monitoring server 12.
          Figure 4 shows a housing 30 of a measurement device 11. In a preferred
   embodiment, the housing 30 houses all of the processor 20, memory 21, wireless
   communication module 22, and sensors 23. The housing 30 also houses a battery
25 (not shown) configured to power the various components of the measurement
   device 11. However, an embodiment is envisioned wherein one or more of these
   components are located outside of the housing 30, in particular, an embodiment is
   envisioned wherein one or more sensors 23 are located outside the housing 30. In
   an embodiment (not shown), an auxiliary port is provided on an outside facing
30 portion of the housing 30, enabling one or more optional external sensors to be
                                                               9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                            7
   interfaced with the processor 20 (i.e. the auxiliary port is interfaced with the
   processor 31). Advantageously, this may allow for customisation of the
   environmental data measured by the measurement device 11. The external
   sensors, in an implementation, are configured to provide information to the
 5 processor 20 indicating the environmental data being measured.
          The housing 30 is typically configured for secure locating within an
   environment. For example, the housing 30 may be configured to be secured to a
   removable back potion 32, itself having a securing means to allow the back
   portion 32 to be secured to a surface in the environment. In the embodiment
10 shown, the securing means comprises one or more apertures 33 into which a
   fastener, such as a screw, may be inserted. Alternatively, or in addition, the back
   portion 32 may be adhered to a surface within the environment. Once secured, the
   housing 30 may be attached (e.g. via a sliding action) to the back portion 32
   thereby securing the housing 30 to the surface. In an implementation, the housing
15 30 and/or the back portion 32 is provided with means to prevent the housing 30
   sliding off of the back portion 32.
          In an embodiment, the housing has dimensions of approximately 100 mm x
   60 mm x 40 mm. In another embodiment, the housing has dimensions of
   approximately 120 mm x 90 mm x 60 mm. It may be preferable that no one
20 dimension of the housing 30 exceeds 500 mm, more preferably that no one
   dimensions of the housing 30 exceeds 300 mm. Advantageously, the housing 30 is
   sized such that the measuring device 11 is discrete and easily installed in an
   environment.
          In an embodiment (not shown), the housing 30 further comprises a user
25 interface, which may comprise one or more buttons, a screen, and/or any other
   suitable user interface components. The housing 30 can further comprise a data
   input/output port ("data I/O port"), which enables the measurement device 11 to
   communicate with a suitable computing device via a wired or wireless connection,
   for example, to enable upgrading of a firmware of the measurement device 11.
30 The data I/O port can correspond to the wireless communication module 22.
                                                            9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                              8
          Figure 5a shows a method of operating a measurement device 11. The
   measurement device 11 is initially in an inactive state and is positioned within an
   environment (e.g. using the securing means). The measurement device 11 is then
   initiated at initiation step 100. This may correspond to a user "powering on" the
 5 measurement device 11 through a user interface. The measurement device 11 may
   also be initiated in response to the action of securing via the securing means-for
   example, attachment to the back portion 32 (where used) may automatically cause
   initiation of the measurement device 11.
          The measurement device 11 establish communications between itself and
10 monitoring server 12. This may be achieved by establishing a session, the session
   including a step of making measurements using the, or each, sensor 23 of the
   measurement device 11 at measuring step 101, thereby generating environment
   data. The session also includes the step of communicating, via the wireless
   channel, the obtained environment data to a gateway 14 located within a
15 communication       distance of the measurement device          11,    at     measurement
   communication step 102. The gateway 14 is configured to communicate the
   received environment data to the monitoring server 12 at server communication
   step 103.
          In an embodiment, measuring step 101 is repeated periodically-the period
20 may be configurable or predefined. Measurements may be made by each sensor
   23 with the same period, or each sensor 23 may have its own period associated
   with it. For example, the occupancy detector 24d may be configured to make
   measurements every 2 seconds while the temperature sensor 23a, humidity sensor
   23b, and luminescence sensor 23c are configured to obtain measurements every 5
25 to 30 minutes. The measurement device 11 can be configured to store the obtained
   environment data in its memory 21. The measurement device 11 can be
   configured to apply a filter to the environment data, for example, an averaging of
   obtained results. In another embodiment, measuring step 101 is undertaken in
   response to a command received via the gateway 14 (which may be initiated by
30 the monitoring server 12).
                                                              9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                             9
         In an embodiment, measurement communication step 102 is repeated
   periodically-the period may be configurable or predefined. In an embodiment,
   measurement     communication     step  102  is repeated    in response            to each
   measurement made at measuring step 101-that is, obtained environment data is
 5 immediately communicated to the monitoring server 12. In another embodiment,
   where environment data is stored in the memory 21 of the measurement device
   11, the measurement communication step 102 may be repeated with a period
   significantly longer than the period for making measurements-in this case, all or
   a subset of all of the environment data obtained between successive local
10 communication steps 102 is communicated to the gateway 14 (e.g. an average of
   all measurements may be communicated). In another embodiment, the local
   communication step 102 is undertaken in response to a command received via the
   gateway 14 (e.g. from the measurement server 12). In an embodiment, the
   memory 21 of the measurement device 11 is cleared of environment data once a
15 local communication step 102 has been completed.
         In an embodiment, the measurement communication step 102 further
   comprises communicating        an identifier configured to uniquely identify a
   particular measurement device 11. For example, the unique identifier may be a
   MAC address or SIM card number. In another example, the unique identifier is a
20 specially selected unique code present in the memory 21 (i.e. a non-volatile
   memory)-such a unique code may be applied during manufacture of the
   measurement device 11. In another example, a measurement device 11 is
   programmed with a unique identifier (for example, via a data I/O port).
         In an embodiment, one or more measuring devices 11 are associated with a
25 particular gateway 14. For example, the gateway 14 can be configured to receive
   environment data only from associated measurement devices 11. The gateway 14
   may therefore be configured to determine that an identifier received from a
   particular measurement device 11 corresponds to an identifier stored within a
   memory of the gateway 14 (this may be "hardwired", in that a particular gateway
30 14 is permanently associated with particular measurement device(s) 11, or
                                                            9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                             10
   alternatively, the gateway 14 is programmable to set associated measurement
   devices 11).
          In an embodiment, as shown in Figure 4b, the session may be formed by a
   two-way communication between the monitoring server 12 and the measurement
 5 device 11 via the gateway 14, at handshake step 110. This enables the monitoring
   server 12 to register the presence of the measurement device 11.
          Generally, the methods described in Figures 4a and 4b are repeated for each
   measurement device 11 in the system 10. The monitoring server 12 is thereby
   configured for receiving environment data from each measurement device 11
10 along with information enabling the monitoring server 12 to associate the
   measurements received with the particular generating measurement device 11.
          Figure 6 shows the system 10 further including a user terminal 13
   configured to interface with the monitoring server 12. The user terminal 13 may
   be implemented within the same hardware as the monitoring server 12.
15 Alternatively, the user terminal 13 may be in data communication with the
   monitoring server 12, for example via a network that may include the Internet
   and/or a direct data connection such as a USB or similar connection.
          Referring to Figures 6a and 6b, the user terminal 13 is configured to enable
   a user to interact with the environment data stored within the monitoring server 12
20 by providing a graphical display for providing information derived from the
   environment data. Typically, the monitoring server 12 is configured to provide
   environment data to a user terminal 13 in response to receipt of a request from the
   user terminal 13. The monitoring server 12 can be configured to process some or
   all of the environment data, and thereby provides derived data to the user terminal
25 12. In an embodiment, the monitoring server is configured to allow access by a
   plurality of user terminals 13. In this embodiment, typically each user terminal 13
   is associated with either all, or a subset of all, of the environment data stored
   within the monitoring server 12 and the monitoring server 12is configured to
   provide only associated environment data to a requesting user terminal. A system
30 operator may by enabled to configured the monitoring server 12 to indicate with
                                                             9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                              11
   which environment data each user terminal 13 is associated. The association may
   be in dependence with a user ID of a current user of the user terminal 13 (e.g. a
   user name and/or password).
         In Figure 6a, the user terminal 13 is configured to display time series graphs
 5 60 of the environment data received for one or more of the environmental
   properties. In Figure 6a, several time series 60 plots are shown for environment
   data corresponding to temperature received from different measurements devices
   11 (which are labelled according to their location: "Outside"; "Fish Bowl"; "Tim
   CS"; "Server Room"; and "Reception"). The measurement devices 11 may be
10 located in different parts of a similar location.
         Figure 6b shows an embodiment wherein the user terminal 13 is configured
   to display a graphical representation of the relative or absolute location of the, or
   each, measurement device 11 in communication with the monitoring server 12. In
   Figure 6b, the graphical representation comprises a floor plan 61 of a building
15 floor. Typically, each measurement device 11 is graphically represented with a
   label 64 and/or a dynamic indicator 65. For example, the label 64 may correspond
   to a pre-set ID (such as the unique identifier) associated with the measurement
   device 11 or may be user set (for example, in Figure 6b, each measurement device
   11 is associated with a custom label 64).
20       Still referring to Figure 6b, in an embodiment, the floor plan 64 (or other
   graphical representation) is configured to delimit the environments of each
   individual measurement device 11. For example, in the figure, each monitoring
   device 11 is associated with a room and is shown as representing the environment
   of that room only (although some rooms              are associated with multiple
25 measurement devices 11). In the example shown, shading is used to indicate the
   space within the floor plan 64 associated with each measurement device 11 -this
   shading may be coloured to be representative of the current value of the
   environment data being displayed.
         In Figure 6b, the user is enabled to select for display one or more
30 environment properties using the metric selector 62. In the example shown, the
                                                              9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                             12
   "temperature" metric has been selected, and therefore, the dynamic indicator 65
   corresponding to each individual measurement device 11                    is showing a
   temperature value. Any measurement device 11 where temperature measurement
   data has not been received (or is out of date, for example) is shown as a dash ("-").
 5        In an embodiment, a user is enabled to position, on the display, the, or each,
   measurement device 11 such that each measurement device 11 is indicated as
   being located in its correct physical location. For example, a user may user an
   input device such as a keyboard or mouse to manoeuvre a graphical representation
   of a measurement device 11 to a location on a floor plan of a building. The user
10 terminal 13 is configured to record the location of each positioned graphical
   representation of a measurement device 11 such that later use of the user terminal
   13 (or even a different user terminal 13) will still represent the monitoring devices
   11 at the appropriate position. This may be recorded in the monitoring server 12.
          Referring back to Figure Id, where a single monitoring server 12 is
15 configured to receive environment data from a plurality of gateways 14a, 14b,
   14c, the environment data is recorded by the monitoring server 12 in association
   with the respective gateway ID. This enables a monitoring server 12 to record
   information, effectively, from different locations.
          In an embodiment, a user may have access to environment data associated
20 with a subset of all locations (and therefore all gateways 14) from which the
   monitoring server 12 has received measurements. For example, the user may have
   a user ID which is enabled, by a system administrator, to access particular
   measurements in accordance with the associated gateway ID.
          An advantage of embodiments described herein is that a user may position a
25 measurement device       11 within a location and it is enabled to initiate
   communication of measurement data to a monitoring server 12 without additional
   configuration by the user. Thus, advantageously, a user is not required to
   undertake extensive training in order to operate the system 10.
                                                               9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17

                                          13
         Another advantage of embodiments described herein is that a user may
  access data from a monitoring server 12 via a user terminal 13 without being
  required to actively manage the data stored in the monitoring server 12. In this
  way, advantageously, the present invention a single service provider to maintain
5 the monitoring server 12 while a plurality of different users utilise the service via
  their respective user terminals 13.
         Further modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and
  scope of the specification.
                                                            9668750_1 (GHMatters) P107283.AU 8/11/17
