Technical Field
[0001] The present invention relates to masks for delivering air or other gases to
patients, particularly but not exclusively neonates.
Background of the Invention
[0002] Masks are used in various clinical settings, such as hospitals, to deliver air,
oxygen or other medical gases to patients. In some instances, they are a relatively loose
fit and are not required to maintain a seal against the face.
[0003] However, in many instances it is desirable that a relatively tight fit is maintained.
This is particularly the case where a gas is supplied under pressure to the patients, for
example in a resuscitation situation, or CPAP for a neonate.
[0004] For example, neonatal resuscitation typically takes place using a relatively
sophisticated, controlled source of pressurised air and/or oxygen. This may include
Positive End Expiratory Pressure and Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PEEP and PIP) to assist
in correct lung inflation and improve blood oxygenation. It is understood in the art that it
is critical to deliver air at the correct pressure, volume, gas mix and breathing rate, so that
the neonate's lungs are not damaged, whilst an effective air flow to assist resuscitation is
provided.
[0005] However, in order to achieve the desired outcome for the neonate, it is necessary
that this air is effectively delivered through the mask in the desired way. If the mask is
not relatively well sealed to the infant's mouth and nose, much of the air will leak out, and
the desired delivery of air will not occur. This is a common situation in conventional
practice.
[0006] The best practice for infant resuscitation is to hold the mask in the correct position
on the face, whilst also supporting the neonate's head, and placing the neonate in the
correct posture. This is a rather difficult task in practice, even with two practitioners
assisting. It will be appreciated that the special needs and delicacy of a neonate
necessitate the utmost care be taken in this procedure.
[0007] Co-pending application No. W0<removed-apn> by the present applicant discloses
a mask for the delivery of medical gases, in which a peripheral sealing recess is
provided, so that the recess can be connected to suction in order to retain the mask in
position. Whilst this is very effective in practice, such an arrangement has not proved

                                             2
optimal for smaller premature neonates. It is also not suited to use for extended periods
of time.
[0008] It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved mask for
delivering medical gases to patients.
Summary of the Invention
[0009] In a first broad form, the present invention provides a mask for delivering
medical gases, wherein the engagement surface of the mask is more rigid than the
tissue surrounding the airways with which it is engaged.
[0010] In another broad form, the present invention provides a mask for delivering
medical gases, wherein the engagement surface is generally circular and of constant
cross-section, preferably toroidal in form.
[0011] In another broad form, the present invention provides a collar for a mask, the
collar being adapted to engage the outer surface of the mask and provide fixing points
to allow the mask to be secured to the user, while spreading the forces associated with
the mask fixation around the mask so that an effective seal between the mask and the
skin of the user can be obtained
[0012] According to one aspect, the present invention provides a mask for the delivery
of a medical gas under positive pressure, the mask including a body having an interior
space, an engagement surface for surrounding the airway of a user and engaging
surrounding tissue, wherein the interior space is adapted to communicate with a source
of medical gas and deliver the gas to the interior space, and operatively to the user,
wherein the engagement surface is generally circular in shape and has a consistent
cross-sectional shape, and wherein the engagement surface is sufficiently rigid that
operatively, when a suitable retention force is applied to the mask, an effective seal is
produced at the interface of the engagement surface and the surrounding tissue
primarily by deformation of the surrounding tissue.
[0013] In one form, the mask is formed from a first mask body, the mask body having a
central opening surrounded by a peripheral recess adapted to receive suction, to
thereby operatively affix the mask body to facilitate supply a medical gas to a user, and
an conversion insert, said insert on one side providing said engagement surface, and on
the other providing a mating surface to engage the recess, so that the section is no
longer operative and the mask is engaged by said retention pressure.

                                              3
[0014] In another form, the present invention the mask further includes a collar,
extending around the outer surface of the mask and adapted to provide connections for
straps, so that the mask may be held in place and a suitable retention pressure applied
by said straps, and the force may be dispersed around the mask so as to maintain an
effective seal.
[0015] The general trend in mask design has been for an increasingly more flexible,
compliant material and form to be used, in an effort to optimise the seal which can be
achieved. It has been determined by the inventor that contrary to this approach, a
better seal can be obtained with a relatively less compliant material. The skin and
underlying tissues on the face, particularly of neonates, are resilient and compliant.
Using another soft, compliant surface does not optimise the seal - rather, a less flexible
surface will maintain a good mechanical seal against the compliant skin and underlying
tissue.

Detailed Description of the invention
[0023] The present invention will be described with reference to various specific
implementations. It will be understood that the broad principles if the present invention
can be implemented in a variety of structures and forms, and is not limited to the
specific examples described.

                                               4
[0024] The term 'medical gas' as used in the specification and claims is intended to be
interpreted broadly. It encompasses air, oxygen, or a mixture thereof, either for
resuscitation, CPAP, PEEP, PIP or any other purpose. It also encompasses other gases,
for example for the delivery of different gas mixtures, therapeutic agents, anaesthetics,
pharmaceuticals, or other agents, either alone or mixed with air. The gases may be either
at ambient or another temperature. The gases may be delivered at a relatively low
pressure, for example as supplementary oxygen, or at a higher pressure, for example for
resuscitation. The gas may have particles or droplet entrained or mixed therein. The
present invention is not limited in scope to any particular gas or treatment.
[0025] The term airway when used throughout the specification and claims refers to the
mouth, the nose or both, as is appropriate for the particular application.
[0026] The main implementation to be described relates to a neonatal resuscitation
system. However, the present invention may be applied to any situation where a medical
gas is required to be delivered, and the mask is required to be correctly placed on the
airways of a user. This includes, for example, resuscitation and ventilation systems,
delivery of anaesthetics, delivery of gas carried treatments (for example for respiratory
conditions), treatments for sleep disorders such as CPAP (continuous positive airway
pressure) devices, and any other application where correct attachment of the mask
around the airways may be useful.
[0027] The transition from foetal to extrauterine life is characterised by a series of unique
physiological events. Among these, the lungs change from fluid-filled to air-filled,
pulmonary blood flow increases dramatically, and intracardiac and extracardiac shunts
initially reverse direction and subsequently close. Normal term newborns exert negative
pressures as high as about -8.0 kPa when starting to expand their lungs.
[0028] For the first few breaths, these pressures are greater than those needed for
subsequent breaths. Likewise, in those newborns that need assistance to initiate lung
expansion, the fluid-filled alveoli may require higher peak inspiratory and end expiratory
pressures than those commonly used in subsequent ventilation, or in resuscitation later
in infancy.
[0029] There are significant differences in the respiratory systems of neonates, children
and adults. Neonates are not small children and children are not small adults. The
anatomy of an infant, head large, neck short, tongue large, narrow nasal passages which
obstruct easily, larynx more cephalad (C4) and anterior, cricoid cartilage narrowest part
of airway, epiglottis long and stiff, trachea short (-5cm in newborns). The small radius of
the trachea causes an increase in resistance to flow in the trachea; further, inflammation
or secretions in the airway cause an exaggerated degree of obstruction in infants, and
this is commonly found with neonates requiring resuscitation.

                                               5
[0030] At birth the alveoli are thick walled and only number 10% of the adult total. Lung
growth occurs by alveolar multiplication until 6 - 8 years. The airways remain relatively
narrow until then. Ventilation is almost entirely diaphragmatic. Infant lungs have poor
elastic properties. It takes some 2 years of life until the geometry of the rib cage changes,
with the gradual development of the "bucket handle" configuration seen in the adult. Ribs
tend to be more horizontal in infants and this limits the potential for thoracic expansion.
(http://www.aic.cuhk.edu.hk/web8/Paediatric%20anatomy%20&%20physiology.htm)
[0031] Further, in terms of the biomechanics of ventilation, the chest wall compliance of
infant is very high, and drops as they grow. In contrast, lung compliance is very low at
birth and steadily increases through puberty. FRC of newborns are maintained through
high respiratory rate, controlled expiration (laryngeal braking), and the tonic activity of
ventilatory muscles.
[0032] The physiological dead space is approx. 30% of the tidal volume, as in adults,
but the absolute volume is small, so that any increase caused by apparatus (mask or
equipment) deadspace has a proportionally greater effect on infants. The problem is
further exacerbated with premature neonates with their lungs (with significantly more
problems) and body size being even smaller than full term newborns.
[0033] The newborn requiring resuscitation is very dependent on accurate delivery of air
pressure and flow with almost no tolerance for variability of these factors. (Adult
tolerances are significantly higher and they can survive with much higher variability). In
other words the requirements for accuracy of ventilation are significantly more demanding
for neonates than adults.
[0034] There have been very large increases in efficiency and effectiveness in neonatal
resuscitation in recent years, with sophisticated resuscitation equipment producing very
accurate delivery flows and pressures to the neonate. Resuscitation machines are used
in labour and delivery wards, and neonatal Intensive care units (NICU) worldwide.
Current neonatal resuscitation guidelines recommend the use of a T-piece device (part
of the equipment delivery systems) with the potential of achieving controlled targeted
Peak Inspiratory pressures (PIP) and delivering consistent Positive End Expiratory
Pressure (PEEP) to help Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) and improve lung volume
in the neonate. Target PEEP pressure are generally 0.5 kPa and PIP 2.5 kPa.
[0035] The T-piece connector in these systems connects onto special sized neonatal
resuscitation masks. Air flows can range between 5 I/min and 15 I/min at specified
pressures. T-piece circuits also typically include valves than can control the timing and
flows of PEEP and PIP pressures.

                                                6
[0036] Special sized and shaped masks have been designed and made to accompany
neonatal resuscitation equipment. These masks are specifically designed to conform
comfortably to an infant's face, facilitating an anatomical seal for the purposes of
resuscitation and to meet all the other critical respiratory requirements mentioned above.
[0037] However these masks are required to fit the neonates face and make (ideally)
100% seals on the neonate's skin for the accurate delivery of PIP and PEEP pressures,
no dead space and accurate flow rates. Due to the accurate pressures required mask
leakage is the single biggest problem in neonatal resuscitation. In some studies, 14 to
80% leakage is found, even with experienced operators.
[0038] Conventional masks seek to provide a highly conformable, relatively soft and
flexible engagement with the face of the user. The inventors have identified that a more
rigid while still sufficiently flexible device provides a superior seal in practice. Without
wishing to be limited to this explanation, it is theorised that this is because the tissue
around the airways, especially for neonates, and the soft, compliant mask structures are
unable to exert a sufficient force on each other to maintain a proper seal. By making the
mask engagement less conformable, the tissue of the user performs the necessary small
deformations relative to the mask to enable an effective seal to be made.
[0039] In a preferred form, the engagement surface is uniform in cross-section, and
circular in shape. The engagement surface is preferably toroidal, or strictly part toroidal,
in shape. That is, the surface which provides an engagement with the tissue surrounding
the airway is so shaped, and merges with the rest of the mask, which will have a different
geometry. In an alternative implementation, the toroidal for could be a silicone gel, which
is less rigid but is sufficient to provide an effective seal. However, other cross-sectional
shapes for the engagement surface are possible, but are preferably close to toroidal in
form. The skilled reader will appreciate that small variations from this precise geometry
are not consequential.
[0040] Implementations of the present invention have particular application to very
preterm infants, for whom other mask sealing approaches, such as suction, are not
suitable. However, the present invention is also more broadly applicable to any situation
where medical gases are required to be delivered. It can be applied in hand held mode,
or in an on-going application, as will be described further below.
[0041] The implementation of the present invention to be discussed below includes a
mask structure (shape, material, flexibility, hardness) and mask function (gas flow, gas
pressure, face adherence, suction pressure and flow) intended to conform to a pre-term
newborn structure (anatomy of head, respiratory system) and newborn function
(physiology of respiratory system).

                                              7
[0042] It will be understood that the requirements for adult resuscitation and other uses
are significantly different from the neonatal application discussed in detail. However, the
general principle may be applied to other applications, for example in adults, with suitable
modifications to structures, materials, dimensions and other characteristics.
[0043] Figure 1 shows a mask 10 according to a first implementation of the present
invention, with a neck section 20 for connection to a source of medical gas. It will be
understood that appropriate connectors would be provided on the end of neck 20 in use.
[0044] Mask 10 has a generally part conical body section 11, connecting the neck 20 to
the engagement 12. As can be seen, the outer and lower surfaces of engagement 12
are partly toroidal in shape, with an interior smooth bore 15. Bore 15 is the outlet for
medical gas in use, while the engagement bears against the tissue surrounding the user's
airway.
[0045] Figure 2 shows a cross section view of the mask 10 of figure 1. It can be seen
that the body section is much thinner than the engagement section 12, and that internally
the bore 15 provides an open passage for the delivery of medical gas.
[0046] Figure 3 shows the mask 10 with a collar 30 attached. One function of collar 30
is to provide a structure to which straps or other engagements can be attached, so as to
fix the mask 10 into position on a user if required. Another function of collar 30 is to act
as a loading device to spread the load associated with the straps evenly around the seal
face. The T-piece 76 ( see figure 6) fits snugly into the top of collar 30, and pressing
down on T-piece 76 will provide a good seal between the mask 10 and the user,
[0047] Collar 30 has a frame 33 to engage the exterior of the mask over a relatively wide
area, so that forces from straps, etc., are spread around the mask's periphery, to provide
a dispersed engagement. Loops 31, 32 are provided to allow the attachment of straps.
In this implementation, collar 30 is removable so that the mask may be used alone or with
a collar. In other possible implementations, the collar could be integrated with the mask.
[0048] The mask is preferably moulded from a material such as silicone rubber. In an
alternative implementation, a toroidal skin may be filled with a silicone gel. It is preferred
that the material have a shore A hardness of about 5 to about 25. The purpose of the
hardness range is to allow for the mask to conform to the anatomy of the user, without
being so soft as to lose effective engagement with the skin.
[0049] The collet may be formed, for example by injection moulding, from any suitable
polymer material, for example a bio-compatible injection moulded polymer. Because the
mask is formed from silicone, it is not practical to provide attachments that are

                                                8
mechanically reliable for straps. Also, straps may be required, for example, in a CPAP
application, but may not be needed or desired for a resuscitation situation. The separate
collar allows for the practitioner to select the collar if needed. It may be used for any
suitable mask, not only those according to the implementations discussed above.
[0050] The diameter of the mask will vary depending upon the age of the user. For a
neonate, it typically will vary from 20 to 38 mm; for a full term infant, 50mm. The circular
shape means that there is no preferred orientation for the mask as it is place onto the
user. It will be appreciated that the interior shape must provide enough clearance for the
face and nose of the user.
[0051] The toroidal shape has been found to be very effective and to provide a better
seal on an infant whose face is more or less round. The interior of the mask 10 is
shaped so as to decrease dead air space. The external shape allows for the collar
and/or fingers to concentrically apply pressure evenly to create a good seal between the
mask 10 and the face.
[0052] It will be appreciated that providing an effective seal involves an interaction
between the downward pressure applied, the shape and the hardness, as well as
consideration of the anatomy which is to be engaged. The cross section of the torus in
the preferred implementation does deform slightly in use. However, its interaction with
the anatomy of the infant is still effective - the deformation does not extend to allow
walls to collapse and cause air leaks. There is a symbiotic relationship between seal
and anatomy, the skin pushes up and the seal pushes down at the "just right" hardness
and conformity.
[0053] Whilst a very preterm neonate only has cartilage and not bone formation the
hardness needs to be "just right" so as not to deform the cartilage of the pre-term.
Downward pressure is required such that pressure does not deform the cartilage.
[0054] Figure 4 shows an implementation in which a mask which is adapted to be
adhered by suction, for example as shown in the applicant's co-pending W0<removed-apn>,
can be modified by an insert to function according to the present invention. It will be
appreciated that similar modification devices may be used with other types of mask if
desired.
[0055] The prior art mask 40 has a connection 43 for a medical gas, a body 40, and an
annular groove 41, connected to suction connection 42. In its original form, connection
43 is connected to a suitable medical gas supply, and connection 42 to suction. The
annular groove is thereby at a reduced pressure, and pulls the mask 40 in to seal against
a user's face.

                                                9
[0056] However, it has been determined by the inventors that in some situations, this
does not provide an effective seal. One particular example is for very early pre-term
infants, for example 24 to 32 week neonates, where in some cases the skin is too soft for
a good seal to be made. Another application is where on-going delivery of medical gases
is required over a longer period, such as for infant or adult CPAP or delivery of
anaesthetics.
[0057] Figures 4 and 5 shows a converter insert 50 adapted to be inserted into mask 40
to convert it into a mask according to the present invention. Insert 50 has an upper
projection 51 with a shape adapted to mate with the interior surface of annular groove 41.
Upper projection 51 further blocks the connection between suction connections and the
groove 41, so that this is not a path for the loss of pressure from the medical gas delivery.
[0058] The lower, engagement surface 52 is part -toroidal in form, and is made from a
similar grade of silicone rubber to the first implementation. Thus, a similar seal and
engagement can be produced to the first implementation, using a composite device.
[0059] In an alternative implementation, the toroidal form could be provided using a
silicone gel with an toroidal tube.
[0060] An advantage of this implementation is that it provides the freedom for the
practitioners to select the form of mask that they need. The converter insert can be quickly
added if needed at the point of care. The medical staff are still using a familiar mask, but
with a different attachment.
[0061] Figure 6 shows an infant 80 with a mask 40 attached using collar 30. The mask
has an attached insert 50, as in figure 5. Straps 70, 71 are attached to the collar 30 at
loops 31, 32 (not visible) to retain the mask in engagement with the face of infant 80.
Mask 40 is attached to a conventional T piece 76, and then to a source of medical gas
via flexible pipe 75.
[0062] Masks according to the present invention may be applied by a practitioner in a
conventional way, in a similar mode to existing masks.
[0063] The connections to medical gases are shown as conventional connections to
neonatal resuscitation machines. It will be appreciated that different connections to the
respective portions of the mask, which could be any suitable passage from the
corresponding interior structure to the exterior connection or system, could be used. For
example, the mask could be integral with the T piece device. The mask could be integrally
connected to the appropriate pipes or hoses for connection to a suitable machine. No
particular mode of connection is dictated in order to implement the present invention.

                                             10
[0064] It will be appreciated that in a practical implementation, masks according to
implementations of the present invention would be provided in a range of sizes, to suit
full term and different sizes of pre-term neonates. Similarly, for children and adults, a
range of sizes would be provided, so as to accommodate each specific individual.
[0065] In another implementation, where on-going use is contemplated, a custom sized
device for a particular user could be made.
