                                          ABSTRACT
             The present invention has an object to provide a mobile communication system
   capable of reducing energy consumption of a network node in a local area range.      In the
 5 present invention, when judging that there is a shift trigger in Step ST1503, a local eNB
   shifts from a normal operation to an energy saving operation in Step ST1504.        In the
   energy saving operation, the local eNB stops the operation of transmitting at least a part
   of downlink transmission signals to be transmitted to a user equipment (UE) and performs
   the operation of receiving an uplink transmission signal transmitted from the UE.    When
10 judging that it has received the uplink transmission signal (RACH) in the energy saving
   operation in Step ST1510, the local eNB shifts to the normal operation in Step ST1511.

                                         DESCRIPTION
     MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, BASE STATION AND MOBILE TERMINAL
   Technical Field
 5 [0001]     The present invention relates to a mobile communication system in which a
   base station performs radio communication with a plurality of user equipments.
   Background Art
   [0002]     Commercial service of a wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA)
   system among so-called third-generation communication systems has been offered in
10 Japan since 2001.    In addition, high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) service for
   achieving higher-speed data transmission using a downlink has been offered by adding a
   channel for packet transmission (high speed-downlink shared channel (HS-DSCH)) to the
   downlink (dedicated data channel, dedicated control channel).        Further, in order to
   increase the speed of data transmission in an uplink direction, service of a high speed
15 uplink packet access (HSUPA) system has been offered.      W-CDMA is a communication
   system defined by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) that is the standard
   organization regarding the mobile communication system, where the specifications of
   Release 8 version are produced.
   [0003]     Further, 3GPP is studying new communication systems referred to as long term
20 evolution (LTE) regarding radio areas and system architecture evolution (SAE) regarding
   the overall system configuration including a core network (merely referred to as network
   as well) as communication systems independent of W-CDMA.
   [0004]     In the LTE, an access scheme, a radio channel configuration and a protocol are
   totally different from those of the current W-CDMA (HSDPA/HSUPA).            For example,
25 as to the access scheme, code division multiple access is used in the W-CDMA, whereas

                                                    2
   in the LTE, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used in a downlink
   direction and single career frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) is used in an
   uplink direction.    In addition, the bandwidth is 5 MHz in the W-CDMA, while in the
   LTE, the bandwidth can be selected from 1.4 MHz, 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz
 5 and 20 MHz for each base station.            Further, differently from the W-CDMA, circuit
   switching is not provided but a packet communication system is only provided in the
   LTE.
   [0005]      The LTE is defined as a radio access network independent of the W-CDMA
   network because its communication system is configured with a new core network
10 different from a core network (general packet radio service: GPRS) of the W-CDMA.
   Therefore, for differentiation from the W-CDMA communication system, a base station
   that communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a radio network controller that
   transmits/receives control data and user data to/from a plurality of base stations are
   referred to as an E-UTRAN NodeB (eNB) and an evolved packet core (EPC) or access
15 gateway (aGW), respectively, in the LTE communication system.              Unicast service and
   evolved multimedia broadcast multicast service (E-MBMS service) are provided in this
   LTE communication system.           The E-MBMS service is broadcast multimedia service,
   which is merely referred to as MBMS in some cases.             Bulk broadcast contents such as
   news, weather forecast and mobile broadcast are transmitted to a plurality of user
20 equipments.      This is also referred to as point to multipoint service.
   [0006]      Non-Patent Document 1 (Chapter 4.6.1) describes the current decisions by
   3GPP regarding an overall architecture in the LTE system.            The overall architecture is
   described with reference to FIG. 1.       FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating the configuration of
   the LTE communication system.             With reference to FIG. 1, the evolved universal
25 terrestrial radio access (E-UTRAN) is composed of one or a plurality of base stations 102,

                                                 3
   provided that a control protocol for a user equipment 101 such as a radio resource control
   (RRC) and user planes such as a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP), radio link
   control (RLC), medium access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) are terminated in
   a base station 102.
 5 [0007]      The base stations 102 perform scheduling and transmission of paging signal
   (also referred to as paging messages) notified from a mobility management entity (MME)
   103.     The base stations 102 are connected to each other by means of an X2 interface.
   In addition, the base stations 102 are connected to an evolved packet core (EPC) by
   means of an SI interface.      More specifically, the base station 102 is connected to the
10 mobility management entity (MME) 103 by means of an SIMME interface and
   connected to a serving gateway (S-GW) 104 by means of an SI_U interface.
   [0008]      The MME 103 distributes the paging signal to a plurality of or a single base
   station 102.     In addition, the MME 103 performs mobility control of an idle state.
   When the user equipment is in the idle state and an active state, the MME 103 manages a
15 list of tracking areas.
   [0009]      The S-GW 104 transmits/receives user data to/from one or a plurality of base
   stations 102.     The S-GW 104 serves as a local mobility anchor point in handover
   between base stations.      Moreover, a PDN gateway (P-GW) is provided in the EPC,
   which performs per-user packet filtering and UE-ID address allocation.
20 [0010]      The control protocol RRC between the user equipment 101 and the base station
   102 performs broadcast, paging, RRC connection management and the like.         The states
   of the base station and the user equipment in RRC are classified into RRC_Idle and
   RRCCONNECTED.              In RRC_IDLE, public land mobile network (PLMN) selection,
   system information (SI) broadcast, paging, cell reselection, mobility and the like are
25 performed.     In RRCCONNECTED, the user equipment has RRC connection, is capable

                                                 4
   of transmitting/receiving data to/from a network, and performs, for example, handover
   (HO) and measurement of a neighbor cell.       RRCIDLE is merely referred to as IDLE or
   idle state as well.    RRCCONNECTED is merely referred to as CONNECTED or
   connected state as well.
 5  [0011]    The current decisions by 3GPP regarding the frame configuration in the LTE
   system described in Non-Patent Document 1 (Chapter 5) are described with reference to
   FIG. 2.    FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating the configuration of a radio frame used in the
   LTE communication system.       With reference to FIG. 2, one radio frame is 10 ms.   The
   radio frame is divided into ten equally sized subframes.     The subframe is divided into
10 two    equally  sized slots.    The first and     sixth subframes     contain a downlink
   synchronization signal (SS) per each radio frame.        The synchronization signals are
   classified into a primary synchronization signal (P-SS) and a secondary synchronization
   signal (S-SS).    Multiplexing of channels for multimedia broadcast multicast service
   single frequency network (MBSFN) and for non-MBSFN is performed on a per-subframe
15 basis.   Hereinafter, a subframe for MBSFN transmission is referred to as an MBSFN
   subframe.
    [0012]    Non-Patent   Document 2 describes       a signaling example      when MBSFN
   subframes are allocated.     FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating the configuration of the
   MBSFN frame.       With reference to FIG. 3, the MBSFN subframes are allocated for each
20 MBSFN frame.        An MBSFN frame cluster is scheduled.        A repetition period of the
   MBSFN frame cluster is allocated.
    [0013]    Non-Patent Document 1 (Chapter 5) describes the current decisions by 3GPP
   regarding the channel configuration in the LTE system.        It is assumed that the same
   channel configuration is used in a closed subscriber group cell (CSG cell) as that of a
25 non-CSG cell.     Physical channels are described with reference to FIG. 4.    FIG. 4 is a

                                                 5
   diagram illustrating physical channels used in the LTE communication system.        With
   reference to FIG. 4, a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) 401 is a downlink channel
   transmitted from the base station 102 to the user equipment 101.  A BCH transport block
   is mapped to four subframes within a 40 ms interval.       There is no explicit signaling
 5 indicating 40 ms timing.   A physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) 402 is
   transmitted from the base station 102 to the user equipment 101.    The PCFICH notifies
   the number of OFDM symbols used for PDCCHs from the base station 102 to the user
   equipment 101.     The PCFICH is transmitted in each subframe.
   [0014]    A physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) 403 is a downlink channel
10 transmitted from the base station 102 to the user equipment 101.    The PDCCH notifies
   the resource allocation, HARQ information related to DL-SCH (downlink shared channel
   that is one of the transport channels shown in FIG. 5 described below) and the PCH
   (paging channel that is one of the transport channels shown in FIG. 5).     The PDCCH
   carries an uplink scheduling grant.       The PDCCH carries acknowledgement (Ack)/
15 negative acknowledgement (Nack) that is a response signal to uplink transmission.    The
   PDCCH is referred to as an LI/L2 control signal as well.
   [0015]    A physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) 404 is a downlink channel
   transmitted from the base station 102 to the user equipment 101.   A DL-SCH (downlink
   shared channel) that is a transport channel and a PCH that is a transport channel are
20 mapped to the PDSCH.        A physical multicast channel (PMCH) 405 is a downlink
   channel transmitted from the base station 102 to the user equipment 101.     A multicast
   channel (MCH) that is a transport channel is mapped to the PMCH.
   [0016]    A physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) 406 is an uplink channel
   transmitted from the user equipment 101 to the base station 102.     The PUCCH carries
25 Ack/Nack that is a response signal to downlink transmission.   The PUCCH carries a

                                                  6
   channel quality indicator (CQI) report.      The CQI is quality information indicating the
   quality of received data or channel quality.    In addition, the PUCCH carries a scheduling
   request (SR).    A physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) 407 is an uplink channel
   transmitted from the user equipment 101 to the base station 102.        A UL-SCH (uplink
 5 shared channel that is one of the transport channels shown in FIG. 5) is mapped to the
   PUSCH.
   [0017]     A physical hybrid ARQ indicator channel (PHICH) 408 is a downlink channel
   transmitted from the base station 102 to the user equipment 101.        The PHICH carries
   Ack/Nack that is a response to uplink transmission.       A physical random access channel
10 (PRACH) 409 is an uplink channel transmitted from the user equipment 101 to the base
   station 102.    The PRACH carries a random access preamble.
   [0018]     A downlink reference signal which is a known symbol in a mobile
   communication system is inserted in the first, third and last OFDM symbols of each slot.
   The physical layer measurement objects of a user equipment include reference symbol
15 received power (RSRP).
   [0019]     The transport channel described in Non-Patent Document 1 (Chapter 5) is
   described with reference to FIG. 5.   FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating transport channels used
   in the LTE communication system.      Part (A) of FIG. 5 shows mapping between a downlink
   transport channel and a downlink physical channel.         Part (B) of FIG. 5 shows mapping
20 between an uplink transport channel and an uplink physical channel.       A broadcast channel
   (BCH) is broadcast to the entire base station (cell) regarding the downlink transport channel.
   The BCH is mapped to the physical broadcast channel (PBCH).
   [0020]     Retransmission control according to a hybrid ARQ (HARQ) is applied to a
   downlink shared channel (DL-SCH).         The DL-SCH enables broadcast to the entire base
25 station (cell).  The DL-SCH supports dynamic or semi-static resource allocation.      The

                                                  7
   semi-static resource allocation is also referred to as persistent scheduling.    The DL-SCH
   supports discontinuous reception (DRX) of a user equipment for enabling the user
   equipment to save power.        The DL-SCH is mapped to the physical downlink shared
   channel (PDSCH).
 5 [0021]     The paging channel (PCH) supports DRX of the user equipment for enabling
   the user equipment to save power.       Broadcast to the entire base station (cell) is required
   for the PCH.     The PCH is mapped to physical resources such as the physical downlink
   shared channel (PDSCH) that can be used dynamically for traffic or physical resources
   such as the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) of the other control channel.
10 The multicast channel (MCH) is used for broadcast to the entire base station (cell).       The
   MCH supports SFN combining of MBMS service (MTCH and MCCH) in multi-cell
   transmission.     The MCH supports semi-static resource allocation.      The MCH is mapped
   to the PMCH.
   [0022]     Retransmission control according to a hybrid ARQ (HARQ) is applied to an
15 uplink shared channel (UL-SCH).            The UL-SCH supports dynamic or semi-static
   resource allocation.     The UL-SCH is mapped to the physical uplink shared channel
   (PUSCH).      A random access channel (RACH) shown in part (B) of FIG. 5 is limited to
   control information.     The RACH involves a collision risk.     The RACH is mapped to the
   physical random access channel (PRACH).
20 [0023]     The HARQ is described.         The HARQ is the technique for improving the
   communication quality of a channel by combination of automatic repeat request and
   forward error correction.     The HARQ has an advantage that error correction functions
   effectively by retransmission even for a channel whose communication quality changes.
   In particular, it is also possible to achieve further quality improvement in retransmission
25 through combination of the reception results of the first transmission and the reception

                                                   8
   results of the retransmission.
    [0024]    An example of the retransmission method is described.        In a case where the
   receiver fails to successfully decode the received data, in other words, in a case where a
   cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error occurs (CRC=NG), the receiver transmits "Nack"
 5 to the transmitter.    The transmitter that has received "Nack" retransmits the data. In a
   case where the receiver successfully decodes the received data, in other words, in a case
   where a CRC error does not occur (CRC=OK), the receiver transmits "AcK" to the
   transmitter.    The transmitter that has received "Ack" transmits the next data.
    [0025]    Examples of the HARQ system include chase combining.          In chase combining,
10 the same data sequence is transmitted in the first transmission and retransmission, which
   is the system for improving gains by combining the data sequence of the first
   transmission and the data sequence of the retransmission in retransmission.           This is
   based on the idea that correct data is partially included even if the data of the first
   transmission contains an error, and highly accurate data transmission is enabled by
15 combining the correct portions of the first transmission data and the retransmission data.
   Another example of the HARQ system is incremental redundancy (IR).           The IR is aimed
   to increase redundancy, where a parity bit is transmitted in retransmission to increase the
   redundancy by combining the first transmission and retransmission, to thereby improve
   the quality by an error correction function.
20  [0026]    A logical channel (hereinafter, referred to as "logical channel" in some cases)
   described in Non-Patent Document 1 (Chapter 6) is described with reference to FIG. 6.
   FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating logical channels used in an LTE communication system.
   Part (A) of FIG. 6 shows mapping between a downlink logical channel and a downlink
   transport channel.    Part (B) of FIG. 6 shows mapping between an uplink logical channel and
25 an uplink transport channel.     A broadcast control channel (BCCH) is a downlink channel for

                                                9
   broadcast system control information.    The BCCH that is a logical channel is mapped to
   the broadcast channel (BCH) or downlink shared channel (DL-SCH) that is a transport
   channel.
   [0027]    A paging control channel (PCCH) is a downlink channel for transmitting paging
 5 signals.   The PCCH is used when the network does not know the cell location of a user
   equipment.     The PCCH that is a logical channel is mapped to the paging channel (PCH)
   that is a transport channel.     A common control channel (CCCH) is a channel for
   transmission control information between user equipments and a base station.        The
   CCCH is used in a case where the user equipments have no RRC connection with the
10 network.    In a downlink direction, the CCCH is mapped to the downlink shared channel
   (DL-SCH) that is a transport channel.     In an uplink direction, the CCCH is mapped to
   the uplink shared channel (UL-SCH) that is a transport channel.
   [0028]    A    multicast   control  channel    (MCCH)     is  a   downlink  channel  for
   point-to-multipoint transmission.   The MCCH is used for transmission of MBMS control
15 information for one or several MTCHs from a network to a user equipment.     The MCCH
   is used only by a user equipment during reception of the MBMS.      The MCCH is mapped
   to the downlink shared channel (DL-SCH) or multicast channel (MCH) that is a transport
   channel.
   [0029]    A dedicated control channel (DCCH) is a channel that transmits dedicated
20 control information between a user equipment and a network.       The DCCH is mapped to
   the uplink shared channel (UL-SCH) in uplink and mapped to the downlink shared
   channel (DL-SCH) in downlink.
   [0030]    A dedicated traffic channel (DTCH) is a point-to-point communication channel
   for transmission of user information to a dedicated user equipment.   The DTCH exists in
25 uplink as well as downlink.    The DTCH is mapped to the uplink shared channel

                                                  10
   (UL-SCH) in uplink and mapped to the downlink shared channel (DL-SCH) in downlink.
    [0031]     A multicast traffic channel (MTCH) is a downlink channel for traffic data
   transmission from a network to a user equipment.        The MTCH is a channel used only by
   a user equipment during reception of the MBMS.               The MTCH is mapped to the
 5 downlink shared channel (DL-SCH) or multicast channel (MCH).
    [0032]     GCI represents a global cell identity.     A closed subscriber group cell (CSG
   cell) is introduced in the LTE and universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS).
   The CSG is described below (see Chapter 3.1 of Non-Patent Document 3).             The closed
   subscriber group (CSG) is a cell (cell for specific subscribers) in which subscribers who
10 are allowed to use are specified by an operator.     The specified subscribers are allowed to
   access one or more E-UTRAN cells of a public land mobile network (PLMN).               One or
   more E-UTRAN cells in which the specified subscribers are allowed access are referred
   to as "CSG cell(s)".     Note that access is limited in the PLMN.     The CSG cell is part of
   the PLMN that broadcasts a specific CSG identity (CSG ID, CSG-ID).             The authorized
15 members of the subscriber group who have registered in advance access the CSG cells
   using the CSG-ID that is the access permission information.
    [0033]     The CSG-ID is broadcast by the CSG cell or cells.        A plurality of CSG-IDs
   exist in a mobile communication system.         The CSG-IDs are used by user equipments
   (UEs) for making access from CSG-related members easier.               The locations of user
20 equipments are traced based on an area composed of one or more cells.           The locations
   are traced for enabling tracing of the locations of user equipments and calling (calling of
   user equipments) even in an idle state.     An area for tracing locations of user equipments
   is referred to as a tracking area.  A CSG whitelist is a list stored in a universal subscriber
   identity module (USIM) in which all CSG IDs of the CSG cells to which the subscribers
25 belong are recorded.     The CSG whitelist is also referred to as an allowed CSG ID list in

                                                       11
   some cases.
   [0034]      A "suitable cell" is described below (see Chapter 4. 3 of Non-Patent Document
   3).   The "suitable cell" is a cell on which a UE camps to obtain normal service.            Such a
   cell shall fulfill the following conditions.
 5 [0035]      (1) The cell is part of the selected PLMN or the registered PLMN, or part of the
   PLMN of an "equivalent PLMN list".
   [0036]     (2) According to the latest information provided by a non-access stratum (NAS),
   the cell shall further fulfill the following conditions:
               (a) the cell is not a barred cell;
10             (b) the cell is part of at least one tracking area (TA), not part of the list of
   "forbidden LAs for roaming", where the cell needs to fulfill (1) above;
               (c) the cell shall fulfill the cell selection criteria; and
               (d) for a cell specified as CSG cell by system information (SI), the CSG-ID is
   part of a "CSG whitelist" of the UE (contained in the CSG whitelist of the UE).
15 [0037]      An "acceptable cell" is described below (see Chapter 4.3 of Non-Patent
   Document 3).         This is the cell on which a UE camps to obtain limited service
   (emergency calls).       Such a cell shall fulfill all the following requirements.     That is, the
   minimum required set for initiating an emergency call in an E-UTRAN network are as
   follows: (1) the cell is not a barred cell; and (2) the cell fulfills the cell selection criteria.
20 [0038]      Camping on a cell represents the state where a UE has completed the cell
   selection/reselection process and the UE has selected a cell for monitoring the system
   information and paging information.
   [0039]      3GPP is studying base stations referred to as Home-NodeB (Home-NB; HNB)
   and Home-eNodeB (Home-eNB; HeNB).                  HNB/HeNB is a base station for, for example,
25 household,      corporation     or    commercial      access    service in   UTRAN/E-UTRAN.

                                                12
   Non-Patent Document 4 discloses three different modes of the access to the HeNB and
   HNB.     Specifically, those are an open access mode, a closed access mode and a hybrid
   access mode.
   [0040]    The respective modes have the following characteristics.        In the open access
 5 mode, the HeNB and HINB are operated as a normal cell of a normal operator.            In the
   closed access mode, the HeNB and HNB are operated as a CSG cell.           The CSG cell is a
   cell where only CSG members are allowed access.         In the hybrid access mode, non-CSG
   members are allowed access at the same time.      In other words, a cell in the hybrid access
   mode (also referred to as hybrid cell) is the cell that supports both the open access mode
10 and the closed access mode.
   [0041]    3GPP discusses that all physical cell identities (PCIs) are split (referred to as
   PCI-split) into ones reserved for CSG cells and the others reserved for non-CSG cells (see
   Non-Patent Document 5).        Further, 3GPP discusses that the PCI split information is
   broadcast in the system information from the base station to the user equipments being
15 served thereby.     Non-Patent Document 5 discloses the basic operation of a user
   equipment using PCI split.       The user equipment that does not have the PCI split
   information needs to perform cell search using all PCIs (for example, using all 504 codes).
   On the other hand, the user equipment that has the PCI split information is capable of
   performing cell search using the PCI split information.
20 [0042]    Further, 3GPP is pursuing specifications standard of long term evolution
   advanced (LTE-A) as Release 10 (see Non-Patent Document 6 and Non-Patent Document
   7).
   [0043]    As to the LTE-A system, it is studied that a relay (relay node (RN)) is supported
   for achieving a high data rate, high cell-edge throughput, new coverage area or the like.
25 The relay node is wirelessly connected to the radio-access network via a donor cell

                                                  13
   (Donor eNB; DeNB).        The network (NW)-to-relay node link shares the same frequency
   band with the network-to-UE link within the range of the donor cell.        In this case, the
   UE can also be connected to the donor cell in Release 8.       The link between a donor cell
   and a relay node is referred to as a backhaul link, and the link between the relay node and
 5 the UE is referred to as an access link.
   [0044]      As the method of multiplexing backhaul links in frequency division duplex
   (FDD), the transmission from DeNB to RN is done in the downlink (DL) frequency band,
   whereas the transmission from RN to DeNB is done in the uplink (UL) frequency band.
   As the method of partitioning resources at the relay, the link from DeNB to RN and link
10 from RN to UE are time division multiplexed in a single frequency band, and the link
   from RN to DeNB and the link from UE to RN are time division multiplexed in a single
   frequency band as well.     This prevents, in the relay, the transmission of the relay from
   causing interference to the reception of its own relay.
   [0045]      As one of the techniques to be studied in LTE-A, heterogeneous networks
15 (HetNet) are added.     3GPP has decided to handle low-output-power network nodes in a
   local area range, such as pico eNB (pico cell), node for hotzone cells, HeNB/HNB/CSG
   cell, relay node, and remote radio head (RRH).
   [0046]      3GPP discusses energy saving of an infrastructure.     Currently, energy saving
   of an infrastructure is discussed as follows.       A base station or cell employed as a
20 capacity booster monitors a traffic load, and can be switched off if the state in which a
   traffic is equal to or smaller than a given threshold continues for a certain period (see
   Non-Patent Document 8).       In a case where the load of an operating base station is high,
   the base station can request that the base station that has been switched off be switched on
   (see Non-Patent Document 8).        The base station that can be switched off is a cell that
25 provides basic coverage and basic capacity (see Non-Patent Document 9).

                                                14
   [0047]    Typically, the cells that provide basic coverage and basic capacity are regarded
   as wide-area eNBs (see Non-Patent Document 10).

   Summary of Invention
20 Problem to be Solved by the Invention
   [0049]    As described above, the cells that provide basic coverage and basic capacity are
   typically regarded as wide-area eNBs.      This means that network nodes in a local area
   range are not taken into consideration in the technology disclosed in Non-Patent
   Document 8.     This leads to a problem that the conventional technology cannot reduce
25 energy consumption of network nodes in a local area range.

                                                15
   [0050]    An efficient reduction in energy consumption of network nodes in a local area
   range is an important issue for pursuing energy saving of a system.
   [0051]    An object of the present invention is to provide a mobile communication system
   capable of reducing energy consumption of network nodes in a local area range.
 5 Means to Solve the Problem
   [0052]    The present invention relates to a mobile communication system including a
   local base station device and a user equipment device configured to perform radio
   communication with the local base station device, wherein upon predetermined shift
   conditions being satisfied, the local base station device shifts from a normal operation
10 state to an energy saving operation state, the local base station device performing a
   transmission operation for downlink transmission signals to be transmitted to the user
   equipment device and a reception operation for uplink transmission signals transmitted
   from the user equipment device in the normal operation state and stopping the
   transmission operation for at least part of the downlink transmission signals and
15 performing the reception operation in the energy saving operation state.
   Effects of the Invention
   [0053]    According to the mobile communication system of the present invention, when the
   predetermined shift condition is satisfied, the local base station device shifts from the
   normal operation state to the energy saving operation state, to thereby stop the transmission
20 operation for at least part of the downlink transmission signals to be transmitted to the user
   equipment device.     As a result, energy consumption can be reduced in the local base station
   device even if the local base station device is, for example, a network node in a local area
   range.   In addition, even in the energy saving operation state, the local base station
   device performs the reception operation of the uplink transmission signals transmitted
25 from the user equipment device.         Accordingly, local the base station device can be

                                                     16
   configured to shift from the energy saving operation state to the normal operation state when,
   for example, receiving the uplink transmission signal transmitted from the user equipment
   device.    This enables the local base station device in the energy saving operation state to
   shift to the normal operation state irrespective of the location and state of the user equipment
 5 device.
   [0054]      These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present
   invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the
   present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

   Embodiments for Carrying Out the Invention
    [0056]     First Embodiment
20             FIG. 7 is a block diagram showing an overall configuration of an LTE mobile
   communication system, which is currently under discussion of 3GPP.          Currently, 3GPP
   is studying an overall system configuration including closed subscriber group (CSG) cells
   (Home-eNodeBs (Home-eNB; HeNB) of E-UTRAN, Home-NB (HNB) of UTRAN) and
   non-CSG cells (eNodeB (eNB) of E-UTRAN, NodeB (NB) of UTRAN, and BSS of
25 GERAN) and, as to E-UTRAN, is proposing the configuration as shown in FIG. 7 (see

                                                  19
   Chapter 4.6.1 of Non-Patent Document 1).
   [0057]     FIG. 7 is described.   A user equipment device (hereinafter, referred to as "user
   equipment" or "UE") 71 is capable of performing radio communication with a base
   station device (hereinafter, referred to as "base station") 72 and transmits/receives signals
 5 through radio communication.       The base stations 72 are classified into an eNB 72-1 and
   a Home-eNB 72-2.        The eNB 72-1 is connected to an MME/S-GW unit (hereinafter,
   referred to as an "MME unit") 73 including an MME, S-GW or MME and S-GW through
   an S I interface, and control information is communicated between the eNB 72-1 and the
   MME unit 73.      A plurality of MME units 73 may be connected to one eNB 72-1.          The
10 eNBs 72-1 are connected to each other by means of an X2 interface, and control
   information is communicated between the eNBs 72-1.
   [0058]     The Home-eNB 72-2 is connected to the MME unit 73 by means of the Si
   interface, and control information is communicated between the Home-eNB 72-2 and the
   MME unit 73.       A plurality of Home-eNBs 72-2 are connected to one MME unit 73.
15 While, the Home-eNBs 72-2 are connected to the MME units 73 through a Home-eNB
   Gateway (HeNBGW) 74.          The Home-eNBs 72-2 are connected to the HeNBGW 74 by
   means of the SI interface, and the HeNBGW 74 is connected to the MME units 73
   through an SI interface.     One or a plurality of Home-eNBs 72-2 are connected to one
   HeNBGW 74, and infonnation is communicated therebetween through an SI interface.
20 The HeNBGW 74 is connected to one or a plurality of MME units 73, and information is
   communicated therebetween through an SI interface.
   [0059]     Further, 3GPP is currently studying the configuration below.     The X2 interface
   between the Home-eNBs 72-2 is not supported.         The HeNBGW 74 appears to the MME
   unit 73 as the eNB 72-1.     The HeNBGW 74 appears to the Home-eNB 72-2 as the MME
25 unit 73.    The interfaces between the Home-eNBs 72-2 and the MME units 73 are the

                                                20
   same, which are the SI interfaces, irrespective of whether or not the Home-eNB 72-2 is
   connected to the MME unit 73 through the HeNBGW 74.                    The mobility to the
   Home-eNB 72-2 or the mobility from the Home-eNB 72-2 that spans the plurality of
   MME units 73 is not supported.     The Home-eNB 72-2 supports a single cell.
 5 [0060]      FIG. 8 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the user equipment
   (user equipment 71 of FIG. 7) according to the present invention.           The transmission
   process of the user equipment 71 shown in FIG. 8 is described.          First, a transmission
   data buffer unit 803 stores the control data from a protocol processing unit 801 and the
   user data from an application unit 802.    The data stored in the transmission data buffer
10 unit 803 is transmitted to an encoding unit 804 and is subjected to encoding process such
   as error correction.    There may exist the data output from the transmission data buffer
   unit 803 directly to a modulating unit 805 without encoding process.       The data encoded
   by the encoding unit 804 is modulated by the modulating unit 805.        The modulated data
   is output to a frequency converting unit 806 after being converted into a baseband signal,
15 and then is converted into a radio transmission frequency.        After that, a transmission
   signal is transmitted from an antenna 807 to the base station 72.
   [0061]      The user equipment 71 executes the reception process as follows.      The antenna
   807 receives the radio signal from the base station 72.    The received signal is converted
   from a radio reception frequency to a baseband signal by the frequency converting unit
20 806 and is then demodulated by a demodulating unit 808.           The demodulated data is
   transmitted to a decoding unit 809 and is subjected to decoding process such as error
   correction.    Among the pieces of decoded data, the control data is transmitted to the
   protocol processing unit 801, while the user data is transmitted to the application unit 802.
   A series of processes of the user equipment 71 is controlled by a control unit 810.       This
25 means that, though not shown in FIG. 8, the control unit 810 is connected to the

                                                  21
   respective units 801 to 809.
   [0062]     FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the base station (base
   station 72 of FIG. 7) according to the present invention.    The transmission process of the
   base station 72 shown in FIG. 9 is described.     An EPC communication unit 901 performs
 5 data transmission/reception between the base station 72 and the EPCs (such as MME unit
   73 and HeNBGW 74).            The EPC corresponds to a communication device.               A
   communication with another base station unit 902 performs data transmission/reception
   to/from another base station.     The X2 interface between the Home-eNBs 72-2 is not
   intended to be supported, and accordingly, it is conceivable that the communication with
10 another base station unit 902 may not exist in the Home-eNB 72-2.                  The EPC
   communication unit 901 and the communication with another base station unit 902
   respectively transmit/receive information to/from a protocol processing unit 903.        The
   control data from the protocol processing unit 903, and the user data and control data
   from the EPC communication unit 901 and the communication with another base station
15 unit 902 are stored in a transmission data buffer unit 904.
   [0063]     The data stored in the transmission data buffer unit 904 is transmitted to an
   encoding unit 905 and is then subjected to encoding process such as error correction.
   There may exist the data output from the transmission data buffer unit 904 directly to a
   modulating unit 906 without encoding process.        The encoded data is modulated by the
20 modulating unit 906.      The modulated data is output to a frequency converting unit 907
   after being converted into a baseband signal, and is then converted into a radio
   transmission frequency.     After that, a transmission signal is transmitted from an antenna
   908 to one or a plurality of user equipments 71.
   [0064]     Meanwhile, the reception process of the base station 72 is executed as follows.
25 A radio signal from one or a plurality of user equipments 71 is received by the antenna

                                                22
   908.   The received signal is converted from a radio reception frequency into a baseband
   signal by the frequency converting unit 907, and is then demodulated by a demodulating
   unit 909.   The demodulated data is transmitted to a decoding unit 910 and is then
   subjected to decoding process such as error correction.     Among the pieces of decoded
 5 data, the control data is transmitted to the protocol processing unit 903, EPC
   communication unit 901, or communication with another base station unit 902, while the
   user data is transmitted to the EPC communication unit 901 and communication with
   another base station unit 902.   A series of processes by the base station 72 is controlled
   by a control unit 911.   This means that, though not shown in FIG. 9, the control unit 911
10 is connected to the respective units 901 to 910.
   [0065]    The functions of the Home-eNB 72-2 currently under discussion of 3GPP are
   described below (see Chapter 4.6.2 of Non-Patent Document 1).        The Home-eNB 72-2
   has the same function as that of the eNB 72-1.    In addition, the Home-eNB 72-2 has the
   function of discovering a suitable serving HeNBGW 74 in a case of connection to the
15 HeNBGW 74.        The Home-eNB 72-2 is connected only to one HeNBGW 74.            That is,
   in a case of the connection to the HeNBGW 74, the Home-eNB 72-2 does not use the
   Flex function in the SI interface.      When the Home-eNB 72-2 is connected to one
   HeNBGW 74, it is not simultaneously connected to another HeNBGW 74 or another
   MME unit 73.
20 [0066]    The TAC and PLMN ID of the Home-eNB 72-2 are supported by the
   HeNBGW 74.        When the Home-eNB 72-2 is connected to the HeNBGW 74, selection of
   the MME unit 73 at "UE attachment" is performed by the HeNBGW 74 instead of the
   Home-eNB 72-2.       The Home-eNB 72-2 may be deployed without network planning.
   In this case, the Home-eNB 72-2 is moved from one geographical area to another
25 geographical area.     Accordingly, the Home-eNB 72-2 in this case is required to be

                                                 23
   connected to a different HeNBGW 74 depending on its location.
   [0067]     FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the MME (MME unit
   73 of FIG. 7) according to the present invention.     A PDN GW communication unit 1001
   performs data transmission/reception between the MME unit 73 and a PDN GW.            A base
 5 station communication unit 1002 performs data transmission/reception between the MME
   unit 73 and the base station 72 by means of the SI interface.    In the case where the data
   received from the PDN GW is user data, the user data is transmitted from the PDN GW
   communication unit 1001 to the base station communication unit 1002 through a user
   plane communication unit 1003 and is then transmitted to one or a plurality of base
10 stations 72.   In the case where the data received from the base station 72 is user data, the
   user data is transmitted from the base station communication unit 1002 to the PDN GW
   communication unit 1001 through the user plane communication unit 1003 and is then
   transmitted to the PDN GW.
   [0068]     In the case where the data received from the PDN GW is control data, the
15 control data is transmitted from the PDN GW communication unit 1001 to a control plane
   control unit 1005.    In the case where the data received from the base station 72 is control
   data, the control data is transmitted from the base station communication unit 1002 to the
   control plane control unit 1005.
   [0069]     A HeNBGW communication unit 1004 is provided in the case where the
20 HeNBGW 74 is provided, which performs data transmission/reception by means of the
   interface (IF) between the MME unit 73 and the HeNBGW 74 according to an
   information type.     The control data received from the HeNBGW communication unit
   1004 is transmitted from the HeNBGW communication unit 1004 to the control plane
   control unit 1005.     The processing results of the control plane control unit 1005 are
25 transmitted to the PDN GW through the PDN GW communication unit 1001.                    The

                                                24
   processing results of the control plane control unit 1005 are transmitted to one or a
   plurality of base stations 72 by means of the SI interface through the base station
   communication unit 1002, and are transmitted to one or a plurality of HeNBGWs 74
   through the HeNBGW communication unit 1004.
 5 [0070]     The control plane control unit 1005 includes a NAS security unit 1005-1, an
   SAE bearer control unit 1005-2 and an idle state mobility managing unit 1005-3, and
   performs overall process for the control plane.   The NAS security unit 1005-1 provides,
   for example, security of a non-access stratum (NAS) message.       The SAE bearer control
   unit 1005-2 manages, for example, a system architecture evolution (SAE) bearer.         The
10 idle state mobility managing unit 1005-3 perfonns, for example, mobility management of
   an idle state (LTE-IDLE state, which is merely referred to as idle as well), generation and
   control of paging signaling in an idle state, addition, deletion, update and search of a
   tracking area (TA) of one or a plurality of user equipments 71 being served thereby, and
   tracking area list (TA list) management.
15 [0071]     The MME unit 73 begins a paging protocol by transmitting a paging message to
   the cell belonging to a tracking area (TA) in which the UE is registered.     The idle state
   mobility managing unit 1005-3 may manage the CSG of the Home-eNBs 72-2 to be
   connected to the MME unit 73, CSG-IDs and a whitelist.
   [0072]     In the CSG-ID management, the relationship between a user equipment
20 corresponding to the CSG-ID and the CSG cell is managed (added, deleted, updated or
   searched).    For example, it may be the relationship between one or a plurality of user
   equipments whose user access registration has been performed with a CSG-ID and the
   CSG cells belonging to this CSG-ID.        In the whitelist management, the relationship
   between the user equipment and the CSG-ID is managed (added, deleted, updated or
25 searched).    For example, one or a plurality of CSG-IDs with which user registration has

                                                25
   been performed      by a user equipment        may be    stored in the    whitelist.   The
   above-mentioned management related to the CSG may be performed by another part of
   the MME unit 73.      A series of processes by the MME unit 73 is controlled by a control
   unit 1006.    This means that, though not shown in FIG. 10, the control unit 1006 is
 5 connected to the respective units 1001 to 1005.
   [0073]    The function of the MME currently under discussion of 3GPP is described
   below (see Chapter 4.6.2 of Non-Patent Document 1).           The MME performs access
   control for one or a plurality of user equipments being members of closed subscriber
   groups (CSGs).      The MME recognizes the execution of paging optimization as an
10 option.
   [0074]    FIG. 11 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the HeNBGW 74
   shown in FIG. 7 that is a HeNBGW according to the present invention.               An EPC
   communication unit 1101 performs data transmission/reception between the HeNBGW 74
   and the MME unit 73 by means of the SI interface.       A base station communication unit
15 1102 performs data transmission/reception between the HeNBGW 74 and the Home-eNB
   72-2 by means of the SI interface.    A location processing unit 1103 performs the process
   of transmitting, to a plurality of Home-eNBs 72-2, the registration information or the like
   among the data transmitted from the MME unit 73 through the EPC communication unit
   1101.    The data processed by the location processing unit 1103 is transmitted to the base
20 station communication unit 1102 and is transmitted to one or a plurality of Home-eNBs
   72-2 through the S1 interface.
   [0075]    The data only caused to pass through (to be transparent) without requiring the
   process by the location processing unit 1103 is passed from the EPC communication unit
   1101 to the base station communication unit 1102, and is transmitted to one or a plurality
25 of Home-eNBs 72-2 through the SI interface.        A series of processes by the HeNBGW

                                                26
   74 is controlled by a control unit 1104.    This means that, though not shown in FIG. 11,
   the control unit 1104 is connected to the respective units 1101 to 1103.
   [0076]    The function of the HeNBGW 74 currently under discussion of 3GPP is
   described below (see Chapter 4.6.2 of Non-Patent Document 1).            The HeNBGW 74
 5 relays an Si application.    The HeNBGW 74 terminates the SI application that is not
   associated with the user equipment 71 though it is a part of the procedures toward the
   Home-eNB 72-2 and towards the MME unit 73.            When the HeNBGW 74 is deployed,
   the procedure that is not associated with the user equipment 71 is communicated between
   the Home-eNB 72-2 and the HeNBGW 74 and between the HeNBGW 74 and the MME
10 unit 73.   The X2 interface is not set between the HeNBGW 74 and another node.        The
   HeNBGW 74 recognizes the execution of paging optimization as an option.
   [0077]    Next, an example of a typical cell search method in a mobile communication
   system is described.    FIG. 12 is a flowchart showing an outline from cell search to idle
   state operation performed by a user equipment (UE) in the LTE communication system.
15 After starting the cell search, in Step ST1201, the user equipment synchronizes the slot
   timing and frame timing by a primary synchronization signal (P-SS) and a secondary
   synchronization signal (S-SS) transmitted from a nearby base station.      Synchronization
   codes, which correspond to physical cell identities (PCIs) assigned per cell one by one,
   are assigned to the synchronization signals (SSs) including the P-SS and S-SS.        The
20 number of PCIs is currently studied in 504 ways, and these 504 ways are used for
   synchronization, and the PCIs of the synchronized cells are detected (specified).
   [0078]    Next, in Step ST1202, the user equipment detects a reference signal RS of the
   synchronized cells, which is transmitted from the base station per cell, and measures the
   received power.    The code corresponding to the PCI one by one is used for the reference
25 signal RS, and separation from another cell is enabled by correlation using the code.

                                                27
   The code for RS of the cell is derived from the PCI specified in Step ST1201, which
   makes it possible to detect the RS and measure the RS received power.
    [0079]    Next, in Step ST1203, the user equipment selects the cell having the best RS
   reception quality (for example, cell having the highest RS received power; best cell) from
 5 one or more cells that have been detected up to Step ST1202.
    [0080]    In Step ST1204, next, the user equipment receives the PBCH of the best cell,
   and obtains the BCCH that is the broadcast information.       A master information block
   (MIB) containing the cell configuration information is mapped on the BCCH over the
   PBCH.     Accordingly, the MIB is obtained by obtaining the BCCH through reception of
10 the PBCH.       Examples of the MIB information include the downlink (DL) system
   bandwidth (also referred to as transmission bandwidth configuration (dl-bandwidth)),
   transmission antenna number and system frame number (SFN).
    [0081]    In Step ST 1205, next, the user equipment receives the DL-SCH of the cell
   based on the cell configuration information of the MIB, to thereby obtain a system
15 information block (SIB) 1 of the broadcast information BCCH.        The SIB1 contains the
   information related to the access to the cell, information related to cell selection and
   scheduling information of other SIB (SIBk; k is an integer equal to or larger than two).
   In addition, the SIBI contains a tracking area code (TAC).
    [0082]    In Step ST1206, next, the user equipment compares the TAC of the SIB1
20 received in Step ST 1205 with the TAC that has been already possessed by the user
   equipment.     In a case where they are identical to each other as a result of comparison,
   the user equipment enters an idle state operation in the cell.   In a case where they are
   different from each other as a result of comparison, the user equipment requires a core
   network (EPC) (including MME and the like) to change a TA through the cell for
25 performing tracking area update (TAU).      The core network updates the TA based on an

                                                 28
   identification number (such as a UE-ID) of the user equipment transmitted from the user
   equipment together with a TAU request signal.        The core network updates the TA, and
   then transmits the TAU received signal to the user equipment.            The user equipment
   rewrites (updates) the TAC (or TAC list) of the user equipment with the TAC of the cell.
 5 After that, the user equipment enters the idle state operation in the cell.
   [0083]     In the LTE and universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS), the
   introduction of a closed subscriber group (CSG) cell is studied.         As described above,
   access is allowed for only one or a plurality of user equipments registered with the CSG
   cell.   The CSG cell and one or a plurality of user equipments registered therewith
10 constitute one CSG.       A specific identification number referred to as CSG-ID is added
   to the thus constituted CSG.    Note that one CSG may contain a plurality of CSG cells.
   After being registered with any one of the CSG cells, the user equipment can access
   another CSG cell of the CSG to which the CSG cell, with which the user equipment has
   been registered, belongs.
15 [0084]     Alternatively, the Home-eNB in the LTE or the Home-NB in the UMTS is used
   as the CSG cell in some cases.      The user equipment registered with the CSG cell has a
   whitelist.    Specifically, the whitelist is stored in the subscriber identity module
   (SIM)/USIM.      The CSG information of the CSG cell with which the user equipment has
   been registered is stored in the whitelist.     Specific examples of the CSG information
20 include CSG-ID, tracking area identity (TAI) and TAC.          Any one of the CSG-ID and
   TAC is adequate as long as they are associated with each other.         Alternatively, GCI is
   adequate as long as the CSG-ID and TAC are associated with global cell identity (GCI).
   [0085]     As can be seen from the above, the user equipment that does not have a
   whitelist (including a case where the whitelist is empty in the present invention) is not
25 allowed to access the CSG cell but is allowed to access the non-CSG cell only.         On the

                                                 29
   other hand, the user equipment which has a whitelist is allowed to access the CSG cell of
   the CSG-ID with which registration has been performed as well as the non-CSG cell.
   [0086]    3GPP discusses that all physical cell identities (PCIs) are split (referred to as
   PCI-split) into ones reserved for CSG cells and the others reserved for non-CSG cells (see
 5 Non-Patent Document 5).         Further, 3GPP discusses that the PCI split information is
   broadcast in the system information from the base station to the user equipments being
   served thereby.       Non-Patent Document 5 discloses the basic operation of a user
   equipment by PCI split.         The user equipment that does not have the PCI split
   information needs to perform cell search using all PCIs (for example, using all 504 codes).
10 On the other hand, the user equipment that has the PCI split information is capable of
   performing cell search using the PCI split information.
   [0087]    Further, 3GPP has determined that the PCIs for hybrid cells are not contained in
   the PCI range for CSG cells (see Chapter 10.7 of Non-Patent Document 1).
   [0088]    The HeNB and fHNB are required to support various services.      For example, an
15 operator causes the predetermined HeNB and HNB to register user equipments therein
   and permits only the registered user equipments to access the cells of the HeNB and H{NB,
   which increases radio resources available for the user equipments and enables high-speed
   communication.       In the above-mentioned service, the operator sets a higher accounting
   fee compared with normal service.
20 [0089]    In order to achieve the above-mentioned service, the closed subscriber group
   (CSG) cell accessible only to the registered (subscribed or member) user equipments is
   introduced.    It is required to deploy a large number of closed subscriber group (CSG)
   cells in shopping malls, apartment buildings, schools, companies and the like.          For
   example, the CSG cells are required to be deployed for each store in shopping malls, for
25 each room in apartment buildings, for each classroom in schools, and for each section in

                                                 30
   companies in such a manner that only the users who have registered with the respective
   CSG cells are permitted to use those CSG cells.      The HeNB/HNB is required not only to
   complement the communication outside the coverage of the macro cell but also to support
   various services as described above.      This leads to a case where the HeNB/HNB is
 5 deployed within the coverage of the macro cell.
   [0090]     As one of the techniques to be studied in LTE-A, heterogeneous networks
   (HetNet) are added.      3GPP handles low-output-power network nodes in a local-area
   range (local area range nodes, local area nodes and local nodes), such as pico eNB (pico
   cell), node for hotzone cells, HeNB/HNB/CSG cell, relay node and remote radio head
10 (RRH).     Accordingly, it is required to deploy networks in which one or more of the
   above-mentioned local area range nodes are incorporated in a normal eNB (macro cell).
   The networks in which one or more of the above-mentioned local area range nodes are
   incorporated in a normal eNB (macro cell) are referred to as heterogeneous networks,
   where the interference reduction method, capacity enhancement method and the like are
15 studied.
   [0091]     Currently, 3GPP discusses energy saving of an infrastructure.      The following
   is specifically discussed.   A base station or cell employed as a capacity booster monitors
   a traffic load, and is capable of being switched off if the state in which a traffic falls
   below a given threshold continues for a certain period (see Non-Patent Document 8).       In
20 a case where the load of an operating base station is high, the base station is capable of
   requesting a base station that has been switched off to be switched on (see Non-Patent
   Document 8).      A base station capable of being switched off is a cell that provides basic
   coverage and basic capacity (see Non-Patent Document 9).
   [0092]     A problem to be solved in the first embodiment is described below.
25 Non-Patent Document 8 considers the cells that provide basic coverage and basic capacity

                                                  31
   Typically, the cells that provide basic coverage and basic capacity are regarded as
   wide-area eNBs (see Non-Patent Document 10).           From the above, network nodes in a
   local area range are not taken into consideration in Non-Patent Document 8.       This leads
   to a problem that energy consumption of network nodes in a local area range cannot be
 5 reduced in a conventional technology.
   [0093]     Hereinafter, a network node in a local area range is referred to as a local eNB
   for the sake of convenience.      Conceivable examples of the wide area eNBs include a
   normal eNB (macro cell).       The local eNB corresponds to a local base station device.
   The local eNB being a local base station device has relatively small output power.         A
10 wide-area eNB being a wide-area base station device, for example, normal eNB (macro
   cell) has relatively large output power.    In other words, the output power of a local eNB
   is smaller than the output power of a wide-area eNB.
   [0094]     Non-Patent Document 8 defines that energy consumption is reduced by means
   of an X2 interface.     On the other hand, as described above, the HeNB being one of local
15 eNBs does not support an X2 interface (see Chapter 4.6.1 of Non-Patent Document 1).
   This leads to a problem that energy consumption of a HeNB cannot be reduced in the
   method disclosed in Non-Patent Document 8.
   [0095]     Further, in a case where the method disclosed in Non-Patent Document 8 is
   applied to the situation of FIG. 13, a problem described below arises.         FIG. 13 is a
20 location diagram illustrating the problem of Non-Patent Document 8.       A local eNB 1303
   is deployed near the boundary of a coverage 1302 of a macro cell 1301, that is, near a cell
   edge.   A user equipment 1305 exists within a coverage 1304 of the local eNB 1303.
   The user equipment 1305 exists outside the coverage 1302 of the macro cell 1301, that is,
   out of service of the macro cell 1301.     The user equipment 1305 is in an idle state and
25 camps on the local eNB 1303.

                                                   32
    [0096]    The user equipment 1305 being in an idle state does not affect the traffic of the
   local eNB 1303.      Therefore, even in a case where the user equipment 1305 camps on the
   local eNB 1303, if a state in which a traffic of the local eNB 1303 falls below a given
   threshold continues for a certain period, the local eNB 1303 can be switched off.         In a
 5 case where the local eNB 1303 is switched off, the user equipment 1305 is out of service
   thereof, leading to a problem that the user equipment 1305 cannot receive the service as a
   mobile communication system.
    [0097]    In a case where the load of an operating base station, which is the macro cell
    1301 in FIG. 13, is high, the base station is capable of requesting the base station that has
10 been switched off, which is the local eNB 1303 in FIG. 13, to be switched on.        However,
   the user equipment 1305 is located outside the coverage of the macro cell 1301, and
   further, is in an idle state.  Accordingly, the load of the macro cell 1301 does not become
   high due to the existence of the user equipment 1305.       That is, the local eNB 1303 is not
   switched on due to the existence of the user equipment 1305.        This causes a problem that
15 the situation in which the user equipment 1305 cannot receive the service as a mobile
   communication system continues.
    [0098]    A solution in the first embodiment is described below.               In the present
   embodiment, the local eNB supports energy saving.         Specific examples of the method of
   achieving support for energy saving are described below.        Three specific examples of a
20 trigger to shift from an operation in a normal state to an energy saving operation are
   disclosed below.      The operation of reducing energy consumption is referred to as an
   energy saving operation, and the state of this operation is referred to as an energy saving
   operation state.    The operation in a normal state is referred to as a normal operation, and
   the state of this operation is referred to as a normal operation state.
25  [0099]    (1) A case where a user equipment being in a connected state with a local eNB

                                                 33
   does not exist for a predetermined period.     Specifically, a case where a user equipment
   in a connected state does not exist to be served by a local eNB for a certain period, or a
   case where only a user equipment in an idle state exists to be served by a local eNB for a
   certain period.
 5 [0100]     (2) A case where an instruction to turn off the power for the transmission
   operation and reception operation of a local eNB is provided.      Specifically, a case where
   the power of a local eNB is turned off, specifically, a case where a power switch is turned
   off.   Alternatively, a case where energy saving is turned on, specifically, a case where an
   energy saving switch is turned on.
10 [0101]     (3) A case where a shift to an energy saving operation is instructed by another
   node.    An X2 interface, SI interface or backhaul link can be used for this instruction.
   [0102]     As a specific example of the energy saving operation, the operation of
   transmitting a downlink transmission signal being a signal to be transmitted to a user
   equipment is stopped, and an operation of receiving an uplink transmission signal being a
15 signal to be transmitted from a user equipment is performed.        That is, the transmission
   operation is turned off, whereas the reception operation is turned on.       This is different
   from switch-off disclosed in Non-Patent Document 8 in that the reception operation is
   turned on.     Further, turning-on the reception operation in the energy saving operation
   enables to use a specific example of a trigger to shift from an energy saving operation to a
20 normal operation, (1) "a case where a local eNB receives uplink transmission from a user
   equipment", which is described below.
   [0103]     As a specific example of turning off a transmission operation, the transmission
   of user data and control data is turned off.   Specific examples of the control data include
   control data associated with user data (specifically, such as Ack/Nack), data used in cell
25 search by a user equipment, broadcast information, and paging.       If a user equipment in a

                                                 34
   connected state does not exist to be served, it is not required to transmit the user data and
   the control data associated with the user data.    Meanwhile, even if a user equipment in a
   connected state does not exist to be served, it is required to transmit the data used for cell
   search by a user equipment, broadcast information, and paging.         Therefore, turning off
 5 the transmission of the data used in cell search by a user equipment, broadcast
   information, and paging in the energy saving operation is effective for reducing energy
   consumption.
   [0104]    In LTE and LTE-A, it is required to transmit the SS and RS used in cell search
   by a user equipment, the PBCH and PDCCH used for transmission of broadcast
10 information, and the PDCCH used for transmission of paging, periodically.        Accordingly,
   turning off the transmission of the data used in cell search by a user equipment, broadcast
   information, and paging is effective for reducing energy consumption.
   [0105]    As a specific example of turning on a reception operation, uplink transmission
   from a user equipment, specifically, an uplink transmission signal transmitted from a user
15 equipment is received.     Two specific examples of a trigger to shift from an energy
   saving operation to a normal operation are disclosed below.
   [0106]    (1) A case where a local eNB receives uplink transmission from a user
   equipment.
   [0107]    (2) A case where a local eNB receives a predetermined signal, for example, a
20 paging signal from a backhaul.     In this case, the backhaul is not only a backhaul link for
   a relay node, but also a wired backhaul link for a pico cell or femto cell (HeNB).
   [0108]    This is different from the switching on of a local eNB during an energy saving
   operation in accordance with the load of an operating base station, which is disclosed in
   Non-Patent Document 8, in that a shift to a normal operation is performed upon reception
25 of uplink transmission from a user equipment or reception of a paging signal from a

                                                  35
   backhaul.
   [0109]     Three specific examples of the uplink transmission from a user equipment are
   disclosed below.
   [0110]     (1) Resources in which uplink transmission is allowed for a user equipment are
 5 discrete in time.   For this reason, a local eNB does not require continuous reception but
   only requires discontinuous reception for receiving the uplink transmission signal
   (hereinafter, also referred to as an "uplink signal") through the energy saving operation.
   The discontinuous reception operation in an energy saving operation is more effective for
   reducing energy consumption compared with the continuous reception operation.
10 [0111]     (2) The resources in which transmission is allowed have a cycle in time.         This
   does not require the notification of the resources in which frequent transmission to a user
   equipment is allowed.     As a result, radio resources can be effectively used.
   [0112]     (3) Frequency allocation of the resources in which transmission is allowed is
   determined.     This enables to reduce the processing loads of a user equipment and a local
15 eNB.
   [0113]     In LTE and LTE-A, the PRACH can be used for uplink transmission from the
   user equipment.
   [0114]     As described above, the resources in which uplink transmission is allowed are
   discrete in time, which requires a reception operation only at that timing in the reception
20 operation in an energy saving operation.       That is, it is not required to continuously turn
   on the reception operation in an energy saving operation.         This is effective for reducing
   energy consumption.       This reception operation is also referred to as a discontinuous
   reception operation at times.
   [0115]     A specific example of the configuration used for the uplink transmission by a
25 user equipment is disclosed below.      The configuration used in the uplink transmission is

                                                 36
   made per local eNB that performs energy saving.     This results in that a local eNB is only
   required to perform discontinuous reception using configuration parameters for uplink
   transmission of the own cell during energy saving.         Accordingly, an energy saving
   operation with a high degree of freedom can be achieved in a local eNB.
 5 [0116]     Two specific examples of the method in which a user equipment acquires the
   configuration used for the uplink transmission by a user equipment are disclosed below.
   [0117]     (1) A user equipment is notified of the configuration used for the uplink
   transmission from a serving cell.
   [0118]     (2) In a case where a local eNB is a HeNB, when a user equipment is registered
10 with the CSG to which the HeNB belongs, the user equipment is notified of the
   configuration used for uplink transmission of the HeNB.           Specific examples of the
   notification method include the notification from a network together with the notification
   of a whitelist that is set by an owner of a HeNB and is notified from the HeNB.
   [0119]     The specific example (1) of the method in which a user equipment acquires the
15 configuration used for uplink transmission is further disclosed below.        R3-093387 by
   3GPP (hereinafter, referred to as "Non-Patent Document 11") discloses that the RACH
   configuration is notified between eNBs by means of an X2 interface for a self organized
   network (SON).       Meanwhile, an X2 interface is not supported by the HeNB that is one
   of local eNBs as described above (see Chapter 4.6.1 of Non-Patent Document 1).          This
20 causes a problem that the RACH configuration cannot be notified by the method
   disclosed in Non-Patent Document 11.
   [0120]     In the first embodiment, a local eNB notifies a neighboring node of the
   configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the own cell by means of an SI
   interface.   Disclosed below is a specific example of the method in which a local eNB
25 determines a neighboring node to be notified of the configuration parameter for uplink

                                                 37
   transmission of the own cell.
   [0121]     A neighboring node to be notified of the configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission of the own cell by a local eNB is determined based on the measurement
   results of the surrounding radio environment of the local eNB.       Specific examples of the
 5 surrounding radio environment include the measurement results of a neighboring cell.
   Specific examples of the measurement results of a neighboring cell include the reception
   quality, received power and path loss.
   [0122]     If the reception quality or received power of a certain node is equal to or larger
   than a certain threshold (or is larger than a threshold) in the measurement results of a
10 surrounding radio environment, a local eNB selects that node as a node to be notified of
   the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the own cell.      Alternatively, if the
   path loss of a certain node is smaller (or is equal to or smaller) than a certain threshold in
   the measurement results of a surrounding radio environment, a local eNB selects that
   node as a node to be notified of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the
15 own cell.    One or a plurality of nodes may be notified of the configuration parameter for
   uplink transmission of the own cell.        The selection of a node to be notified of the
   configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the own cell by the above-mentioned
   method enables to select a neighboring node.      As a result, the local eNB is not required
   to notify an unnecessary node of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of
20 the own cell, which reduces the processing load thereof.
   [0123]     The node that has been notified of the configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission of a local eNB notifies a user equipment being served thereby of that
   information.     Two specific examples of the notification method are disclosed below.
   (1) The information is notified in the broadcast information.         (2) The information is
25 notified by a dedicated signal.

                                               38
    [0124]    Specific examples of notifying the information with the use of the broadcast
   information in LTE and LTE-A are disclosed below.       The RACH configuration is used.
   Two specific examples in a case where the RACH configuration is used are disclosed
   below.
 5  [0125]    (1) The RACH configuration for a serving cell, that is, for a node that has been
   notified of a configuration parameter for uplink transmission of a local eNB and the
   RACH configuration for a local eNB are provided in the current RACH configuration.
    [0126]    (2) The uplink transmission configuration for shifting a local eNB during an
   energy saving operation to a normal operation is provided apart from the current RACH
10 configuration.
    [0127]    Two specific examples of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission
   are disclosed below.
    [0128]    (1) Resources in which uplink transmission is allowed.     Specific examples of
   the resources are a time resource and a frequency resource, and time resources, which are
15 the RACH configuration in LTE and LTE-A.        Further, specific examples thereof include
   "RACH-ConfigCommon"           and "PRACH-config"     (see   TS36.331     V9.0.0 by    3GPP
   (hereinafter, referred to as "Non-Patent Document 12")).
    [0129]    (2) Uplink frequency information.     Uplink frequency information available
   between a local eNB and a user equipment being served thereby.        Specific examples of
20 the uplink frequency information include a carrier frequency, a frequency band, and a
   component carrier.      In LTE and LTE-A, they are "freqInfo", "ul-CarrierFreq", and
   "ul-Bandwidth" (see Non-Patent Document 12).
    [0130]    The component carrier is described below.      It is considered in the LTE-A
   system that frequency bandwidths larger than the frequency bandwidths (transmission
25 bandwidths) of the LTE system are supported (see Chapter 5 of TR36.814 V1.5.0 by.

                                                  39
   3GPP (hereinafter, referred to as "Non-Patent Document 13").               Therefore, a user
   equipment supporting LTE-A is considered to simultaneously perform reception on one
   or a plurality of component carriers (CCs).        A user equipment supporting LTE-A is
   considered to have the capability for carrier aggregation to simultaneously perform
 5 reception and transmission on a plurality of component carriers, only perform reception
   on those, or only transmission on those.
   [0131]     Typically, a user equipment receives downlink transmission of a base station,
   specifically,  a downlink transmission signal transmitted from a base station to
   synchronize with the frequency of a base station based on the received downlink
10 transmission.    This function is referred to as automatic frequency control (AFC).      In a
   case where a user equipment performs uplink transmission to a local eNB during an
   energy saving operation for shifting the local eNB to a normal operation, a problem
   described below arises.    In the first embodiment, a transmission operation is turned off
   as the energy saving operation of a local eNB.         Accordingly, in a case where a user
15 equipment performs AFC, there is no downlink transmission of a base station, based on
   which a user equipment performs AFC.         This raises the issue about how to execute AFC
   by a user equipment.
   [0132]     Three specific solutions in the first embodiment are disclosed below.
   [0133]     (1) A user equipment receives downlink transmission downlinkk) of a serving
20 cell and executes AFC at the frequency of the downlink transmission.                The user
   equipment sets the frequency of the uplink of the user equipment to the uplink frequency
   information available between a local eNB and a user equipment being served thereby.
   The user equipment performs uplink transmission to a local eNB during an energy saving
   operation with the use of the uplink frequency for shifting the local eNB to a normal
25 operation.    This enables a user equipment to execute AFC on a local eNB during an

                                                 40
   energy saving operation.
   [0134]     (2) A local eNB during an energy saving operation receives downlink
   transmission (downlink) of a serving cell and executes AFC at the frequency of the
   downlink transmission.     A local eNB sets the frequency of the local eNB for receiving
 5 uplink from a user equipment to the uplink frequency available between a local eNB and
   a user equipment being served thereby.      A local eNB receives uplink transmission from
   a user equipment using this frequency.      A local eNB may perform the AFC operation
   before receiving uplink transmission from a user equipment.       Specific examples of the
   uplink transmission from a user equipment include uplink transmission for shifting a local
10 eNB during an energy saving operation to a nonnal operation.
   [0135]     (3) (1) and (2) described above are used in combination.       In this case, the
   frequency of a user equipment and the frequency of a local eNB coincide with each other
   with higher accuracy than the case where (1) or (2) is used singly.        This enables to
   achieve an effect that the communication quality of uplink from a user equipment to a
15 local eNB is improved.
   [0136]     Next, four specific examples of the situation in which a user equipment
   performs uplink transmission (hereinafter, also referred to as uplink transmission for
   wakeup) for shifting a local eNB during an energy saving operation to a normal operation
   are disclosed below.
20 [0137]     (1) A case where the reception quality of a serving cell deteriorates or a case
   where a cell that can serve as a serving cell does not exist. For example, in a case where
   a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists at the cell edge of a serving cell, the
   local eNB shifts to a normal operation upon wakeup uplink transmission from a user
   equipment.     Upon this, handover is performed from a serving cell to the local eNB or
25 cell reselection to the local eNB is performed, so that the user equipment is capable of

                                                   41
   continuously receiving the service of a mobile communication system.
    [0138]    (2) A case where conditions of RACH transmission in a conventional
   technology are satisfied.     As a specific example, a case where TAU transmission or a
   service request from a user equipment is made (also referred to as a call at times).
 5  [0139]    (3) Periodically.
    [0140]    (4) A case where a user makes an operation.
    [0141]    A specific example of the judging method in the (1) case where the reception
   quality of a serving cell deteriorates is disclosed below.        Based on the measurement
   results of a user equipment, in a case where the reception quality (such as received power
10 or SIR) of a serving cell falls below (or may be equal to or smaller than or be smaller
   than) a threshold (hereinafter, also referred to as a wakeup uplink transmission threshold
   at times), it is judged that wakeup uplink transmission is performed.          Alternatively,
   based on the measurement results of a user equipment, in a case where the reception
   quality (such as path loss) of a serving cell exceeds (may be equal to or larger than or be
15 larger than) a threshold (hereinafter, also referred to as a wakeup uplink transmission
   threshold at times), it is judged that wakeup uplink transmission is performed.
    [0142]    Two specific examples of the method of notifying a user equipment of the
   wakeup uplink transmission threshold are disclosed below.
    [0143]    (1) A serving cell notifies a user equipment being served thereby of the wakeup
20 uplink transmission threshold.      The broadcast information is conceivable as an example
   of the notification method.     This is effective because a user equipment being served by a
   serving cell can be notified irrespective of a state.       In addition, a threshold can be
   changed easily, which enables to build a flexible mobile communication system.       In LTE
   and LTE-A, the wakeup uplink transmission threshold can be used in combination with a
25 neighboring cell measurement start threshold (Sintrasearch) (see Chapter 5.2.4.2 of

                                                 42
   Non-Patent Document 3).       As a result, parameters can be reduced, and radio resources
   can be effectively used.
   [0144]     (2) The wakeup uplink transmission threshold is determined in a static manner.
   This does not require a notification to a user equipment using radio resources, so that
 5 radio resources can be effectively used.
   [0145]     Disclosed below are two specific examples of the situation in which,
   particularly when a local eNB is a HeNB, a user equipment performs uplink transmission
   (wakeup uplink transmission) for shifting a local eNB during an energy saving operation
   to a normal operation.
10 [0146]     Non-Patent Document I discloses that the method of cell selection/reselection
   to CSG cells is based on an autonomous search function.           Non-Patent Document 3
   discloses that a user equipment uses an autonomous search function for searching for a
   CSG cell being a "suitable cell" at a frequency different from a serving frequency.
   Further, Non-Patent Document 1 discloses that a user equipment supports manual
15 selection of CSG cells.    It is disclosed that if the CSG whitelist configured in a user
   equipment is empty, the autonomous search function of CSG cells by a user equipment is
   disabled.
   [0147]     (1) In manual selection of a CSG cell.    As a specific example, wakeup uplink
   transmission is performed before the measurement for selection.      Accordingly, even in a
20 case where a HeNB performing an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood of
   a user equipment, the HeNB is caused to shift to a normal operation.        Therefore, it is
   possible to perform CSG cell selection where the HeNB is included as a target.
   [0148]     (2) While an autonomous search function is in operation, wakeup uplink
   transmission is performed periodically.      Accordingly, even in a case where a HeNB
25 performing an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood of a user equipment,

                                                  43
   the HeNB is caused to shift to a normal operation.          Therefore, it is possible to perform
   CSG cell selection where the HeNB is included as a target.            Even in a case where the
   configuration is made as described above, an autonomous search function becomes
   inoperative in a case where the CSG whitelist configured in the user equipment is empty.
 5 Upon this, uplink transmission for releasing an energy saving operation of a HeNB is
   stopped.    Accordingly, an effect that unnecessary uplink transmission is eliminated can
   be achieved.    The CSG whitelist is also referred to as an allowed CSG list (allowed CSG
   ID list) in some cases.
   [0149]     As described above, conceivable examples of local eNBs include pico eNB
10 (pico cell), node for hotzone cells, HeNB/HNB/CSG cell, relay node, and remote radio
   head (RRH).      A trigger to shift from an energy saving operation to a normal operation
   may vary from type to type of a local eNB.        Alternatively, wakeup uplink transmission
   may vary from type to type of a local eNB.       Still alternatively, a situation in which a user
   equipment performs uplink transmission (wakeup uplink transmission) for shifting a local
15 eNB during an energy saving operation to a normal operation may vary from type to type
   of a local eNB.
   [0150]     As a specific example, as to a relay node, the situation in which wakeup uplink
   transmission is performed may be a case where the reception quality of a serving cell
   deteriorates.   As to a HeNB, the situation in which uplink transmission for wakeup is
20 performed may be such that uplink transmission for wakeup is performed periodically
   while an autonomous search function is in operation.              This enables to perform an
   optimum energy saving operation per type of a local eNB.
   [0151]     While the first embodiment above has described the case where a serving cell is
   a macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the first embodiment if a
25 serving cell is a local eNB, so that similar effects to those of the first embodiment can be

                                                 44
   achieved.
   [0152]     While the first embodiment has described the case where the node that performs
   an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be performed as in
   the first embodiment if the node that performs an energy saving operation is a wide-area
 5 eNB, where similar effects to those of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0153]     The first embodiment can be used in combination with a conventional
   technology of reducing energy consumption disclosed in, for example, Non-Patent
   Document 8.
   [0154]     A specific operation example in which the first embodiment is used is described
10 with reference to FIG. 14 and FIG. 15.        FIG. 14 is a location diagram illustrating a
   solution of the first embodiment.   The portions of FIG. 14 corresponding to those of FIG.
   13 are denoted by the same reference numerals, which are not described.              A user
   equipment 1401 exists within the coverage 1302 of the macro cell 1301, that is, exists
   within the service area of the macro cell 1301.
15 [0155]     Next, description is given of a sequence example of a mobile communication
   system in which the solution of the first embodiment is used with reference to FIG. 15.
   FIG. 15 illustrates a sequence example of a mobile communication system in a case
   where the solution of the first embodiment is used.        In this operation example, a case
   where a serving cell is the macro cell 1301 is described.
20 [0156]     In Step ST1501, the local eNB 1303 determines a neighboring node to be
   notified of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission.       A specific example of
   the determining method is as described above.      In this operation example, the macro cell
   1301 is selected as one of the neighboring nodes to be notified of the configuration
   parameter for uplink transmission.
25 [0157]     In Step ST1502, the local eNB 1303 notifies the macro cell 1301 of the

                                                   45
   configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the own cell, that is, the local eNB
    1303.   A specific example of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission is as
   described above.      While a specific example of the uplink transmission is as described
   above, the PRACH is used as a specific example of the uplink transmission in this
 5 operation example.      Therefore, the RACH configuration of the local eNB 1303 is used
   as   a specific example       of the configuration     parameter    for uplink transmission.
   Alternatively, the uplink frequency information available between a local eNB and a user
   equipment being served thereby may be notified as the configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission.
10  [0158]    In Step ST1503, the local eNB 1303 judges the presence or absence of a trigger
   to shift from a normal operation to an energy saving operation.         A specific example of
   the shift trigger is as described above.    In a case of judging that there is a trigger to shift
   to an energy saving operation, the local eNB 1303 moves to Step ST1504.             In a case of
   judging that there is no trigger to shift to an energy saving operation, the local eNB 1303
15 repeats the judgment of Step ST1503.
    [0159]    In Step ST1504, the local eNB 1303 shifts to an energy saving operation.         As a
   specific example of the energy saving operation, the transmission operation is turned off
   and the reception operation is turned on as described above.
    [0160]    In Step ST1505, the local eNB 1303 starts discontinuous reception.              As a
20 specific example, the local eNB 1303 starts discontinuous reception for receiving uplink
   transmission with the RACH configuration of the local eNB 1303.
    [0161]    The same effect can be obtained if the process of Step ST1502 is performed
   after the process of Step ST1503, after the process of Step ST1504, or after the process of
   Step ST1505.
25  [0162]    In Step ST1506, the macro cell 1301 being a serving cell notifies user

                                                  46
   equipments being served thereby of the RACH configuration of the own cell, that is, the
   macro cell 1301.     The user equipments (UEs) being served by the macro cell 1301
   include the user equipment 1401.
   [0163]     In Step ST1507, the macro cell 1301 notifies user equipments being served
 5 thereby of the RACH configuration of the local eNB 1303 received in Step ST1502.
   Alternatively, the macro cell 1301 may notify the uplink frequency information available
   between a local eNB and user equipments being served thereby.                The information
   indicating whether or not the local eNB is in an energy saving operation may be included.
   The user equipments being served by the macro cell 1301 include the user equipment
10 1401.
   [0164]     In Step ST1508, the user equipment 1401 judges whether or not to perform
   uplink transmission for wakeup.       A specific example of the situation in which uplink
   transmission for wakeup is performed is as described above.        In this operation example,
   the situation in which uplink transmission for wakeup is performed is the case where the
15 reception quality of a serving cell deteriorates.         As a specific example, the user
   equipment 1401 judges whether or not the reception quality of the macro cell 1301 being
   a serving cell (hereinafter, also referred to as "serving cell 1301") falls below the wakeup
   uplink transmission threshold.     In a case where the reception quality of the serving cell
   1301 falls below the wakeup uplink transmission threshold, the user equipment 1401
20 moves to Step ST1509.       In a case where the reception quality of the serving cell 1301
   does not fall below the wakeup uplink transmission threshold, the user equipment 1401
   repeats the judgment of Step ST1508.
   [0165]     In Step ST1509, the user equipment 1401 performs RACH transmission as
   uplink transmission for wakeup.      The user equipment may be allowed to perform uplink
25 transmission to a local eNB that cannot be detected in the measurements of neighboring

                                                  47
   cells by the user equipment 1401.      In the RACH transmission, the user equipment 1401
   transmits the RACH with the use of the RACH configuration of the local eNB 1303 that
   has been received in Step ST1507.       Alternatively, the user equipment 1401 may transmit
   the RACH with the use of the uplink frequency available between a local eNB and user
 5 equipments being served thereby that has been received in Step ST1507.                   Still
   alternatively, as described above, the user equipment 1401 may perform AFC on a local
   eNB with the use of downlink transmission of the macro cell 1301 and transmit the
   RACH.
    [0166]    In Step ST1510, the local eNB 1303 judges the presence or absence of a trigger
10 to shift from an energy saving operation to a normal operation.        A specific example of
   the shift trigger is as described above.    In this operation example, a specific example of
   the shift trigger is the case where the local eNB 1303 receives uplink transmission from
   the user equipment 1401.      The local eNB 1303 judges whether or not it has received the
   RACH as uplink transmission for wakeup.          The local eNB 1303 moves to Step ST1511
15 in a case of judging that it has received the RACH.          The local eNB 1303 repeats the
   judgment of Step ST1510 in a case ofjudging that it has not received the RACH.
    [0167]    In Step ST151 1, the local eNB 1303 shifts to a normal operation.
    [0168]    The first embodiment described above achieves an effect described below.
   According to the first embodiment, it is possible to perform an energy saving operation in
20 a local eNB, which reduces energy consumption of an infrastructure in a mobile
   communication system.
    [0169]    In a conventional technology of Non-Patent Document 8, a reduction in energy
   consumption of an infrastructure using an X2 interface is defined.      The first embodiment
   discloses the method of reducing energy consumption of an infrastructure in which an X2
25 interface is not used.    This enables to reduce energy consumption also in a HeNB that

                                                   48
   does not support an X2 interface.      It is required to deploy a large number of HeNBs as
   described above, and thus, a reduction in energy consumption of a HeNB is conducive to
   a reduction in energy consumption of the entire mobile communication system.
   [0170]     In the first embodiment, a local eNB during an energy saving operation can be
 5 shifted to a normal operation without using the load of a network disclosed in a
   conventional technology of Non-Patent Document 8.            That is, a local eNB during an
   energy saving operation can be shifted to a normal operation irrespective of a position
   (location) of a user equipment, or irrespective of a state of a user equipment.
   [0171]     Accordingly, also in a location as shown in FIG. 13 that causes a problem in a
10 case where a conventional technology of Non-Patent Document 8 is used, it is possible to
   turn on the local eNB 1303, that is, to shift the local eNB 1303 to a normal operation.
   This solves a problem that the user equipment 1305 cannot receive the service as a mobile
   communication system.
   [0172]     The present embodiment has disclosed that a transmission operation is turned
15 off and the reception operation is turned on as the energy saving operation.      This only
   requires to collectively turn off power supply of a transmission unit of a local eNB but
   turn on the power supply of only a reception unit during an energy saving operation.
   Therefore, it becomes easier to design hardware for performing an energy saving
   operation.
20 [0173]     First Modification of First Embodiment
              A problem to be solved in a first modification of the first embodiment is
   described.    Even in a case where the solution of the first embodiment is executed, two
   problems described below arise if a large number of local eNBs exist in the neighborhood
   of a macro cell.
25 [0174]     (1) The configuration parameters for uplink transmission of local eNBs, which

                                                 49
   are notified from the local eNB to the macro cell, increase.       That is, the types of the
   configuration parameters for uplink transmission of local eNBs, which are notified from
   the macro cell to user equipments being served thereby, increase.         This increases the
   amount of information of the configuration parameters for uplink transmission of the
 5 local eNB, which are notified from the macro cell to user equipments being served
   thereby.    Accordingly, a problem that a large amount of radio resources needs to be used
   arises.
   [0175]     (2) The types of the configuration parameters for uplink transmission for uplink
   transmission for wakeup, which is performed by a user equipment, increase.        Therefore,
10 a user equipment needs to perform uplink configuration for an amount of the types and
   perform uplink transmission for the amount of the types.       This increases the processing
   load of a user equipment, causing a problem that the energy consumption of a user
   equipment increases.
   [0176]     The problem of the first modification of the first embodiment is described again
15 with reference to FIG. 15 and FIG. 16.       FIG. 16 is a location diagram illustrating the
   problem of the first modification of the first embodiment.         The portions of FIG. 16
   corresponding to those of FIG. 13 and FIG. 14 are denoted by the same reference
   numerals, which are not described.     A plurality of local eNBs, specifically, a local eNB
   1601, a local eNB 1603, a local eNB 1605, and a local eNB 1607 are deployed near the
20 boundary of the coverage 1302 of the macro cell 1301, that is, near the cell edge.       The
   local eNB 1601 has a coverage 1602.        The local eNB 1603 has a coverage 1604.       The
   local eNB 1605 has a coverage 1606.      The local eNB 1607 has a coverage 1608.
   [0177]     A sequence example of a mobile communication system in a case where the
   first embodiment is executed with the location as shown in FIG. 16 is described with
25 reference to FIG. 15.    In Step ST1501, not only the local eNB 1303 but also the local

                                                  50
   eNB 1601, the local eNB 1603, the local eNB 1605 and the local eNB 1607 select the
   macro cell 1301 as a neighboring node to be notified of the configuration parameter for
   uplink transmission.
   [0178]     In Step ST1502, the local eNB 1303 notifies the macro cell 1301 of the
 5 configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the local eNB 1303.     In Step ST1502,
   the local eNB 1601 notifies the macro cell 1301 of the configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission of the local eNB 1601.       In Step ST1502, the local eNB 1603 notifies the
   macro cell 1301 of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the local eNB
   1603.    In Step ST1502, the local eNB 1605 notifies the macro cell 1301 of the
10 configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the local eNB 1605.     In Step ST1502,
   the local eNB 1607 notifies the macro cell 1301 of the configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission of the local eNB 1607.
   [0179]     In Step ST1507, the macro cell 1301 notifies user equipments (including the
   user equipment 1401) being served thereby of the RACH configurations of the local eNB
15 1303, local eNB 1601, local eNB 1603, local eNB 1605, and local eNB 1607 that have
   been received in Step ST1502.          In this manner, the amount of information of the
   configuration parameters for uplink transmission of local eNBs increases, causing a
   problem that a large amount of radio resources needs to be used.
   [0180]     In Step ST1508, the user equipment 1401 judges whether or not to perform
20 uplink transmission for wakeup and, in a case of judging to perform uplink transmission
   for wakeup, performs uplink transmission for wakeup in Step ST1509.            The RACH
   configurations of the local eNB 1303, local eNB 1601, local eNB 1603, local eNB 1605,
   and local eNB 1607 that have been received in Step ST1507 are used as the configuration
   parameters for the uplink transmission for wakeup.
25 [0181]     In this case, the user equipment 1401 is located within the coverage 1304 of the

                                                   51
   local eNB 1303 but is not located within the coverage 1602 of the local eNB 1601, the
   coverage 1604 of the local eNB 1603, the coverage 1606 of the local eNB 1605, and the
   coverage 1608 of the local eNB 1607.         Therefore, it suffices that uplink transmission for
   wakeup is performed in the location of the user equipment 1401 only with the use of the
 5 RACH configuration of the local eNB 1303.           This is because the user equipment 1401
   cannot receive the service of a mobile communication system from the local eNB 1603
   even if the local eNB 1603 shifts from an energy saving operation to a normal operation.
   [0182]     However, the transmission operation is turned off as the energy saving
   operation of the local eNB, and accordingly, the user equipment 1401 cannot judge of
10 which local eNB that the own user equipment is located within the coverage.                 This
   requires the user equipment 1401 to perform uplink transmission for makeup in Step
   ST1509 with the use of the RACH configurations of the local eNB 1303, local eNB 1601,
   local eNB 1603, local eNB 1605, and local eNB 1607 that have been received in Step
   ST1507.     As a result, it is required to perform uplink configuration for an amount of the
15 types (five types in the case of FIG. 16) and perform uplink transmission as many times
   as the types (five times in the case of FIG. 16).    This increases the processing load of the
   user equipment 1401, causing a problem that energy consumption of the user equipment
   1401 increases.
   [0183]    The solution in the first modification of the first embodiment is described below.
20 A part different from the solution of the first embodiment is mainly described.          A part
   that is not described is similar to the first embodiment.
   [0184]     In the present modification, the configuration used for uplink transmission
   when a user equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup is used together with the
   configuration used for uplink transmission of a serving cell.         A local eNB performs an
25 energy saving operation based on the configuration used for uplink transmission of a

                                                   52
   serving cell.   A local eNB may perform discontinuous reception during an energy saving
   operation so as to receive the resources in which transmission is allowed in the
   configuration used for uplink transmission of the serving cell.
   [0185]     As a result, a serving cell is not required to notify user equipments being served
 5 thereby of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of a local eNB.             This
   enables to effectively use radio resources.      In addition, this reduces the processing load
   of a serving cell.   Further, it is possible to reduce the types of configuration parameters
   for uplink transmission for uplink transmission for wakeup performed by a user
   equipment.     This reduces the processing load of a user equipment and reduces energy
10 consumption of a user equipment.
   [0186]     (Al) and (A2) below are disclosed as two specific examples of the method in
   which a local eNB acquires the configuration used for uplink transmission (configuration
   parameter for uplink transmission) of the serving cell.
   [0187]     (Al) Non-Patent Document 11 discloses that the RACH configuration is
15 notified by means of an X2 interface between eNBs for a self organized network (SON).
   Meanwhile, an X2 interface is not supported in a HeNB that is one of local eNBs as
   described above (see Chapter 4.6.1 of Non-Patent Document 1).             Therefore, a problem
   that a HeNB cannot be notified of the RACH configuration arises in the method disclosed
   in Non-Patent Document 11.        In the first modification of the first embodiment, a serving
20 cell notifies a neighboring node of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of
   the own cell by means of an SI interface.
   [0188]     (A2) A local eNB measures a surrounding radio environment in initialization,
   turning-on of power or turning-off of transmission at times.          Specific examples of the
   surrounding radio environment include the measurement results of neighboring cells.          In
25 measuring neighboring cells, a local eNB receives the broadcast information, decodes the

                                                 53
   broadcast information, acquires the configuration         used for uplink transmission
   (configuration parameter for uplink transmission) of a neighboring cell included in the
   broadcast information, and stores the configuration used for uplink transmission of the
   neighboring cell.   The measurement, reception of the broadcast information, and storage
 5 of the configuration used for uplink transmission of a neighboring cell may be performed
   by a local eNB having the capability to perform an energy saving operation, not by all
   local eNBs.
    [0189]   (B1) and (B2) below are disclosed as specific examples of the method in which
   a serving cell determines a neighboring node to be notified of the configuration parameter
10 for uplink transmission of the own cell in a case of using the specific example of the
   method (Al) in which the local eNB acquires the configuration used for uplink
   transmission (configuration parameter for uplink transmission) of the serving cell.    One
   or a plurality of nodes may be notified of the configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission of the own cell.   The selection of a node to be notified of the configuration
15 parameter for uplink transmission of the own cell by the above-mentioned method
   enables to select a neighboring node.        This eliminates the need to notify even an
   unnecessary node of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the own cell,
   whereby the processing load of a serving cell is reduced.
    [0190]   (B1)  A neighboring node to be notified of the configuration parameter for
20 uplink transmission of a serving cell is determined based on the measurement results of a
   surrounding radio environment of the own cell.       Specific examples of the surrounding
   radio environment include the measurement results of a neighboring cell.           Specific
   examples of the measurement results of a neighboring cell include the reception quality,
   received power and path loss.     If the reception quality or received power of a certain
25 node is equal to or larger than a certain threshold (or is larger than a threshold) in the

                                                   54
   measurement results of a surrounding radio environment, a serving cell selects that node
   as a node to be notified of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the own
   cell.   Alternatively, if the path loss of a certain node is smaller (or is equal to or smaller)
   than a certain threshold in the measurement results of a surrounding radio environment, a
 5 serving cell selects that node as a node to be notified of the configuration parameter for
   uplink transmission of the own cell.
   [0191]     (B2) A neighboring node to be notified of the configuration parameter for
   uplink transmission of a serving cell is determined based on the measurement results of a
   user equipment being served by the own cell.          As a specific example, if the reception
10 quality or received power of a certain node is equal to or larger than a certain threshold
   (or is larger than a threshold), a serving cell selects that node as a node to be notified of
   the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the own cell.        Alternatively, if the
   path loss of a certain node is smaller (or is equal to or smaller) than a certain threshold in
   the measurement results of a surrounding radio environment, a serving cell selects that
15 node as a node to be notified of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the
   own cell.
   [0192]     (C) described below is disclosed as a specific example of the method in which a
   local eNB determines a neighboring cell for which the local eNB receives the broadcast
   information, decodes the broadcast information, and stores the configuration used for
20 uplink transmission (configuration parameter for uplink transmission) in a case of using
   the specific example of the method (A2) in which the local eNB acquires the
   configuration    used for uplink transmission          (configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission).
   [0193]     (C) A neighboring cell is determined based on the measurement results of a
25 surrounding radio environment of the local eNB.          Specific examples of the surrounding

                                                55
   radio environment include the measurement results of neighboring cells.             Specific
   examples of the measurement results of a neighboring cell include the reception quality,
   received power and path loss.
   [0194]     If a node has the reception quality or received power equal to or larger than a
 5 certain threshold (or larger than a threshold) in the measurement results of a surrounding
   radio environment, a local eNB selects that cell as a neighboring cell for which the local
   eNB receives the broadcast information, decodes the broadcast information, and stores the
   configuration    used  for uplink transmission      (configuration  parameter for uplink
   transmission).    Meanwhile, if a node has the path loss smaller than (or equal to or
10 smaller than) a certain threshold in the measurement results of a surrounding radio
   environment, the local eNB selects that cell as a neighboring cell for which the local eNB
   receives the broadcast information, decodes the broadcast information, and stores the
   configuration    used  for uplink    transmission   (configuration  parameter   for uplink
   transmission).
15 [0195]     It may be one or a plurality of neighboring cells for which the local eNB
   receives the broadcast information, decodes the broadcast information, and stores the
   configuration used for uplink transmission.       The selection of a neighboring cell for
   which the local eNB receives the broadcast information, decodes the broadcast
   information,    and stores the    configuration used    for uplink transmission      by the
20 above-mentioned method enables to select a neighboring cell.       This eliminates the need
   to unnecessarily receive the broadcast information of a neighboring cell, decode the
   broadcast information thereof, and store the configuration used for uplink transmission
   thereof, whereby the processing load of a local eNB is reduced.
   [0196]     Two specific examples of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission
25 are disclosed below.

                                                 56
   [0197]     (1) Resources in which uplink transmission is allowed.     Specific examples of
   the resources are a time resource and a frequency resource, or time resources, which are
   the RACH configurations in LTE and LTE-A.              Further, specific examples thereof
   include "RACH-ConfigCommon" and "PRACH-config" (see Non-Patent Document 12).
 5 [0198]     (2) Uplink frequency information.      Uplink frequency information available
   between a serving cell and a user equipment being served thereby.      Specific examples of
   the uplink frequency information include a carrier frequency, a frequency band, and a
   component carrier.      In LTE and LTE-A, they are "freqInfo", "ul-CarrierFreq" and
   "ul-Bandwidth" (see Non-Patent Document 12).
10 [0199]     Three specific examples of the method of performing AFC in the first
   modification of the first embodiment are disclosed below.
   [0200]     (1) A user equipment receives downlink transmission (downlink) of a serving
   cell and executes AFC at the frequency of the downlink transmission.              The user
   equipment sets the frequency of the uplink of the user equipment to the uplink frequency
15 information available between a serving cell and a user equipment being served thereby.
   In order to shift a local eNB during an energy saving operation to a normal operation, the
   user equipment performs uplink transmission to the local eNB with the use of the
   frequency of the uplink.    This enables a user equipment to perform AFC.
   [0201]     (2) A local eNB during an energy saving operation receives downlink
20 transmission (downlink) of a serving cell and executes AFC at the frequency of the
   downlink transmission.      The local eNB sets the frequency of the local eNB for receiving
   uplink from a user equipment to the uplink frequency information available between a
   serving cell and a user equipment being served thereby.     The local eNB receives uplink
   transmission from a user equipment using the frequency.       The local eNB may perform
25 the AFC operation before receiving uplink transmission from a user equipment.      Specific

                                                 57
   examples of the uplink transmission from a user equipment include uplink transmission
   for shifting a local eNB during an energy saving operation to a normal operation.
    [0202]    (3) (1) and (2) described above are used in combination.       In this case, the
   frequency of a user equipment and the frequency of a local eNB coincide with each other
 5 with higher accuracy than the case where (1) or (2) is used singly.         This enables to
   achieve an effect that the communication quality of uplink from user equipment to a local
   eNB is improved.
    [0203]    Next, four specific examples of a situation in which a user equipment performs
   uplink transmission for wakeup are disclosed below.
10  [0204]    (1) A case where the reception quality of a serving cell deteriorates or a case
   where a cell that can serve as a serving cell does not exist. For example, in a case where
   a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists at the cell edge of a serving cell, the
   local eNB shifts to a normal operation upon wakeup uplink transmission from a user
   equipment.     Upon this, handover is performed from a serving cell to the local eNB or
15 cell reselection is performed to the local eNB, so that the user equipment is capable of
   continuously receiving the service of a mobile communication system.
    [0205]    (2) A case where conditions of RACH transmission in a conventional
   technology are satisfied.    As a specific example, a case where TAU transmission or a
   service request from a user equipment is made (also referred to as a call at times).    The
20 local eNB receives normal uplink transmission from a user equipment being served by a
   serving cell to the serving cell.  The local eNB that has received the uplink transmission
   judges that a user equipment exists near the own cell, and then shifts from the energy
   saving operation to the normal operation.      Specific examples of the uplink transmission
   include the PRACH.       As a specific example of the judgment, if the reception quality or
25 received power in uplink transmission from a user equipment is equal to or larger than a

                                                  58
   certain threshold (or is larger than a threshold), a local eNB judges that a user equipment
   exists near the own cell.    Meanwhile, if the path loss in uplink transmission from a user
   equipment is equal to or smaller than a certain threshold (or is smaller than a threshold), a
   local eNB judges that a user equipment exists near the own cell.
 5 [0206]     (3) Periodically.
   [0207]     (4) A case where a user makes an operation.
   [0208]     A specific operation example in which the first modification of the first
   embodiment is used is described with reference to FIG. 16 and FIG. 17.        FIG. 16 being a
   location diagram illustrating the solution of the first modification of the first embodiment
10 is as described above, which is not described.     FIG. 17 illustrates a sequence example of
   a mobile communication system in a case where the solution of the first modification of
   the first embodiment is used.     The portions of FIG. 17 corresponding to those of FIG. 15
   are denoted by the same step numbers, and the processes thereof are not described in
   detail.
15 [0209]     This operation example discloses a case of using the specific example of the
   method (2) in which a local eNB acquires the configuration used for uplink transmission
   (configuration parameter for uplink transmission) of a serving cell.               While the
   description is given of the local eNB 1303 as an example of the local eNB, a similar
   operation is performed for the local eNB 1601, local eNB 1603, local eNB 1605, and
20 local eNB 1607.
   [0210]     In Step ST1701, the local eNB 1303 measures neighboring cells.            In Step
   ST1702, the local eNB 1303 determines a neighboring cell of which configuration
   parameter for uplink transmission the local eNB 1303 stores.        A specific example of the
   determination method is as follows.       In the location shown in FIG. 16, the local eNB
25 1303 selects the macro cell 1301 as a neighboring cell of which configuration parameter

                                                 59
   for uplink transmission the local eNB 1303 stores.
   [0211]     In Step ST1703, the local eNB 1303 stores the configuration parameter for
   uplink transmission of a neighboring cell that has been determined in Step ST1702.        In
   the location shown in FIG. 16, the local eNB 1303 stores the configuration parameter for
 5 uplink transmission of the macro cell 1301.        Then, the local eNB 1303 performs the
   processes of Step ST1503 and Step ST1504.
   [0212]     In Step ST1704, the local eNB 1303 starts discontinuous reception.         As a
   specific example, the local eNB 1303 starts discontinuous reception for receiving uplink
   transmission    with the   configuration    parameter   (as  a specific example,    RACH
10 configuration) for uplink transmission of the macro cell 1301 that has been stored in Step
   ST1703.     Then, the macro cell 1301 performs the process of Step ST1506, and the user
   equipment 1401 performs the process of Step ST1508.
   [0213]     In Step ST1705, the user equipment 1401 performs RACH transmission.            In
   the RACH transmission, the user equipment 1401 transmits the RACH with the use of the
15 configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the macro cell 1301 that has been
   stored in Step ST1703.     Alternatively, the user equipment 1401 may transmit the RACH
   with the use of the uplink frequency available between the macro cell 1301 and a user
   equipment being served thereby, which has been stored in Step ST1703.       Next, the local
   eNB 1303 performs the processes of Step ST1510 and Step ST151 1.
20 [0214]     While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
   macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the first modification of the first
   embodiment if the serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the first
   modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0215]     While the present modification has described the case where the node that
25 performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be

                                                  60
   performed as in the first modification of the first embodiment if the node that performs an
   energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of the first
   modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0216]     The first modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
 5 below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.
   [0217]     Even if a large number of local eNBs exist in the neighborhood of a macro cell,
   the macro cell does not need to notify user equipments being served thereby of the
   configuration parameters for uplink transmission of the local eNBs.         This enables to
   effectively use radio resources.   In addition, the processing load of a serving cell can be
10 reduced.
   [0218]     The transmission operation is turned off as the energy saving operation of a
   local eNB, and accordingly, it is possible to reduce the types of the configuration
   parameters in uplink transmission for uplink transmission for wakeup even in a case
   where a user equipment cannot judge of which local eNB that the own user equipment is
15 located within the coverage.     This reduces the processing load of a user equipment and
   reduces energy consumption of a user equipment.
   [0219]     Second Modification of First Embodiment
              A problem to be solved in a second modification of the first embodiment is
   described.    Even in a case where the solutions of the first embodiment and the first
20 modification of the first embodiment are executed, a problem described below arises if
   base stations, for example, macro cells are densely deployed.
   [0220]     It is conceivable that the configuration parameters for uplink transmission of
   macro cells, which are notified from macro cells to a local eNB, will increase.
   Alternatively, it is conceivable that neighboring cells that store the configuration
25 parameters for uplink transmission, which are selected by the local eNBs, will increase.

                                                 61
   [0221]     The local eNB has no way to acquire that a user equipment which performs
   uplink transmission for wakeup uses which macro cell to perform uplink transmission for
   wakeup with the use of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission.      Therefore,
   the local eNB needs to perform an energy saving operation with the use of the plurality of
 5 notified configuration parameters for uplink transmission of macro cells or with the use of
   the plurality of stored configuration parameters for uplink transmission of macro cells.
   This makes the energy saving operation of a local eNB inefficient, causing a problem that
   energy consumption is not reduced efficiently.
   [0222]     The above-mentioned problem becomes particularly noticeable in a case where
10 among the configuration parameters for uplink transmission, time resources in which
   uplink transmission is allowed, or time resources in which uplink transmission is allowed
   have different cycles.    This is because the local eNB during an energy saving operation
   is required to turn on the reception operation at that time of time for receiving uplink
   transmission for wakeup in which the plurality of configuration parameters for uplink of
15 macro cells are used.
   [0223]     The problem of the second modification of the first embodiment is described
   again with reference to FIG. 17 and FIG. 18.      FIG. 18 is a location diagram illustrating
   the problem of the second modification of the first embodiment.      A macro cell 1801 has
   a coverage 1802.     A macro cell 1803 has a coverage 1804.       A macro cell 1805 has a
20 coverage 1806.     A local eNB 1807 has a coverage 1808.           The local eNB 1807 is
   deployed near the cell edges of the macro cell 1801, macro cell 1803, and macro cell
   1805.    A user equipment 1809 exists within the coverage 1804 of the macro cell 1803.
   [0224]     A sequence example of a mobile communication system in a case where the
   first modification of the first embodiment is executed in the location as shown in FIG. 18
25 is described with reference to FIG. 17.     In Step ST1702, not only the macro cell 1801,

                                                  62
   but also the macro cell 1803 and the macro cell 1805 are selected by the local eNB 1807
   as neighboring cells of which configuration parameters for uplink transmission the local
   eNB 1807 stores.
    [0225]    In Step ST1704, the local eNB 1807 starts discontinuous reception.        As a
 5 specific example, the local eNB 1807 starts discontinuous reception for receiving uplink
   transmission with the configuration         parameters    (as  a specific example, RACH
   configurations) for uplink transmission of the macro cell 1801, macro cell 1803, and
   macro cell 1805 that have been stored in Step ST1703.
    [0226]    It is required to perform an energy saving operation with the use of a plurality
10 of configuration parameters for uplink transmission of macro cells as described above.
   This makes the energy saving operation of a local eNB inefficient, causing a problem that
   energy consumption is not reduced efficiently.          In this case, the problem becomes
   particularly noticeable in a case where, for example, the time resource in which uplink
   transmission is allowed with the configuration parameter for uplink transmission differs
15 among the macro cell 1801, macro cell 1803, and macro cell 1805, or the cycle of the
   time resource in which uplink transmission is allowed differs thereamong.          This is
   because the local eNB 1807 is required to turn on the reception operation at the different
   times.
    [0227]    The solution in the second modification of the first embodiment is described
20 below.    Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly described.
   Parts that are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
    [0228]    The configuration for uplink transmission for wakeup is provided separately.
   Two specific examples of the method of separately providing such a configuration are
   disclosed below.
25  [0229]    (1) A specific configuration parameter is selected from the existing

                                                 63
   configuration parameters used for uplink transmission that are determined in accordance
   with the standards.    This configuration is the configuration used for uplink transmission
   in a case where a user equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup.
    [0230]   (2) The configuration used for uplink transmission (configuration parameter for
 5 uplink transmission) in a case where a user equipment performs uplink transmission for
   wakeup is newly provided.      Hereinafter, this configuration is also referred to as uplink
   transmission for local eNB wakeup at times.       Hereinafter, a signal transmitted based on
   the configuration of the uplink transmission for local eNB wakeup is also referred to as
   uplink transmission for local eNB wakeup or RACH for local eNB wakeup at times.
10 One type or a plurality of types of the configurations in uplink transmission for local eNB
   wakeup may be provided.        As a specific example, a new preamble sequence may be
   provided.   As a specific example, a new physical resource on a frequency-time axis may
   be provided.    The new physical resource on a frequency-time axis may be added to
   "PRACH Configuration Index".
15  [0231]   The configuration for uplink transmission for local eNB wakeup is provided
   separately as described above, whereby the types of configuration parameters for uplink
   transmission that are used by a user equipment performing uplink transmission for
   wakeup do not increase even in a case where base stations, for example, macro cells are
   densely deployed.     This eliminates the need to perform an energy saving operation with
20 the use of a large number of configuration parameters for uplink transmission of macro
   cells.  This enables to efficiently perform an energy saving operation, which efficiently
   reduces energy consumption.
    [0232]   Two specific examples of the method in which a user equipment acquires the
   configuration for uplink transmission for local eNB wakeup (configuration parameter for
25 uplink transmission) are disclosed below.

                                                  64
   [0233]    (1) The configuration is determined in a static manner.   As a specific example,
   the configuration is determined in accordance with the standards.
   [0234]    (2) Each base station notifies user equipments being served thereby of the
   configuration for uplink transmission for local eNB wakeup (configuration parameter for
 5 uplink transmission) currently used.      The two specific examples of the notification
   method are as follows.     (1) The configuration is notified in the broadcast information.
   (2) The configuration is notified by a dedicated signal.
   [0235]    A specific operation example in which the second modification of the first
   embodiment is used is described with reference to FIG. 18 and FIG. 19.       First, FIG. 18
10 being a location diagram illustrating the solution in the second modification of the first
   embodiment is as described above, which is not described.            FIG. 19 illustrates a
   sequence example of a mobile communication system in a case where the solution of the
   second modification of the first embodiment is used.            The portions of FIG. 19
   corresponding to those of FIG. 15 are denoted by the same step numbers, and the
15 processes thereof are not described in detail.
   [0236]    This operation example discloses the case where the above-mentioned specific
   example (1) of the method in which a user equipment acquires the configuration for
   uplink transmission for local       eNB wakeup      (configuration parameter for uplink
   transmission) is used.
20 [0237]    The local eNB 1807 performs the processes of Step ST1503 and Step ST1504.
   Next, in Step ST1901, the local eNB 1807 starts discontinuous reception.     As a specific
   example, the local eNB 1807 starts discontinuous reception for receiving uplink
   transmission with the configuration for uplink transmission for local eNB wakeup
   (configuration parameter for uplink transmission) that has been determined in a static
25 manner.    Then, the macro cell 1803 being a serving cell performs the process of Step

                                                 65
   ST1506, and the user equipment 1809 performs the process of Step ST1508.
   [0238]    In Step ST1902, the user equipment 1809 performs RACH transmission on the
   local eNB 1807.     In the RACH transmission, the user equipment 1809 transmits the
   RACH using the configuration         for uplink transmission    for local eNB      wakeup
 5 (configuration parameter for uplink transmission) that has been determined in a static
   manner.    Then, the local eNB 1807 performs the processes of Step ST1510 and Step
   ST1511.
   [0239]    While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
   macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the second modification of the
10 first embodiment if the serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   second modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0240]    While the present modification has described the case where the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
   performed as in the second modification of the first embodiment if the node that performs
15 an energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   second modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0241]    The second modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
   below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment and the first modification of the
   first embodiment.
20 [0242]    Even in a case where base stations, for example, macro cells are densely
   deployed, there is no increase in the types of configuration parameters for uplink
   transmission used by a user equipment that performs uplink transmission for wakeup.
   [0243]    Further, if a local eNB has no way to acquire a macro cell, within the coverage
   of which a user equipment that performs uplink transmission for wakeup is located, there
25 is no need to perform an energy saving operation with the use of a large number of

                                                  66
   configuration parameters for uplink transmission of macro cells.             This enables to
   efficiently    perform   an   energy  saving    operation    and efficiently  reduce  energy
   consumption.
    [0244]     Third Modification of First Embodiment
 5            A problem to be solved in a third modification of the first embodiment is
   described.     Even in a case where the solution of the first embodiment is executed, a
   problem described below arises in a case where a local eNB performing an energy saving
   operation does not exist in the neighborhood of a user equipment.
    [0245]     If the condition in which a user equipment performs uplink transmission for
10 wakeup is satisfied, which has been disclosed in the first embodiment, the user equipment
   performs uplink transmission for wakeup even though a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation does not exist in the neighborhood thereof.      Accordingly, the following
   two problems arise.
    [0246]     (1) Through the uplink transmission, a user equipment performs unnecessary uplink
15 transmission, which is performed in the case that a local eNB that shifts from an energy
   saving operation to a normal operation does not exist.         As a result, some radio resources
   become unnecessary, leading to a problem that unnecessary uplink interference arises.
    [0247]     (2) A user equipment needs to perform unnecessary uplink transmission in
   which a local eNB that shifts from an energy saving operation to a normal operation does
20 not exist.    This causes a problem that the processing load of a user equipment increases
   and energy is consumed unnecessarily.
    [0248]     A solution in the third modification of the first embodiment is described below.
   Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly described.     Parts that
   are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
25  [0249]     In a case of judging that a local eNB exists in the neighborhood, a user

                                                  67
   equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup.        Alternatively, in a case of judging
   that a local eNB having the capability to execute an energy saving operation exists in the
   neighborhood, a user equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup.                  Still
   alternatively, in a case of judging that a local eNB performing an energy saving operation,
 5 that is, a local eNB in an energy saving operation state exists in the neighborhood, a user
   equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup.
    [0250]     As a specific example of the method in which a user equipment judges whether
   or not a local eNB exists in the neighborhood, there is a method in which a serving cell
   notifies user equipments being served thereby of the information regarding whether or not
10 a local eNB exists in the neighborhood thereof.
    [0251]     Specific examples of the information regarding whether or not a local eNB
   exists in the neighborhood include (1) information regarding whether or not a local eNB
   exists, (2) information indicating that a local eNB exists, and (3) information indicating
   that a local eNB does not exist.     The user equipment that has received any information
15 among (1) to (3) cannot judge whether or not a local eNB is in an energy saving operation
   but can reduce unnecessary uplink transmission for wakeup from a user equipment that is
   performed in a case where a local eNB does not exist in the neighborhood.
    [0252]     As a specific example of the method in which a user equipment judges whether
   or not a local eNB having the capability to execute an energy saving operation exists in
20 the neighborhood, there is the method in which a serving cell notifies user equipments
   being served thereby of the information regarding whether or not a local eNB having the
   capability to execute an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood.
    [0253]     Specific examples of the information regarding whether or not a local eNB
   having the capability to execute an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood
25 include (1) information regarding whether or not a local eNB having the capability to

                                                68
   execute an energy saving operation exists, (2) information indicating that a local eNB
   having the capability to execute an energy saving operation exists, and (3) information
   indicating that a local eNB having the capability to execute an energy saving operation
   does not exist.     The user equipment that has received any information among (1) to (3)
 5 cannot judge whether or not a local eNB is in an energy saving operation but can reduce
   unnecessary uplink transmission for wakeup from a user equipment that is performed in a
   case where a local eNB having the capability to execute an energy saving operation does
   not exist in the neighborhood.
   [0254]      As a specific example of the method in which a user equipment judges whether
10 or not a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood, there is
   a method in which a serving cell notifies user equipments being served thereby of the
   information regarding whether or not a local eNB during an energy saving operation
   exists in the neighborhood.
   [0255]      Specific examples of the information regarding whether or not a local eNB
15 during an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood include (1) information
   regarding whether or not a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists, (2)
   information indicating that a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists, and (3)
   information indicating that a local eNB during an energy saving operation does not exist.
   The user equipment that has received any information among (1) to (3) can reduce
20 unnecessary uplink transmission for wakeup from a user equipment that is performed in a
   case where a local eNB during an energy saving operation does not exist in the
   neighborhood.
   [0256]      Disclosed below are two specific examples of the method in which a serving
   cell notifies user equipments being served thereby of the information regarding whether
25 or not a local eNB exists in the neighborhood, the information regarding whether or not a

                                                 69
   local eNB having the capability to execute an energy saving operation exists in the
   neighborhood, or the information regarding whether or not a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation exists in the neighborhood.        (1) The information is notified in the
   broadcast information.     (2) The information is notified by a dedicated signal.
 5  [0257]   In a case where the first embodiment is applied, "user equipment being served
   thereby is notified of the RACH configuration of the local eNB 1303 that has been
   received in Step ST1502" in Step ST1507 shown in FIG. 15, so that the user equipment
   can be notified of the "information regarding whether or not a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation exists in the neighborhood" as well.     The "user equipment being served
10 thereby is notified of the RACH configuration of the local eNB 1303 that has been
   received in Step ST1502" in Step ST1507, which enables to notify the information
   indicating that a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists as well.
    [0258]   Disclosed below is a specific example of the method in which a serving cell
   acquires whether or not a local eNB exists in the neighborhood.       The local eNB notifies
15 neighboring cells of its deployment.    An SI interface, X2 interface or backhaul link can
   be used for this notification.    A specific example of the method in which a local eNB
   determines "a neighboring cell to be notified of the deployment is similar to "the method
   in which a local eNB determines a neighboring cell that receives the broadcast
   information, decodes the broadcast information, and stores the configuration used for
20 uplink transmission (configuration parameter for uplink transmission)" of the first
   modification of the first embodiment, which is not described.
    [0259]   Disclosed below is a specific example of the method in which a serving cell
   acquires whether or not a local eNB having the capability to execute an energy saving
   operation exists in the neighborhood.     In a case of being deployed, a local eNB notifies
25 neighboring cells of the information regarding whether or not it has the capability to

                                                70
   execute an energy saving operation.
   [0260]    Specific examples of the information regarding whether or not a local eNB
   having the capability to execute an energy saving operation include (1) information
   regarding whether or not a local eNB has the capability to execute an energy saving
 5 operation, (2) information indicating that a local eNB has the capability to execute an
   energy saving operation, and (3) information indicating that a local eNB does not have the
   capability to execute an energy saving operation.       An SI interface, X2 interface or
   backhaul link can be used for the notification of any information among (1) to (3).    In a
   case where a local eNB is deployed, a specific example of the method in which the local
10 eNB determines a neighboring cell to be notified of the information regarding whether or
   not the local eNB has the capability to execute an energy saving operation is similar to
   "the method in which a local eNB determines a neighboring cell that receives the
   broadcast information, decodes the broadcast information, and stores the configuration
   used for uplink transmission (configuration parameter for uplink transmission)" of the
15 first modification of the first embodiment, which is not described.
   [0261]    (A) and (B) below are disclosed as two specific examples of the method in
   which a serving cell acquires whether or not a local eNB during an energy saving
   operation exists in the neighborhood.
   [0262]    (A) A local eNB notifies neighboring cells of the information regarding whether
20 or not it is during an energy saving operation.      Specific examples of the information
   regarding whether or not a local eNB is during an energy saving operation include (1)
   information indicating the start of an energy saving operation, (2) information indicating
   that an energy saving operation has ended, (3) information indicating whether or not a
   local eNB is during an energy saving operation, (4) information indicating that a local
25 eNB is during an energy saving operation, and (5) information indicating that a local eNB

                                                 71
   is not during an energy saving operation.
    [0263]    Non-Patent Document 9 discloses that when a base station is switched off, other
   base stations are notified of the switch-off by means of an X2 interface.   Meanwhile, an
   X2 interface is not supported in a HeNB that is one of local eNBs as descried above (see
 5 Chapter 4.6.1 of Non-Patent Document 1).       Therefore, a problem that a HeNB cannot be
   notified of switch-off arises in the method disclosed in Non-Patent Document 9.       In the
   third modification of the first embodiment, neighboring nodes are notified of the
   information regarding whether or not a local eNB is during an energy saving operation by
   means of an X2 interface or SI interface.
10  [0264]    A specific example of the method in which a local eNB determines a
   neighboring cell to be notified of the information regarding whether or not it is during an
   energy saving operation is similar to "the method in which a local eNB determines a
   neighboring cell that receives       the broadcast information,    decodes the broadcast
   information, and stores the configuration used for uplink transmission (configuration
15 parameter for uplink transmission)" of the first modification of the first embodiment,
   which is not described.
    [0265]    Considered here is a case where, when the first embodiment is applied, the local
   eNB 1303 judges the presence or absence of a trigger to shift from a normal operation to a
   energy saving operation in Step ST1503 shown in FIG. 15 described above and, after
20 judging the presence of a trigger, executes the process of Step ST1502 to notify the macro
   cell 1301 of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the local eNB 1303.
   That is, the case where Step ST1502 is performed after judging "YES" in Step ST1503,
   after Step ST1504, or after Step ST1505 is considered.
    [0266]    In this case, the "information regarding whether or not the local eNB 1303 is
25 during an energy saving operation" can be notified with the "macro cell 1301 is notified

                                                  72
   of the configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the local eNB 1303" in Step
   ST1502.     The (1) information indicating the start of an energy saving operation or the
   (4) information indicating that the local eNB 1303 is during an energy saving operation
   can be notified with the "macro cell 1301 is notified of the the configuration parameter
 5 for uplink transmission of the local eNB 1303" in Step ST1502.
   [0267]     (B) There is newly provided a paging signal to a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation from a serving cell.      A serving cell receives a response signal (Ack
   signal) to the paging signal from a local eNB during an energy saving operation, to
   thereby acquire that a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists in the
10 neighborhood.
   [0268]     Disclosed below is a specific example of the paging signal from a serving cell
   to a local eNB during an energy saving operation.     A carrier, which is used in a paging
   signal from a serving cell to a local eNB during an energy saving operation, is disclosed.
   The paging signal uses the same carrier as the downlink carrier available between a
15 serving cell and a user equipment being served thereby or the same component carrier
   (CC) as the CC available between a serving cell and a user equipment being served
   thereby.
   [0269]     Considered here is a case where a local eNB uses the same downlink carrier or
   the same CC as that of the serving cell in downlink transmission to a user equipment
20 being served thereby.    In that case, a local eNB cannot receive a downlink signal from a
   serving cell due to a transmission signal thereof becoming an interference source
   (hereinafter, also referred to as self-interference).   Meanwhile, the present invention
   discloses that a local eNB turns off a transmission operation in an energy saving operation.
   Therefore, for example, the same carrier as the downlink carrier available between a
25 serving cell and a user equipment being served thereby can be used in a paging signal for

                                                73
   a local eNB during an energy saving operation.
   [0270]     The same carrier as a normal downlink carrier available between a serving cell
   and a user equipment being served thereby can be used for a paging signal for a local eNB
   during an energy saving operation, which enables to newly provide a paging signal for the
 5 local eNB during an energy saving operation while suppressing an increase in processing
   load of the serving cell.
   [0271]     Disclosed below are two specific examples of an identifier (RNTI) used for a
   local eNB to receive a paging signal from a serving cell to a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation.
10 [0272]     (1) A user equipment uses an identifier for receiving a paging signal from a
   serving cell.
   [0273]     (2) An identifier is newly provided, which is used for a local eNB to receive a
   paging signal from a serving cell to a local eNB during an energy saving operation
   (hereinafter, also referred to as P-RNTIlocal eNB).         In LTE and LTE-A, a user
15 equipment performs an operation below for receiving a paging channel (PCH) (see
   Chapter 5.5 of TS36.321 V9.1.0 by 3GPP (hereinafter, referred to as "Non-Patent
   Document 14")).
   [0274]     In a case where PCH assignment is received on the PDCCH for the
   paging-RNTI (P-RNTI), a user equipment attempts to decode the PCH mapped on the
20 PDSCH, as indicated by the PDCCH assignment information.          Note that the system has
   one P-RNTI, which is fixed (see Chapter 7.1 of Non-Patent Document 14).          Therefore,
   when an identifier used for a local eNB to receive a paging signal from a serving cell to
   the local eNB during an energy saving operation is made identical to a conventional
   identifier (P-RNTI) used for a user equipment to receive a paging signal from a serving
25 cell, even in a case of the same paging signal for a local eNB during an energy saving

                                                 74
   operation, user equipments being served by the same serving cell need to attempt to
   decode the PCH.
   [0275]      The P-RNTIlocal eNB is provided differently from the P-RNTI, whereby it is
   possible to prevent user equipments being served by the same serving cell from
 5 attempting to decode the PCH in response to a paging signal for a local eNB during an
   energy saving operation.       This prevents an increase in processing load of a user
   equipment, to thereby prevent an increase in energy consumption.          One P-RNTIlocal
   eNB may be provided as a system.           Alternatively, the P-RNTIlocal eNB may be
   determined in a static manner as a system.     This achieves an effect that the assignment to
10 a local eNB is not required.
   [0276]      A specific example of a transmission timing of a paging signal from a serving
   cell to a local eNB during an energy saving operation is disclosed below.
   [0277]      (1) Transmission timings are discrete in time.    For this reason, a local eNB
   receives a paging signal for the local eNB during an energy saving operation through the
15 energy saving operation, which does not require continuous reception but requires only
   discontinuous reception.     The discontinuous reception operation in an energy saving
   operation is more effective for reducing energy consumption compared with the
   continuous reception operation.
   [0278]      (2) The resources in which transmission is allowed have a cycle in time.    This
20 does not require the notification of the resources in which frequent transmission to a local
   eNB is allowed.      The transmission timing of a paging signal from a serving cell to a
   local eNB during an energy saving operation is made identical to the time resource in
   which uplink transmission for wakeup is allowed, which leads to further energy saving.
   The cycle of the transmission timing of a paging signal from a serving cell to a local eNB
25 during an energy saving operation is made identical to the cycle of the time resource in

                                                  75
   which uplink transmission for wakeup is allowed, which further reduces energy
   consumption.
   [0279]      Disclosed below is a specific example of the method of transmitting a response
   signal (Ack signal) to the paging signal by a local eNB during an energy saving operation
 5 in response to the paging signal.
   [0280]      A response signal may be notified by means of a backhaul link, S I interface, or
   X2 interface.
   [0281]      The response signal uses the same carrier as the uplink carrier available
   between a user equipment being served by a serving cell and the serving cell or the same
10 CC as the CC available between a user equipment being served by a serving cell and the
   serving cell.     Accordingly, a serving cell is only required to perform a reception
   operation using one carrier, which achieves an effect that the processing load of the
   serving cell is reduced.    This is effective also in increasing the frequency use efficiency.
   In the case where the first modification of the first embodiment is used, the uplink
15 frequency information used for uplink transmission for wakeup from a user equipment is
   identical to the uplink frequency information used in the response signal.     This results in
   that the same frequency is used between the operation of transmitting a response signal by
   a local eNB and the operation of receiving uplink transmission for wakeup.        As a result,
   self-interference may arise in a local eNB, and the uplink transmission for wakeup may
20 fail due to the deteriorated reception quality.      A solution to the problem is described
   below.     The timing of the operation of transmitting a response signal is made different
   from the timing of the operation of receiving uplink transmission for wakeup.             This
   enables to prevent the occurrence of self-interference in a local eNB.
   [0282]      Next, disclosed below are five specific examples of the situation in which a user
25 equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup in a case where the user equipment

                                                  76
   judges that a local eNB exists in the neighborhood, judges that a local eNB having the
   capability to execute an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood, or judges that
   a local eNB during an energy saving operation, that is, a local eNB in an energy saving
   operation state exists in the neighborhood.
 5  [0283]    (1) A case where the reception quality of a serving cell deteriorates or a case
   where a cell that can serve as a serving cell does not exist. For example, in a case where
   a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists at the cell edge of a serving cell, the
   local eNB shifts to a normal operation upon wakeup uplink transmission from a user
   equipment.     Upon this, handover is performed from a serving cell to the local eNB or
10 cell reselection is performed to the local eNB, so that the user equipment is capable of
   continuously receiving the service of a mobile communication system.
    [0284]    (2) A case where the conditions of RACH transmission in a conventional
   technology are satisfied.     As a specific example, a case where TAU transmission or a
   service request from a user equipment is made (also referred to as a call at times).
15  [0285]    (3) Periodically.
    [0286]    (4) A case where a user makes an operation.
    [0287]    (5) A case where, in measuring a neighboring cell for cell selection, in
   measuring a neighboring cell for cell reselection, or in measuring a neighboring cell for
   handover, a neighboring cell that applies to the following is detected: a neighboring cell
20 with a local eNB existing in the neighborhood; a neighboring cell with a local eNB
   having the capability to execute an energy saving operation existing in the neighborhood;
   or a neighboring cell with a local eNB during an energy saving operation existing in the
   neighborhood.     In this case, it suffices that a user equipment receives and decodes the
   broadcast information of a neighboring cell in measuring a neighboring cell, to thereby
25 obtain the information regarding whether or not a local eNB exists in the neighborhood,

                                                 77
   the information regarding whether or not a local eNB having the capability to execute an
   energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood, or the information regarding whether
   or not a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood.
   [0288]     A specific operation example in which the third modification of the first
 5 embodiment is used is described with reference to FIG. 14 and FIG. 20.      First, FIG. 14
   being a location diagram illustrating the solution of the third modification of the first
   embodiment is as described above, which is not described.            FIG. 20 illustrates a
   sequence example of a mobile communication system in a case where the solution of the
   third modification of the first embodiment is used.            The portions of FIG. 20
10 corresponding to those of FIG. 15 are denoted by the same step numbers, and the
   processes thereof are not described in detail.
   [0289]     This operation example describes the case where a user equipment performs
   uplink transmission for wakeup in a case of judging that a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation exists in the neighborhood.       The method in which a serving cell
15 acquires whether or not a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists in the
   neighborhood is described regarding the specific example (B).
   [0290]     The local eNB 1303 performs the processes of Step ST1501, Step ST1502, Step
   ST1503, and Step ST1504.          Next, in Step ST2001,      the local eNB 1303       starts
   discontinuous reception.   As a specific example, the local eNB 1303 starts discontinuous
20 reception for receiving uplink transmission with the RACH configuration of the local
   eNB 1303.      At the same time, the local eNB 1303 starts discontinuous reception for
   receiving a paging signal from a serving cell to a local eNB during an energy saving
   operation.    That is, even during an energy saving operation, the local eNB 1303
   performs reception at the transmission timing at which both signals are allocated, or with
25 the time resource.

                                                78
   [0291]     In Step ST2002, the macro cell 1301 being a serving cell transmits, to the local
   eNB 1303, a paging signal for a local eNB during an energy saving operation.
   [0292]     In Step ST2003, the local eNB 1303 judges whether or not it has received a
   paging signal to a local eNB during an energy saving operation from the macro cell 1301.
 5 In a case where the local eNB 1303 has received a paging signal to the local eNB during
   an energy saving operation, the local eNB 1303 moves to Step ST2004.       In a case where
   the local eNB 1303 has not received a paging signal to the local eNB during an energy
   saving operation, the local eNB 1303 repeats the judgment of Step ST2003.
   [0293]     In Step ST2004, the local eNB 1303 transmits, to the macro cell 1301, a
10 response signal (Ack signal) to the paging signal to the local eNB during an energy saving
   operation.
   [0294]     In Step ST2005, the macro cell 1301 judges whether or not it has received the
   response signal to the paging signal to the local eNB during an energy saving operation.
   In a case where the macro cell 1301 has received the response signal, the macro cell 1301
15 moves to Step ST2006.        In a case where the macro cell 1301 has not received the
   response signal, the macro cell 1301 moves to Step ST2007.
   [0295]     In Step ST2006, the macro cell 1301 judges that a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation exists in the neighborhood.
   [0296]     In Step ST2007, the macro cell 1301 judges that a local eNB during an energy
20 saving operation does not exist in the neighborhood, and returns to Step ST2002.
   [0297]     In Step ST2008, the macro cell 1301 notifies the user equipment 1401 of the
   information indicating that a local eNB during an energy saving exists in the
   neighborhood.     Then, the macro cell 1301 performs the processes of Step ST1506 and
   Step ST1507.
25 [0298]     In Step ST2009, the user equipment 1401 judges whether or not a local eNB

                                                79
   during an energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood.     In a case of judging that
   such a local eNB exists, the user equipment 1401 moves to Step ST1508.          In a case of
   judging that such a local eNB does not exist, the user equipment 1401 repeats the
   judgment of Step ST2009.       Then, the user equipment 1401 performs the processes of
 5 Step ST1508 and Step ST1509, and the local eNB 1303 performs the processes of Step
   ST1510 and Step ST1511.
    [0299]    In this operation example, in a case where the user equipment 1401 has
   received the information indicating that a local eNB during an energy saving operation
   exists in the neighborhood from the macro cell 1301 in Step ST2008, in Step ST2009, the
10 user equipment 1401 judges that a local eNB during an energy saving operation exists in
   the neighborhood.    On the other hand, in a case where the user equipment 1401 has not
   received the information indicating that a local eNB during an energy saving operation
   exists in the neighborhood from the macro cell 1301 in Step ST2008, in Step ST2009, the
   user equipment 1401 judges that a local eNB during an energy saving does not exist in the
15 neighborhood.
    [0300]    While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
   macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the third modification of the first
   embodiment if a serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the third
   modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
20  [0301]    While the present modification has described the case where the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
   performed as in the third modification of the first embodiment if the node that performs
   an energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of the third
   modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
25  [0302]    The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the

                                                   80
   first embodiment, which can be used also in combination with the first modification of the
   first embodiment and the second modification of the first embodiment.
    [0303]     The third modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
   below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.
 5  [0304]     In a case of judging that a local eNB exists in the neighborhood, a user
   equipment can perform uplink transmission for wakeup.             Alternatively, in a case of
   judging that a local eNB having the capability to execute an energy saving operation
   exists in the neighborhood, a user equipment can perform uplink transmission for wakeup.
   Still alternatively, in a case of judging that a local eNB during an energy saving operation
10 exists in the neighborhood, a user equipment can perform uplink transmission for
   wakeup.
    [0305]     Therefore, uplink transmission for wakeup is performed only in a case where a
   local eNB exists in the neighborhood, a local eNB having the capability to execute an
   energy saving operation exists in the neighborhood, or a local eNB during an energy
15 saving operation exists in the neighborhood.
    [0306]     Accordingly, unnecessary uplink transmission can be reduced, such as uplink
   transmission for wakeup in a case where, for example, a local eNB during an energy
   saving operation does not exist in the neighborhood.        As a result, radio resources can be
   effectively used, which enables to remove unnecessary interference.           This also enables
20 to reduce energy consumption of a user equipment.
    [0307]     Fourth Modification of First Embodiment
               A problem to be solved in a fourth modification of the first embodiment is
   described.     In the case where the solution of the first embodiment is executed, a problem
   below arises in determining the uplink transmission power from a user equipment.
25  [0308]     Considered here is the case where the solution of the first embodiment is

                                                81
   executed and the PRACH is used for uplink transmission from a user equipment in LTE
   and LTE-A.
   [0309]     TS36.213 V9.0.1 by 3GPP (hereinafter, referred to as "Non-Patent Document
   15") defines the initial transmission power of the PRACH as expressed by Equation (1)
 5 below.
   [0310]       PPRACH=min{Pcmax, PREAMBLERECEIVEDTARGETPOWER+PL}
   [dBm]      ---(1)
              In Equation (1), "PL" represents a path loss.      "Pcmax" of Equation (1) is
   determined by Equation (2) below, and "PREAMBLERECEIVEDTARGETPOWER"
10 of Equation (1) is defined as expressed in Equation (3) below (see Chapter 5.1.3 of
   Non-Patent Document 14).
   [0311]     Pcmax=min{Pemax, Pumax} -..      (2)
              In Equation (2), "Pemax" is a value that is set per cell and broadcast to a user
   equipment being served thereby, and "Pumax" is determined from the capability of a user
15 equipment.
   [0312]
              PREAMBLERECEIVEDTARGETPOWER=preamblelnitialReceivedTarge
   tPower+DELTAPREAMBLE+(PREAMBLETRAN SMIS SION_COUNTER- 1) *powe
   rRampingStep         ... (3)
20            In Equation (3), "preamblelnitialReceivedTargetPower" is a part of the RACH
   configuration, and "DELTAPREAMBLE" is determined based on the preamble format
   (see Chapter 7.6 of Non-Patent Document 14).        The preamble format is a part of the
   RACH configuration.         "PREAMBLETRANSMISSIONCOUNTER" represents how
   many times the preamble transmission has been performed.         "powerRampingStep" is a
25 part of the RACH configuration, and "*" represents multiplication "x" (see Non-Patent

                                                  82
   Document 12).
   [03 13]    In a case where the solution of the first embodiment is executed in LTE and
   LTE-A, "PL" in Equation (1) and "Pemax" in Equation (2) are undefined in a user
   equipment, which causes a problem that the user equipment cannot determine the initial
 5 transmission power of the PRACH.
   [0314]     RI-094839 by 3GPP (hereinafter, referred to as "Non-Patent Document 16")
   discloses the following.     Disclosed is the technology in which a serving cell notifies a
   HeNB within its coverage of the coordination information of the own cell via a user
   equipment being connected with the own cell.          It is disclosed in such a case that, based
10 on the measurement value of downlink reception quality of a HeNB by the user
   equipment, a serving cell notifies the user equipment of the uplink transmission power
   required for the notification or the user equipment estimates the uplink transmission
   power.
   [0315]     In the first embodiment, meanwhile, a local eNB during an energy saving
15 operation turns off a transmission operation.      That is, a user equipment cannot measure
   the downlink reception quality of a local eNB during an energy saving operation.
   [0316]     Therefore, in the first embodiment, the uplink transmission power cannot be
   determined with the technology disclosed in Non-Patent Document 16.
   [0317]     The solution in the fourth modification of the first embodiment is described
20 below.    Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly described.
   Parts that are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
   [0318]     First, the solution to "Pemax" is disclosed.       A local eNB notifies neighboring
   nodes of "Pemax" of the own cell by means of an S 1 interface, similarly to the
   configuration parameter for uplink transmission of the first embodiment.             After that,
25 with the method similar to the method for the configuration parameter for uplink

                                                 83
   transmission of the first embodiment, a user equipment that transmits the PRACH can
   acquire "Pemax".      A user equipment determines the initial transmission power of the
   PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup with the use of the Pemax".
   [0319]     Next, the solution to "PL" is disclosed.  A user equipment uses the path loss of
 5 a serving cell.    This enables a user equipment that transmits the PRACH to establish
   "PL".     The user equipment determines the initial transmission power of the PRACH as
   uplink transmission for wakeup with the use of this "PL".
   [0320]      While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
   macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the fourth modification of the
10 first embodiment if a serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   fourth modification of the first embodiment are achieved.
   [0321]      The present modification has also described the case where the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
   performed as in the fourth modification of the first embodiment if the node that performs
15 an energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   fourth modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0322]      The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first
   embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, and the third modification
20 of the first embodiment.
   [0323]      The fourth modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
   below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.      In LTE and LTE-A, a user
   equipment can determine the initial transmission power of the PRACH even in a case
   where the solution of the first embodiment is executed and the PRACH is used for uplink
25 transmission from a user equipment.

                                                 84
   [0324]     Fifth Modification of First Embodiment
              A problem to be solved in a fifth modification of the first embodiment is
   described.    Even in the case where the solution of the fourth modification of the first
   embodiment is executed, a problem described below arises.
 5 [0325]     In the fourth modification of the first embodiment, a user equipment uses the
   path loss of a serving cell as a demonstration in determining the initial transmission
   power of the PRACH.         Accordingly, the initial transmission power of the PRACH
   becomes unnecessarily large depending on the location where a user equipment exists, so
   that an energy saving operation of a local eNB of which coverage the user equipment is
10 outside is released.   This causes a problem that energy consumption of a local eNB is not
   reduced efficiently.    Further, the initial transmission power of the PRACH becomes
   unnecessarily large depending on a location where a user equipment exists, causing a
   problem that unnecessary uplink interference arises.
   [0326]     The problem of the fifth modification of the first embodiment is described again
15 with reference to FIG. 21.     FIG. 21 is a location diagram illustrating the problem of the
   fifth modification of the first embodiment.      The portions of FIG. 21 corresponding to
   those of FIG. 13 are denoted by the same reference numerals, which are not described.
   [0327]     Considered here is the case where a user equipment 2101 exists at a location A.
   The case where the user equipment 2101 transmits the PRACH as uplink transmission for
20 wakeup is considered.     The user equipment 2101 uses the path loss of a serving cell as a
   demonstration in determining the initial transmission power of the PRACH.           The path
   loss of the serving cell (macro cell) 1301 for the user equipment 2101 positioned at the
   location A is measured based on a downlink signal 2102 from the serving cell 1301 to the
   user equipment 2101.         "PL" is added in Equation (1) for obtaining the initial
25 transmission power of the PRACH, which has been disclosed in the fourth modification

                                                 85
   of the first embodiment.      This is because a user equipment located farther from the
   serving cell has larger path loss "PL", and accordingly, the uplink signal to the serving
   cell from the same position similarly requires large transmission power as well.
   [0328]     The path loss of the serving cell (macro cell) 1301 for the user equipment 2101
 5 positioned at the location A is PLA.        In this case, this "PLA" is also added to the
   PRACH initial transmission power as uplink transmission for wakeup of the user
   equipment 2101.      Accordingly, conceptually, the uplink signal power for wakeup is
   equal in amount to the uplink transmission power from the location A to the macro cell
   1301, as indicated by a PRACH 2103.         This enables the local eNB 1303 to receive the
10 PRACH 2103 as the uplink signal for wakeup transmitted from the user equipment 2101
   positioned at the location A.    The location A is outside the coverage 1304 of the local
   eNB 1303.     This means that, even if the local eNB 1303 releases the energy saving
   operation, the user equipment 2101 cannot receive the service of a mobile communication
   system via the local eNB 1303.     As a result, releasing of the energy saving operation that
15 is unnecessary in a local eNB occurs, causing a problem that energy consumption is not
   reduced efficiently.
   [0329]     Considered here is the case where a user equipment 2104 exists at a location B.
   The case where the user equipment 2104 transmits the PRACH as uplink transmission for
   wakeup is considered.     The user equipment 2104 uses the path loss of a serving cell as a
20 demonstration in determining the initial transmission power of the PRACH.          The path
   loss of the serving cell (macro cell) 1301 for the user equipment 2104 positioned at the
   location B is measured based on a downlink signal 2105 from the serving cell 1301 to the
   user equipment 2104.
   [0330]     The path loss of the serving cell (macro cell) 1301 for the user equipment 2104
25 positioned at the location B is PLB.       In this case, this "PLB" is also added to the

                                                  86
   PRACH initial transmission power as uplink transmission for wakeup of the user
   equipment 2104.      Accordingly, conceptually, the uplink signal power for wakeup is
   equal in amount to the uplink transmission power from the location B to the macro cell
    1301, as indicated by a PRACH 2106.        This enables the local eNB 1303 to receive the
 5 PRACH 2106 as the uplink signal for wakeup transmitted from the user equipment 2104
   positioned at the location B.      However, approximately the transmission power of a
   PRACH 2107 as an uplink signal for wakeup is sufficient for enabling the local eNB 1303
   to receive the PRACH 2106.        As a result, the initial transmission power of the PRACH
   becomes unnecessarily large, causing a problem that unnecessary uplink interference
10 arises.
    [0331]    A solution in the fifth modification of the first embodiment is described below.
   A part different from the solution of the fourth modification of the first embodiment is
   mainly described.    A part that is not described is similar to the fourth modification of the
   first embodiment.
15  [0332]    A fixed value is set as the value of "PL" used in determining the initial
   transmission power of the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup.                     Specific
   examples of the value include a value necessary and sufficient (neither excessively large
   nor excessively small) for being received by a local eNB in the case where the PRACH as
   uplink transmission for wakeup is transmitted from the cell edge of the local eNB.        Two
20 specific examples of the value are disclosed below.
    [0333]    (1) A value is determined in a static manner.      As a specific example, a value is
   determined in accordance with the standards.
    [0334]    (2) A value is determined per local eNB.         Each local eNB notifies a serving
   cell of a value as a configuration parameter for uplink transmission.        Each base station
25 notifies user equipments being served thereby of a value.        Two specific examples of the

                                                  87
   notification method are disclosed below. (1) A value is notified in the broadcast
   information.    (2) A value is notified by a dedicated signal.
    [0335]    FIG. 22 is a conceptual diagram in a case where the solution of the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment is used.       The portions of FIG. 22 corresponding to
 5 those of FIG. 13 and FIG. 21 are denoted by the same reference numerals, which are not
   described.
    [0336]    A case where the user equipment 2101 exists at the location A is considered.
   In the case of transmitting the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup, the user
   equipment 2101 uses a fixed value as "PL" for determining the initial transmission power
10 of the PRACH.       Considered here is the case where the fixed value is a value necessary
   and sufficient (neither excessively large nor excessively small) for being received by a
   local eNB in a case where the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup is transmitted
   from a cell edge of a local eNB.      In this case, the fixed value "PL" is also added to the
   PRACH initial transmission power as uplink transmission for wakeup of the user
15 equipment 2101.      Accordingly, conceptually, this results in as indicated by a PRACH
   2201 as an uplink signal for wakeup of FIG. 22.        Therefore, the local eNB 1303 cannot
   receive the PRACH 2201 as an uplink signal for wakeup transmitted from the user
   equipment 2101 positioned at the location A.
    [0337]    The location A is out of the coverage 1304 of the local eNB 1303.       Therefore,
20 even if the local eNB 1303 releases an energy saving operation, the user equipment 2101
   cannot receive the service of a mobile communication system via the local eNB 1303.
   According to the present modification, a local eNB does not unnecessarily release an
   energy saving operation of the local eNB, which solves a problem that energy
   consumption is not reduced efficiently.
25  [0338]    A case where the user equipment 2104 exists at the location B is considered.

                                                  88
   In the case of transmitting the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup, the user
   equipment 2104 uses a fixed value as "PL" in determining the initial transmission power
   of the PRACH.       In this case, the fixed value "PL" is also added to the PRACH initial
   transmission power as uplink transmission for wakeup of the user equipment 2104.
 5 Accordingly, conceptually, this results in as indicated by a PRACH 2202 as an uplink
   signal for wakeup of FIG. 22.       Therefore, the local eNB 1303 can receive the PRACH
   2202 as an uplink signal for wakeup transmitted from the user equipment 2104 positioned
   at the location B.
   [0339]      The transmission power of the PRACH 2202 as an uplink signal for wakeup
10 does not differ from the transmission power of the PRACH 2107 as an uplink signal for
   wakeup, which is sufficient for being received by the local eNB 1303.     This prevents the
   initial transmission power of the PRACH from becoming unnecessarily large, solving the
   problem that unnecessary uplink interference occurs.
   [0340]      While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
15 macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the fifth modification of the first
   embodiment if a serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0341]      The present modification has also described the case where the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
20 performed as in the fifth modification of the first embodiment if the node that performs an
   energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0342]      The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   fourth modification of the first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the
25 first embodiment, the first modification of the first embodiment, the second modification

                                                 89
   of the first embodiment, and the third modification of the first embodiment.
   [0343]      The fifth modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
   below in addition to the effects of the fourth modification of the first embodiment.    It is
   possible to prevent the initial transmission power of the PRACH as uplink transmission
 5 for wakeup from becoming unnecessarily large.             This prevents a local eNB from
   unnecessarily releasing an energy saving operation, which efficiently reduces energy
   consumption.       Further, it is possible to prevent an occurrence of unnecessary
   interference.
   [0344]      Sixth Modification of First Embodiment
10             A problem to be solved in a sixth modification of the first embodiment is
   described.      The problem described below arises even in a case where the first
   embodiment is used.
   [0345]      Non-Patent Document 15 (Chapter 6.1) discloses a random access procedure.
   The procedure is described with reference to FIG. 23.      FIG. 23 is a sequence diagram of
15 a mobile communication system, which illustrates the random access procedure disclosed
   in Non-Patent Document 15.
   [0346]      In Step ST2301, a user equipment (UE) transmits a random access preamble to
   a base station (eNB) with the PRACH.       The initial transmission power of the PRACH is
   as described in, for example, the fourth modification of the first embodiment.
20 [0347]      In Step ST2302, the base station that has received the random access preamble
   transmits a random access response to the user equipment with the PDCCH.           The user
   equipment needs to receive the PDCCH using the random access RNTI (RA-RNTI) for
   checking whether the random access response is included.              The RA-RNTI is an
   identifier used for a user equipment to receive the random access response.
25 [0348]      In Step ST2303, the user equipment that has received the random access

                                                  90
   response transmits scheduled transmission to the base station using the PUSCH allocated
   to the random access response.
    [0349]    In Step ST2304, the base station that has received the scheduled transmission
   transmits a contention resolution to a user equipment.        As described above, the base
 5 station needs to receive the PDCCH using the RA-RNTI for judging whether or not the
   base station has received the PRACH.
    [0350]    The local eNB during an energy saving operation receives the PRACH as
   uplink transmission for wakeup from the user equipment and shifts to a normal operation
   to start downlink transmission.     However, time is required for the user equipment to
10 perform the search operation, for example, the operation shown in FIG. 12, to thereby
   detect the local eNB.    This causes a problem that the user equipment is highly likely to
   judge the reception of a random access response from the local eNB in Step ST2302 of
   FIG. 23 as a failure.
    [0351]    The serving cell for the user equipment is a cell different from the local eNB.
15 The user equipment cannot receive the PDCCH from two different base stations.
   Therefore, in order to receive the PDCCH on which the random access response from the
   local eNB is mapped, a user equipment needs to execute handover or cell reselection.       A
   user equipment needs to execute handover or cell reselection at the time when it is not
   confirmed that a local eNB during energy saving exists in the neighborhood, or even if
20 such a local eNB exists in the neighborhood, it is not confirmed that the PRACH as
   uplink transmission for wakeup is received successively and the local eNB shifts to a
   normal operation.     As described above, an unnecessary handover process or unnecessary
   cell reselection process of a user equipment occurs.
    [0352]    A solution in the sixth modification of the first embodiment is described below.
25 Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly described.    Parts that

                                                  91
   are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
   [03 53]    A user equipment that has transmitted the PRACH as uplink transmission for
   wakeup is not required to receive a random access response.         A base station does not
   transmit the random access response with the use of the PDCCH in a case where it has
 5 received the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup.
   [0354]     A base station is configured to distinguish the PRACH as uplink transmission
   for wakeup from a conventional PRACH for enabling the above-mentioned judgment.
   Specifically, an indicator showing the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup is
   provided in the random access preamble.         This enables, in receiving a random access
10 preamble in Step ST2301 of FIG. 23, the base station to make the above-mentioned
   distinction and perform the process of avoiding the transmission of a random access
   response.
   [0355]     FIG. 24 shows a sequence example of a mobile communication system in a case
   where the solution of the sixth modification of the first embodiment is used.            The
15 portions of FIG. 24 corresponding to those of FIG. 23 are denoted by the same step
   numbers, which are not described in detail.
   [0356]     In Step ST2301, a user equipment transmits a random access preamble to a base
   station with the use of the PRACH.        In Step ST2401, the base station that has received
   the random access preamble judges whether or not the random access preamble is uplink
20 transmission for wakeup.      In a case of judging that the random access preamble is an
   uplink signal for wakeup, the base station moves to Step ST2402.        In a case of judging
   that the random access preamble is not an uplink signal for wakeup, the base station
   moves to Step ST2302.       In Step ST2302, the base station transmits the random access
   response to the user equipment with the use of the PDCCH.
25 [0357]     As a specific example of judging the process in Step ST2401, if an indicator

                                                 92
   showing the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup is mapped in the random access
   preamble, the random access preamble is judged as uplink transmission for wakeup.       On
   the other hand, if the indicator showing the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup is
   not mapped in the random access preamble, the random access preamble is not judged as
 5 an uplink transmission signal for wakeup.
   [0358]     In Step ST2402, the base station judges whether or not to be during an energy
   saving operation.    In a case of judging to be during an energy saving operation, the base
   station moves to Step ST2403.       In a case of judging not to be during an energy saving
   operation, the base station ends the process.
10 [0359]     In Step ST2403, the base station during an energy saving operation shifts to a
   normal operation.
   [0360]     In Step ST2404, the user equipment that has transmitted the random access
   preamble judges whether or not the random access preamble is uplink transmission for
   wakeup.     In a case of judging that the random access preamble is an uplink signal for
15 wakeup, the user equipment ends the process.         In a case of judging that the random
   access preamble is not an uplink signal for wakeup, the user equipment moves to Step
   ST2303.     In Step ST2303, the user equipment transmits scheduled transmission to the
   base station with the use of the PUSCH allocated to the random access response.     In Step
   ST2304, the base station transmits a contention resolution to the user equipment.
20 [0361]     The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first
   embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, the third modification of
   the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the first embodiment, and the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment.
25 [0362]     The sixth modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described

                                                93
   below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.      The user equipment that has
   transmitted the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup is not required to receive the
   PDCCH on which a random access response is mapped.           As a result, the user equipment
   that has transmitted the PRACH as uplink transmission for wakeup does not judge a
 5 failure in receiving a random access response.     Further, it is not required to receive the
   PDCCH from a cell different from the serving cell, which reduces an unnecessary
   handover process and an unnecessary cell reselection process.
    [0363]    The base station that has received the PRACH as uplink transmission for
   wakeup can reduce the transmission of a random access response.             This reduces the
10 processing load of the base station and enables effective use of radio resources.
    [0364]    Seventh Modification of First Embodiment
              A problem to be solved in a seventh modification of the first embodiment is
   described.     A problem described below arises even in a case where the sixth
   modification of the first embodiment is used.
15  [0365]    The preamble is repeatedly transmitted until it is normally received by a base
   station.   However, if the user equipment that has transmitted the PRACH as uplink
   transmission for wakeup is not required to receive a random access response, the user
   equipment cannot judge whether or not the PRACH has been normally received by the
   base station.    This causes a problem that a preamble transmission operation becomes
20 uncertain.
    [0366]    Along with this, a problem described below arises in determining uplink
   transmission power even in a case where the fourth modification of the first embodiment
   or the fifth modification of the first embodiment is used.      There arises a problem that
   "PREAMBLETRANSMISSIONCOUNTER" indicating how many times preamble
25 transmission has been performed becomes uncertain.       The problem that a user equipment

                                                94
   cannot determine the initial transmission power of the PRACH arises again.
   [03 67]     A solution in the seventh modification of the first embodiment is described
   below.     Parts different from the solutions of the first embodiment and the fourth
   modification of the first embodiment, or the first embodiment and the fifth modification
 5 of the first embodiment are mainly described.    Parts that are not described are similar to
   the first embodiment and the fourth modification of the first embodiment, or the first
   embodiment and the fifth modification of the first embodiment.
   [0368]      In determining the initial transmission power of the PRACH as uplink
   transmission for wakeup, the PRACH is repeatedly transmitted as many times as a fixed
10 value.    The repetitive transmission may be stopped in a case where a user equipment
   measures neighboring cells and detects a new local eNB.
   [0369]      In a case where the PRACH is transmitted as many times as a fixed value in
   determining the initial transmission power of the PRACH as uplink transmission for
   wakeup, a user equipment automatically transmits the PRACH again up to the number of
15 times of PRACH transmission.
   [0370]      The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment and the fourth modification of the first embodiment, or the first
   embodiment and the fifth modification of the first embodiment, which can be used in
   combination with the first modification of the first embodiment, the second modification
20 of the first embodiment, and the third modification of the first embodiment.
   [0371]      The seventh modification of the first embodiment achieves effects described
   below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the
   first embodiment, and the fifth modification of the first embodiment.       Also in a case
   where the user equipment that has transmitted the PRACH as uplink transmission for
25 wakeup is not required to receive a random access response, the user equipment can

                                                  95
   establish the operation of transmitting the PRACH and further determine the initial
   transmission power.
   [0372]     Eighth Modification of First Embodiment
              A problem to be solved in an eighth modification of the first embodiment is
 5 described.    A problem described below arises even in a case where the solution of the
   first embodiment is executed.
   [0373]     Considered here is the case where a local eNB shifts from an energy saving
   operation to a normal operation upon the execution of the first embodiment.          As a result
   of the shift in this manner, a user equipment is located within the coverage of that local
10 eNB, to thereby enter the idle station normally.        It is assumed, however, that the user
   equipment does not shift to the connected state.        In that case, the local eNB detects a
   trigger to shift from a normal operation to an energy saving operation and shifts to the
   energy saving operation again.     This causes the use equipment to be out of the coverage
   of the local eNB, leading to a problem that the user equipment is outside the coverage and
15 cannot receive the service of a mobile communication system in a case where other
   neighboring cell does not exist.
   [0374]     Four solutions in the eighth modification of the first embodiment are disclosed
   below.    Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly described.
   Parts that are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
20 [0375]     (1) Uplink transmission for wakeup is performed with the use of the
   configuration for uplink transmission of a local eNB.        In a case where a local eNB shifts
   to an energy saving operation, a user equipment being normally in an idle state when the
   local eNB is in a normal operation is assumed here.           The local eNB during a normal
   operation serves as a serving cell for the user equipment.        As the local eNB shifts to the
25 energy saving operation, the reception quality of a serving cell in the user equipment

                                                 96
   deteriorates.   Accordingly, the condition in which the user equipment performs uplink
   transmission for wakeup is satisfied, whereby the user equipment performs uplink
   transmission for wakeup.      The local eNB that has received the uplink transmission for
   wakeup shifts from an energy saving operation to a normal operation.
 5 [0376]     (2) In a case of becoming outside the coverage after camping on a local eNB, a
   user equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup.           This is effective in a case
   where the user equipment becomes outside the coverage because a local eNB during
   being camped on has shifted to an energy saving operation.         The user equipment may
   perform the uplink transmission for wakeup only in a case where the local eNB has the
10 capability to execute an energy saving operation.     In a case where the local eNB does not
   have that capability, the situation in which the user equipment becomes outside the
   coverage because the local eNB during being camped on shifts to an energy saving
   operation does not occur.     This prevents a user equipment from performing unnecessary
   uplink transmission, leading to effects that radio resources are effectively used, uplink
15 interference is reduced, and a user equipment reduces energy consumption.
   [0377]     (3) A local eNB that has received uplink transmission for wakeup performs a
   normal operation for a certain time interval (T a).      A user equipment performs uplink
   transmission for wakeup periodically (T b).        If Ta > T_b, the local eNB can be
   prevented from shifting to an energy saving operation again when a user equipment exists
20 in the range in which an uplink signal for wakeup can be received.
   [0378]     (4) Even in a case where a trigger to shift from a normal operation to an energy
   saving operation exists, a local eNB checks whether or not a user equipment in an idle
   state exists to be served thereby before shifting from a normal operation to an energy
   saving operation.    In a case where a user equipment in an idle state exists to be served
25 thereby, the local eNB continues a normal operation.       On the other hand, in a case where

                                                  97
   a user equipment in an idle state does not exist to be served thereby, the local eNB shifts
   to an energy saving operation.     This prevents the local eNB from shifting to an energy
   saving operation in a case where a user equipment in an idle state exists to be served
   thereby.    This judgment may be applied to the specific example described in the first
 5 embodiment as the trigger to shift from a normal operation to an energy saving operation,
   (1) "a case where a user equipment in a connected state does not exist to be served by a
   local eNB for a certain period, or a case where only a user equipment in an idle state
   exists to be served by a local eNB for a certain period".
   [0379]     Disclosed below is a specific example of the method of checking whether or not
10 a user equipment in an idle state exists to be served by a local eNB.    All user equipments
   being served by a local eNB are paged.       If a user equipment that responds to the paging
   exists, the local eNB judges that a user equipment in a connected state or a user
   equipment in an idle state exists to be served thereby.      Meanwhile, if a user equipment
   that responds to the paging does not exist, the local eNB judges that neither user
15 equipment in a connected state nor user equipment in an idle state exists to be served
   thereby.
   [0380]     A   specific  example   of simultaneous paging         is disclosed   below.     A
   simultaneous paging signal is newly provided for user equipments being served by a local
   eNB.     An identifier used in simultaneous paging (hereinafter, also referred to as
20 P-RNTI simultaneous) for user equipments being served by a local eNB is newly
   provided.       The   effects  described    below     are  achieved   by   newly    providing
   P-RNTIsimultaneous apart from conventional P-RNTI.             In the conventional method, a
   user equipment that has received P-RNTI needs to attempt to decode the PCH for
   checking whether paging is for the own user equipment.           On the other hand, the user
25 equipment that has received P-RNTI simultaneous recognizes that paging is for all user

                                                 98
   equipments.     Accordingly, the user equipment is not required to decode the PCH and
   check whether paging is for the own user equipment, and can respond to the paging.
   This alleviates the processing load of a user equipment and prevents a control delay.
   [0381]     The technology of simultaneous paging for user equipments being served by a
 5 local eNB can be used not only in local eNBs but also in all types of eNBs.
   [0382]     While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
   macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the eighth modification of the
   first embodiment if the serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   eighth modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
10 [0383]     While the present modification has described the case where the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
   performed as in the eighth modification of the first embodiment if the node that performs
   an energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   eighth modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
15 [0384]     The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first
   embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, the third modification of
   the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the first embodiment, the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment, the sixth modification of the first embodiment, and
20 the seventh modification of the first embodiment.
   [0385]     The eighth modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
   below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.       It is possible to prevent a
   situation in which a local eNB shifts to an energy saving operation regardless of a user
   equipment being in idle state to be served thereby and the user equipment becomes out of
25 service.

                                                99
   [0386]     Ninth Modification of First Embodiment
              A ninth modification of the first embodiment discloses below another solution
   to the problem of the eighth modification of the first embodiment.
   [0387]     A local eNB transmits, even in an energy saving operation, a signal or channel
 5 necessary for measurement of a user equipment for a certain period.       This enables the
   user equipment to check the existence of the local eNB even if the local eNB is in an
   energy saving operation.     Three specific examples of the signal or channel required for
   measurement are disclosed below, which include (1) SS, (2) PBCH, and (3) RS.
   [0388]     Two specific examples of a certain period are disclosed below.
10 [0389]     (1) Transmission is performed periodically.      Transmission is performed by
   specifying values of the cycle and transmission period.        A specific example of the
   method of specifying those values is disclosed below.      The values are determined in a
   static manner.    Alternatively, the values are determined by a local eNB per se.      Still
   alternatively, the values are instructed by an entity of higher layer by means of an SI
15 interface or X2 interface.
   [0390]     (2) Transmission is performed during a specified period.           The start of
   transmission and the end of transmission are instructed.        Alternatively, the start of
   transmission and the end of transmission are instructed and, after the transmission period
   expires, transmission is stopped automatically.      A specific example of the method of
20 specifying values is disclosed below.    The values are determined by a local eNB per se.
   Alternatively, the values are instructed by an entity of higher layer by means of an SI
   interface or X2 interface.
   [0391]     While the present modification has described the case where the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
25 performed as in the ninth modification of the first embodiment if the node that performs

                                                 100
   an energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of the ninth
   modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0392]     The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first
 5 embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, the third modification of
   the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the first embodiment, the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment, the sixth modification of the first embodiment, and
   the seventh modification of the first embodiment.
   [0393]     The ninth modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
10 below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.   A user equipment that exists in
   the coverage of a local eNB is capable of measuring the reception quality of the local
   eNB if the local eNB shifts to an energy saving operation.           This enables the user
   equipment to acquire the existence of a local eNB during an energy saving operation.
   Therefore, the user equipment can be prevented from becoming out of service.               In
15 addition, the user equipment can be prevented from performing unnecessary cell
   reselection.   Further, based on the above, it is possible to perform uplink transmission
   disclosed in, for example, the first embodiment.    Accordingly, it is possible to accurately
   transmit uplink transmission for shifting a local eNB performing an energy saving
   operation to a normal operation without no waste.
20 [0394]     Tenth Modification of First Embodiment
              A tenth modification of the first embodiment discloses below an energy saving
   operation for further reducing energy consumption, in addition to the effects of the first
   embodiment.
   [0395]     In a case where a user equipment exists within a tracking area (TA) to which a
25 local eNB belongs, the local eNB performs the energy saving operation disclosed in the

                                                 101
   first embodiment.    Meanwhile, in a case where a user equipment does not exist within
   the tracking area (TA) to which a local eNB belongs, the eNB turns off the power.      As a
   result, in a case where a trigger to shift from an energy saving operation to a normal
   operation does not occur, even the reception operation can be turned off, which further
 5 reduces energy consumption.       This is because, in a case where a user equipment does not
   exist within the tracking area to which the local eNB belongs, (1) a user equipment that
   may perform uplink transmission for wakeup does not exist in the neighborhood of the
   local eNB, and (2) there is no likelihood that the local eNB will receive a paging signal
   via a backhaul.    Therefore, in a case where a user equipment does not exist within the
10 tracking area to which the local eNB belongs, it could be said that a trigger to shift from
   an energy saving operation to a normal operation does not occur.
    [0396]    FIG. 25 illustrates a sequence example of a mobile communication system in a
   case where a solution of the tenth modification of the first embodiment is used.        The
   portions of FIG. 25 corresponding to those of FIG. 15 are denoted by the same step
15 numbers, and the processes thereof are not described in detail.
    [0397]    In Step ST2501, an MME judges whether or not a user equipment exists within
   a tracking area to which a local eNB belongs.       A user equipment performs tracking area
   update in a case where a tracking area to which the own user equipment belongs changes,
   and thus, the judgment of Step ST2501 can be executed without complicating a
20 conventional technology.      In a case of judging that a user equipment exists in Step
   ST2501, the MME moves to Step ST2502, or in a case of judging that a user equipment
   does not exist in Step ST2501, the MME moves to Step ST2503.
    [0398]    In Step ST2502, the MME instructs the local eNB to perform an energy saving
   operation by means of an S1 interface or X2 interface.         Alternatively, the MME may
25 instruct the energy saving operation via the HeNBG W.         The instruction to perform an

                                                102
   energy saving operation may be an instruction to turn off the transmission operation and
   turn on the reception operation.    Alternatively, it may be an instruction to turn off the
   transmission operation and turn on the discontinuous reception.         After that, the MME
   returns to the judgment of Step ST2501.
 5  [0399]    In Step ST2503, the MME instructs the local eNB to turn off the power by
   means of an SI interface or X2 interface.     Alternatively, the MME may instruct to turn
   off the power via the HeNBGW.           The instruction to turn off the power may be an
   instruction to turn off the transmission operation and turn off the reception operation.
   Still alternatively, the instruction may be an instruction to turn off the transmission
10 operation and turn off the discontinuous reception.      After that, the MME returns to the
   judgment of Step ST2501.      The local eNB that has received the instruction to turn off the
   power in Step ST2503 performs the processes of Step ST1501, Step ST1502 and Step
   ST1503 and, after that, moves to Step ST2504.
    [0400]    In Step ST2504, the local eNB judges whether or not to perform an energy
15 saving operation.     A specific example of the judgment in Step ST2504 is disclosed
   below.    In a case where the local eNB has received the instruction to perform the energy
   saving operation, the local eNB judges to perform an energy saving operation.         In a case
   where the local eNB has not received the instruction to perform an energy saving
   operation, the local eNB judges not to perform an energy saving operation.           In a case
20 where the local eNB has received the instruction to turn off the power, the local eNB
   judges not to perform an energy saving operation.      In a case where the local eNB has not
   received the instruction to turn off the power, the local eNB judges to perform an energy
   saving operation.    In a case where the local eNB judges to perform an energy saving
   operation, the local eNB moves to Step ST1504.        In a case where the local eNB judges
25 not to perform an energy saving operation, the local eNB moves to Step ST2505.

                                                 103
   [0401]     In Step ST2505, the local eNB turns off the power.      As a specific example, the
   local eNB turns off the transmission operation and turns on the reception operation.
   Alternatively, the local eNB turns off the transmission operation and turns off the
   discontinuous reception.
 5 [0402]     In Step ST2506, the local eNB judges whether or not it has received an
   instruction to perform an energy saving operation.         In a case of judging that it has
   received the instruction, the local eNB moves to Step ST1504, or in a case of judging that
   is has not received the instruction, the local eNB repeats the process of Step ST2506.
   After performing the processes of Step ST1504 and Step ST1505, the local eNB moves to
10 Step ST2507.
   [0403]     In Step ST2507, the local eNB judges whether or not it has received the
   instruction to turn off the power.   In a case of judging that it has received the instruction,
   the local eNB moves to Step ST2505, or in a case of judging that is has not received the
   instruction, repeats the process of Step ST2507.
15 [0404]     While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
   macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the tenth modification of the first
   embodiment even if the serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   tenth modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0405]     While the present modification has described the case where the node that
20 performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
   performed as in the tenth modification of the first embodiment even if the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of
   the tenth modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
   [0406]     The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
25 first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first

                                                104
   embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, the third modification of
   the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the first embodiment, the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment, the sixth modification of the first embodiment, the
   seventh modification of the first embodiment, the eighth modification of the first
 5 embodiment, and the ninth modification of the first embodiment.
   [0407]     The tenth modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects described
   below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.    In a case where the trigger to
   shift from an energy saving operation to a normal operation does not occur, it is possible
   to turn off the reception operation as well.  On the other hand, in a case where there may
10 occur a trigger to shift from an energy saving operation to a normal operation, a shift to
   the energy saving operation is enabled, which enables to turn on the reception operation.
   Accordingly, energy consumption can be reduced further while keeping the effects of the
   first embodiment.
   [0408]     Eleventh Modification of First Embodiment
15            A problem to be solved in an eleventh modification of the first embodiment is
   described.    A problem described below arises even in a case where the solution of the
   first embodiment is executed.
   [0409]     A HeNB is deployed by an owner irrespective of the positions at which other
   cell is deployed.    Therefore, a HeNB may be deployed in a place where the reception
20 quality of the other cell is good.  The deployment of a HeNB in the neighborhood of the
   other cell is conceivable as a specific example.      In a case where the other cell is a
   serving cell in such a location, the reception quality of the serving cell does not
   deteriorate in the neighborhood of the HeNB deployed in the neighborhood of the other
   cell.   For example, in a case where the reception quality of the serving cell is judged as a
25 trigger to transmit uplink transmission for wakeup, a situation in which a user equipment

                                                105
   performs uplink transmission for wakeup does not occur.       Accordingly, in a case where
   a HeNB is deployed in the neighborhood of other cell, there arises a problem that the
   HeNB cannot shift from an energy saving operation to a normal operation in uplink
   transmission for wakeup from a user equipment.
 5 [0410]     FIG. 26 is a location diagram illustrating the problem of the eleventh
   modification of the first embodiment.      A macro cell 2601 has a coverage 2609.       The
   path loss from the macro cell 2601 is, for example, "9" in the neighborhood of the
   coverage 2609.     A HeNB 2602 is deployed in the neighborhood of the path loss, for
   example, "1" from the macro cell 2601.      A HeNB 2603 is deployed in the neighborhood
10 of the path loss, for example, "2" from the macro cell 2601.    A HeNB 2604 is deployed
   in the neighborhood of the path loss, for example, "7" from the macro cell 2601.          A
   HeNB 2605 is deployed in the neighborhood of the path loss, for example, "8" from the
   macro cell 2601.     A HeNB 2606 is deployed in the neighborhood of the path loss, for
   example, "9" from the macro cell 2601.        A solid line 2607 of FIG. 26 indicates the
15 location with a path loss "3" from the macro cell 2601.       A solid line 2608 of FIG. 26
   indicates the location with a path loss "6" from the macro cell 2601.     A solid line 2609
   of FIG. 26 indicates the location with a path loss "9" from the macro cell 2601.
   [0411]     Considered here is a case where the value "9" of a path loss is used as a wakeup
   uplink transmission threshold as the method of judging the deterioration in reception
20 quality of the serving cell using (1) a case where the reception quality of the serving cell
   deteriorates is used as a specific example of a situation in which uplink transmission for
   wakeup is performed in the first embodiment.          In a case where a user equipment
   transmits the uplink signal for wakeup under the above-mentioned conditions, in the
   location as shown in FIG. 26, only the HeNB 2606 may shift to a normal operation by the
25 uplink signal power for wakeup.       There is no likelihood that the HeNB 2602, HeNB

                                                 106
   2603, HeNB 2604 and HeNB 2605 will shift to the normal operation by the uplink signal
   for wakeup.      This is because the HeNB 2602, HeNB 2603, HeNB 2604 and HeNB 2605
   are located within the place where the path loss from the macro cell 2601 is smaller than
   the threshold "9".     Accordingly, a user equipment does not reach the situation to perform
 5 uplink transmission for wakeup in the vicinities of the HeNB 2602, HeNB 2603, HeNB
   2604 and HeNB 2605.
   [0412]      In a case where, for example, a HeNB is deployed in a house of an owner of a
   user equipment, the means in which the HeNB shifts from an energy saving operation to a
   normal operation without the process by a user when the owner returns home is important
10 in terms of the construction of a user-friendly system.     This means is necessary even if a
   user equipment is in an idle state.
   [0413]      As described above, Non-Patent Document 8 describes the technology using an
   X2 interface, which is not applicable to a HeNB.        Further, a user equipment in an idle
   state is not taken into consideration in Non-Patent Document 8.
15 [0414]      The solution in the eleventh modification of the first embodiment is described
   below.     Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly described.
   Parts that are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
   [0415]      A serving cell notifies user equipments being served thereby of the information
   indicating the existence of a HeNB and the information of the path loss for the location in
20 which the HeNB exists.         In a case where the reception quality of the serving cell
   becomes the path loss indicating that a HeNB exists, the user equipment that has received
   the information performs uplink transmission for wakeup.          This enables the HeNB to
   shift to a normal operation in a case where the user equipment exists in the neighborhood
   of the HeNB.
25 [0416]      Further, in a case a user equipment that has received the information is

                                                107
   registered with any CSG (whitelist is not empty), the user equipment may perform uplink
   transmission for wakeup when the reception quality of the serving cell becomes the path
   loss indicating the existence of a HeNB.         Alternatively, in a case where the user
   equipment that has received the information is not registered with any CSG (whitelist is
 5 empty), the user equipment may not perform uplink transmission for wakeup even if the
   reception quality of a serving cell becomes the path loss indicating the existence of a
   HeNB.
   [0417]     Specific examples of the information indicating the existence of a HeNB and
   the information of the path loss for the location in which the HeNB exists are described
10 below.    FIG. 27 shows a specific example of the information of the path loss in the
   solution of the eleventh modification of the first embodiment.
   [0418]     (1) A path loss in which a HeNB exists.       In the case of the location shown in
   FIG. 26, information is as shown in part (1) of FIG. 27.      A user equipment can transmit a
   wakeup uplink signal in accordance with the path loss, which reduces unnecessary uplink
15 transmission.
   [0419]     (2) The range of a path loss and whether or not a HeNB exists within the range
   thereof.   In the case of the location shown in FIG. 26, information is as shown in part (2)
   of FIG. 27.     Irrespective of the number of HeNBs to be deployed, an amount of the
   information indicating the existence of a HeNB and the information of a path loss for the
20 location in which the HeNB exists is constant.      In the case where HeNBs to be deployed
   increase, the amount of information can be reduced                more compared      with the
   above-mentioned method (1).         This enables to effectively use radio resources.      The
   division of path loss range is determined in a static manner such that, for example, an
   index I indicates being equal to or larger than zero and smaller than three, an index 2
25 indicates being equal to or larger than three and smaller than six, and an index 3 indicates

                                               108
   being equal to or larger than six, which leads to a further reduction in amount of
   information.
    [0420]    While the present modification has described the case where a serving cell is a
   macro cell, the present invention can be performed as in the eleventh modification of the
 5 first embodiment if the serving cell is a local eNB, where similar effects to those of the
   eleventh modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
    [0421]    The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first
   embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, the third modification of
10 the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the first embodiment, the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment, the sixth modification of the first embodiment, the
   seventh modification of the first embodiment, eighth modification of the first embodiment,
   the ninth modification of the first embodiment, and the tenth modification of the first
   embodiment.
15  [0422]    The eleventh modification of the first embodiment can achieve effects
   described below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.      Similar effects to
   those of the first embodiment can be achieved also in a HeNB that may be deployed in the
   place where the reception quality of other cell is sufficient.
    [0423]    Twelfth Modification of First Embodiment
20            A problem to be solved in a twelfth modification of the first embodiment is
   described.    Even in a case where the solution of the first embodiment is executed, a
   problem described below arises when a local eNB is a HeNB that operates in a closed
   access mode.
    [0424]    With the use of the first embodiment, the uplink transmission for wakeup from
25 a user equipment is received, whereby the HeNB shifts from an energy saving operation

                                                  109
   to a normal operation.     Meanwhile, the user equipment is not registered with the CSG to
   which the HeNB belongs.         In this case, there arises a problem that even if the HeNB
   enters a normal operation, the user equipment cannot access the HeNB as well as cannot
   camp thereon.       In addition, the energy saving operation of a He-NB is released
 5 unnecessarily, leading to a problem that energy consumption is not reduced efficiently.
    [0425]    Three solutions in the twelfth modification of the first embodiment are
   disclosed below.     Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly
   described.    Parts that are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
    [0426]    (1) In a case of shifting from an energy saving operation to a normal operation,
10 a HeNB does not operate in a closed access mode but operates in an open access mode or
   a hybrid access mode.       As a result, even if a user equipment that has performed uplink
   transmission for wakeup is not registered with the CSG to which the HeNB belongs, the
   user equipment is capable of accessing the HeNB and camping thereon.
    [0427]    (2) A HeNB judges whether or not a user equipment that has performed wakeup
15 uplink transmission is registered with the CSG to which the own HeNB belongs and, if
   the user equipment is registered, the HeNB shifts from an energy saving operation to a
   normal operation.     If the user equipment is not registered, the HeNB continues an energy
   saving operation.     This reduces the unnecessary release of an energy saving operation by
   a HeNB.
20  [0428]    (3) A HeNB judges whether or not a user equipment that has performed wakeup
   uplink transmission is registered with the CSG to which the own HeNB belongs and, in a
   case where the user equipment is registered, shifts from an energy saving operation to a
   normal operation by entering a closed access mode or allowing a closed access mode.       In
   a case where the user equipment is not registered, the HeNB shifts to a normal operation
25 by entering an open access mode or a hybrid access mode or prohibiting a closed access

                                               110
   mode.
   [0429]     Disclosed below is a specific example of the method in which a HeNB judges
   whether or not a user equipment that has performed wakeup uplink transmission is
   registered with a CSG to which the own HeNB belongs.         The identification information
 5 of a user equipment (such as UE-ID) is included in a wakeup uplink signal from the user
   equipment.     The HeNB judges whether or not the user equipment is registered with the
   CSG to which the own HeNB belongs based on the identification information of the user
   equipment.     This judgment may be performed by inquiring of a home subscriber server
   (HSS).    The HSS is a subscriber information database in a mobile communication
10 network of 3GPP, which is an entity that manages authentication information and the
   location information.
   [0430]     The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first
   embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, the third modification of
15 the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the first embodiment, the fifth
   modification of the first embodiment, the sixth modification of the first embodiment, the
   seventh modification of the first embodiment, the eighth modification of the first
   embodiment, the ninth modification of the first embodiment, the tenth modification of the
   first embodiment, and the eleventh modification of the first embodiment.
20 [0431]     The twelfth modification of the first embodiment can achieve the effect
   described below in addition to the effects of the first embodiment.    By receiving uplink
   transmission for wakeup from the user equipment, it is possible to prevent the occurrence
   of a situation in which, even though a HeNB shifts from an energy saving operation to a
   normal operation, the user equipment cannot access the HeNB or cannot camp thereon on
25 the ground that the user equipment is not registered with the CSG to which the HeNB

                                                  111
   belongs.    This reduces energy consumption efficiently.
   [0432]     Thirteenth Modification of First Embodiment
              A problem to be solved in a thirteenth modification of the first embodiment is
   described.    Even if the solution of the first embodiment is executed, a problem described
 5 below arises in a case of an isolated cell where a local eNB does not exist within the
   coverage of any cell.
   [0433]     In the first embodiment, a user equipment executes AFC using the downlink
   transmission of a serving cell in a case of performing uplink transmission for wakeup.
   In the case of an isolated cell, however, a problem that the AFC cannot be executed arises.
10 If AFC cannot be executed, a difference between frequencies is caused between a user
   equipment and a local eNB.       This deteriorates the reception quality.
   [0434]     Two solutions in the thirteenth modification of the first embodiment are
   disclosed below.     Parts different from the solution of the first embodiment are mainly
   described.    Parts that are not described are similar to the first embodiment.
15 [0435]     (1) A user equipment performs uplink transmission for wakeup if the condition
   for performing uplink transmission for wakeup is satisfied.          A specific example of the
   uplink transmission for wakeup is disclosed below.            A user equipment transmits a
   predetermined signal in a predetermined frequency-time domain.          A local eNB measures
   the received power in a predetermined frequency-time domain and, in a case where the
20 received power exceeds a given threshold, shifts from an energy saving operation to a
   normal operation.
   [0436]     As a specific example of the predetermined frequency-time                domain, a
   frequency domain is given more latitude.       The latitude given to a frequency prevents the
   influence when a difference between the frequencies arises.                The predetermined
25 frequency-time domain may be determined in a static manner.

                                                 112
    [0437]     Specific examples of the predetermined signal include a random signal and a
   PN signal.
    [0438]     (2) A local eNB does not shift to an energy saving operation in a case of
   judging that the own cell is an isolated cell.    On the other hand, the local eNB executes
 5 the energy saving operation of the first embodiment in a case of judging that the own cell
   is not an isolated cell.
    [0439]     A specific example of the method ofjudging that the own cell is an isolated cell
   is disclosed below.        A local eNB measures a surrounding radio environment in
   initialization, turning-on of the power, or turning-off of the transmission power at times.
10 Specific examples of the surrounding radio environment include the reception quality of a
   neighboring cell.     If the reception quality or received power of all of the neighboring
   cells is equal to or smaller than a threshold (or is smaller than a threshold), a local eNB
   judges that the own cell is an isolated cell.     Meanwhile, if the path loss of all of the
   neighboring cells is larger (or is equal to or larger) than a threshold, a local eNB judges
15 that the own cell is an isolated cell.
    [0440]     While the present modification has described the case where the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a local eNB, the present invention can be
   performed as in the thirteenth modification of the first embodiment even if the node that
   performs an energy saving operation is a wide-area eNB, where similar effects to those of
20 the thirteenth modification of the first embodiment can be achieved.
    [0441]     The present modification has mainly described the example combined with the
   first embodiment, which can be used in combination with the first modification of the first
   embodiment, the second modification of the first embodiment, the third modification of
   the first embodiment, the fourth modification of the first embodiment, the fifth
25 modification of the first embodiment, the sixth modification of the first embodiment, the

                                                  113
   seventh modification of the first embodiment, the eighth modification of the first
   embodiment, the ninth modification of the first embodiment, the tenth modification of the
   first embodiment, the eleventh modification of the first embodiment, and the twelfth
   modification of the first embodiment.
 5 [0442]     The thirteenth modification of the first embodiment can achieve an effect that a
   problem of an isolated cell can be solved, in addition to the effects of the first
   embodiment.
   [0443]     While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing
   description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive.    It is therefore understood that
10 numerous modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope
   of the invention.
   [0444]     Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context
   requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising",
   will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps
15 but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
   [0445]     The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as,
   an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common
   general knowledge in Australia.
