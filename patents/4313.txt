specifically relates to a cylinder of ultrasonic wave multi-station bucket cleaning
device.
Background
      With the improvement of people's living standards and the demand of modern
logistics and transportation, a part of liquid or powdered products are required to be
packed in bucket according to national standards or user requirements for safe
transportation and storage. The expense of packing common products such as paint
and chemical products and the like, is high, and the buckets used for packing the
chemical products have the hazard of chemical pollution. Therefore, in order to save
costs and reduce environmental hazards, manufacturers will recycle the packing
buckets for repacking.

bucket cleaning device, utilizing ultrasonic wave combining with the high speed
cleaning brush to wash the inner and the outer faces of the bucket, and to rapidly
clean the impurities attached to the surface of the bucket, thus contributing for
recycling the buckets.
