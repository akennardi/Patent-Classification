   Detailed Description
15
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown an embodiment of
   a gaming system having a game controller arranged such
   that a player can play a plurality of different games
   concurrently. The game controller conducts the games in
20 respective ones of a plurality of different display areas.
   The game rules of each game provide for the possibility of
   a super feature being triggered in which instances of a
   feature game based on the game rules of a triggering game
   are carried out in each of the display areas. The gaming
25 system also has a player interface which allows a player
   to choose which of the games to play and in which display
   areas the games are to be conducted.
   General construction of gaming system
30
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
35
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
                                      10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
 5 gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
10 and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
15 wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.          For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
   mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
20 on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
25 core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
30 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
35 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
                                      10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                               - 8
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions               (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
 5 The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
10 program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
15 or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs       (for example on
20 the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
25 array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
30 displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
35 mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.     Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
                                       10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                               - 9
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
 5 value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.        The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
10 other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
15 credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
20 information or images relating to the game.              Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
25
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
30 display unit. The top box 26 may also include a display,
   for example a video display unit, which may be of the same
   type as the display 14, or of a different type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
35 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
                                        10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                              -  10
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
 5 communication with the processor 102.         Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
10
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
15 machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
20 random numbers for use by the processor 102.                Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
25 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107    (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
30 coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
35 player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
                                         10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                              - 11
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
 5 buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
10 The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                     In
15 embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
20
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                  The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
25 execution by the processor 102 and related data.                  The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.   The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
30 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
35 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
                                       10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                             - 12
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
 5 two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
10 implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
15 network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
20 promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
25 game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
30 gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.          A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
35
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
                                      10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                             - 13
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.     With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
 5 these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard

   Further detail of gaming system
   Figures 6 to 8 show specific details of implementation of
   the embodiment.  In the example of Figures 6 to 8, the
10 player can play up to four different games in separate
   display areas 54A, 54B, 54D on display 54.            In the
   embodiment, the player can select between one and four
   different games and can select to play any combination of
   the games.  For example, the player can select to play all
15 four different games or one instance of one game, two
   instances of a second game and one instance of a third
   game.  The player may also select less than four games.
   In this respect, memory 64 of game controller 60 stores
20 game data for the first game 650, second game 660,                  third
   game 670, and fourth game 680.   The player interacts with
   a game allocator function 625 of the game controller 60 to
   allocate the games.  In this respect, outcome generator
   622 is arranged to generate outcomes for up to four
25 different game instances.   This is represented in Figure 6
   by the fact that the outcome generator including provision
   to generated outcomes for Game A 522A, Game B 622B, Game C
   622C, and Game D 622D.  These game instances are linked to
   respective ones of the display areas 54A to 54D.                  The game
30 allocator 625 is operable by the player using player
   interface 56 so that the first to fourth games 650 to 680
   can be allocated to any one of the game instances Game A
   to Game D and hence can be allocated to any one of the
   display areas 54A to 54D.   In this way, the player has
35 full control over not only which games are played but also
   where they are displayed.   This allows the player to
   exercise personal preference over not only which games are
                                       10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                              -  15
   conducted but where they are conducted on the display.
   For example, the player may wish to place a particular
   game in a particular area which the player finds easiest
   to monitor.
 5
   A specific mechanism for the player to allocate games is
   shown in Figure 8 which shows an exemplary display 54 of
   the game.   The display area includes a plurality of sub
   display areas 54A to 54D.    The display also includes a
10 credit meter 801, a win meter 802 and a bet meter 803.
   Icons 810, 811, 812, 813 correspond to respective ones of
   a plurality of the four different games.           In the
   embodiment, a touch screen is incorporated over the
   display 54 as part of the player interface 56.                 For a
15 player to allocate a game to a particular display area,
   the player places their finger on the icon corresponding
   to the game they wish to select during a selection phase
   and drags the icon with their finger into the area in
   which they want the game to be conducted before releasing
20 the icon.   This results in population of the display area
   with the selected game.   Accordingly, it can be seen in
   Figure 8 that the player has elected to populate the four
   display areas with the four different games and has chosen
   a particular selection of areas for each game.                 Once the
25 player has made their selections they press the exit
   button 820 so that they can play and view the games.
   As well as selecting the games to play, the player
   operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify a wager for
30 this play of the game and to initiate a play of the game.
   In the embodiment, the player is restricted in their
   selection of a wager to only selecting a bet multiplier to
   apply to all the games. Thus, where a game is a spinning
   reel game, the other selections are preset. That is, while
35 normally in a line-based spinning reel game, the player
   may select how many lines they play in each play of the
   game (e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum number
                                        10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                              -  16
   of lines allowed by the game) and how much they wager per
   line, in the embodiment the player plays a defined number
   of win lines, specifically the maximum number of lines.
 5 In many games, is not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a player's selection of pay lines and are
   an inherent part of the game.
10 In other spinning reel games, a player usually selects a
   number of reels to play and an amount to wager per reel.
   Such games are marketed under the trade name "Reel Power"
   by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of
   the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel can
15 be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
   display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
   at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
   reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated,   symbol display positions of the
20 other reels. For example, if there are five reels and
   three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
   symbol display positions; the symbols displayed in the
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
25 the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reels, the active display positions being all display
   positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
30 reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win. As in line based games, the player plays a fixed
   number of reels, specifically, all reels. Persons skilled
   in the art, will appreciate that this arrangement makes
   placing the wager on each play of the game
35 straightforward.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
                                        10336060_1 (GHIatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                             - 17
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
 5 circuit.
   These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
10 the games and generates game outcomes for each of the
   games which will then be evaluated by award evaluator 623.
   In the embodiment, generation of each game outcome
   includes a symbol selector (not shown) selecting symbols
   using random number generator 621. The selected symbols
15 are advised to the display controller 624 which causes
   them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of display
   positions within the display area 54A-D for the game.
   One example of selecting symbols is to select symbols for
20 display from a plurality of symbol sets corresponding to
   respective ones of a plurality of spinning reels. The
   symbol sets can specify a sequence of symbols for each
   reel such that a symbol selector can select all of the
   symbols by selecting a stopping position in the sequence.
25 It is known to use a probability table stored in memory 64
   to vary the odds of a particular stop position being
   selected. Other techniques can be used to control the odds
   of particular outcomes occurring to thereby control the
   return to player of the game.
30
   In the embodiment, the gaming system is arranged such that
   a player can in some instances trigger plural instances of
   a feature game corresponds to an individual one of the
   base games upon a trigger condition being met.               In the
35 embodiment, this is achieved by instances of the feature
   game in respect of which the trigger is met being carried
   out in each of the display areas.  In the embodiment, a
                                      10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                             - 18
   criterion for the player having eligibility to this "super
   feature" is that the player is playing game instances in
   each of the display areas 54A to 54D.      To this end,
   outcome generator 622 includes a super game condition
 5 monitor 622E which monitors whether the super game
   condition is met and controls the outcome generator 622
   such that the super game is available.
   As is shown in Figure 6, the game data 650,660,670,680
10 include the same types of data.  Referring to the first
   game by way of example, each game includes a base game
   portion 651, two sets of reel data 652, 653, feature game
   data 654, a first trigger in the form of super trigger 656
   and a second trigger in the form of a normal trigger 655.
15 In the example shown in Figure 6, the main difference
   between the normal feature game and the super feature game
   is that in the normal feature game is carried out only in
   the display area corresponding to the game that triggered
   the feature whereas in the super feature is carried out in
20 all four display areas.
   Further, in the embodiment, in order to control whether
   the feature game or the super feature game is triggered,
   different symbols are used on the reels such that the
25 reels vary between a base game from which a super game can
   be triggered and a base game from which only the feature
   game can be triggered.  In this embodiment, the super
   trigger involves a symbol present in reel set 653 but not
   present in reel set 652 and similar considerations apply
30 for each of the other games 660, 670,    680.       Accordingly, a
   super trigger 656 can only occur when the second set of
   reels 653 are employed.  While this is shown as two sets
   of different reels 652, 653, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that the same effect can be achieved by
35 modifying a particular set of reels.
   Further, in the embodiment shown in Figure 6, each of the
                                      10336060_1 (GHIatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                             - 19
   feature game comprises a free game series where a
   plurality of game rounds are conducted of the base game
   without requiring the player to place a further wager.                        As
   is known in the art, this can be done with the same reels
 5 as in the underlying base game such as Reels 1B in the
   case of a super feature game being triggered or Reels 1A
   in the case of a normal feature game being triggered or
   can be done with a further modification of the game.                     For
   example, additional wild symbols may be added to the reels
10 of the base game to increase the chance of winning in the
   feature games.  Persons skilled in the art will also
   appreciate that the base and feature games need not
   necessarily be of the same type or use similar reels to
   one another, however, in the embodiment in each instance,
15 the super feature game is based primarily on the rules of
   the feature game conducted in respect for a particular
   game so that it is apparent to the player that they have
   triggered a super feature from a particular game.
20 The game controller 60 also incorporates a super game
   controller 624 which controls the super game so that all
   instances are carried out in the respective display areas
   54.
25 Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that there
   are also meters 645 which keep track of the players
   current level of credits, any awards made during a base
   game, a feature game, or a super feature game and transfer
   these wins to the credit meter either when the player
30 seeks to cash out or when the player initiates another
   play of the game.
   Figure 7 illustrates a method of an embodiment of the
   invention.  At step 710 the method involves receiving
35 player selections of games and a game initiation.                  It is
   then determined whether a super feature condition is met
   720.  If a super feature condition is not met, the normal
                                      10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                              - 20
   game rules for each of the games are used 780 and the
   games are conducted in each display area 54A-54D such that
   if a normal trigger occurs 770 the feature of the
   triggering game is conducted for that game only in its
 5 relevant display area.   If a super feature condition is
   met, the game rules are used which enable the super
   feature to be won 730.   In the above example, this
   involves the selection of a particular set of reels to be
   used.  The games are conducted in each display area 740
10 and if a super trigger condition is met 750 the plural
   rounds of the feature game of the triggering game is
   conducted in each display area.
   In some embodiments, it may also be possible for a normal
15 trigger to be met in respect of games where a super
   trigger does not occur.   In such embodiments the feature
   game of the triggering game is conducted in the relevant
   display area.
20 In one example, the super free game feature results in the
   awarding of 5, 10 or 25 super free games depending on
   whether the trigger involves 3, 4, or 5 scattered symbols
   including a designated super feature game scatter symbol.
   During the super feature free game feature these games
25 (i.e. 5, 10 or 25 games) are played in each of the four
   display areas.  Such that the awarding of the feature
   results in effectively 20, 40 or 100 free games being
   conducted.  During the free games, an extra WILD symbol is
   added to four reels of the five reel game.           Additional
30 feature games can be awarded with a scatter win occurring
   during play of the game.
   As discussed above, in the embodiment, an eligibility
   criterion is applied for the player to be eligible for the
35 super feature, requiring the player to play games in each
   of the display areas. In other embodiments, there could be
   additional eligibility criteria, for example that the
                                       10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                              - 21
   player has selected at least two different games or
   different games in each display area, made a certain sized
   wager, made an ante bet, played sufficient games, or the
   player is a member of a loyalty program.
 5
   The base game is a part of the game which is carried out
   each time the player makes a wager, typically irrespective
   of the wager, whereas the feature game will be carried out
   occasionally upon the trigger occurring.
10
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a feature
   game involves some additional element of game play which
   usually only occurs when a trigger condition is met. Types
   of feature games include:  those where a series of free
15 game events are awarded such as free games or re-spins
    (where some reels are held while others are re-spun);
   games where the symbols on the reel are changed; and
   "second screen" games where game play is totally different
   to the base game, for example where the player makes
20 selections in a "pick a box type" game.
   The trigger event may be, a symbol combination in the
   game, occurrence of a specific symbol in the game,
   purchased, be caused by another connected system, based on
25 turnover, based on a random evaluation, etc.
   A game round involves at least one of the reels being
   "spun" -  e.g. new symbols of the reel are selected for
   display at the display positions. Persons skilled in the
30 art will appreciate that there may be more than one game
   round in a play of a gaming machine such as is the case
   when a series of free spins is awarded. The outcome of a
   game round may be no win, a win  (for example from a
   winning combination of symbols),  a contribution towards a
35 win accrued over a plurality of game rounds, a trigger
   condition occurring etc. Typically, a win will result in
   some form of award being made such as an award of credits.
                                       10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

                             - 22
   Such an award may never actually be physically received by
   a player. For example, many gaming systems provide a
   player with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the
   player can double or forfeit their credits before
 5 commencing another play of the game or cashing out.
   Further, as credits are fungible, once credits have been
   added to the credit meter it is not possible to
   distinguish between credits which exist because the player
   has input cash or the like and credits resulting from an
10 award.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
15 electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
20 appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
25 may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
30 ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
   (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server). Further different parts of the program code can
35 be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
                                      10336060_1 (GHKatters) P87499.AU.3 5/06/18

   instructions executable by the processor.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
 5 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
10 It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
   to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission

   description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
   implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
