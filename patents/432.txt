DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
         [0007]         Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the
present invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying
drawings.    Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention and not by
limitation of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and
variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit
thereof. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used
on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment.            Thus, it is intended that the
present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the
appended claims and their equivalents.
         [0008]         As is understood in the art, shrink films are films that shrink in at least
one direction when heated to a shrink initiation temperature. In some embodiments, shrink
films of the present invention may shrink only in the machine direction upon exposure to a
shrink initiation temperature.        In other embodiments, shrink films may alternatively or
additionally shrink in the transverse direction (also called the cross direction) upon exposure to
a shrink initiation temperature.        In still other embodiments, shrink films of the present
invention may shrink only in the machine direction upon exposure to a shrink initiation
temperature and may also grow (or expand) in the cross direction.
                                                    2

         [0009]        In some embodiments, the present invention includes films comprised of
at least one shrinkable layer prepared using a blend of (i) at least one shrinkable polymer
having a high glass transition temperature (Tg), and (ii) at least one shrinkable polymer having a
low Tg. In some specific embodiments, films of the present invention may have at least one
film layer prepared using (i) at least one cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) having a high glass
transition temperature, and (ii) at least one COC having a low glass transition temperature.      As
used herein, high Tg indicates a glass transition in the range of about 85* C to about 165* C and
low Tg indicates a glass transition temperature lower than about 85* C. The foregoing ranges
shall include each intermittent value and each intermittent range therein.
         [0010]        Any combination of one or more shrinkable polymers having a high Tg
and one or more shrinkable polymers having a low Tg are within the scope of the present
invention.   In some particular embodiments, polymers having high Tg may include polymers
having a Tg in the range of about 85* C to about 160* C. In other embodiments, polymers
having a Tg of about 90* C to about 155* C may be used as a high Tg polymer. In addition, in
some particular embodiments, polymers having a Tg from about -100* C to about 85* C may be
used as a low Tg polymer. In some embodiments, polymers having a Tg from about -60* C to
about 85* C may be used as a low Tg polymer. In yet other embodiments, polymers having a Tg
in the range of about -40* C to 83* C may be used as a low Tg polymer.                In still other
embodiments, polymers having a Tg in the range of about -35* C to about 82* C may be used as
a low Tg polymer. In yet other embodiments, polymers having a Tg of less than about 80* C
may be used as a low Tg polymer. Each of the foregoing ranges shall include each intermittent
value and each intermittent range therein.
                                                 3

          [0011]       Any suitable blend of high and low Tg polymers may be used in particular
embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, a shrinkable layer may include
about 1% to about 99% by weight of shrinkable polymers having a high glass transition
temperature and about 1% to about 99% by weight shrinkable polymers having a low glass
transition temperature, including each intermittent       range therein for each.      In some
embodiments, a shrinkable layer may include about 10% to about 80% by weight of shrinkable
polymers having a high glass transition temperature and about 20% to about 90% by weight
shrinkable polymers having a low glass transition temperature
          [0012]       By way of example, in some embodiments, one or more high Tg COC
polymers and one or more low Tg COC polymers may be blended in a shrinkable layer. In other
embodiments, a high Tg COC may be blended with a low Tg polyolefin to form a shrinkable
layer. In still other embodiments, polystyrene, which has a high Tg, may be blended with a
styrene block copolymer having a low Tg, such as styrene ethylene butylene styrene polymers
(SEBS), styrene ethylene/propylene styrene (SEPS) polymers, styrene butadiene (SBR), styrene
ethylene/propylene-styrene (SEPS), and poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) polymers (SBS), to
form a shrinkable layer. Additionally, in some embodiments, a shrinkable layer may include a
high Tg polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG) and/or polycarbonate blended with
a low Tg PETG and/or low Tg polyethylene terephthalate (PET).       The foregoing embodiments
are intended to be illustrative of specific embodiments of the present invention without limiting
its full scope.
          [0013]       In addition, although embodiments herein are discussed in the context of
glass transition temperatures, the present invention also includes embodiments wherein the
                                                 4

shrinkable layer polymer blend is alternatively based upon heat deflection temperatures (also
called the heat distortion temperatures) (HDT).       In this regard, such shrinkable layers may
comprise a blend of (i) at least one polymer, such as a COC, having a high heat deflection
temperature, and (ii) at least one polymer, such as a COC, having a low heat deflection
temperature. As used herein, a high heat deflection temperature includes temperatures above
about 750 C, and low heat deflection temperature includes temperatures at about or below
about 750 C.
        [0014]          Shrinkable layers of the present invention having a blend of a high Tg
polymer and a low Tg polymer may optionally include other components. By way of example,
in some embodiments, the shrinkable layer may include one or more additional polymer
materials, such as linear low density polyethylene or low density polyethylene. In addition,
such layers may also contain other components such as pigments, fillers, stabilizers, light
protective agents or other suitable modifying agents if desired. These film layers may also
contain anti-block, slip additives and anti-static agents.      Useful anti-block agents include
inorganic particles, such as clays, talc, calcium carbonate and glass. Slip additives useful in the
present invention include polysiloxanes, waxes, fatty amides, fatty acids, metal soaps and
particulate such as silica, synthetic amorphous silica and polytetrafluoroethylene powder. Anti
static agents useful in the present invention include alkali metal sulfonates, polyether-modified
polydiorganosiloxanes, polyalkylphenylsiloxanes and tertiary amines.
        [0015]           In some embodiments, shrinkable layers of the present invention may
include from about 5% to about 50% by weight of a semi-crystalline polymer.             By way of
example, such semi-crystalline polymers may include olefinic polymers, such as linear low
                                                  5

density polyethylene,     low density polyethylene, and       other polyethylenes.      In  some
embodiments having a shrinkable layer with a blend of high and low Tg COC polymers, the
shrinkable layer may include one or more semi-crystalline polymers having a density in the
range of about 0.90 g/cc to about 0.94 g/cc. In other embodiments, shrinkable layers having a
blend of high and low Tg COC polymers may include semi-crystalline polymers having a density
in the range of about 0.905 g/cc to about 0.935 g/cc. In still other embodiments, shrinkable
layers having a blend of high and low Tg COC polymers may include semi-crystalline polymers
having a density in the range of about 0.91 g/cc to about 0.93 g/cc.
        [0016]         Films of the present invention may be single layer films having a blend of
high and low Tg polymers or, in other embodiments, may be multilayer films wherein at least
one layer is prepared using a blend of high and low Tg polymers.         In some embodiments,
shrinkable layers having at least one high Tg polymer and one low Tg polymer may constitute at
least about 5% of the total thickness of a multilayer film. In some embodiments, shrinkable
layers having a blend of at least one high Tg polymer and one low Tg polymer may constitute
about 2% to about 30% of the total thickness of a multilayer film. In other embodiments, such
high Tg and low Tg blend shrinkable layers may constitute about 5% to about 25% of the total
thickness of a multilayer film.    In addition, in some embodiments, such as in Samples F-H
discussed below, a multilayer film may have a first shrink layer that includes a high and low Tg
blend and at least a second shrink layer that does not include a high and low Tg blend.
        [0017]         In some multilayer film embodiments of the present invention, other
layers may include, by way of example, skin layers, tie layers, core layers, print layers, and
adhesive layers. In some embodiments, a core may include a polymeric material, such as a
                                                 6

polyolefin resin or blends thereof. For example, the core layer in some embodiments of the
present invention may be comprised of low density polyethylene, linear low density
polyethylene, medium density polyethylene, ethyl vinyl acetate, polypropylene, and blends
thereof. In some embodiments, the core layer may additionally or alternatively be comprised
of elastomers and/or plastomers. In some embodiments, the core layer may also be prepared
with other     non-olefinic material,   such as styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS),
poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS), poly(styrene-isoprene-styrene) (SIS), and other similar
comopnents.
        [0018]         The following samples provide certain exemplary embodiments in
accordance with some aspects of the present invention. As shown below for Samples A-E are
films having a shrinkable layer with a high Tg COC (indicated as TOPAS 5013) and a low Tg COC
(indicated as TOPAS 8007), and the weight ratio of high Tg COC to low Tg COC is varied for each
sample. In addition, Samples F-H show exemplary compositions for embodiments of a film skin
layer wherein a tie layer includes a blend of high Tg COC and low Tg COC. In similar fashion, the
weight ratio of high Tg polymer to low Tg polymer in the tie layer is varied between these
samples. Samples I-J use a high Tg polystyrene (indicated as Polystyrene EA3400 and having a
Tg of about 102 *C)and low Tg styrene ethylene butylene styrene polymers (SEBS) (indicated as
Kraton G2832 and having a Tg of -42 *C). Finally, Sample K employs a high Tg PETG (indicated as
FX100, which is available from Eastman as Tritan Copolyester FX100 and has a Tg of 110 *C)and
Sample L employs FX100 and a low Tg PETG (indicated as SKC, which is available from SK
Chemicals as Skygreen K2012 and has a Tg of 82 *C).     As reflected in the data below, the layer
percentage is a volumetric percentage reflecting the thickness ratio of the layer.

        [0021]         Samples A-L were also tested for MD oven shrinkage, DMA shrink curve
and for various optical properties. The MD oven shrinkage was tested by punching 4" by 4" film
portions for the samples. For each sample, a different portion was placed in an oven that was
one of the temperatures listed in the data below. The portion was heated for five minutes and
then measured to determine the dimensional change (shrinkage or growth) in each direction.
The reported values below are the percentage shrink in the machine direction from the original
portion. The DMA shrink testing was conducted for each sample by placing a strip of the
                                               10

sample in a rheometer and applying a small load to strip in the tension direction to avoid
curling. Heat was then applied at a rate of 3* C/ min. The strip was be monitored and the data
below, which provides the change in dimension as a function of temperature, were recorded.
The optical properties were tested using the following procedures. For gloss, specular gloss of
plastic films was measured at 60* pursuant to Standard ASTM D2457. Transmittance, haze, and
clarity were determined by measuring the resultant light passed through the plastic film from a
light source pursuant to Standard ASTM D2457.

         [0023]          As indicated in the results above, the shrinkage properties of a film may
be varied based upon the ratio of high Tg polymer to low Tg polymer. Furthermore, as shown
in Fig. 1, the initiation shrink temperature is a non-linear function of high Tg polymer to low Tg
polymer.      As such, this shrink initiation temperature         may be adjusted in particular
embodiments by varying the ratio of high Tg polymer to low Tg polymer in the shrinkable layer.
In general, as shown in the figures, it was generally observed that an increase in the high Tg
component yielded an increase in the shrink initiation temperature. In addition, as shown by
                                                   13

the comparison of Sample K and Sample L, the blended skin layer in Sample L of high Tg PETG
and low Tg PETG (in this case, a low Tg of about 82 *C) resulted in shifting the activation
temperature of the film as compared with the high Tg PETG layer of Sample K.
         [0024]        Appreciating this correlation, in some embodiments of the present
invention, the shrink initiation temperature may be controlled for a film by the ratio of high Tg
polymer to low Tg polymer in the shrinkable film layer. For example, through the blending of
such components in a film layer, the shrink initiation temperature may be adjusted to a
desirable level.    As a result, using extrapolations from testing various film layers having
different ratios of high Tg polymers to low Tg polymers, the data may be extrapolated to
determine the necessary ratio to achieve a certain shrink initiation temperature for a film. Such
embodiments of the present invention allow a film to be prepared with a suitable shrink
initiation temperature, which may avoid the film undesirably shrinking at normal storage or
transportation temperatures.
         [0025]        These and other modifications and variations to the present invention
may be practiced by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and
scope of the present invention, which is more particularly set forth in the appended claims. In
addition, it should be understood that aspects of the various embodiments may be
interchanged in whole or in part. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate
