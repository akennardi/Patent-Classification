                                 Handle for a slidable panel
                                       Field of the invention
   The present invention relates to handles for slidable panels, such as slidable doors,
   windows, or the like.
 5                                Background of the invention
           Slidable panels, such as slidable doors, are typically slidably moved relative to a
   stationary frame by way of a handle. The handle is generally mounted to a side of the
   door and may include a protruding hand-graspable lever to assist with opening and
   closing the slidable door.
10         There are some disadvantages with such handles having protruding levers. For
   example, the handle may be considered aesthetically unappealing due to the protruding
   nature of the lever. Additionally, the lever may be bumped into by persons, or the lever
   may catch on or interfere with, clothing items worn by persons or articles of furniture
   located near the slidable door.
15         In an attempt to overcome the above deficiencies, slidable door handles
   comprising recessable or retractable levers have been proposed. US patent publication
   no. 2011/0156411 and US patent no. 9,170,598 describe handles having retractable
   levers. To some users, the handles described in the aforementioned US patent
   publications may be considered generally complex in operation. For example, the user
20 may be required to fold and/or rotate the lever into a particular position to operate the
   slidable door.
           It is an object of the present invention to provide a handle for a slidable panel
   which overcomes, or at least ameliorates, one or more of the problems described
   above, or is at least a useful alternative.
25         Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
   suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any
   jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood,
   regarded as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person
   in the art.
                                                      1

                                  Summary of the invention
           In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a handle
   for a slidable panel comprising:
           a housing mountable to the slidable panel;
 5         a lever connected to the housing and selectively moveable by hand between a
   stowed position and an extended position in which the lever is extended from the
   housing and adapted to move the slidable panel;
           wherein the lever is selectively moveable between the stowed and extended
   positions about a lever axis that is generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of the
10 housing.
           The lever is preferably pivotably moveable with respect to the housing via a
   hinge, said hinge defining the lever axis about which the lever preferably pivots between
   the stowed and extended positions and vice versa. The stowed position may be at least
   partially within the housing or fully within the housing, the stowed position being less
15 extended from the housing than the extended position.
           The handle preferably includes a selectively releasable lock mechanism
   configured to releasably lock the lever in the extended position. The lock mechanism
   may include blocking means moveable between a blocking position which blocks the
   lever from moving to the stowed position from the extended position, and an open
20 position in which the lever may be moved to the stowed position from the extended
   position.
           The blocking means may be biased to the blocking position. The bias may be
   provided by a compressible spring. The blocking means may comprise two arms. Each
   arm may be biased to the blocking position by a respective spring. The arms may be
25 rotatably mounted upon a base within the housing between the blocking and open
   positions. The lever is preferably connected to the base via the hinge.
           The lock mechanism may also include an actuator that selectively releases the
   lock mechanism to thereby allow the lever to move to the stowed position from the
   extended position. To this end, the actuator may be configured to move the element
                                                    2

   against its bias. The actuator may be a depressible push-button and may be located on
   the base.
           The lever is preferably generally rectangular and includes L-shaped outer ends.
   The "bend" in the L-shaped outer ends advantageously corresponds to the lever axis
 5 about which the lever is pivoted. When in the blocking position, the arms may engage
   respective L-shaped outer ends of the lever in the extended position to thereby block
   the lever from moving to the stowed position from the extended position. However,
   when in the open position, the blocking means may disengage the the L-shaped outer
   ends of the lever in the extended position, thereby allowing the lever to move, by hand
10 force, to the stowed position from the extended position.
           The lever may be assistably moved to the stowed position from the extended
   position by the blocking means engaging a portion of the lever as the blocking means
   moves from the open position to the blocking position due to their bias.
           A hand-graspable portion of the lever is preferably substantially flush with the
15 housing when the lever is in the stowed position. In this position, the hand-graspable
   portion is preferably parallel to a base of the housing. In the extended position, the
   hand-graspable portion of the lever outwardly projects from the housing. When in the
   stowed position, a space is preferably defined between the hand-graspable portion of
   the lever and the housing. The space is preferably dimensioned to allow a hand to
?0 grasp the hand-graspable portion of the lever and move the lever from the stowed
   position to the extended position. The lever is preferably pivotably moveable with
   respect to the housing such that, in one substantially smooth and continuous motion, a
   user may grasp the hand-graspable portion of the lever and pull the lever from the
   stowed position to the extended position and thereafter continue pulling on the lever in a
25 same general direction to move the slidable panel relative to an adjacent frame or
   panel.
           The handle may also include a lock mechanism configured to releasably latch the
   slidable panel to a striker of an adjacent frame or panel. The lock mechanism may
   include a lock or key cylinder configured to receive a key, one or more latches for
30 latching the slidable panel to the adjacent frame or panel, said one or more latches
   being optionally operatively associated with the lock or key cylinder, and one or more
                                                   3

   actuators operatively associated with the one or more latches to selectively latch the
   slidable panel to the adjacent frame or panel.

   "comprise" and variations of the term, such as "comprising", "comprises" and
 5 "comprised", are not intended to exclude further additives, components, integers or

                             Detailed description of an embodiment
            Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a handle 10 for a slidable panel, such as a
   slidable door or window (not shown). The handle 10 comprises a housing 12 mountable
   to the slidable panel, a generally rectangular lever 14 having L-shaped opposite outer
 5 ends 17 (Figure 3A), the lever 14 being hingedly connected to the housing 12 and
   selectively moveable by hand between a stowed position (Figure 1) in which the lever
   14 is stowed in the housing and an extended position (Figure 2) in which the lever is
   extended from the housing 12 and adapted to move the slidable panel. Advantageously,
   the lever 14 is selectively moveable between the stowed and extended positions about
10 a lever axis 16 that is generally parallel to a longitudinal axis 18 of the housing 12. As is
   illustrated throughout the figures, a hand-graspable portion 15 of the lever 14 is
   substantially flush with the housing 12 in the stowed position and is upstanding in the
   extended position.
           The housing 12 comprises a generally elongate rectangular body 20 defined by
15 opposite end walls 20a, 20b and opposite side walls 20c, 20d (Figure 3A). End walls
   20a, 20b are arranged generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 18 of the housing
   12, and side walls 20c, 20d are arranged generally parallel to the longitundinal axis 18.
   End walls 20a, 20b are curved slightly inwardly from a lower end thereof to an upper
   end thereof and include respective generally rectangular cut-outs or apertures 22a, 22b
?0 at their lower end having rounded corners, said apertures 22a, 22b defining, with an
   underside surface 24 of the body 20, a lower cavity 26 adapted to receive a lock
   mechanism (not shown) configured to releasably latch the slidable panel (to which the
   handle 10 is mounted) to an adjacent frame or panel. End walls 20a, 20b and side walls
   20c, 20d also define, with a topside surface 36 of the body 20, an upper cavity 38
25 adapted to house a portion of lever 14 and various other components of the handle 10
   described later.
           Side wall 20c includes a centrally located circular aperture 28 dimensioned to
   receive a lock or key cylinder (not shown) of the aforesaid lock mechanism. Side wall
   20d includes a generally rectangular cut-out or aperture 30 (Figure 3A) having a central
30 arch portion 32, said aperture 30 extending along approximately three-quarters of a
   length of side wall 20d and dimensioned to allow one or more latches (not shown) of the
   lock mechanism to selectively extend from, and retract within, lower cavity 26 to
                                                     5

   releasably latch the slidable panel to the adjacent frame or panel. Additionally, the
   apertures 22a, 22b of respective end walls 20a, 20b are dimensioned to receive push
   button like actuators 34 (Figures 1 and 2) operatively associated with the one or more
   latches to selectively latch the slidable panel to the adjacent frame or panel.
 5        Advantageously, the handle 10 is mounted to the slidable panel (not shown) via
   fasteners 19 (Figures 1 and 2), such that side wall 20d of the housing 12 faces, or is
   closest to, the adjacent frame or panel to which the slidable panel is slidable relative
   thereto. In this arrangment, a user of the handle 10 may grasp the hand-graspable
   portion 15 of the lever 14, and in one substantially smooth continuous motion, move the
10 lever 14 from the stowed position to the extended position, and thereafter continue to
   pull on the hand-graspable portion 15 of the lever 14 in the same direction to thereby
   move the slidable panel relative to the adjacent frame or panel.
          The handle 10 also includes a generally rectangular base plate 40 (Figure 3)
   located within upper cavity 38 and affixed to the topside surface 36 of the body 20 by
15 fasteners 42 that are received through the underside surface 24 of the body 20 and
   located within cylindrical mounting apertures 44 in an underside surface 46 of the base
   plate 40. The base plate 40 includes a topside surface 48 having, at opposite ends
   adjacent end walls 20a, 20b of body 20, upwardly projecting mounting apertures 50 that
   each include aligned longitudinal bores 52. The longitudinal bores 52 are adapted to
?0 pivotally mount, via pins 54, the lever 14 to the housing 12. The pins 54 are respectively
   received through the aligned bores 52 of the base plate 40 and similarly sized bores 56
   located at the opposite outer longitundal L-shaped ends 17 of the lever 14 at the "bend"
   in the L-shaped ends 17. The bores 52, 56, and pins 54 define the lever axis 16 about
   which the lever 14 is pivotally mounted between the stowed and extended positions.
25        The handle 10 also includes a selectively releasable lock mechanism 60
   configured to releasably lock the lever 14 in the extended position (Figure 2). The lock
   mechanism includes a pair of blocking elements in the form of generally elongate arms
   62 (Figures 3A, 3B and 4A) that are moveable between a blocking position (Figure 6A)
   in which the arms 62 block the lever 14 from moving to the stowed position (Figure 1)
30 from the extended position (Figure 2), and an open position (Figure 6B) in which the
   lever 14 may move to the stowed position from the extended position.
                                                     6

           Referring now to Figure 4, the arms 62 include an outer end flange 64, an
   opposite inner end flange 66, and a circular bore 68 disposed approximately one-third of
   the way along the length of the arm 62 from the inner end flange 66. The arm 62
   includes a first portion 70 defined between the inner end flange 66 and the circular bore
 5 68, which first portion 70 is offset at a slight angle from a second, longer, portion 72 of
   the arm 62 defined between the circular bore 68 and the outer end flange 64. The
   circular bores 68 are dimensioned to be rotatably mounted upon bosses 74 (Figures 3A
   and 3B) located on the underside surface 64 of the base plate 40. The inner end flanges
   66 of the arms 62 define generally cylindrical lateral projections 76 (Figures 3B and 4A)
10 that receive one end of a helical compression spring 78 (Figures 3A and 3B), the
   springs 78 being configured to bias the arms 62 to the blocking position (Figure 6A) in
   which they releasably lock the lever 14 in the extended position. The other end of each
   helical compression spring 78 is located against an L-shaped inner end wall 41 (Figure
   3B) located in the underside surface 46 of the base plate 40. The L-shaped wall 41 and
15 the cylindrical mounting aperture 44 define therebetween a cavity 79 dimensioned to
   receive the helical spring 78.
           The outer end flanges 64 of the arms 62 define upstanding projections 100 that
   include downwardly depending or sloping ramp surfaces 102 that slope from a central
   peak 104 to a rear side of the arm 62 (the rear side being closest to the sidewall 20c of
?0 the housing 12). The ramp surfaces 102 operably interface with the lever 14 in the
   manner described below to releasably lock or block the lever 14 from moving from the
   extended position to the stowed position.
           The inner end flanges 66 of the arms 62 also define upstanding projections 80
   that include downwardly depending or sloping ramp surfaces 82 that slope from a
25 central peak 106 to a front side of the arm 62 (the front side being closest to the
   sidewall 20d of the housing 12). The ramp surfaces 82 are operatively associated with
   an actuator in the form of a generally rectangular push-button 84 (Figure 4B) having
   rounded corners approximately centrally and pivotally located on the topside surface 48
   of base plate 40, the push button 84 being configured to selectively release the lock
30 mechanism 60 to thereby allow the lever 14 to move from the extended position to the
   stowed position.
                                                     7

          The push-button 84 includes outer end flanges 86 that define generally
   rectangular lateral projections 88 that are pivotally slotted in matching slots 90 (Figure
   3A) located in a side surface 92 of the base plate 40, the side surface 92 located
   generally adjacent the side wall 20d of the body 20. The push-button 84 is pivotable
 5 within slots 90 betwen a first, non-actuable position (Figure 5A), corresponding to the
   stowed position of the lever 14, and a second, actuable, position (Figure 5B),
   corresponding to the extended position of the lever 14 and in which the push-button
   may be actuated by being depressed to release the lock mechanism 60 to thereby allow
   the lever 14 to move from the extended position to the stowed position.
10        The outer end flanges 86 of the push-button 84 also define oblique downwardly
   depending ramp surfaces 93 located along an underside 94 of the push-button, said
   ramp surfaces 93 being dimensioned to contact and operably interface with ramp
   surfaces 82 of the arms 62 to move the arms 62 against the bias of spring 78 from the
   blocking to the open position to thereby allow the lever 14 to move from the extended
15 position to the stowed position.
          The manner in which the arms 62 releasably lock or block the lever 14 in the
   extended position will now be described with reference to Figure 6. Referring to Figure
   6A initially, it can be seen that the lever 14 is in the extended position with the hand
   graspable portion 15 of lever 14 being readily graspable by hand to move the handle 10,
?0 and thereby the slidable panel to which the handle is mounted. As is described above,
   the handle 10 is mounted to the slidable panel (not shown) such that, in one
   substantially smooth and continous motion, a user can grasp the portion 15, move the
   lever 14 from the stowed position to the extended position, and thereafter continue
   pulling on lever 14 in the same general direction to move the slidable panel relative to
25 the adjacent frame or panel (not shown). As is also seen in Figure 6A, the end flange 64
   of arm 62 is located adjacent to and contacting an inner side surface of sidewall 20c,
   and peak 104 of arm 62 is contacting lower portion 13 of lever 14. In this position, i.e the
   blocking position, outer end flange 64 of arm 62 releasably locks or blocks the lever 14
   from moving to the stowed position from the extended position. In this position also, the
30 push-button 84 is in the actuable position and is ready to be depressed to release the
   lock mechanism 60 to thereby allow the lever 14 to move from the extended position to
   the stowed position.
                                                    8

           As a user depresses the push-button 84, the ramp surfaces 93 of the push
   button engage the ramp surfaces 82 of the arms 62 to thereby pivot the arms 62 about
   the bosses 74 to move the arms to the open position (Figure 6B). In the open position,
   the outer end flanges 64 of the arms 62 are located near an inner side surface of
 5 sidewall 20d. In this open position, the peak 104 of end flange 64 moves out of contact
   with the lower portion 13 of lever 14, which thereby allows a user to release the push
   button 84 and move, by hand force, the lever 14 about the pivot axis 16 to the stowed
   position.
           As the user pivots lever 14 to the stowed position, springs 78 bias the arms 62 to
10 pivot towards the blocking position, and in doing so, ramp surfaces 102 of the arms
   contact and engage the lower portion 13 of lever 14 to assistably move the lever from
   the extended position to the stowed position (Figures 6C to 6E). In the stowed position
   (Figure 6E), the lower portion 13 of the lever 14 is located or "sandwiched" between the
   inner side surface of side wall 20c and the rear side surface of the outer end flange 64
15 with the spring bias maintaining the position. In this arrangement, the arms 62 assist
   with ensuring that the hand-graspable portion 15 of lever 14 is substantially flush with
   the housing 12 in the stowed position.
           The user may then, as desired, return the lever to the extended position (Figure
   6A). In doing so, as the hand-graspable portion 15 of lever 14 is pulled upwardly by the
?0 user, lower portion 13 of lever 14 engages ramp surfaces 102 of the arms 62 to move
   the arms against the bias of springs 78 to the open position (Figure 6B), after which the
   springs 78 then move the arms 62 back to the blocking position (Figure 6A).
           Advantageously, the abovedescribed handle 10 includes a stowable lever that, in
   operation, is easily usable in a single substantially smooth and continous movement to
25 move the lever from a stowed to an extended position, and to thereafter move the
   slidable panel. As is described above, the lever is advantageously moved from the
   stowed position to the extended operating position in same general direction to which
   the slidable panel is subsequently slided.
           It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined in this specification
30 extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features
                                                     9

mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations
constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.

           7.     The handle of claim 5 or 6, wherein the lever includes L-shaped outer
   ends which engage with the blocking means.
25         8.     The handle of claim 7, wherein the blocking means comprises two arms,
   and wherein each arm is biased to the blocking position by a respective spring.
                                                    11

          9.     The handle of claim 8, wherein the pair of arms are mounted upon a base
   located within the housing and are rotatably moveable between the blocking and open
   positions.
          10.    The handle of claim 8 or 9, wherein, when in the blocking position, the
 5 arms engage respective L-shaped outer ends of the lever in the extended position to
   thereby block the lever from moving to the stowed position from the extended position.
          11.    The handle of any one of claims 6 to 10, wherein the releasable lock
   mechanism further includes an actuator configured to, when selectively actuated, move
   the blocking means against the bias to the open position.
10        12.    The handle of claim 11, wherein, when in the open position, the blocking
   means disengages the L-shaped outer ends of the lever in the extended position,
   thereby allowing the lever to move, by hand force, to the stowed position from the
   extended position.
          13.    The handle of claim 12, wherein the lever is assistably moved to the
15 stowed position from the extended position by the blocking means engaging a portion of
   the lever as the blocking means moves from the open position to the blocking position
   due to their bias.
          14.    The handle of any one of claims 11 to 13, wherein the actuator is a
   depressible push-button.
20        15.    The handle of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the lever includes
   a hand-graspable portion, and wherein the hand-graspable portion is substantially flush
   with the housing when the lever is in the stowed position.
          16.    The handle of claim 15, wherein the hand-graspable portion of the lever
   outwardly projects from the housing in the extended position.
25        17.    The handle of claim 15, wherein, when in the stowed position, a space is
   defined between the hand-graspable portion of the lever and the housing, and wherein
   the space is dimensioned to allow a hand to grasp the hand-graspable portion of the
   lever and move the lever from the stowed position to the extended position.
                                                  12

          18.    The handle of claim 17, wherein the lever is pivotably moveable with
   respect to the housing such that, in one substantially smooth and continuous motion, a
   user may grasp the hand-graspable portion of the lever and pull the lever from the
   stowed position to the extended position and thereafter continue pulling on the lever in a
 5 same general direction to move the slidable panel relative to an adjacent frame or
   panel.
          19.    The handle of any one of claims 1 to 18, further including a key-operated
   lock, one or more latches configured to latch the slidable panel to an adjacent frame or
   panel, and one or more actuators configured to selectively actuate the one or more
10 latches.
                                                  13
