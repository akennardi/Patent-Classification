         COMBINATION CPAP AND RESUSCITATION SYSTEMS AND METHODS
                                  ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
              A combination positive airway pressure (PAP) or continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) and resuscitation system and related methods. The systems can be well
 5    suited for use in providing CPAP therapy for a neonate or infant patient, with the ability
      to also provide resuscitation therapy at a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) as needed or
      desired without switching to another system or switching the patient interface.      The
      system can include an expiratory pressure device capable of regulating a positive end
      expiration pressure (PEEP) of the system, which preferably can also induce pressure
10    oscillations relative to a mean PEEP.

        COMBINATION CPAP AND RESUSCITATION SYSTEMS AND METHODS
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Field of the Invention
  5           [0001]      The present invention relates to breathing assistance systems and
     methods.      In particular, the present invention relates to systems and methods for
     providing positive airway pressure therapy or resuscitation therapy to an infant.
     Description of the Related Art
              10002]      Under certain circumstances it is necessary or desirable to provide
 10  breathing assistance to a patient under respiratory distress.       For example, breathing
     assistance is often a necessary therapy to treat respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in
     infants, which can also be referred to as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or
     respiratory distress syndrome of newborn.      The breathing assistance provided is often in
     the form of providing breathing gases at a positive pressure, or a pressure somewhat
15   greater than atmospheric pressure.      Such treatments may be referred to in general as
     positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Often, the positive pressure is provided by a
     continuous flow of breathing gases, which is referred to as continuous positive airway
     pressure (CPAP) therapy. Infants on CPAP therapy to treat respiratory distress syndrome
     may also be likely to stop breathing and require resuscitation therapy.
20                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
              [0003]      A preferred embodiment is a combination positive airway pressure and
     resuscitation system and, preferably, a continuous positive airway pressure             and
     resuscitation system, as well as methods relating to the set-up and use of such a system.
     Conventionally, in response to RDS, an infant is treated with a PAP system for an
25   extended period of time.       If necessary, a separate resuscitation system is utilized to
     provide resuscitation. Subsequently, the use of the PAP system is resumed. This method
     results in inefficiencies caused by the switchover from one system to the other.          In
     particular, the patient interface is usually switched when going from one system to the
     other, which can be time consuming and disruptive to the infant. The preferred systems
30   and methods allow PAP or CPAP therapy for extended periods, along with intermittent
                                                  -1-

     resuscitation, in a quick and efficient manner and without requiring the patient interface
     to be changed.
              [0004] A preferred embodiment involves a combination infant positive airway
     pressure and resuscitation system, including an integrated inspiratory pressure device
 5   comprising a resuscitator and a humidifier. The resuscitator is capable of regulating a
     flow of breathing gas to a desired peak inspiration pressure. The humidifier humidifies
     the flow of breathing gas.         An expiratory pressure device is configured to receive
     expiratory gases from an expiratory circuit and regulate the expiratory gases to a positive
     end expiration pressure. An occlusion device is within the expiratory circuit upstream
10   from the expiratory pressure device and is configured to permit occlusion of the
     expiratory circuit at desired times such that the pressure within the inspiratory circuit rises
     to the peak inspiration pressure of the resuscitator.
              [0004]     In some embodiments of the above-described system, the resuscitator
     is separable from the humidifier. The resuscitator can be integrated with a first housing
15   and the humidifier can be integrated with a second housing. Some of the above-described
     system can include a flow generator that generates the flow of breathing gas. The flow
     generator can be integrated with the second housing.
              100051     A preferred embodiment involves a combination infant positive airway
     pressure and resuscitation system. The system includes an inspiratory pressure device
20   that outputs a flow of breathing gas at a desired peak inspiration pressure to an inspiratory
     circuit. A patient interface receives the flow of breathing gas from the inspiratory circuit,
     wherein the patient interface is configured to deliver the flow of breathing gas to an infant
     patient and receive expiratory gases from the patient. An expiratory circuit receives the
     expiratory gases from the patient interface.        An expiratory pressure device receives
25   expiratory gases from the expiratory circuit and regulates the expiratory gases to a
     positive end expiration pressure. An occlusion device is positioned within the expiratory
     circuit upstream from the expiratory pressure device. The occlusion device is configured
     to permit occlusion of the expiratory circuit at desired times such that the pressure within
     the inspiratory circuit rises to the peak inspiration pressure.

             [00061       Another preferred embodiment involves a combination infant positive
     airway pressure and resuscitation system. The system includes a supply of breathing gas
     and an inspiratory pressure device that receives a flow of breathing gas from the supply of
     breathing gas.    The inspiratory pressure device is capable of outputting the flow of
 5   breathing gas at a desired peak inspiration pressure to an inspiratory circuit. A patient
     interface receives the flow of breathing gas from the inspiratory circuit, wherein the
     patient interface is configured to deliver the flow of breathing gas to an infant patient and
     receive expiratory gases from the patient. An expiratory circuit receives the expiratory
     gases from the patient interface.       An oscillatory expiratory pressure device receives
10   expiratory gases from the expiratory circuit and regulates the expiratory gases to a mean
     positive end expiration pressure with pressure oscillations relative to the mean pressure.
     An occlusion device is positioned within the expiratory circuit and is configured to permit
     occlusion of the expiratory circuit at desired times such that the pressure within the
     inspiratory circuit rises to the peak inspiration pressure.
15           100071       In some arrangements of the above-described systems, the expiratory
     pressure device is or includes a water resistance valve, which can be adjustable to permit
     adjustment of the positive end expiration pressure. The occlusion device can be a manual
     push button valve or a clamp valve, among other possible valve types.               In some
     arrangements, the system can include a humidifier positioned within the inspiratory
20   circuit between the inspiratory pressure device and the patient interface. Preferably, the
     occlusion device is located less than 500 millimeters from the patient end of the
     expiratory circuit. In some arrangements, the expiratory circuit can include an expiratory
     hose coupled to the patient interface and the occlusion device can be located within the
     expiratory hose.
25           [00081      In some arrangements, a source of breathing gas is provided separately
     from the inspiratory pressure device, such as via a bottle or wall source.          In other
     arrangements, the source of breathing gas is ambient air and a flow of air is generated by
     a flow generator or blower. The blower can be provided in an integrated unit with the
     inspiratory pressure device (e.g., resuscitator) and the humidifier. In some arrangements,
30   the blower and humidifier are contained or associated with a first housing and the
                                                    -3-

     inspiratory pressure device (e.g., resuscitator) can be integrated with a second housing,
     which can be removed from the first housing. In some arrangements, the humidifier is
     contained or associated with a first housing and the inspiratory pressure device (e.g.,
     resuscitator) can be integrated with a second housing, which can be removed from the
 5   first housing. In some arrangements, the blower can be integrated with the humidifier and
     the inspiratory pressure device (e.g., resuscitator) can be a separate component.
              (00091     Another preferred embodiment involves a combination infant positive
     airway pressure and resuscitation system. The system includes a patient interface that
     receives expiratory gases from the patient and an expiratory circuit that receives the
10   expiratory gases from the patient interface.        An expiratory pressure device receives
     expiratory gases from the expiratory circuit and regulates the expiratory gases to a
     positive end expiration pressure. An occlusion device is positioned within the expiratory
     circuit upstream from the expiratory pressure device and is configured to permit occlusion
     of the expiratory circuit at desired times such that the pressure within the system rises
15   above the positive end expiration pressure.
              10010]     A preferred embodiment involves a breathing circuit for a combination
     infant positive airway pressure and resuscitation system.           The circuit includes an
     expiratory circuit that is configured for connection to a patient interface to receive
     expiratory gases from the patient interface and an inspiratory circuit that is configured for
20   connection to the patient interface to deliver a flow of breathing gas to the patient
     interface. An occlusion device is configured to permit occlusion of the expiratory circuit
     at desired times such that the pressure within the system rises above the positive end
     expiration pressure.
              100111     In some arrangements of the above-described circuits, the expiratory
25   circuit is further configured for connection to an expiratory pressure device that receives
     expiratory gases from the expiratory circuit and regulates the expiratory gases to a
     positive end expiration pressure.      The occlusion device can comprise a manual push
     button valve. The occlusion device can comprise a clamp. The occlusion device can be
     located less than 500 millimeters from the patient interface along the expiratory circuit.

     The occlusion device can be located in the expiratory circuit. In some embodiments, the
     occlusion device can be located in the patient interface.
             [00121      Another preferred embodiment involves a method of providing
     continuous positive airway pressure and resuscitation to an infant, including using an
 5   inspiratory pressure device to provide a flow of breathing gas, the inspiratory pressure
     device capable of generating a peak inspiratory pressure in the flow of breathing gas. The
     flow of breathing gas is supplied to an infant patient through a patient interface and
     expiratory gases are received from the infant patient through the patient interface.       A
     water resistance valve or other type of oscillatory resistance valve is utilized to vent the
10   flow of breathing gas and expiratory gases and maintain a mean positive end expiration
     pressure within the patient interface that is less than the peak inspiratory pressure. A
     resuscitation breath is provided to the infant patient by blocking the flow of breathing gas
     and expiratory gases between the patient interface and the water resistance valve such that
     the pressure within the patient interface increases to the peak inspiratory pressure.
15           [00131      In some applications, the method can include providing repeated
     resuscitation breaths to the infant patient by repeatedly alternating between blocking and
     allowing the flow of breathing gas and expiratory gases between the patient interface and
     the water resistance valve. In some applications, the blocking of the flow of breathing gas
     and expiratory gases between the patient interface and the water resistance valve can be
20   accomplished by actuating a push button occlusion valve or by clamping a portion of an
     expiratory tube. In some applications, the flow of breathing gas can be passed through a
     humidifier after the inspiratory pressure device and before the patient interface.      The
     positive end expiration pressure can be adjusted by adjusting a depth of an outlet of the
     flow of breathing gas and expiratory gases within a water reservoir of the water resistance
25   valve.

               DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
             [00221     Figure 1 illustrates a combination infant positive airway pressure
20   (PAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and resuscitation system, generally
     referred to by the reference numeral 10. The system 10 is capable of providing PAP or
     CPAP therapy to a neonate or an infant patient 12 for an extended period of time, while
     also permitting resuscitation breaths to be delivered to the infant patient 12 if or when
     necessary. Preferably, both the PAP or CPAP therapy and the resuscitation breaths are
25   delivered through a single patient interface 14 without requiring removal of the interface
     14 from the infant patient 12. The present system 10 is disclosed herein in the context of
     continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy; however, the system 10 could also
     provide other types or modes of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Accordingly,
     references to CPAP therapy herein are understood to also include other types of PAP
30   therapies, unless specifically noted otherwise.
                                                   -6-

 WO 2013/154439                                                            PCT/NZ2013/000062
             [0023]      The illustrated system 10 includes a source of breathing gas 20, which
     can be a gas cylinder (not shown), a wall supply 20, or any other suitable source of
     breathing gas. The breathing gas can be air, oxygen, a blend of air and oxygen, or any
     other suitable gas for use in respiratory therapy. The source of breathing gas 20 provides
 5   a flow of breathing gas at an initial feed pressure or within an initial feed pressure range.
     The flow rate of the flow of breathing gas can be adjusted by a suitable flow meter or gas
     blender 22 to a suitable level for the desired therapy.
             10024]      A suitable conduit, such as a gas supply line 24 supplies the flow of
     breathing gas to an inspiratory pressure device 26, which can be a resuscitator. More
10   preferably, the inspiratory pressure device 26 is an infant resuscitator, such as an infant
     resuscitator sold by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, the Assignee of the present application,
     under the NEOPUFF trademark.           Although referred to herein as a "resuscitator" for
     convenience, it is understood that the term can encompass other suitable types of
     inspiratory pressure devices capable of providing a breathing gas at a controlled output
15   pressure.
             [0025]      Preferably, the resuscitator 26 is capable of receiving a flow of
     breathing gas from the source of breathing gas 20 and outputting the flow of breathing gas
     at a controlled pressure greater than atmospheric pressure. In particular, the resuscitator
     26 can output the flow of breathing gas at a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), which
20   preferably can be up to about 75 cmH 20 or greater.           Preferably, the resuscitator 26
     includes an adjustment mechanism, such as an adjustment valve 28, which allows the PIP
     to be adjusted to a desired pressure level. Preferably, the resuscitator 26 also incorporates
     a pressure relief valve 30 that regulates a maximum pressure within the system 10. The
     pressure relief valve 30 can be adjustable such that the maximum system pressure can be
25   adjusted. For example, an adjustment range can be between about 5-70 cmH 20.              The
     pressure relief level can be factory set to a particular value, such as about 40 cmH 20, for
     example. However, in alternative arrangements, a separate pressure regulator could be
     provided within the system 10 to regulate the maximum system pressure. Such a pressure
     regulator is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,644,313, which is incorporated by reference
30   herein in its entirety. In embodiments having a blower unit, a pressure relief valve may
                                                   -7-

 WO 2013/154439                                                          PCT/NZ2013/000062
     not be necessary because the maximum achievable pressure of the system can be
     regulated by the blower unit. The blower unit can be designed so that the maximum
     pressure it can produce is lower than a desired pressure relief level.            In other
     embodiments, the maximum achievable pressure of the blower unit can be limited by
 5   software in the system.
             100261     The flow of breathing gas outputted from the resuscitator 26 preferably
     is delivered to an optional humidifier system 32 by a suitable conduit, such as an
     inspiratory tube or supply tube 34.      In some embodiments, the resuscitator and the
     humidifier system can be integrated into a single unit, as discussed below. The humidifier
10   system 32 provides humidity or vaporized liquid, such as water, to the flow of breathing
     gas received from the resuscitator 26 to output a flow of humidified breathing gas to the
     patient interface 14 through a suitable conduit, such as a supply tube 36. The humidifier
     system 32 can include a humidifier unit or humidifier 40 and a humidity chamber 42.
     The humidity chamber 42 holds a volume of liquid, such as water, which is heated by the
15   humidifier 40 to create a vapor within the humidity chamber 42 that is transferred to the
     flow of breathing gas. The humidity chamber 42 can be an auto-fill variety, in which a
     source of liquid 44 is connected to the humidity chamber 42 to refill the volume of liquid,
     as appropriate. A suitable humidifier 40 is the MR850 Humidifier sold by the Assignee
     of the present application. A suitable humidity chamber 42 is the MR225 or MR290
20   humidity chamber sold by the Assignee of the present application. The humidifier system
     32 can output a flow of humidified breathing gas at a desired temperature and absolute
     humidity, such as an optimal temperature of about 37 degrees Celsius and absolute
     humidity of about 44 mg/L, or within a desirable or acceptable range of the optimal
     temperature and absolute humidity.
25           [00271     The supply tube 36 can be a heated supply tube such that a temperature
     of the flow of breathing gas is maintained at an elevated level within the supply tube 36
     and to avoid or limit condensation within the supply tube 36 or patient interface 14. A
     heating element cable 46 can connect a heating element of the supply tube 36 to the
     humidifier 40 (or other power/heat source) to power the heating element. A sensor or
30   probe 48 can be coupled to the humidifier 40 and supply tube 36 to detect the temperature

      sensor 48 is spaced from the inlet end of the supply tube 36 and can be located at the

     48 to the humidifier 40. The humidifier 40 can utilize information from the sensor 48 to
 5   control the operating parameters of the humidifier 40, for example, to maintain the
     temperature and/or humidity of the flow of breathing gas within the supply tube 36 at a
     desirable level or range.
              100281      From the humidifier system 32, the flow of breathing gas is supplied to
     the patient interface 14, which can be any suitable type of interface capable of supplying a
10   breathing gas to the respiratory system of the patient. The illustrated interface 14 is a
     lateral nasal interface, which includes nasal cannula or nasal prongs that are inserted into
     the nostrils of the infant patient 12. In a lateral interface, the inlet and outlet are laterally
     spaced on opposing sides of the nasal cannula or prongs and a midline of the infant
     patient 12. Figure 1A illustrates an alternative nasal interface 14A, which can be referred
15   to as a midline nasal interface. The midline nasal interface 14A positions the inlet and the
     outlet of the interface 14A are located in line with the nasal cannula or nasal prongs and
     substantially along the midline of the infant patient 12.         The inlet and outlet of the
     interface 14A can be positioned side-by-side; however, in a preferred arrangement, the
     inlet and outlet are stacked one on top of the other. One suitable interface 14A is an
20   infant nasal tube or mask in combination with nasal prongs sold by the Assignee of the
     present application under the trademark FLEXITRUNK. However, other suitable patient
     interfaces 14 can also be used, such as a face mask that covers both the nose and mouth of
     the infant patient 12 (e.g., RD Series Infant Resuscitation Masks sold by the Assignee of
     the present application) or an appropriate interface device in combination with an
25   endotracheal tube.      An infant resuscitation mask is described in U.S. Patent No.
     7,341,059, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
             [00291       Preferred interfaces 14 provide a sealed system that delivers the flow
     of breathing gas to the infant patient 12 and receives expiratory gases from the patient 12.
     Preferably, the system 10 is a biased flow system in which breathing gas is constantly
30   flowing within the system 10 generally in a direction from the inlet of the patient interface
                                                   -9-

 WO 2013/154439                                                             PCT/NZ2013/000062
      14 to the outlet of the patient interface 14. Thus, the infant patient 12 can inhale a portion
     of the flow of breathing gas and the remainder is passed through the patient interface 14.
     Exhaled or expiratory gases can mix with the flow of breathing gas and exit the patent
     interface 14 along with the unused portion of the flow of breathing gas. For convenience,
 5   the gases exiting the patient interface 14 are referred to as expiratory gases or the flow of
     breathing gas, although it is understood that either or both of patient exhaled gases and
     unused breathing gases can be present at any particular point in time.
              100301      Expiratory gases flow from the patient interface 14 to an expiratory
     pressure device 60, which is configured to regulate the minimum pressure within the
10   system 10, preferably to a level above ambient or atmospheric pressure. Preferably, the
     expiratory pressure device 60 is connected to the patient interface 14 by a suitable
     conduit, such as an expiratory hose 62.         However, in an alternative arrangement, the
     expiratory pressure device 60 can be connected directly to or integrated with the patient
     interface 14.
15            10031]      Preferably, the expiratory pressure device 60 is configured to provide a
     minimum pressure or minimum backpressure within the system 10 and, in particular, at
     the patient interface 14, which can be referred to as the positive end expiration pressure
     (PEEP). In the illustrated system 10, the PEEP is equivalent to, or generally equivalent
     to, the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Accordingly, such a device can be
20   referred to as a CPAP generator. However, preferably, the expiratory pressure device 60
     is an oscillatory valve capable of providing pressure oscillations relative to a mean PEEP
     pressure. It is believed that such pressure oscillations are beneficial to the infant patent
      12 and may result in improved gas exchange and reduce the infant patient's 12 work of
     breathing.    Thus, an oscillatory pressure expiratory pressure device 60 is particularly
25   preferred.    One type of oscillating pressure expiratory pressure device 60 is a fluid
     resistance valve, in particular a liquid or water resistance valve, which is often referred to
     as a bubbler. In general, a water resistance valve delivers the expiratory gases to an outlet
     that is submerged in a water reservoir resulting in a resistance to the exit of the expiratory
     gases that is greater than that caused by ambient or atmospheric pressure and related to
30   the depth of the outlet relative to a surface of the water within the water reservoir. In
                                                    -10-

      some arrangements, the depth of the outlet is adjustable to allow the PEEP to be adjusted
     to a desired level.    One suitable bubbler is the Bubble CPAP generator sold by the
     Assignee of the present application. Additional details of a suitable bubbler device are
     described in U.S. Patent No. 6,805,120, which is incorporated by reference herein in its
 5   entirety.   Preferably, the bubbler (or other oscillatory pressure device) is capable of
     producing vibrations in the infant patient's chest at a frequency of between about 5-30
     Hz.
              100321     The illustrated system 10 also includes an occlusion device or
     occlusion valve 70 that is configured to selectively block the flow of gases within the
10   system 10 and preferably block the flow of expiratory gases, such as within the patient
     interface 14, expiratory tube 62 or expiratory pressure device 60.          Preferably, the
     occlusion valve 70 is located upstream of the expiratory pressure device 60 and
     downstream of the patient interface 14, such as within the expiratory tube 62. Preferably,
     the occlusion valve 70 is located at or near the patient interface 14, such as within about
15   500 millimeters or less of the patient interface 14. However, in other arrangements, the
     occlusion valve 70 can be integrated with the patient interface 14 or expiratory pressure
     device 60. The occlusion valve 70 is configured to block the exit of gases from the
     system 10 to a sufficient extent such that the gas pressure within the system 10 rises
     above the PEEP. With the exit of gases from the system 10 blocked, the inspiratory
20   pressure device 26 can increase the pressure in the system 10 preferably to or near the set
     PIP level. The occlusion valve 70 can completely or substantially completely block the
     flow of gas within the system 10, or can block or interrupt the flow to a sufficient extent
     to allow the inspiratory pressure device 26 or integrated unit 90 to raise the pressure
     toward the PIP. Preferably, the occlusion valve 70 can block the flow of gas within the
25   system 10 to a sufficient extent that the inspiratory pressure device 26 or integrated unit
     90 can raise the pressure within the system 10 to or substantially to the PIP pressure.
     However, to quickly and accurately achieve the PIP pressure, it is desirable that the
     occlusion valve 70 completely or substantially completely block the flow of gas within
     the system 10. Although described as a sealed system, it is understood that some leakage
30   of gas may occur from the system 10, such as between the patient interface 14 and the
                                                 -11-

 WO 2013/154439                                                             PCT/NZ2013/000062
     patient 12, for example. In addition, pressure losses may occur throughout the system 10
     such that the pressure is not the same throughout the entire system 10. Accordingly, it is
     understood that the PEEP or PIP may vary between the point of measurement and some
     other point within the system 10. Therefore, it is understood that discussion of specific
 5   pressures or pressure ranges herein, such as PIP or PEEP, incorporates a range of
     acceptable    variation, which can result from pressure leakage, pressure loss or
     measurement error.
              [00331      In operation, the occlusion valve 70 can be utilized to perform a
     resuscitation procedure or resuscitation therapy by raising the pressure within the system
10    10 to at or near the PIP pressure to deliver a resuscitation breath to the infant patient 12 in
     a manner similar to a conventional resuscitation procedure. However, advantageously,
     with the present system 10, resuscitation breaths can be provided to an infant patient 12
     that is undergoing CPAP therapy immediately and without requiring additional equipment
     or set-up.     Furthermore, the CPAP therapy can be immediately resumed after the
15   resuscitation procedure. Preferably, the resuscitation breaths can be provided through the
     same patient interface 14 as the CPAP therapy without removal or exchange of the
     interface and with breathing gases flowing in the same direction within the system 10 as
     the CPAP therapy. The occlusion valve 70 can be used to provide repeated resuscitation
     breaths to the infant patient 12 at or near PIP pressure with intervening periods of PEEP.
20   The resuscitation breaths delivered by use of the occlusion valve 70 can be at any suitable
     rate, such as about 40-60 breaths per minute. The relative duration of the resuscitation
     breath time at PIP pressure to the exhalation time at PEEP can be any suitable ratio, such
     as 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, or any value in between. The resuscitation procedure typically
     lasts for less than 30 minutes or less than 15 minutes. Often, the resuscitation procedure
25   lasts between about 3-5 minutes.            Thus, the present system 10 is particularly
     advantageous in reducing the switchover time between CPAP therapy and resuscitation
     therapy, which avoids delay in providing resuscitation therapy once it is recognized as
     necessary or desirable.
              [00341      The occlusion valve 70 can be of any suitable arrangement or structure
30   to selectively accomplish a partial or complete occlusion of gas flow within the system
                                                   -12-

 WO 2013/154439                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000062
      10. Preferably, the occlusion valve 70 allows the cycling between an occluded or closed
     position and an open position at a suitable rate, such as the rates described herein. In
     some arrangements, the occlusion valve 70 is a manual valve that is operated by manually
     by a caregiver. Accordingly, preferably the occlusion valve 70 facilitates repeated cycling
 5   between the open and closed position multiple times per minute.
              [00351     For example, Figure 2 illustrates a push button valve arrangement 70
     having a manually operated push button 72 that actuates a valve body 74 movable
     between an open position and a closed position. The valve body 74 can simply move into
     or out of a flow passage P of the system 10 (linear movement or translation) to selectively
10   allow and occlude gas flow within the system 10.           In some embodiments, the valve
     arrangement can include a safety feature to help prevent accidental actuation.             For
     example, the push button may be lockable in the open position by rotating the push button
     a quarter turn. In order to use the valve arrangement, the user can rotate the push button
     to unlock before actuating. Preferably, the valve body 74 is biased to the open position by
15   a biasing member, such as a spring 76, so that gas flow is normally unobstructed. The
     valve body 74 can be movable to the closed position (e.g., using the manual push button
     72) when it is desired to deliver a resuscitation breath at PIP. In other arrangements, the
     valve 70 could be a rotatable valve, such as a stopcock. Figure 3 illustrates another
     possible occlusion valve arrangement 70, in which a compliant section of tubing 78 that
20   has sufficient resilience to remain open in the absence of an external force (Figure 3A),
     but can be collapsed to a closed position in response to an external squeezing force
     (Figure 3B), such as a force applied by a clamping mechanism 79. In still other
     arrangements, the valve 70 could be automatically movable (e.g., electronically actuated).
              [0036]     As described, the occlusion valve 70 can be positioned in any suitable
25   location within the system 10. The system 10 can be considered to have an inspiratory
     circuit and an expiratory circuit. In the illustrated arrangement, the inspiratory circuit can
     include all or portions of the source of breathing gas 20, the gas supply line 24, the
     inspiratory pressure device 26, the supply tube 34, the humidifier system 32, and the
     supply tube 36. The expiratory circuit can include all or portions of the expiratory tube
30   62 and the expiratory pressure device 60. A portion of the patient interface 14 can be
                                                   -13-

 WO 2013/154439                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000062
     predominantly occupied by a flow of inspiratory breathing gas prior to inspiration by the
     infant patient 12 or prior to availability to the infant patient 12, while another portion of
     the patient interface 14 can be predominantly occupied by a flow of expiratory gas
     exhaled by the infant patient 12 or that has bypassed the infant patient 12. Accordingly,
 5   the patient interface 14 can be considered to form a part of each of the inspiratory circuit
     and the expiratory circuit. A portion of the patient interface 14 can also include a mixture
     of inspiratory gas and expiratory gas, at least for certain time durations, and may not be
     considered part of either of the inspiratory circuit or the expiratory circuit or may be
     considered as a part of each.
10           [00371      The various components of the system 10, including those described
     above, can be arranged and/or mounted in any suitable manner.             Some or all of the
     components can be stationary (e.g., wall mounted) or movable.              In the illustrated
     arrangement, some of the components are mounted to a support pole 80, which includes a
     base portion 82 having a plurality of rollers or casters 84 to provide mobility. A suitable
15   pole 80 is the 900MR292 or 900MR293 pole sold by the Assignee of the present
     application.    In the illustrated arrangement, the inspiratory pressure device 26, the
     humidifier system 32 and the expiratory pressure device 60 are mounted to the support
     pole 80. Although not specifically illustrated, the source of water 44 preferably is also
     supported by the support pole 80. In other arrangements, some of the components could
20   be mounted on another support pole 80. The source of breathing gas 20 and the flow
     meter or gas blender 22 can be mobile or can be stationary (e.g., wall mounted). In one
     arrangement, for example, the resuscitator 26 can be integrated with an infant warmer,
     such as the 900 Series infant warmers sold by the Assignee of the present invention.
             [0038]      To set up the system 10 for use, the components can be gathered and
25   mounted to the support pole 80 or other support structure, if necessary or desired. The
     components can be connected to a power source, if necessary, and turned on. The
     inspiratory pressure device 26 can be coupled to the source of breathing gas 20 through
     the flow meter or gas blender 22 by the gas supply line 24. The humidifier system 32 can
     be coupled to the inspiratory pressure device 26 by the supply tube 34. The source of
30   water 44 can be coupled to the humidity chamber 42. The patient interface 14 can be

     coupled to the humidifier system 32 by the supply tube 36.           The expiratory pressure
     device 60 can be coupled to the patient interface 14 by the expiratory tube 62. The
     occlusion valve 70 can be integrated into the expiratory tube 62; however, the occlusion
     valve 70 can also be assembled to the expiratory tube 62 (such as intermediate two tube
  5  portions of the expiratory tube 62) or otherwise assembled in a suitable location within
     the system 10, as described above.
             [00391      If necessary, the expiratory pressure device 60 can be filled with a
     liquid, such as about 500 milliliters of water. If adjustable, the expiratory pressure device
     60 can be initially adjusted to a maximum pressure level (maximum PEEP).                  The
 10  humidifier system 32 can be adjusted to a desired temperature and absolute humidity,
     such as about 37 degrees Celsius and 44 mg/L. The flow meter or gas blender 22 can be
     adjusted to a desired flow rate, preferably less than 15 liters per minute (LPM). In
     embodiments having a blower unit, the flow meter or gas blender can be integrated with
     the blower unit. More preferably, the flow rate is adjusted to between about 6-8 LPM.
15           [0040]     If necessary or desirable, the pressure relief valve 30 of the inspiratory
     pressure device 26 can be adjusted to a suitable pressure relief level. The pressure relief
     valve 30 can be factory set to a pressure relief level, such as about 40 cmH 20. The
     pressure relief valve 30 can be set to a lower level, such as between about 5-70 cmH 2O
     and, more preferably, 30-40 cmH 2 0. To set the level of the pressure relief valve 30, the
20   PIP adjustment of the inspiratory pressure device 26 is adjusted to a maximum level. The
     patient interface 14 can be blocked or connected to a test lung apparatus, such as the
     RD020-01 test lung apparatus sold by the Assignee of the present application.            The
     occlusion valve 70 can be actuated to allow the pressure within the system 10 to rise to
     the pressure relief level, which can be adjusted to a desired level. With the occlusion
25   valve 70 still actuated, the PIP can be adjusted to a desirable level, preferably less than
     about 75 cmH 20.     More preferably, the PIP is between about 10-40 cmH 2 0 or 20-30
     cmH 20. In one application, the PIP pressure is adjusted to about 20 cmH 20, using the PIP
     valve 28. The occlusion valve 70 can be moved to an open position such that the system
     pressure is reduced to the PEEP value as determined by the expiratory pressure device 60.
30   The PEEP level can be adjusted to a desirable pressure, such as less than about 25 cmH 2 0,

 WO 2013/154439                                                            PCT/NZ2013/000062
     by adjusting a depth of the gas outlet within the water reservoir. Preferably, the PEEP
     level is adjusted to less than about 15 cmH 20, less than about 9 cmH 20 or less than about
     5 cmH 20. In one application, the PEEP level is set to about 5 cmH 20. If necessary, the
     test lung apparatus can be removed and the system 10 is ready for use.
 5           [0041]      To use the system 10, the patient interface 14 can be applied to an
     infant patient 12 following an appropriate methodology. For example, a face mask can be
     positioned over the nose and mouth of the infant patient 12 and, if desired, held in place
     by hand, a strap or other retention device. If an endotracheal tube is used, the interface 14
     or portion of the interface 14 can be coupled to the endotracheal tube. In the illustrated
10   arrangement, the nasal prongs can be coupled to the nasal mask or tube and the nasal
     prongs can be inserted into the nostrils of the infant patient 12. The nasal mask 14 can be
     held in place by any suitable retention mechanism, such as a chin strap or head strap.
             [0042]      Once the patient interface 14 is in place on the infant patient 12, the
     CPAP therapy can be commenced.           A flow of breathing gas is supplied to the infant
15   patient 12 by the patient interface 14 at the CPAP or PEEP level, as regulated by the
     expiratory pressure device 60. As discussed, preferably the expiratory pressure device 60
     is configured to produce pressure oscillations within the system 10, which is believed to
     have an improved therapeutic effect on the infant patient 12.        The CPAP therapy can
     continue for a desired period of time.
20           100431      If necessary or desirable, resuscitation therapy can be administered. As
     described above, the occlusion valve 70 can be actuated to block the exit of expiratory
     gases from the system 10 and cause the pressure within the system 10 to rise toward or to
     the PIP pressure to deliver a resuscitation breath to the infant patient 12. The occlusion
     valve 70 can be moved to an open position, or allowed to return to an open position, to
25   return the system to the PEEP. In some arrangements, the actuation of the occlusion
     valve 70 is accomplished manually. The actuation and release of the occlusion valve 70
     can be repeated at a desired frequency, such as between about 40-60 breaths per minute,
     for a suitable duration, such as about 3-5 minutes. However, if necessary or desirable, the
     duration of the resuscitation therapy can be up to 15-30 minutes, or longer.           At the
30   conclusion of the resuscitation therapy, the system 10 can automatically return to the
                                                  -16-

     therapy can be immediately commenced on an infant patient 12 that is undergoing CPAP
     therapy without requiring the set-up of additional equipment and without requiring the
     replacement of the patient interface 14.
  5           [00441     Figures 4 and 5 illustrate a modification of the system 10 of Figure 1.
     Because the system of Figures 4 and 5 is similar to the system 10 of Figure 1 in many
     respects, the same reference numbers are used to indication the same or corresponding
     components.     In the system of Figures 4 and 5, the resuscitator 26 (or other inspiratory
     pressure device) is integrated with the humidifier 32 in a resuscitator/humidifier unit 90
 10  (hereinafter "integrated unit 90"). In addition, preferably, the source of breathing gas 20
     is or includes ambient air from an environment adjacent the integrated unit 90. Therefore,
     the integrated unit 90 preferably comprises a flow generator or flow source, such as a fan,
     gas pump or blower 92 (Figure 5), which generates a flow of air. In some embodiments,
     however, the integrated unit 90 can be connected to a source of breathing gas, such as a
15   gas cylinder or a wall supply, instead of or in addition to the flow generator. In some
     arrangements, the system can utilize supplemental breathing gases (oxygen or other
     suitable respiratory gases) that are blended in combination with air. However, in many
     arrangements, only air is used and the source of breathing gas (reference number 20 in
     Figure 1) can be omitted.
20            [00451     In the illustrated arrangement, the integrated unit 90 generates a flow
     of breathing gas (e.g., air) and outputs the flow of breathing gas at a controlled pressure
     greater than atmospheric pressure to the humidifier, which humidifies the flow of
     breathing gas. The flow of humidified breathing gas is delivered to the patient 12 via the
     supply tube 36 and patient interface 14. Exhaled and unused gases are delivered to the
25   expiratory pressure device 60 via the expiratory hose 62. The expiratory pressure device
     60 can provide a minimum pressure or minimum backpressure within the system and, in
     particular, at the patient interface 14 preferably to or near the PEEP pressure.         The
     occlusion valve 70 can be used to block the flow of breathing gas such that the inspiratory
     pressure device 26 can increase the pressure in the system preferably to or near the set PIP
                                                  -17-

 WO 2013/154439                                                           PCT/NZ2013/000062
     level. The system of Figures 4 and 5 preferably operates in substantially the same manner
     as described above with respect to the system 10 of Figure 1.
             [00461      With reference to Figure 5, in addition to the blower 92, the integrated
     unit 90 preferably includes a filter 94 upstream from the blower 92. The filter 94 is of a
 5   suitable arrangement to separate impurities or other undesirable elements from the
     ambient air that is used to generate the flow of air within the system. The filter 94 and the
     blower 92 preferably can be coupled to or contained within a housing 96 that contains
     portions of the humidifier 40 and supports the humidifier chamber 42. The pressure
     adjustment valve 28 and a manometer 98, or other pressure gauge or measurement device,
10   can be coupled to or contained within a housing 100 that is separate from the housing 96.
     Preferably, the housing 100 can be removable from the housing 96. When the housing
      100 is removed, the integrated unit 90 can be used as a blower 92 and humidification
     system 32 without the resuscitation feature. In the illustrated arrangement, the housing
      100 defines or contains a conduit 102 for delivering the flow of breathing gas from the
15   blower 92 to the humidification chamber 42 of the humidifier system 32.            When the
     housing is removed, an auxiliary conduit (not shown) can be utilized in place of the
     conduit 102.    Alternatively, an auxiliary conduit can be integrated with or otherwise
     incorporated with the housing 96 that is utilized when the housing 100 is removed. A
     valve arrangement could be configured to automatically switch between the conduit 102
20   and the auxiliary conduit depending on the presence or absence of the housing 100.
             100471      With reference to Figure 6, in another modification of the systems of
     Figure 1 and Figures 4 and 5, the flow generator (hereinafter "blower 92") is integrated
     with the humidifier 40 of the humidification system 32. However, unlike the system of
     Figures 4 and 5, the resuscitator 26 is a separate system component from the humidifier
25   40, humidification chamber 42 or the entire humidifier system 32. Thus, in the system of
     Figure 6, the blower 92 is connected to the resuscitator 26 via the supply line 24 to deliver
     the flow of air (or other breathing gas) from the blower 92 to the resuscitator 26. The
     flow of air then flows from the resuscitator 26 to the humidification chamber 42 of the
     humidifier system 32 and to the patient 12 as described above. If the resuscitator 26 is
30   not necessary or desired, the blower 92 can be connected to the humidification chamber
                                                  -18-

    42 of the humidifier system 32, without passing through the resuscitator 26, via a suitable
    internal or external auxiliary conduit, as described above.
