   FIELD OF INVENTION
 5
   The present invention relates to wave generating systems. The invention
   particularly relates to wave generating systems that facilitate modulation of a
   wake generated by the system.
10 SUMMARY OF INVENTION
   According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a wave generating
   system comprising:
          a semi-submerged water displacement hull adapted to travel along a
15 travel path within a wave pool, thereby generating a wake; and
          a wake modulator adapted to modulate the wake;
          wherein at least one of the travel path of the hull relative to the wake
   modulator and the travel of the wave modulator relative to the wake generated by
   the hull is controlled to effect the modulation of the wake.
20
   In one embodiment, the wake modulator comprises contours of a floor of the
   wave pool and wherein the travel path of the hull is non-parallel with the
   contours. The travel path of the hull may be at a predetermined angle relative to
   the contours, or may follow a meandering path relative to the contours.
25
   In certain embodiments, the hull comprises a panel extending from the stern of
   the hull. In other embodiments, the hull is rotatably mounted relative to a
   carriage.
30 In another embodiment, the wake modulator comprises at least another hull
   adapted to travel along a travel path within the wave pool, thereby generating

                                            2
   another wake, and wherein modulation of the wake comprises an interaction
   between the wake and the other wake.
   The travel paths of the hulls may be substantially identical, and the hulls
 5 disposed at a distance from one another such that wakes generated by a prior
   hull are superimposed by wakes of a following hull.
   The travel paths of the hull and the other hull may alternatively be towards one
   another such that the wake and the other wake intersect to form a bulge that
10 advanced laterally across the wave pool.
   The travel paths of the hull and the other hull may alternatively be in the same
   direction on opposing sides of the wave pool such that the wake and the other
   wake intersect to form a concave wave front disposed between the travel paths.
15
   In a further embodiment, the wake modulator comprises a submerged foil
   adapted to travel along a travel path parallel to the travel path of the hull and at a
   predetermined distance preceding the wake generated by the hull such that the
   foil forms a trough that modulates the wake.
20
   In yet another embodiment, the wake modulator comprises a submerged reef
   adapted to travel along a travel path parallel to the travel path of the hull and at a
   predetermined distance behind the hull such that the wake generated by the hull
   travel over the reef as the reef advances, thereby causing the wake to break over
25 the reef.
   The submerged reef may comprise an adjustable panel that can be adjusted
   relative to the wake of the hull.
30 Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word
   "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood
   to imply the inclusion of a stated step or element or integer or group of steps or

                                             3
   elements or integers, but not the exclusion of any other step or element or
   integer or group of steps, elements or integers. Thus, in the context of this
   specification, the term "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense and thus should
   be understood as meaning "including principally, but not necessarily solely".

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
   Hereinafter, this specification will describe the present invention according to the
   preferred embodiments. It is to be understood that limiting the description to the
15 preferred embodiments of the invention is merely to facilitate discussion of the
   present invention and it is envisioned without departing from the scope of the
   appended claims.
   The present invention relates to recreational wave pools. The purpose of this
20 invention is to change wave shape to suit various aspects of surfing
   performance.
   To efficiently transform wave shape, the present invention provides for at least
   one of the following:
25
           1. Manipulates swell size, speed and direction, by controlling the position
   of a semi-submerged water displacement member (hereafter the "hull") relative to
   the contours of the pool floor;

                                             6
           2. Produces overlapping wakes, by controlling the relative position, speed
   and configuration of multiple hulls;
           3.  Manipulates water level, by controlling the position of a submerged
 5 water displacement member (hereafter: the "foil") relative to an advancing wake;
   and
           4. Manipulates surf zone bathymetry, by controlling the position of a wave
   obstruction member (hereafter: the "reef") relative to the water surface.
10
   Figure 1 depicts a system 100 in which a hull 105 moving along a travel path 110
   proximate the edge of a pool 115, in a direction that is parallel to the contours
   120 of the pool floor, such that the resulting wake 125 advances at a constant
   angle, depicted here as 45 degrees to the contours 120, upon which the wake is
15 designed to break. Figure 2 depicts a similar system 200 having the same
   elements as Figure 1, except that the travel path 210 of the hull 205 is now five
   degrees off parallel to the contours 220 of the pool floor, resulting in a five degree
   reduction in the angle of its wake 225, which now advances at an angle of 40
   degrees, instead of 45 degrees, as depicted in Figure 1. The angle of the travel
20 path 210 of the hull 205 may advantageously be modified to modulate the angle
   of the wake 225 relative to the contours 220 of the pool floor.
   Figure 3 depicts an alternative system 300 having the same elements as Figure
   2, except that the hull 305 now follows a meandering path 310, resulting in the
25 angle of its wake 325 changing in response to the various directions followed by
   the hull 305. Apart from producing waves that continually change shape, the
   meandering path 310 increases wave power by compressing the wave front each
   time it turns toward the side that releases the wake 325.

                                             7
   Referring to Figures 4 and 5, a vertical panel 430 is suspended longitudinally
   from one side of the hull 405, to prevent a wake 425' from forming on that side of
   the hull 405, when its path takes it away from the pool wall 415, which would
   otherwise prevent the desired wake 425 from forming. Figure 4 depicts the
 5 undesirable occurrence of the wake 425' bouncing off the wall 415 of the pool.
   Figure 5 depicts the hull 405 with a vertical panel 430 suspended from one side
   and extending beyond the stern of the vessel.
   In another, as depicted in Figure 6, the hull 605 is supported by a carriage 635,
10 which allows it to pivot on the horizontal plane, so it can be aligned with the
   direction of its movement through the water along the travel path 610. Figure 6
   depicts the relationship between the alignment of the hull 605, the travel path 610
   it follows and the carriage 635 supporting it.
15 The systems of Figures 2-6, described above, may further provide for altering the
   depth of the hull while it is being driven along the travel path such that the
   magnitude of its wake increases or decreases accordingly. Similarly, the systems
   may provide for alteration of the width of the hull while it is being driven along the
   travel path such that the magnitude of its wake increases or decreases
20 accordingly. In other embodiments the systems may provide for increasing or
   decreasing the speed of the hull, such that the magnitude of its wake increases
   or decreases accordingly. A plurality of hulls may also be driven along the travel
   path on side of a channel, with successive hulls moving at different speeds, such
   that their wakes vary in size and speed.
25
   In certain embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of hulls is driven in
   close succession along the side of a channel, such that key differences in their
   size, draft and trim angle result in variously angled wakes, which subsequently
   intersect to produce favourable effects on the resulting wave. Figure 7 depicts
30 two hulls 705, which are traveling along the same path, but are producing

                                               8
   differently angled wakes 725, which subsequently intersect as they enter shallow
   water.
   As depicted      in Figures 8 and 9, the plurality of hulls 805, 805' are
 5 advantageously driven along the wall of a pool 815 with the hulls 805, 805'
   spaced precisely one wavelength apart, such that the second wake 825' from the
   preceding hull 805 merges with the first wake 825" of the following hull 805'.
   Figure 8 depicts a single hull 805 producing a train of two wakes 825 and 825'.
   Figure 9 depicts two hulls 805, 805' advancing along the same path, with each
10 hull 805, 805' producing a train of two wakes, such that the first wake 825" of the
   trailing hull 805' becomes aligned with the second wake 825' of the preceding
   hull 805. By overlapping the wake trains of multiple hulls, the wave size relative
   to energy input may be increased, while simultaneously maximising their rate of
   production, since the wave length of the preceding hull's wake determines how
15 close the next hull can trail, without its wake unduly distorting the preceding hull's
   wake.
   In certain embodiments, the speed of the hulls may be controlled by a
   programmable logic computer, such that the distance between successive wave
20 generating bodies maintains the correlation with wave length, as the resulting
   waves build in size and their wave lengths increase.
   In other embodiments, as depicted in Figures 10 and 11, two hulls 1005, 1005'
   are driven toward each other, along one side 1015 of a channel, such that their
25 wakes 1025, 1025' intersect to form a bulge 1040, which advances laterally
   across the pool, directly toward the shallows, where it forms into a peak, as it
   breaks.
   In another embodiment, as depicted in figure 12, two hulls 1205, 1205' are driven
30 along opposing sides 1215, 1215' of a channel, in the same direction, such that

                                              9
   their wakes 1225, 1225' intersect in the middle of the channel, where they
   converge to form a concave wave 1240 front that advances along the centre line
   of the channel for as long as said wakes 1225, 1225' continue to intersect.
 5 In a further embodiment, as depicted in Figures 13 and 14, a submerged foil
   1350 is driven along a horizontal path 1355, in front of a wake 1325 such that its
   effect upon the surface contours of the water converge with the wake 1325. The
   method of propulsion could be self-contained, as with a submarine, or via a track
   fixed to the pool floor. Figure 14 depicts a cross-section A-B of the submerged
10 foil 1350, followed by a trough 1360, which affects the wake 1325, by increasing
   the depth of its trough 1365 and the height of its crest 1370.
   In another embodiment, as depicted in Figures 15 and 16, a hull 1505 produces
   a wake 1525, which forms into a breaking wave 1525' as it crosses over a reef
15 1550 driven along a parallel path 1575. The wake 1525 intersects the path 1575
   of a reef 1550, for example moving along a track, maintaining its position below
   the advancing wake 1525. Figure 16 depicts the cross-section A-B, identified in
   Figure 15, showing the reef 1550, causing the wake 1525 to break in a manner
   determined by the shape and proximity of the reef 1550.
20
   In an alternative embodiment, a hull produces a wake, which forms into a
   breaking wave as it crosses over a reef in the form of a submerged panel, which
   is driven along a path that is parallel to the path followed by said hull. Figure 17
   depicts this arrangement, viewed from above, in which a hull 1705 produces a
25 wake 1725 that intersects the path of a submerged panel 1750, which maintains
   its position below the advancing wake 1725, by moving along rails 1780 fixed to
   the pool floor. To minimise drag, the position of the submerged panel 1750 is flat
   with respect to its direction of movement. In cross-section, the submerged panel
   1750 is curved, with its convex surface facing upward. The submerged panel
30 1750 is secured to a carriage 1785 by struts, which are independently

                                            10
   extendable, to allow for the submerged panel 1750 to be repositioned relative to
   the surface. Figure 18 depicts the cross-section A-B, identified in Figure 17,
   showing the submerged panel 150, causing the wave to break 1725' in a manner
   determined by the shape and proximity of the panel 1750. Figures 19 and 20
 5 depict the same cross-section, now showing how the submerged panel 1750 can
   be repositioned at different depths and different angles, to change the shape of
   the wave 1725' breaking above it. In Figure 19, the submerged panel 1750 has
   been rotated 10 degrees to steepen the incline, which causes the wave 1725' to
   break more abruptly, increasing its height and the breadth of its plunge. Figure
10 20 depicts the submerged panel 1750 raised as a unit to make the water
   shallower, so the wave 1725' breaks even more abruptly, creating an even
   rounder concave in the cross-sectional profile of the plunging wave 1725'.
   Unless the context requires otherwise or specifically stated to the contrary,
15 integers, steps or elements of the invention recited herein as singular integers,
   steps or elements clearly encompass both singular and plural forms of the recited
   integers, steps or elements.
   It will be appreciated that the foregoing description has been given by way of
20 illustrative example of the invention and that all such modifications and variations
   thereto as would be apparent to persons of skill in the art are deemed to fall
   within the broad scope and ambit of the invention as herein set forth.
