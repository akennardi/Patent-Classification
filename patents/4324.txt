        METHOD OF MAKING AN ABSORBENT COMPOSITE AND ABSORBENT

 5                                         BACKGROUND
   [001]   The present application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application
   Serial No. 61/801,620, filed on March 15, 2013 (pending), which disclosure is hereby
   incorporated by reference for all purposes and made a part of the present disclosure.
10 [002]   The present disclosure relates generally to an absorbent composite (or absorbent core
   laminate) and a method of making an absorbent composite. The present invention also relates
   generally to disposable absorbent articles employing absorbent composites and methods of
   making same. Such disposable absorbent articles include diapers, training pants, adult
   incontinence products, bodily exudates absorbing products, feminine hygiene products, and
15 other absorbent products (collectively "disposable absorbent articles" or "disposable
   absorbent products").
   [003]   Disposable absorbent articles typically employ three basic structural elements: a
   topsheet that forms the inner surface, a backsheet that forms the outer surface, and an
   absorbent core that is interposed between the topsheet and the backsheet. The topsheet is
20 designed to allow liquid to pass from outside the absorbent article through the topsheet and
   into the absorbent core. The topsheet may be made out of a range of liquid and vapor
   permeable hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials. The permeability of the topsheet can be
   increased by using surface activation agents ("surfactants"). Surfactants lower the surface
   energy or the contact angle of the liquid-solid interface and facilitate the liquid's passage
25 through the topsheet.
   [004]   The backsheet is designed to prevent fluid from passing from the absorbent core
   through the backsheet and out of the absorbent article. The backsheet may be made out of an
   impermeable film that extends the full width of the article or a combination of cloth-like
   material and impermeable film. The backsheet may also have vapor transmission properties
30 ("breathability") that allow vapor to pass through the backsheet without releasing fluid stored
   in the absorbent core. The backsheet may also be made from a liquid impermeable but vapor
   transmitable non-woven material such as spunbond, melt-blow, spun-bond ("SMS"); spun
   bond, melt-blown, melt-blown, spun-bond ("SMMS"); micro, nano, or splitable fibers; spun
   melt or spun laced; carded; and the like.

    WO 2014/145312                                                                PCT/US2014/030051
   [005]    The absorbent core is designed to contain and distribute fluid that passes through the
   topsheet. A typical absorbent core is made out of a high or super absorbent polymer (SAP)
   stabilized by an absorbent matrix. SAP is commonly made out of materials such as polyvinyl
   alcohol, polyacrylates, various grafted starches, and cross-linked sodium polyacrylate. SAP
 5 can be in the form of particles, fibers, foams, web, spheres, agglomerates of regular or
   irregular shapes, and film. The absorbent matrix is typically a de-fiberized wood pulp or
   similar material. The absorbent matrix is very bulky relative to the topsheet, backsheet, and
   SAP. Most of a diaper's thickness comes from the absorbent core.
   [006]    Increasingly, consumers of absorbent articles are demanding thinner absorbent
10 articles. To meet these demands, manufactures are decreasing the thickness of absorbent
   articles by decreasing the amount of absorbent matrix used in absorbent cores. Although the
   resulting absorbent cores are thinner, they suffer in performance. As the amount of absorbent
   matrix is reduced, it is less effective in stabilizing the SAP - preventing the SAP from
   migrating within the absorbent core. As SAP migrates within the core, the absorbent core
15 loses its effectiveness and no longer has uniform absorbency. For example, SAP that is not
   contained tends to bunch up in wetted areas and is inefficient for handling subsequent
   discharges.
   [007]    Manufacturers have attempted to solve this problem by creating small, individual SAP
   pockets or by gluing the SAP. These solutions, however, have been largely unsuccessful. The
20 SAP pockets merely limit the migration to movement within the pockets. However, because
   there is still a movement of the particles, the absorbent core does not exhibit uniform
   absorbency. Gluing the SAP stabilizes the SAP, but results in an uncomfortably stiff
   absorbent core and a loss in the SAP's swelling capacity. Applicants have also discovered
   that may of the methods to contain the SAP can negatively impact SAP and the absorbent
25 core's capacity to receive and distribute intake.
   [008]    Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved absorbent product that continues the
   trend of decreasing product thickness, while minimizing product stiffness and otherwise
   exhibiting excellent absorbency and fluid handling properties. The specification of U.S. Pat.
   No. 8,148,598, which is commonly assigned and designates at least one common inventor as
30 the present application, describes a prior improvement to the state of the art and serves as
   background to the present disclosure. The '598 patent document is hereby incorporated by
   reference, in its entirety, for all purposes and made a part of the present disclosure. The
   present disclosure may, in one respect, be regarded as continuing and furthering the effort to
   provide improved absorbent products and methods of manufacturing.

    WO 2014/145312                                                                 PCT/US2014/030051
                                           BRIEF SUMMARY
   [009]    In one aspect, the disclosure provides improved absorbent composites and methods of
 5 making the composite. Embodiments are disclosed that focus on the composition or
   arrangement of components of the absorbent composite. In one embodiment, an absorbent
   core composite for a disposable absorbent article has a first fabric, a body side second fabric,
   and a plurality of aggregates of superabsorbent particles (SAP) situated between the first
   fabric second fabric. About each of a plurality of the SAP aggregates, an arrangement of
10 spaced apart bond sites secure the second fabric to the first fabric and form a pocket in which
   the SAP aggregate is secured between the first fabric and the second fabric. The body side
   second fabric is a bulky nonwoven including fibers that entangle at least some particles in the
   SAP aggregate. In preferred embodiments, a pattern of adhesive may be preapplied on the
   first fabric (e.g., a pattern having a plurality of intersecting loops defining open regions free
15 of adhesive).
   [0010] In another aspect, a method is disclosed for manufacturing an absorbent composite
   laminate for a disposable absorbent article. The method entails conveying a first fabric into
   position to receive superabsorbent particles (SAP) and depositing SAP on the first fabric to
   provide discrete aggregates of SAP. A second fabric of a bulky nonwoven is then conveyed
20 and positioning relative the first fabric such that fibers of the bulky nonwoven entangle
   particles in a top layer of particles of the SAP aggregate. This secures, at least partly, the SAP
   aggregate therebetween. The first and second fabric are then bonded at a network of bond
   sites to form an elongated laminate having a plurality of pockets of SAP aggregate, whereby
   each pocket is defined by bond sites positioned about a SAP aggregate and securing the
25 second fabric to the first fabric; and conveying the elongated laminate, whereby the bulky
   nonwoven and pockets inhibit SAP particle migration from said pockets. In preferred
   embodiments, the bond sites are bond points and/or the bond sites form diamond shaped
   pockets and a corresponding grid without any direct straight line paths to the side margins.
   [0011] A disposable absorbent article is also disclosed having a chassis body defined by a
30 first end margin and a second end margin longitudinally spaced from the first end margin, the
   end margins partially defining front and back waist regions that are fastenable about a waist
   of a user. The article further includes a topsheet, a backsheet, and an absorbent composite
   disposed between the topsheet and backsheet. The absorbent composite includes a first
   fabric, a second fabric bonded to said first fabric, absorbent particles secured between the
35 first and second fabric. The first fabric is intermittently attached to the second fabric to define
                                                      3

    WO 2014/145312                                                                PCT/US2014/030051
   a plurality of pockets situated between the first fabric and the second fabric and containing an
   aggregate of superabsorbent particles (SAP), wherein discontinuous and spaced apart bond
   sites secure the first fabric with the second fabric. The second fabric is a bulky nonwoven
   material positioned on a bodyside of the absorbent composite and over the SAP aggregate
 5 such that fibers of the bulky nonwoven entangle superabsorbent particles, wherein the SAP
   aggregate is free of an absorbent matrix in a middle portion extending from beneath the bulky
   nonwoven material.
   [0012] In another aspect, an absorbent composite is disclosed having a bulky nonwoven
   substrate, a top fabric bonded with the bulky nonwoven substrate, and a layer of
10 superabsorbent particles (SAP) secured therebetween. Furthermore, hot melt adhesive is
   interspersed with the SAP to mutually secure the SAP with the bulky nonwoven substrate and
   top fabric. The top fabric may be tissue material in preferred embodiments.
   [0013] In yet another aspect, a method is disclosed for manufacturing an absorbent
   composite. The method entails conveying a first substrate of a nonwoven material, delivering
15 a mixture of superabsorbent particles (SAP) with hot melt adhesive particles onto the
   conveyed first substrate, and, as the first substrate with the mixture is conveyed, applying
   heat to the first substrate, thereby activating the hot melt adhesive particles and bonding the
   SAP with the hot melt particles and the first substrate. A second substrate is then applied
   atop the first substrate and SAP layer bonded therewith.
20 [0014] Various embodiments are disclosed in which aggregates of absorbent particles are
   strategically located and/or constituted between a top layer and a bottom layer, and across the
   expanse of the composite or core. By varying the position of the aggregates or the
   restrictions on the aggregates, the performance and capabilities of the absorbent composite
   may be managed or influenced. In certain embodiments, the aggregates of absorbent
25 particles are situated in containers or pockets. In further embodiments, the size, spacing,
   arrangement, and\or geometry or shape of the containers or pockets are specifically provided
   to achieve certain core fluid handling properties.
   [0015] In one embodiment, a disposable absorbent article includes a chassis body defined by
   a first end margin and a second end margin longitudinally spaced from the first end margin,
30 the end margins partially defining front and back waist regions that are fastenable about a
   waist of a user. The article further includes a topsheet, a backsheet, and an absorbent
   composite disposed between the topsheet and backsheet. The topsheet and backsheet define
   longitudinal and lateral margins of the chassis body. The absorbent composite includes a first
   fabric and a second fabric bonded to the first fabric. Furthermore, absorbent particles are
                                                     4

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   adhered between the first and second fabric, wherein the first fabric is intermittently attached
   to the second fabric to define a plurality of containers situated between the first fabric and the
   second fabric and containing an aggregate of absorbent particles. The absorbent composite
   includes regions of containers of absorbent particles aggregates including a primary region
 5 having containers of a first size and a secondary region having a plurality of containers of a
   second size different from the first size.
   [0016] The present disclosure is of an absorbent composite that, in some embodiments, does
   not require an absorbent matrix and a novel method of making the absorbent composite. The
   present document also discloses an absorbent article that incorporates the absorbent
10 composite. The absorbent composite provides for an absorbent article that can be made very
   thin and pliable, while at the same time retaining enough SAP to provide sufficient
   absorbency and dry and wet integrity (uniform absorbency). Although using the absorbent
   composite in a diaper is described, one skilled in the art would readily understand that an
   absorbent composite made according to the inventive process may be used in a wide variety
15 of absorbent products.
   [0017] The present disclosure is also directed to an improved absorbent article incorporating
   the absorbent composite.
   [0018] In one example, a method is described for manufacturing a composite sheet,
   comprising the steps of positioning a first fabric to receive particles, depositing particles on
20 the first fabric, applying adhesive to a second fabric, positioning the second fabric relative to
   the first fabric, and forming bond sites that extend between the first and second fabric. The
   method may further include an article in which the particles comprise SAP particles, skin
   care particles, odor absorbing particles, binder particles, ion exchange particles, and
   combinations thereof. Still further, the method may include the step of coating the particles
25 with a hydrophobic material.
   [0019] The method may include conforming the first fabric to a surface. The surface may
   include recesses that form pockets or containers in the first fabric when it is conformed to the
   surface. The SAP particles may be guided into the pockets formed in the first fabric. Suction
   may be used to conform the first fabric to the surface. The adhesive applied to the second
30 fabric may be applied in a concentration sufficient to secure an effective amount of dry
   particles. That concentration is generally between I to 100 grams per square meter. More
   specifically, the adhesive may be applied in a concentration of between 5 and 75 grams per
   square meter, or even more optimally, between 12 and 50 grams per square meter. The
   adhesive may be applied in a manner such that the total amount of adhesive engaging
                                                    5

    WO 2014/145312                                                                  PCT/US2014/030051
   particles is between 1 and 100 grams per square meter. The inventive method may further
   includes a step of applying adhesive to the first fabric before particles are deposited on the
   first fabric.
   [0020] The bond sites suitable for the method may be bond lines, which may be continuous
 5 or discontinuous and may define pockets or other shapes and designs. Alternatively, the bond
   sites may be bond points. The bond sites may be positioned relative to particles and/or
   arranged to prevent straight line particle migration of more than 2 inches.
   [0021] Alternatively, the method entails positioning a first fabric to receive particles,
   positioning particles on the first fabric, securing the particles relative to the first fabric,
10 positioning a second fabric over the particles, and forming bond sites that join the first fabric
   to the second fabric. The bond sites may be discrete points spaced to inhibit the migration of
   particles. The bond sites may also be bond lines spaced to inhibit the migration of particles,
   or bond lines that are connected to form a single bond line. The bond lines may be arranged
   to form pockets within which some particles are positioned. The particles may be SAP
15 particles, skin care particles, odor absorbing particles, binder particles, ion exchange
   particles, and combinations thereof. The particles may be secured to the first fabric with
   adhesive, thermal plastic, or combinations thereof. In addition to or in the alternative, the
   particles may be secured to the second fabric with adhesive, thermal plastic, or combinations
   thereof. Furthermore, shapes may be formed in the first fabric for receiving particles.
20 [0022] A disposable absorbent article according to the disclosure may comprise a topsheet, a
   backsheet, and an absorbent core disposed therebetween, wherein at least a portion of one of
   the backsheet, topsheet, and absorbent core. The absorbent core is an absorbent composite
   comprising a first fabric, a second fabric bonded to the first fabric, and particles adhered
   between the first and second fabric. The particles may be SAP particles, skin care particles,
25 odor absorbing particles, binder particles, ion exchange particles, and combinations thereof.
   [0023] Alternatively, an absorbent layer may be provided that is supported on the backsheet,
   such that a section of the backsheet provides the second fabric of the absorbent composite.
   The backsheet may further comprises a first backsheet layer, a second backsheet layer and
   SAP particles in a concentration of about 20 gsm positioned there between and the second
30 back sheet layer is an SMS having a basis weight in the range of about 10 gsm to 60 gsm. The
   absorbent layer may be adhered between the first and second fabric with an adhesive
   concentration of between 1 and 100 grams per square meter. The first fabric may be bonded
   to the second fabric at discrete points, which discrete points may define pockets. Further, the
                                                     6

   first fabric may be bonded to the second fabric along a plurality of bond lines, which bond
   lines may define pockets.
   [0024] The absorbent core may also comprise a first fabric, a second fabric, bond sites at
   which the first fabric is connected to the second fabric; and an absorbent layer of particles
 5 adhered between the first and second fabric. The particles may be SAP particles and/or other
   beneficial particles. The absorbent layer may be supported underneath a section of the
   topsheet, such that the section of topsheet provides the second fabric of the absorbent
   composite. The absorbent layer may be supported on a section of the backsheet, such that the
   backsheet section provides the first fabric of the absorbent composite.
10 [0025] In some embodiments, the disposable absorbent article may include a concentration of
   SAP particles in the absorbent layer of between about 50 and 650 grams per square meter.
   The SAP particles may also be coated with a hydrophobic material to retard the initial receipt
   of liquid by the SAP particles in the absorbent layer. The bond sites may define a plurality of
   continuous lines that inhibit the movement of the SAP particles of the absorbent layer. The
15 continuous lines may be shaped to form pockets between the first and second fabrics. The
   bond sites may define a plurality of discontinuous lines that inhibit the movement of the SAP
   particles of the absorbent layer. The discontinuous lines may be shaped to form pockets
   between the first and second fabric.
   [0026] In the yet another embodiment, the bonds may be positioned along periphery of
20 pockets of particles. The bonds may form a pattern such as herringbone, bricklayer, circles,
   triangles, dots, dashes, rectangles, and combinations thereof. The yet another embodiment
   may also include loose particles positioned between the first and second sheets.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0068] Upon review of the detailed description and the accompanying drawings provided
25 herein, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that an absorbent composite made
   according to the present disclosure may be used in disposable absorbent articles, and more
   particularly, in disposable absorbent articles, such as diapers, training pants or other
   incontinence products. Accordingly, the present disclosure shall not be limited to the
   structures and processes specifically described and illustrated herein, although the following
30 description is particularly directed to an absorbent composite that is used in a disposable
   diaper. The term "absorbent article" or "absorbent garment" with which the present disclosure
   is associated, includes various types of disposable articles and garments which are placed
   against or in proximity to the body of the wearer so as to absorb and contain various bodily
   exudates, bodily fluid, or biofluid.
                                                    11

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   [0069] Perhaps to gain a better understanding and appreciation of the particular contributions
   and improvements which are introduced in the present disclosure, reference may be first
   made to the improvements earlier disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,148,598. These earlier
   improvements are described in respect to FIGS. 1-14. Some of the teachings and suggestions
 5 therein may, in addition to serving as background knowledge in the art, translate to certain
   specific embodiments of the present disclosure (which will become apparent to one skilled in
   the relevant art given the present disclosure).
   [0070] In FIG. 1, a fabric 125 is shown as it is dispensed from roll 120 and carried along a
   production line on a conveyer belt 100. The fabric 125 may be thermal plastic material that
10 may be a woven, nonwoven, film, or a combination thereof. The fabric 125 is secured to the
   conveyor belt 100 by a vacuum system 110. The vacuum system 110 serves to confirm the
   fabric 125 to the conveyor belt 100.
   [0071] In one embodiment, the surface of the conveyor belt 100 has recessed portions that
   form cups in the fabric 125 as the fabric is pulled against the surface of the conveyor belt
15  100. The surface of the conveyor belt 100 is not limited to constructions that form cups in the
   fabric but, instead, may be configured with a number of different surface shapes and sizes.
   Examples include ridges, raised shapes, and holes. In addition, the surface shapes may be
   distributed uniformly or non-uniformly across the width and length of the conveyor belt.
   Alternatively, the conveyor belt 100 may be flat. In applications in which the conveyor belt
20  100 has holes or other similar constructions, the depth of the pockets formed in the fabric 125
   may be varied by the force of the vacuum system 110, the elasticity of the fabric 125, or a
   combination thereof. Additionally, heat may be used to increase the elasticity of the fabric
    125 as the fabric is pulled against the surface of the conveyor belt 100. Heat may be applied
   to the fabric by way of a heated conveyor belt or any other means known in the art. The
25 vacuum 1 10 may be applied uniformly across the surface of the conveyor belt 100 or at
   selected locations. For example, in a configuration in which the surface of conveyor belt 100
   has depressions, vacuum may be applied only at the depressions.
   [0072] The SAP particles 135 are then deposited on the fabric 125 by SAP dispenser 130.
   The SAP dispenser 130 may be configured to position SAP particles in their desired position
30 on the first fabric or may be configured merely to deposit SAP particles on the first fabric,
   wherein the SAP particles are position by another means. One skilled the art understands that
   multiple SAP dispensers 130 may be used. The SAP particles 135 may be deposited,
   positioned, or both on the fabric 125 by wind or other known methods. Alternatively, the
   conveyor belt shown in FIG. 1 may be inverted so that the vacuum system 110 applies
                                                    12

    WO 2014/145312                                                              PCT/US2014/030051
   suction from above. In such a configuration, the fabric 125 is carried over a supply of SAP
   particles 135 and the SAP particles are held onto the surface of fabric 125 by vacuum system
    110. In alternative embodiments, SAP dispenser 130 may include skin care particles such as
   ion exchange resins, deodorant, anti-microbial agents, binder particles, or other beneficial
 5 particles. Further, although the preferred embodiment is directed to SAP particles, the
   methods discloses herein can be used with any combination of the above referenced particles,
   including combinations that do not include SAP. Alternatively, separate dispensers
   advantageously positioned along the production line (not shown) may be used to deposit
   different types of particles such as, for example, skin care particles.
10 [0073] The SAP particles 135 are positioned and concentrated on the fabric 125 according to
   a number of alternative methods. In one embodiment, the vacuum system 110 and fabric 125
   may be configured to allow the vacuum system 110 to pull the SAP particles 135 against the
   surface of the fabric 125 uniformly or in particular areas. In another embodiment, the shape
   of the fabric 125 guides the SAP particles 135 into position. For example, when the fabric
15  125 is shaped to form pockets, the SAP particles 135 roll into the pockets as a result of the
   vacuum system 110, the vibration of the conveyor belt, wind, the angle of the conveyor belt,
   or combinations thereof. Alternatively, the SAP dispenser(s) 130 may be positioned and
   controlled to dispense SAP particles 135 strategically across the surface of fabric 125, which
   strategic positioning includes but is not limited to alignment or nonalignment with the
20 machine direction, offset, or randomly. Further, SAP may be positioned such that there are
   zones without SAP particles. Still further, SAP particles may be positioned using adhesive
   such as by applying adhesive to specific locations on a surface, depositing SAP particles on
   the surface. Still further, SAP particles may be positioned on both fabrics 125 and 155.
   [0074] Once SAP particles have been deposited and positioned on fabric 125, a second fabric
25  155 is introduced into the production line from roll 150. The second fabric 155 may be
   selected from a variety of materials including spun-bonded thermoplastic or similar woven or
   nonwoven material, film, or combinations thereof.
   [0075] The adhesive 145 is applied to the SAP particles 135 in a number of ways. FIG. 1
   shows the adhesive 145 applied to the fabric 155. Alternatively, the adhesive 145 may be
30 applied to the fabric 125 and SAP particles 135, fabric 125 before the SAP particles 135 are
   deposited on the fabric 125, or directly to the SAP particles before they are deposited on the
   fabric 125. In still another embodiment, the adhesive 145 is applied at the point where fabrics
    125 and 155 are jointed together. In still another embodiment, multiple coats of adhesive are
   applied. For example, adhesive 145 may be applied to the fabric 125 before the SAP particles
                                                    13

    WO 2014/145312                                                              PCT/US2014/030051
    135 are deposited, to the SAP particles 135 after they have been positioned, to the fabric 155,
   or a combination thereof. Alternatively or in addition to the above embodiments, binder
   particles may be mixed with the SAP particles 135. Additionally, the adhesive may be
   applied uniformly, randomly, or in a specific pattern, depending the desired absorbent
 5 properties of the finished composite.
   [0076] The adhesive is applied according to a number of methods know to those skilled in
   the art. For example, the adhesive may be sprayed, rolled, or spun onto the surface of fabric
    155. The adhesive may be hydrophobic, hydrophilic, biodegradable, bioderived, or
   combinations thereof. The preferred adhesive is hydrophobic. The concentration of adhesive
10 in a coat varies between 1 and 100 grams per square meter ("GSM"). Optimally, the
   concentration is between 5 and 75 GSM. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration is
   between 12 and 50 GSM. Additionally, enough adhesive should be applied to cover at least
   25% of the targeted area.
   [0077] Fabrics 125 and 155 are then bonded together. FIG. 1 shows a thermal bonding
15 system in which calendar rolls 160 and 170 are used. However, other bonding
   systems/methods may be used. For example, the ultrasonic bonding system of FIGS. 4 and 5
   may be used. Adhesive 145 retains the SAP particles 135 in a relatively fixed position with
   respect to the fabrics during the bonding process and subsequent to the bonding process. The
   bond pattern may be aligned with the distribution of the SAP particles 135. Alternatively, the
20 bond pattern may not be aligned with the distribution of the SAP particles 135. In such
   embodiments, the bonding equipment may be adapted to nudge the SAP particles 135 aside
   prior to bonding or to bond through the SAP particles 135. These embodiments eliminate the
   need to synchronize the bond points with the distribution of SAP particles.
   [0078] Fabrics 155 and 125 are shown as two materials. However, one skilled in the art
25 understands that the fabrics may actually be part of the same material. In such a
   configuration, the unitary fabric is folded to cover the SAP particles. Alternatively, the edges
   of fabric 125 may be folded prior to applying the second fabric 155. In embodiments in
   which fabrics 125 and 155 are separate, fabrics 125 and 155 may be the same or a different
   material. Additionally, fabric 155 may be sized to cover specific areas, such as the center
30 section, of fabric 125.
   [0079] Once the fabrics have been bonded together, the absorbent composite 195 is collected
   on rewinder 200.
   [0080] In a method illustrated in FIG. 2, the fabric 125 is transported along the conveyer belt
    100. As fabric 125 is transported along the conveyer belt 100, a thin coat of adhesive 145 is
                                                   14

    WO 2014/145312                                                                 PCT/US2014/030051
   applied to fabric 125. As with the method of FIG. 1, the adhesive may be applied uniformly,
   randomly, or in a specific pattern, depending the desired absorbent properties of the finished
   composite. Although the adhesive 145 is shown being applied before the SAP Particles 135
   are deposited, alternate embodiments are envisioned. For example, the adhesive may be
 5 applied according to the embodiments described with respect to FIG. 1.
   [0081] Following the application of the adhesive, SAP particles 135 are deposited and
   positioned on the fabric 125. The SAP particles 135 may be deposited directly on fabric 125,
   as shown in FIG. 2, or indirectly, such as by wind blowing SAP particles across fabric 125.
   The weight of the SAP particles aids in securing the fabric 125 to the conveyor belt 100.
10 Additionally, the SAP particles may be positioned in a manner similar to that disclosed for
   FIG. 1.
   [0082] A second fabric 155 is then fed into the production line from roll 150. The second
   fabric is positioned to cover the SAP particles 135. The adhesive 145 prevents the SAP
   particles from moving freely between the two fabrics. The resulting sandwiched construction
15 is then transported to the calendar rolls for thermal bonding. As described with respect to
   FIG. 1, the bond pattern may be aligned or not aligned with the SAP particles 135. The
   absorbent composite 195 is then collected by rewinder 200. As described with respect to
   FIG. 1, fabrics 125 and 155 may be part of a single sheet. Additionally, the fabrics may be
   folded in the manner described for FIG. 1. In another embodiment, the fabric 125 may be
20 coated with adhesive and pressed on a supply of SAP particles.
   [0083] FIG. 3 is similar to FIGS. 1 and 2, except that an energy source 900 such as an oven
   or microwave generator is positioned along the assembly line. The energy source applies heat
   and or radiation 910 that can be used to melt thermal plastic binder. The amount of heat may
   also be regulated to melt specific types of particles or fibers, specific sections of the fabrics,
25 or only the outer layers of particles/binder.
   [0084] FIGS. 4 and 5 are similar to FIGS. 1 and 2, except that the fabrics are bonded together
   using ultrasonic bonds. FIGS. 4 and 5 show an ultrasonic bonding system (2 1Oa and 2 1Ob). It
   is readily understood that FIGS. 1-5 show different embodiments of the novel method and
   that aspects of the various methods may be advantageously combined depending on the need.
30 Important to all combinations, however, is the amount of adhesive 145, binder particles, or
   combinations thereof applied to the SAP particles 135 and the strength of the bonds. As noted
   with respect to FIG. 1, the optimal concentration of adhesive is between 12 and 50 GSM,
   though other concentrations are acceptable. In all embodiments, it is important that the
   concentration of adhesive 145 be high enough to inhibit the migration of SAP particles 135.
                                                    15

    WO 2014/145312                                                              PCT/US2014/030051
   The concentration should not be so high, however, that it coats the SAP particles 135 and
   reduces SAP swelling. The adhesive should only inhibits the migration of enough SAP
   particles 135 to assure uniform absorbency. Although not shown, one skilled in the art
   understands that the energy source 900 shown in FIG. 3 can also be applied in the
 5 configurations shown in FIGS. 2, 4 and 5.
   [0085] FIG. 6 (a) through (q) show various bonding patterns contemplated by the method.
   The bonding patterns may completely enclose an area, partially enclose an area, or provide
   local bonding zones. The lines and points indicate the bond sites. The solid lines depict bond
   lines. The bond lines may form open shapes or enclosed shapes, such as can be found in
10 examples (a) and (c), which depict continuous bond lines that completely enclose pockets of
   SAP particles 135 or, as in example (g), separate distinct regions of the absorbent composite.
   The dashed lines, such as can be found in examples (b) and (m), are discontinuous bond
   patters that do not completely enclose pockets of SAP particles 135. In these configurations,
   the migration of dry SAP particles is inhibited by the adhesive and continuous or
15 discontinuous bond patters. Discontinuous pond patters may be substituted for continuous
   bond patterns and vise versa. Further, though the FIG. 6 shows either continuous or
   discontinuous bond patters, combinations of discontinuous and continuous bond patters may
   be used.
   [0086] FIG. 7 shows a partial cross-section of an absorbent composite 195. FIG. 7 shows
20 how bonds 192 may act to separate pockets of SAP particles 135. As noted with respect to the
   bonding pattern, SAP particles 135 may be entirely enclosed in pockets defined by the
   bonding pattern, partially enclosed in pockets defined by the bonding pattern or merely
   inhibited by the bonding pattern. Inhibited in this context means the SAP particles 135 cannot
   move directly from one area of the core to another area, but instead, must move around bond
25 sites.
   [0087] Notably, multiple functions or advantageous properties are obtained in the absorbent
   composite by varying the amount of SAP particles, the type and number of fabrics used, and
   construction variables such as, the ratio of SAP to adhesive, and applying the absorbent
   composite at various locations in the article. Such manufacturing and design techniques may
30 be incorporated into structural designs and methods of the present disclosure.
   [0088] Additionally, one skilled in the art understands that the process for constructing a
   single absorbent composite described above may be modified to produce a multiple,
   laminated absorbent composite. In structures comprising multiple layers, the layers may be
   sheets of absorbent composite 195 that are laminated together to form a single structure or
                                                   16

    WO 2014/145312                                                                PCT/US2014/030051
   alternating layers of fabric and SAP particles 135 that form a single structure. One skilled in
   the art understands that alternating layers may be achieved by applying adhesive to the top of
   fabric 155 (FIG. 1), applying a second layer of SAP particles 135, and a third fabric (not
   shown). Similarly, additionally layers may be added, limited only by the maximum thickness
 5 suitable for the bonding process.
   [0089] The SAP particles 135 may be coated with a miscible, hydrophobic material. The
   coating acts as a barrier or membrane that initially slows the liquid uptake, thereby saving
   SAP capacity for additional or secondary discharges. In this regard, the coating evens out the
   absorbency rates between discharges. In the processes shown in FIGS. 1 to 5, the coating may
10 be applied prior to the adhesive 145 being applied, after the adhesive 145 is applied, or at the
   same time. Alternatively, the adhesive may be mixed with the coating material.
   [0090] In one example, a light coating of mineral oil is applied over the SAP particles 135.
   The coating retards the initial uptake by the SAP particles and allows more time for the liquid
   to spread out in the article. Preferably, the mineral oil is applied at a concentration of about
15 0.0000 1 grams per gram of SAP to about 0.1 grams per gram of SAP (depending on the
   particular product design). Alternatively, the mineral oil may be applied in specific target
   zones. In this way, the received liquid is encouraged to initially spread to uncoated areas
   before the coated areas are activated and begin to swell.
   [0091] An absorbent composite manufactured by the above-described process may be used
20 for a disposable absorbent article or as one or more of the components of a disposable
   absorbent article. The components of an absorbent article include the backsheet, topsheet,
   absorbent core, containment walls or cuffs (including leg gathers), backsheet/absorbent core
   composite, topsheet/absorbent composite, and combinations thereof. Such constructions are
   described below in more detail.
25 [0092] FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a disposable absorbent article in the form of a diaper
    10. Diaper 10 comprises a topsheet 50, a backsheet 60, and an absorbent core (not shown).
   The diaper further comprises upstanding barrier cuffs 34 which extend longitudinally along
   the diaper and are elasticized to conform to the buttocks of the wearer. Additionally, the
   diaper includes an elastic band 52 and fastening elements 26. Element 26, in use, extends to
30 and engages the corresponding opposing end of the diaper to secure the diaper about the
   wearer.
   [0093] FIG. 9 illustrates a composite web structure of the diaper 10 of FIG. 8 in a generally

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   disposable diaper 10 in a finished or final form. To facilitate description of the diaper 10, the
   description refers to a longitudinally extending axis AA, a laterally extending central axis
   BB, a pair of longitudinally extending side edges 90, and a pair of end edges 92 which extend
   between side edges 90. Along the longitudinal axis AA, the diaper 10 includes a first end
 5 region or front waist region 12, a second end region or back waist region 14, and a crotch
   region 16 disposed therebetween. Each of the front and back waist regions 12, 14 is
   characterized by a pair of ear regions or ears 18, which are located on either side of a central
   body portion 20 and extend laterally from the side edges 90. A fastening structure 26 (e.g., a
   conventional tape fastener) is affixed to each of the ears 18 along the back waist region 14 of
10 diaper 10.
   [0094] When the diaper 10 is worn about the waist, the front waist region 12 is fitted adjacent
   the front waist area of the wearer, the back waist region 14 is fitted adjacent the back waist
   area, and the crotch region 16 fits about and underneath the crotch area. To properly secure
   the diaper 10 to the wearer, the ears 18 of the back waist region 14 are brought around the
15 waist of the wearer and toward the front and into alignment with the ears 18 of the front waist
   region 12. The securing surface may be located on or provided by the interior or exterior
   surface of the front waist region 12. Alternatively, the fasteners 26 may be located on the ears
    18 of the front waist region 12 and made securable to the ears 18 of the back waist region 14.
   [0095] FIG. 10 is an exploded view of the diaper of FIGS. 8 and 9. A suitable diaper
20 structure typically employs at least three layers. These three layers include a backsheet 60,
   an absorbent core 46, and a topsheet 50. The diaper structure mayor may not contain a pair of
   containment walls or leg cuffs 34 disposed upwardly from the topsheet 50 and preferably
   equipped at least with one or more spaced apart, longitudinally elastic members 38. It will be
   shown below that any of these diaper elements or a combination of these elements may be
25 constructed with or using the absorbent composite 195. Additionally, an acquisition layer 48
   could be added to improve performance.
   [0096] BACKSHEET
   [0097] As mentioned above, the diaper 10 employs a backsheet 60 that covers the core 46
   and preferably extends beyond the core 46 toward the side edges 90 and end edges 92 of the
30 diaper 10. In one aspect of the invention, the backsheet 60 is constructed from a single
   layered material sheet of absorbent composite 195. In such a configuration, fabric 125 is
   positioned as an outer surface of the backsheet 60.
   [0098] Additionally, an alternative structure could be used for gel blocking. For an
   application using gel blocking, a backsheet of the inventive disposable absorbent article is
                                                   18

    WO 2014/145312                                                                 PCT/US2014/030051
   relatively thin and provides improved flexibility. When dry, the backsheet is soft and
   breathable, but upon wetting, a thin, gel blocked layer is formed (i.e., on the inner surface of
   the backsheet) which renders the backsheet substantially liquid impervious. The gel blocked
   layer is formed by the swelling of the SAP particles 135.
 5 [0099] TOPSHEET
   [00100]          Similarly, the absorbent composite 195 may be utilized with or as the topsheet
   of an absorbent garment. The topsheet 50 is preferably soft, compliant, exhibits good
   strikethrough and a reduced tendency to rewet from a liquid pervious material. The topsheet
   50 is placed in close proximity to the skin of the wearer when the diaper 10 is worn. In this
10 way, such a topsheet 50 permits bodily discharges to rapidly penetrate it so as to flow toward
   the core 46 more quickly, but not allowing such discharges to flow back through the topsheet
   50. The topsheet 50 may be constructed from anyone of a wide range of liquid and vapor
   permeable hydrophilic materials. The surface(s) of the topsheet may be treated with a
   surfactant so as to facilitate liquid transfer therethrough, especially at a central zone or area of
15 the topsheet located over the core and an inner surface of the core. The topsheet may also be
   coated with a substance having rash preventing or rash reducing properties (e.g., aloe vera).
   [00101]         In one example, the topsheet 50 is formed from an absorbent composite 195
   that covers substantially the entire area of the disposal absorbent article 10, including
   substantially all of the front waist region 12, back waist region 14, and crotch region 16.
20 Further, the ear layer of the inner region 18 is formed from the same single topsheet material
   and, thus, may be referred to as being unitary with the topsheet 50 in forming lateral
   extensions of the topsheet material. Alternatively, the topsheet 50 may be formed from
   multiple different materials which vary across the width of the topsheet 50. Such a multiple
   piece design allows for creation of preferred properties and different zones of the topsheet.
25 [00102]         ABSORBENT CORE
   [00103]         In addition to or as an alternative to the above examples, the absorbent core of
   the disposable absorbent article may be constructed from the absorbent composite 195,
   laminated layers of absorbent composite 195 (not shown) or multiple layers of SAP particles
    135 and fabric. FIGS. 11 and 12 depict cross sectional views of alternating layers of SAP
30 particles 135 and fabric that form a multi layered absorbent composite 700 and 900,
   respectively. As shown in these drawings, the core 46 may be comprised of distinct layers of
   SAP particles 135 (710 and 910). The layers may be uniform or non-uniform, depending on
   the intended application. In the non-uniform multi layered absorbent composite 900, the
                                                     19

    WO 2014/145312                                                              PCT/US2014/030051
   concentration of SAP particles 135 may vary within a given layer, between layers, or
   combinations thereof.
   [00104]         FIG. 11 depicts a composite structure 700 in which SAP particle layers 710
   and fabric layers 720 are alternated to form the completed composite structure 700. The
 5 layered design can also be constructed by bonding together sheets of absorbent composite,
   folding a unitary sheet of absorbent composite, or constructing absorbent composites with
   multiple layers during the manufacturing process. In folded applications, the composite fold
   may be a C-fold, Z-fold, V-fold, W-fold or combinations thereof. Further, the folds may be
   open, closed, or overlapping.
10 [00105]         FIG. 12 depicts multi layers absorbent composite 900. As shown in FIG. 12,
   high concentrations areas of SAP particles 910 may be strategically positioned to provide
   additional absorbency in specific regions such as the crotch of an absorbent article. One
   skilled in the art understands that the high concentration areas may be offset to control the
   amount and direction of liquid penetration. Additionally, the layer with zones of high
15 concentrations may be combined with layers of substantially uniform layers. Alternatively,
   the high SAP concentration areas can be formed by positioning multiple layers of absorbent
   core.
   [001061         The core may be configured to extend substantially the full length and/or
   width of the disposable absorbent article. Preferably, however, the core is disposed or is
20 otherwise concentrated at the crotch region of the article. In various embodiments, the core
   extends to the edges of the article and the SAP particles 135 are concentrated in the crotch
   region or another target zone of the article. In still another embodiment, the particles can be a
   combination of SAP particles, skin care particles such as ion exchange resins, deodorant,
   anti-microbial agents, binder particles, or other beneficial particles.
25 [00107]         CONTAINMENT WALLS
   [00108]         Now turning to FIGS. 13 and 14, the disposable absorbent article 10 utilizes a
   pair of containment walls or cuffs 34 which employ the absorbent composite 195. Each
   containment wall 34 is a longitudinally extending wall structure preferably positioned on
   each side of the core 46 and spaced laterally from the longitudinal center. The longitudinal
30 ends of the walls 34 may be attached, for example, to the topsheet 50 in the front and rear
   waist regions 12 and 14. Preferably, the ends of the containment wall 34 are tacked down
   inwardly and attached, for example, by adhesive to the web structure. Such a construction
   effectively biases the containment wall 34 inwardly and is generally considered to cause
   containment wall 34 to exhibit improved leakage prevention properties.
                                                    20

    WO 2014/145312                                                                  PCT/US2014/030051
   [00109]         FIG. 13 provides a cross-sectional view of a diaper 10. The diaper 10 includes
   backsheet 60, absorbent core 46, acquisition layer 48, and topsheet 50. As shown in FIG. 13,
   the core is an absorbent composite 195. The diaper 10 also includes a pair of containment
   walls or cuffs 34 which are formed by folding the topsheet 50 and wrapping it about the ends
 5 of the absorbent composite 195. Alternatively, the absorbent composite 195 in the cuffs 34
   may be distinct from the absorbent core 46.
   [00110]         Preferably, the containment walls 34 are equipped with elastic members 38,
   which extend along a substantial length of the containment walls 34. In a common
   application, the elastic members 38 are placed within the containment walls 34, preferably at
10 the top of the containment walls 34 while in a stretched condition and the glued to the
   containment walls at least at their ends. When released or otherwise allowed relaxing, the
   elastic members 38 retract inwardly. When the article 10 is worn, the elastic members 38
   function to contract the containment walls 34 about the buttocks and the thighs of the user in
   a manner, which effects a seal between the article 10, the buttocks and the thighs. The core 46
15 may be a single sheet of absorbent composite 195 or multilayered, as described above.
   [00111]         FIG. 13 depicts the configuration of the containment walls 34 when it is soft
   and dry. FIG. 14, on the other hand, depicts the containment walls after wetting, in which the
   absorbent composite 195 has swollen to dispose the containment walls 34 in a resiliently,
   erect position. Unlike traditional leg cuffs in the prior art, the resiliently erect containment
20 walls 34 resists flattening (e.g., when the wearer sits down) and, thereby, ensures leakage
   prevention, especially of explosive, liquefied bowel movements and rapid discharges of
   urine.
   [00112]         OPTIONAL LAYERS
   [001131         The disposable absorbent article may employ additional layers including an
25 acquisition layer or surge layer 48, preferably situated between the topsheet and the core
   (e.g., FIG. 10). One function of such an acquisition layer is to spread out or disperse liquid
   flow so that liquid is distributed more evenly over the core surface. This serves to slow down
   the flow so that the liquid has adequate time to be absorbed by the core. The acquisition layer
   also serves to prevent the core from being saturated locally, while a substantial remainder of
30 the core is not absorbing any liquid.
   [00114]         TAPE TABS
   [00115]         The disposable absorbent article must be secured to the wearer. This is most
   important with respect to diapers since diapers are not pulled up by the wearer, like training
   pants or incontinent briefs, but are fastened around the wearer. Securing elements
                                                    21

    WO 2014/145312                                                                PCT/US2014/030051
   compliment the elastic members by effecting a quasi-seal between the wearer and the
   waistband and leg cuffs, so that liquid is contained within the article which is then absorbed;
   in other words, so that it does not leak through gaps between the wearer and the edge of the
   article. The securing elements may be adhesive, mechanical fasteners hook and loop features,
 5 or conceivably strings, i.e., anything that will secure one end of the article to the
   longitudinally opposite end. The securing elements may also be co-adhesive such that they
   adhere to each other but not other materials.
   [001161          In the examples shown in the Figures (see, e.g., FIG. 10), the article 10 is
   affixed to the wearer by tape fasteners 26 which are permanently affixed to (e.g., sewn
10 directly into) the backsheet 60. Tape fasteners 26 are contacted with the transversely opposite
   ear 22 extending from the backsheet, where they remain affixed due to adhesive compound
   applied to the fasteners 26. Alternatively, the article 10 may be training pants, pull-on
   diapers, and the like. In this configuration, the article 10 mayor may not have tape fasteners
   26.
15 [00117]          WAISTBAND
   [00118]          Waistbands employing elastic members 52 are positioned along the transverse
   portion of the article 10 so that when worn, the waistbands are positioned along the waist of
   the wearer. Generally, the waistband preferably creates a quasi-seal against the waist
   (transverse elastic members 52) so that liquid waste does not leak from the regions between
20 the waist elastic and the waist of the wearer. The quasi-seal is significant because, although
   the liquid may be eventually absorbed by filler material, the assault of liquid by the wearer
   may overwhelm the absorption rate capacity of the filler material. Hence, the waistbands
   contain the liquid while it is being absorbed. Secondly, the waistbands may have a capacity to
   absorb liquid (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,601,544, which is hereby incorporated by
25 reference).
   [00119]          Aggregate (and Embossing) Patterns and Material Selection for Fluffless
   Absorbent Composites
   [00120]          The simplified illustrations of FIGS. 15A-15D present absorbent composites
   510 with particularly advantageous arrangements of aggregates 512 of absorbent particles,
30 according to the present disclosure (with like reference numerals used to indicate like
   elements). Referring first to FIG. 15A, each of the aggregates on the absorbent composite 510
   is represented by the diamond-shaped enclosure 514 in the pattern. In preferred
   embodiments, SAP is employed as the absorbent particles in the aggregates. Furthermore,
   SAP aggregates in each of FIGS. 15A-15D are preferably maintained in place and stabilized
                                                    22

    WO 2014/145312                                                              PCT/US2014/030051
   by physical entrapments or containers provided by the engagement of a first fabric disposed
   generally above the SAP aggregate with a second fabric disposed generally beneath the SAP
   aggregate. Thus, in an alternative view of FIG. 15A, the diamond units represent the outline
   of the containers or pockets, reflecting in particular embodiments, the engagement of the top
 5 fabric with the bottom fabric, as previously described herein.
   [00121]         As described previously, the absorbent performance of the SAP can be
   affected by the size and structure of the container. As SAP becomes more saturated, its
   permeability is reduced. Water cannot pass through the SAP particle due to the high level of
   water already contained within the SAP particle and eventually the SAP can completely halt
10 the passage of further fluid through it. This is known as gel blocking. Also, as SAP becomes
   more saturated, it swells and its volume increases. By confining the SAP in a small container
   of fixed volume it is possible to restrict the swelling of the SAP and prevent it from reaching
   its highest saturation levels (and, by consequence, stop the SAP from reaching its lowest
   levels of permeability). The degree to which the SAP particle is restricted depends on a
15 number of factors, including: the nature and size of the container, the size and frequency of
   any breaks in the container (e.g., along the side walls), the amount of SAP disposed in the
   container, and the amount of fluid absorbed by the SAP. Further, the performance properties
   of SAP are affected by its degree of saturation. Specifically, absorbent composite properties
   such as permeability, absorption rate, capillary pressure (arising from the void space in the
20 composite) will vary significantly as the SAP changes from dry to fully saturated. In
   accordance with a method of the present disclosure, target or optimal performance of the SAP
   may be achieved by changing the size of the container and/or the SAP concentration so as to
   physically constrain the swelling of the SAP and limit the maximum saturation point of the
   SAP. By incorporating these physical features, preferred levels of permeability or a preferred
25 absorption property may be achieved in target regions of the absorbent core. Thus, by
   playing with the two variables of pocket size and the amount of SAP in the pocket, the
   minimum permeability of that container or pocket may be "set". Pockets in some regions of
   the diaper may be prevented from gel blocking and the permeability of that region of the core
   may be optimized. A gradient of pocket size may also be established to obtain maximum flow
30 and utilization of the absorbent core. This gradient will be radiate from the target zone
   towards the ends or sides of the diaper.
   [00122]         The various arrangements of containers or pockets also promote SAP and core
   utilization and prevent fluid from bypassing the containers. Ideally, fluid should leak or flow
   from container to container as the SAP reaches the maximum level of saturation which is set
                                                    23

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   either by the properties of the SAP or the volume of the pocket into which it is expanding.
   Applicants contemplate that, in some of the previously described composites or arrangements
   of pockets (see FIG. 6), there may be a tendency for fluid to leak between the pockets. That
   is the fluid runs along the channels formed by embossing lines and does not enter the core. To
 5 mitigate this tendency, arrangements or patterns for the containers are preferably ones that
   minimize or eliminate short and direct routes (as may be established along embossing lines)
   of fluid flow from the core center to the side margins of the core (at end edges). To illustrate,
   containers or pockets shaped as diamonds are preferred to ones formed in squares or
   rectangles, because the diagonal lines or channels formed by the diamond containers are
10 longer and more circuitous. Circles are also effective if packed in a way that does not present
   channels that flow quickly to the edge. In more preferred arrangements, fluid flow is forced
   to change directions one or more times before flowing through the side of the diaper.
   [001231          An absorbent core for a baby diaper or adult incontinence product is required
   to absorb fluid quickly, in an anatomically aligned region of the core, absorb all the fluid
15 without leaking at the sides or ends of the product and hold on to that fluid without wetting
   the user's skin particularly when under the pressure caused by the user's bodyweight. This
   present disclosure accomplishes that by providing regions of the core having different
   performance parameters defined by the size of the containers retaining the SAP, as well as the
   arrangement of the containers. Thus, a core may be designed to attain optimized performance
20 characteristics by changing the size of the pocket and/or the concentration of SAP within that
   pocket.
   [00124]          In certain arrangements shown here, design features are combined to provide a
   core that is less likely to leak, absorbs wetness fast, and provides a dry, comfortable feeling
   for the user. At the crotch region of the core, the container size and SAP loading are
25 optimized to provide an open structure, with high permeability, resulting in fast acquisition or
   distribution of fluid away from the point of insult and away from the user's skin. Permeability
   is maintained even when the SAP is swollen due to the physical constraints of the container
   restricting further swelling. This allows the liquid to spread more efficiently toward the
   regions further away from the target zone (crotch area), and contributes to better performance
30 and utilization of the absorbent core. At regions away from the crotch region, such as regions
   proximate the periphery of the core and beyond, permeability is reduced to slow down the
   fluid. Absorption capacity is increased by the larger pockets allowing the SAP to swell more
   fully and hold on to more fluid.

    WO 2014/145312                                                                 PCT/US2014/030051
   [001251          In FIG. 15A, large diamond shaped containers or pockets 514 of absorbent
   particles aggregate 522 are present in a region anatomically aligned with the point of insult.
   The containers then gradually reduce in size toward the sides and front and rear margins or
   edges of the core 510. There are three distinct regions of containers. In the crotch region
 5 "A", large diamond shaped pockets are provided. Adjacent and surrounding the crotch region
   is an intermediate region "B" of pockets of smaller size than those in the crotch region (A).
   Among other things, the smaller pockets of this intermediate region (B) present breaks in the
   potential fluid flow around the SAP aggregates and along embossing lines. As described
   previously, the presentation of such barriers to direct escape of fluid flow through the side
10 margins prevents leakage and promote utilization of the SAP aggregates. Finally, a third
   region "C" of pockets is present near each of the end edges of the core 510 populated by even
   smaller sized pockets of SAP aggregates.
   [00126]          FIG. 15B illustrates a second exemplary arrangements of SAP aggregates 522
   and pockets 514. In this example, small, diamond shaped pockets 522 are disposed in the
15 region anatomically aligned with the point of fluid insults. The pockets then gradually
   increase in size in regions disposed toward the sides and front and rear edges of the core. The
   two arrangements (in FIGS. 15A and 151B) provide alternative ways of structuring the
   expected flow gradient and as well, handling of the liquid insults. The absorbent composite
   and arrangement of pockets in FIG. 15A may provide for a center region with a larger
20 capacity initially, but which, over time, will redistribute liquid in its void volume, or from
   subsequent liquid insults, to smaller adjacent pockets or cells. With the pattern of FIG. 15B,
   the center region may be equipped with smaller capacity initially, which will cause the liquid
   to travel to larger cells. It may also generate a surface topography that prevents leakage from
   the sides and ends of the diaper, i.e., "dams" will be created that intercept and absorb surface
25 flow.
   [00127]          FIGS. 15C and 15D provide alternate arrangements wherein circular pockets
   for SAP aggregates are employed. In FIG. 15C, large, circular shaped pockets are present in
   a region anatomically aligned with the point of insult. The pockets 534 gradually reduce in
   size toward the sides and front and rear edges of the core 530. The pattern is similar to that
30 employed in FIG. 15A but with circular pockets rather than diamond-shaped ones. Many of
   the characteristics of the arrangement in FIG. 15A translate to the design of FIG. 15C.
   [00128]          However, unlike a diamond shaped pocket, it is not possible to produce a
   perfectly close packed pattern with circular shaped pockets and the resulting space between
   the circular pockets could be disposed in a number of ways. It is envisaged that the space
                                                    25

   between the circular pockets could either be completely embossed (i.e., have large embossed,
   thermally bonded regions between the pockets), partially embossed or not embossed. The
   spaces could also contain SAP or be free of SAP.
   [00129]         FIG. 15D illustrates a further embodiment of the present invention, with a
 5 pattern analogous to that found in FIG. 15B. In this example, small, circular shaped pockets
   544 are disposed in the region anatomically aligned with the point of fluid insults. The
   pockets 544 gradually increase in size in regions disposed towards the sides and front and
   rear edges of the core. Again the space between the pockets 544 could be utilized in a number
   of ways as described above.
10 [00130]         It should be noted that arrangements and embossed patterns are not limited to
   employment of diamond shaped pockets or circular shaped pockets. Other shapes are
   contemplated. Some arrangements may even utilize different pocket shapes within the same
   pattern.

   [00134]          In a further variation of providing an absorbent composite according to the
   present disclosure, one or more of the nonwoven webs employed in previous examples is
   replaced with a more open structure. Examples of such a nonwoven include, carded PET
   webs, airthrough bonded nonwovens, resin bonded nonwovens and non-absorbent air-laid
 5 structures. Materials known as acquisition and distribution layers (ADL) are included in this
   list of suitable materials. The resulting structure provides an alternative means for containing
   absorbent particles and more specifically, within a fibrous network but without using an
   absorbent matrix of fibers (i.e., without pulp). The structure promotes the distribution of the
   SAP within a network of fibers provided by the non-woven web layer. This distribution of
10 SAP particles into the more open web provides, among other things, a mechanism for further
   stabilization of the SAP within the nonwoven simply through entanglement of the particles
   within the fibrous network.
   [00135]          FIG. 16A illustrates a composite structure as previously described. The
   composite employs a non-woven as a bottom layer (NW 1) and a top layer (NW2) to
15 sandwich a layer of SAP material (SAP). FIG. 16B illustrates an alternative structure,
   wherein a bulky non-woven ("bulky" NW1) is employed as a base layer. The bulky non
   woven layer NW1 provides fibers that extend outward and entangle SAP particles. Such
   entanglement with the fibers in the more open material leads to stabilization of the SAP
   within the absorbent composite. In a manufacturing process, SAP particles applied onto a
20 sheet or web of the bulky woven may be energized so as to promote penetration into the
   fibrous network of the more open nonwoven web. The effect of gravity on the particles may
   be sufficient to promote the desired penetration as the SAP particles are laid down onto the
   web. Techniques such as vacuum or vibration could be used to further enhance the
   penetration of the SAP particles into the open, fibrous network.
25 [001361          Stabilization of the SAP prevents movement of the material during processing,
   storage and use. In exemplary embodiments, the absorbent composite or core may employ the
   "bulky nonwoven" structure (as in FIG. 16B) for stabilizing the SAP in addition to the use of
   adhesive and containers or pockets of SAP aggregates, as previously described.
   [00137]          It should also be noted that the more open nonwoven material can provide
30 additional performance features. These include faster acquisition of fluid and improved
   dryness (rewet) for the user. Also, the absorbent matrix will feel softer (spongier) than "flat"
   nonwoven webs, and will provide a more flexible composite. This results in greater comfort
   for the user and a better fit around the contours of the user's body leading to less chance of
   leakage.

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   [001381         Referring now to the illustrations in FIGS. 17A-17B, the exemplary absorbent
   composite is preferably provided with top layer of "bulky" nonwoven. The illustrations may
   be regarded as simplified cross-sectional views of the composite in FIG. 15A. Because the
   substrate used to contain the SAP is an open structure nonwoven, it is characterized by large
 5 pores (- 2000 microns). Embossing will set and stabilize the local pore structure of the
   bulky, resilient fiber web substrate. Areas wherein the embossing pattern is small (utilizes
   small containers) (FIG. 17A) creates smaller pores (see FIG. 17A) compared to areas with
   larger embossing patterns (FIG. 17B) which creates larger capillary pores (17B). In other
   words, the smaller inter-fiber distance characterized by the smaller patterns lead to higher
10 densities and higher capillarity. The larger patterns provide greater inter-fiber distances which
   lead to low density and low capillarity. The result of this combination of pockets across the
   core is an optimized wicking structure, as illustrated in FIG. 17C. With larger pores situated
   in the target area and smaller pores away from the insult point, an effective conduit for fluid
   flow results. This conduit may be utilized to transport liquid against gravity more
15 efficiently. (See illustration of liquid movement in FIG. 17c). Such an advantageous
   structure can be created within the nonwoven substrate by the appropriate choice of
   embossing patterns hence allowing the liquid to spread further, enhancing core utilization and
   intake.
   [00139]         In further embodiments and in reference to FIGS. 17C and 17D, 3-D patterns
20 or contours may be formed during use (uptake of liquid) as a consequence of SAP swelling.
   As shown in FIGS. 17C and 17D, different size pockets provide differences in swelling
   capacities, which in turn lead to differential swelling. In one respect, dams may be created by
   the pockets with greater swells (i.e., larger pillows). This structural consequence helps to
   reduce side and waist leakage. In most cases, uncontrolled liquid (liquid pooling on the
25 surface of the product) lead to product leakage. The 3-D topography generated as SAP swells
   is defined by the embossing pattern size/frequency. An absorbent core that can self-generate a
   surface topography can inhibit cross-directional surface flow (to prevent side leakage) or
   discourage leakage at the waist region (longitudinal ends of the core). The structure and
   arrangement of pockets in FIG. 15A would be well suited to achieve these properties in an
30 absorbent core.
   [00140]         Further Exemplary Methods and Systems for Making an Absorbent Composite
   Employing SAP
   [00141]         In a method referred to as profiling, the SAP dosing rate is varied to produce a
   profiled core. See e.g., U.S. Pat. Applic. Nol2/925,765 for profiled core designs, which
                                                    28

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   document is incorporated by reference and made a part of the disclosure. The profiled core
   structure provides improved diaper performance by providing more absorbent material in
   areas of the core where it is needed. The profile may also be achieved by stacking multiple
   layers of the absorbent composite, but at different lengths (e.g., short top core, full length
 5 bottom core). A more efficient solution may be to vary the SAP dosing rate during
   application of the SAP and align the high SAP dose areas with the crotch area of the diaper
   when the core is converted in the diaper line. Such a method may be more efficient as it
   utilizes less nonwoven material than the stacked core. It is also cost effective.
   [00142]         In one embodiment, a powdered hotmelt adhesive is mixed with the SAP to
10 provide additional bonding. The SAP and adhesive mixture is distributed between the two
   nonwoven webs and the hotmelt adhesive is "activated" by passing the composite through a
   heating device. Suitable devices include heated rollers, infra-red heater and the like. The
   adhesive melts and bonds the SAP and nonwovens together. This can also be combined with
   the patterned embossing/ultrasonic processes to produce pocket patterns as described
15 previously. Typically, the adhesive/SAP is mixed at a ratio of 10 to 100 parts SAP to 1 part
   adhesive by weight (1-10% adhesive by weight). Too much adhesive will limit the absorption
   performance of the SAP, while too little adhesive may sacrifice structural integrity.
   Preferably, the adhesive is applied at a rate of about 1 to 2 particles of adhesive per particle of
   SAP. The exact rates may be worked out if the average particle size and density of the SAP
20 and adhesive are known.
   [001431          The absorbent composites described thus far are well suited for
   manufacturing in both offline and online manufacturing processes. In the offline process, the
   core machine stands separate to any other process and produces rolls, spools or boxes of
   festooned material that is then delivered to the diaper converting line. Typically, but not
25 necessarily, the machine associated with the product of FIGS. 6-7, as described previously,
   would produce a wide sheet of the absorbent composite. The product is then slit to produce a
   number of rolls of material for use on the diaper converting line, e.g., a 1.5m wide machine
   would produce 15 rolls of material at 100mm width. In the offline process, the offline
   machine will typically run at speeds much slower than the diaper converting line. In the
30 online process, the core machine is part of the diaper converting line and the core is made a
   part of the diaper converting process. The output speed of the core machine must match the
   speed of the diaper converting line and the width of the core will match the width of the core
   in the product.

   [00144]         In an offline process depicted in FIG. 18A, a SAP sandwich is formed having
   a substrate A, a second substrate B, and a SAP coating disposed between the two substrates.
   In one embodiment, the SAP is immobilized by bonding the two substrates together to
   contain the SAP in discrete planar volumes between the layers. One or a combination of the
 5 following methods for SAP stabilization may be employed. In a first process, heat embossing
   or ultrasonic bonding is employed to fuse the substrate layers in a defined pattern. In a
   second process, an adhesive is applied to one or both of the substrate inner surfaces. The
   two substrates are then strategically bonded together according to an advantageous
   embossing pattern. Thirdly, a thermal binder, such as low melting adhesive particles, may be
10 mixed with the SAP particles. External heating is then applied to the composite to activate or
   melt the adhesive, thereby binding the particles to the substrate and to each other. Here, a
   patterned embossing step may be used to enhance the lamination quality while maintaining a
   more open SAP layer structure for enhanced liquid intake. If a patterned is not desired, a
   smooth calendar roll (not patterned) may also be employed to bond the cover layer to the
15 SAP layer to produce the sandwich structure.
   [00145]         In an online process, the core forming process is directly coupled to the diaper
   converting process. The SAP sandwich structure is formed as with the first and second
   process   discussed above, at speeds 3-4 times that of the offline process. The third method
   may not be suited to the faster online process because of the short dwell time required to heat
20 and activate the thermal binder that is mixed in with the SAP. The offline process is designed
   to produce a wide material at slower speeds. The material output is then slit into narrower
   widths to supply several diaper lines. In contrast, the online process is designed to produce a
   narrow (1-wide) material at higher speeds and supply core material for only one diaper
   machine at a time.
25 [001461         So, in a preferred embodiment using the offline method according to the third
   method described above, a small quantity (10% or less) of hot melt particles is mixed in with
   the SAP. This particle mix is uniformly deposited on substrate A and then, subjected to
   radiant IR heating to melt the adhesive particles. The second substrate B is then laid on top
   while the material is still hot. The layers are immediately laminated together using heat
30 embossing with a patterned roll/smooth anvil embossing system. Table 2 below summarizes
   the process and provides certain parameters of a preferred embodiment.

   FIG. 18B, a scatter unit utilizes a hopper and a standard rotating needle roll to mix and apply
 5 the mixture on the web. The SAP material is chosen according to its suitability for the
   application, but in general, SAP with high retention capacity and high absorbency under load
   are preferred, for example, Centrifuge Retention Capacity (CRC) of from 20 - 40 g/g, a
   Pressure Absorbency Index (PAI) greater than 100 g/g An exemplary SAP is M-15 1
   manufactured by Nippon Shokubai. A suitable hot melt adhesive is low melting EVA
10 polymer, Abifor 1605, 0-200 micron particle size grade, which is currently available from
   Abifor Powder Technology, Switzerland. As shown in the detail of FIG. 18, a readily
   available scatter unit employs a needle roll in mixing and applying the mixture on the web.
   The bonding pattern specified for this embodiment is an elongated diamond with a major axis
   length of 50mm oriented in the MD direction and a minor axis length of 22mm. See e.g., FIG.
15  18C.
   [00149]          FIG. 19 depicts an absorbent composite 910 that is produced by the method
   and system as described in respect to FIGS. 18A-18C above. Preferably, the composite 910
   includes a bottom substrate A that is a bulky nonwoven, a top layer or substrate B, and
   superabsorbent particles S situated between the two layers and interspersed with hot melt
20 adhesive particles HM (as described above). More preferably, the top substrate B is provided
   by a tissue material readily available and understood in the art. The top substrate B may, in
   the alternative, be provided by a second bulky nonwoven layer or an SMS or spunbond
   ("non-bulky") nonwoven layer.
   [00150]          As described above, a laminate of the absorbent composite 910 may be
25 manufactured on-line or off-line. The laminate may be modified to incorporate additional or
   differential SAP loading (i.e., Profiled Core) as also discussed above. In an off-line process,
   the composite may be delivered as a wide sheet that is slitted and divided into individual core
   composite sections.

   convenience in describing the accompanying Figures, a complete absorbent composite
   extended to provide a complete absorbent core of a disposable absorbent article may be
   referred to as an absorbent core laminate while an absorbent composite may be used to
   describe components of a section or portion of the laminate. Elsewhere, including the claims,
 5 the terms may be used interchangeably. The absorbent core laminate 812 features a plurality
   of spaced apart pockets 814 with an aggregate 816 of SAP (superabsorbent particles (S))
   contained therein. FIG. 20C provides a detail cross-sectional, elevated view of one of these
   pockets 814. FIG 20C also depicts the components of a preferred absorbent composite 810.
   [00152]          Now referring to FIG. 28, a basic disposable absorbent article 862 (in a laid
10 flat state) is shown incorporating an absorbent core laminate 812 as the absorbent core,
   according to the disclosure. The absorbent core laminate 860 is completely covered by a
   topsheet 864 but, for convenience, the topsheet 864 is shown to be transparent. The
   absorbent core laminate 860 is supported on a wide backsheet 866 with side margins 868.
   Each side margins 868 is provided with a cutout that exhibit a concave shape on either side of
15 the absorbent core laminate 860. As generally known, the concave cutout will coincide or
   correspond to leg holes about the thighs of the user.
   [00153]          Referring again to FIG. 20C, in a preferred construction, a nonwoven material
   provides a base or bottom layer 818 of the composite (during manufacture of the absorbent
   article product). During product use, the base layer 818 may be described as being positioned
20 away from the body, as opposed to being positioned on the body-side of the absorbent
   composite 810 in direct receipt of intake. Further in this embodiment, the base nonwoven
   layer 818 has an adhesive layer 822 applied thereon. The adhesive layer 822 is preferably
   delivered, as a continuous bead, atop the base nonwoven 818 and in an advantageous open
   pattern, as will be described below.
25 [00154]          The absorbent composite also includes a SAP layer 806 positioned above the
   adhesive layer 822 and in between the bottom nonwoven 818 and a top nonwoven layer 826.
   In this embodiment, the SAP layer 824 is composed of SAP particles S only, without any
   form of binder material or matrix. It may be described also as being fluffless or pulpless.
   The top nonwoven layer 826 is preferably provided by a bulky nonwoven material with fibers
30 that extend toward and laterally entangle some SAP on or near the top surface of the SAP
   layer 806. The top nonwoven 826 is preferably bonded to the base nonwoven 818 by
   embossing and more preferably, by point bonding. Bond points 828 define the periphery of
   the pocket 814 and also, compress the resilient bulky nonwoven 826 at the pocket periphery
   to present an overall bubble or domed cross section (as shown in FIG. 20C). The simplified

   illustration of FIG. 29 provides an alternate view of the absorbent composite 810 and, more
   particularly, the components of the composite, without showing point bonding and
   compression about the periphery of the pocket 814.
   [00155]          In this preferred construction, the bulky non-woven layer 826 contacts and
 5 covers the SAP layer 824 thereby restricting travel of SAP particles S. The bulky non-woven
   layer 826 is also advantageously positioned as a top layer during manufacturing and product
   handling, thereby restricting travel or migration of SAP particles even before use. During use
   of the absorbent article, the bulky non-woven 826 is also advantageously positioned on the
   bodyside to receive and distribute intake to the SAP layer and beyond.
10 [001561          In this preferred construction, the SAP is organized into discrete, spaced-apart
   aggregates or clumps 816 of SAP, each of which is maintained in a pocket or container 814
   as described previously. The two non-woven layers 818, 826 are bonded at bond sites or,
   more specifically, at an arrangement of discrete, spaced-apart bond points 828.      The bulky
   non-woven 826 is, therefore, multiply and intermittently secured over the SAP aggregates
15 816, and helps maintain the SAP aggregates 816 in place. The unique functions and
   properties imparted on the absorbent composite and absorbent core laminate through use of
   the bulky nonwoven are described further below.
   [00157]          The exploded view of FIG. 21 reveals the various components or layers of the
   absorbent composite 810 or absorbent laminate 812 and their relative positions, according to
20 a preferred embodiment. FIG. 22 provides additional exploded views that illustrate a basic
   process or steps for making the composite, by showing the order by which the components of
   the composite are brought together. Reference should also be made to preceding descriptions
   of making an absorbent composite or an absorbent article employing the composite, including
   FIGS. 1-5 and descriptions associated therewith. Many of the process steps and process
25 components described therein may be applicable or adaptable for use in the making of the
   absorbent composite of FIGS. 19 -29.
   [00158]          In an initial step of the preferred method, a web of nonwoven 818 is conveyed
   in the conventional manner and then, passed beside an adhesive applicator. The spray
   adhesive applicator preferably delivers a continuous bead onto the nonwoven 818 in an open
30 adhesive pattern (see FIG. 22A). In this way, loops of adhesive 822a are provided on the
   surface of the nonwoven material 818 characterized by or defining open regions free of
   adhesive (rather than a uniform layer or film). The loops 822a in exemplary embodiments
   are smaller (i.e., width or diameter) than the pockets 814 previously described, with
   diameters typically in the order of 1mm to 25mm.

   [001591          FIG. 22B illustrates the delivery of SAP aggregates 816 by methods described
   herein, or otherwise known in the art, onto a substrate composed of the base nonwoven layer
   818 with an adhesive layer 822 or open pattern pre-applied thereon. Specifically, SAP is
   delivered via an airstream and, through the use of a conventional vacuum system or suction
 5 mechanism, such as those previously described herein or otherwise known in the art. Suction
   applied on and beneath the web of nonwoven 818 draws SAP toward the nonwoven 818 and
   organizes the SAP into the desired prearrangement of aggregates or clumps 816 of SAP (as
   shown in FIG. 22B). The vacuum system may employ a screen or mesh interface to better
   engage the bottom of the non-woven and define the target geometry of the SAP aggregates.
10 Thus, the interface presents a suction pattern that corresponds with the desired pocket pattern
   of the SAP aggregates 816. The vacuum system preferably draws the SAP directly from the
   stream above the web and into discrete clumps or aggregates on the web above the suction
   mechanism. Certain regions, including regions along the sides and ends are designated as
   SAP-free (as well as adhesive-free) zones and will be purposely left free of SAP.
15 [00160]          SAP generally falls directly into the desired arrangement as opposed to being
   first distributed across the web and then moved about the web before forming tighter
   concentrations on the web (as in alternate embodiments). The SAP generally does not have
   to travel over adhesive on the web to form the target plurality of SAP aggregates 816. The
   resulting web is, therefore, composed of a nonwoven base layer 818 with an open adhesive
20 pattern 822 thereon and an arrangement or layer 806 of discrete, spaced apart SAP aggregates
   816. The clumps of SAP generally lay on and contact the adhesive, but the open pattern of
   the adhesive occupies substantially less than the bottom layer of that SAP aggregate contacts.
   It should be noted, however, that a SAP particle contacting adhesive may be generally
   immobilized. Another SAP particle positioned adjacent and in contact with such
25 immobilized SAP particle may, in turn, be restricted (in movement) by and at least partly
   immobilized by that SAP particle (and/or other adjacent SAP particles). Such friction
   mechanism at least hinders horizontal movement of SAP particles.
   [00161]          As the web of nonwoven-SAP moves forward and away from the vacuum
   system, the adhesive pattern 822 acts to maintain the desired arrangement and position of
30 SAP aggregates 816. In a subsequent step, a web of a second nonwoven 826 is conveyed
   toward and then applied over the nonwoven-SAP laminate. See FIG. 22C. As discussed
   above, the preferred top nonwoven 826 layer is a bulky nonwoven. With further processing
   and travel of the SAP aggregates 816 in a process of making an absorbent article such as a
   diaper or training pants, the additional nonwoven 826 provides additional cover and acts to
                                                    34

    WO 2014/145312                                                              PCT/US2014/030051
   retain the SAP aggregates 816 in the desired pattern. In addition to providing advantageous
   functions in the finished product and during use, the bulky nonwoven 826 entangles top
   layered SAP particles S, as represented in FIG. 29, thereby furthering the immobilization of
   the SAP aggregates 816 (during product manufacture and then post-manufacture product
 5 handling). Entanglement of the SAP with the fibers of the bulky nonwoven restricts lateral
   and vertical movement of SAP near the top of the SAP aggregate 816 and also hinders
   movement of SAP directly beneath it. As noted herein, the SAP and bulky nonwoven are
   defined and selected in consideration of the desired degree of entanglement and penetration.
   [00162]          Next, the web of two nonwovens and SAP aggregates therebetween is passed
10 over to a calendar roll that engages and compresses the web. The calendar roll is equipped
   with a surface engraving having a pattern that corresponds with the pocket pattern on the
   web, as described previously. FIG. 23 depicts a typical bonded absorbent composite laminate
   812 using discontinuous point bonding. The dots reflect indentation in the bulky nonwoven
   826 after embossing. The dots are also the bond points 828 for the pockets 814 (see also the
15 cross-sectional views of FIGS. 20A-20C). Securing the two nonwovens together about the
   SAP aggregates 816 provides another mechanism for maintaining the arrangement of SAP
   aggregates 816 and the resultant absorbent laminate 812. As will be discussed herein, the
   arrangement of bond sites provides a geometric grid 830 that locate and define the pockets
   814 of SAP aggregates 816.
20 [00163]          Thus, in this exemplary embodiment, the preferred SAP laminate construction
   draws from several structural features to inhibit the migration of SAP particles from the
   desired arrangement of SAP aggregates during absorbent article product manufacture and
   post-manufacture handling. First, adhesive is provided on the base non-woven layer and SAP
   aggregates are laid on the adhesive. The optional adhesive layer is delivered, however, in an
25 open pattern of closed loops that contact only certain bottom layered SAP particles but inhibit
   travel of SAP particles beyond these contacted SAP articles. The application of the top
   nonwoven layer over the SAP aggregates augments the minimally-applied adhesive to further
   restrict movement of the SAP. Advantageously, the SAP layer delivered onto the base
   nonwoven is pulp-free and free of a matrix or binder, which optimizes the composite's
30 absorption and fluid handling properties. It is also free of adhesive but for the bottom layer
   of adhesive. Thus, much of the SAP layer, particularly, the middle part of the SAP layer,
   consists of SAP, although other materials may, in alternative embodiments, be included to
   impart beneficial properties. The predominance of the SAP-only constituency results in a
   thinner, softer, more flexible SAP construction, as discussed previously. Also, the large
                                                  35

    WO 2014/145312                                                              PCT/US2014/030051
   sections of SAP-only constitution, which are adequately maintained in position (inhibiting
   SAP particle migration), provide improved absorbent properties and fluid handling
   characteristics.
   [00164]          As a further enhancement, the preferred SAP laminate construction utilizes an
 5 arrangement of discrete or intermittent bonding points in conjunction with the laminate
   construction of FIG. 22. See FIG. 23. The embossing pattern that provides the intermittent
   or spaced part bonding points provides a synergistic effect with utilization of the SAP
   laminate construction of FIGS. 20-22 and/or the use of a bulky nonwoven layer as a top or
   bodyside layer of the absorbent laminate (or vice versa). The gap provided between bond
10 points allow for fluid to pass between SAP aggregates, including fluid flow passing from the
   SAP-only middle sections of the SAP laminate. The provision of the bulky nonwoven and/or
   adhesive reduces the need for complete or continuous bonding lines. Similarly, the position
   of the bulky nonwoven and/or point bonding reduces the amount of adhesive required for
   SAP stabilization.
15 [00165]          Furthermore, reduced constriction of the bulky nonwoven layer by using the
   embossing points, rather than longer bond points or solid bond lines, allow for the resilient
   bulky woven to expand and advantageously receive and distribute fluid intake. Pressure
   applied by the embossing compresses the bulky nonwoven at the bond point as shown in FIG.
   20C, but the resilient bulky nonwoven "bounces up" from the bond point. See also FIG. 30.
20 This results in a more open substructure well capable of fluid handling functions. Further,
   the SAP-only constituent functions to receive and absorb the fluid intake and, as necessary,
   pass fluid intake to adjacent SAP pockets via the gap between bonds. In one respect, there is
   a fluid channel that runs from the top surface of the relatively open bulky nonwoven layer,
   through the bulky nonwoven layer, and into the SAP-only body, and from the SAP-only body
25 middle layer, sideways through the gap between bond points, and then into another
   preferably, substantially SAP-only aggregate.
   [00166]          The plan view of FIG. 24 presents a bonded absorbent core laminate 812
   mutually secured by discrete bond points 828. FIG. 24 depicts a preferred pattern of SAP
   pockets 814, according to this exemplary embodiment. The laminate 812 is elongated having
30 a lateral width dimension and a longitudinal length dimension. The shape of the laminate 812
   at this stage is generally rectangular. The embossing process preferably employs an
   intermittent bonding pattern to enhance fluid flow between pockets, as described above. The
   selected pocket pattern uses diamond shaped embossing to produce diamond shaped pockets
   814. An advantage to the use of a diamond shape pockets and the corresponding grid is that,
                                                  36

    WO 2014/145312                                                                 PCT/US2014/030051
   with its straight, intersecting lines, it is easier to design and match engraving patterns on
   embossing rolls and interfaces for vacuum systems.
   [00167]          Preferably, the diamond shapes are arranged such that the embossing lines or
   series of bond points are not square with the side margins of the core. The straight lines (SL)
 5 that aligned bond sites may present on the surface of the laminate 812 are advantageously
   oriented at less than a ninety degree angle to the side margins and more preferably, between
   about 60 degrees and 30 degrees. In this way, the interconnected bonding lines (SL), which
   can provide a potential fluid pathway (i.e., above the surface as well as in the pockets 814 and
   along the lines) are longer than a perpendicular line to the side margins 834 (which another
10 pattern may represent). This addresses possible fluid leakage to the side margin 834 and
   encourages fluid path diversion into non-saturated pockets downstream.
   [00168]          The absorbent core laminate 812 also features SAP free lanes 838 proximate
   side margins 834 and proximate end margins 836. The steps for delivering SAP and
   organizing SAP aggregates on the bottom nonwoven layer are designed to leave these regions
15 free of SAP to minimized SAP usage. The regions are later sealed and in the case of the side
   margins, a curved section may be cut out of the absorbent core laminate 812 to accommodate
   leg cutouts and/or produce an hourglass shaped core. The absence of SAP in these regions
   makes for a more flexible and foldable material layers. This also avoids having to cut (or
   seal) through the relatively harder, stiffer SAP material as may be required in the
20 manufacturing process, thereby promoting cleaner and more precise cuts (and seals). Perhaps,
   more importantly, this avoids extra wear on cutting blades and maintenance and downtime of
   manufacturing equipment.
   [00169]          The plan view of FIG. 25 illustrates an alternative absorbent core laminate 840
   employing an alternative pocket pattern and bonding pattern. Instead of intermittent bonding,
25 the bond pattern employs continuous bond lines 842 that generates a solid grid. As with the
   previously described embodiment, diamond shaped pockets 844 are used. Among other
   things, the potential fluid pathway created by the connection of the bond lines is directed to
   an angle away from the side margin (i.e., 45 degrees), thereby somewhat mitigating the risk
   of direct fluid strand to side margin.
30 [00170]          As used herein, diamond shaped pockets mean a pocket having four sides and
   with two corners preferably mutually aligned with the longitudinal direction and the other
   two corners with the lateral directions. The pockets are preferably not oriented as rectangles
   square with the lateral and longitudinal centerlines of the laminate, wherein bond lines make
   for a "direct" straight line path to the side margins. As used herein, the term "grid" means the
                                                       37

   geometry established by intersecting lines along the bond sites or embossing line. Further, as
   used herein in respect to an arrangement or geometry of pockets, "direct" straight line path
   means one or more bond lines that connect to make for a continuous and unobstructed (not
   "broken") path from proximate the longitudinal centerline to the side margins wherein, the
 5 path is generally perpendicular to the side margins. Such a direct straight line path makes for
   the shortest fluid path to the side margins. For clarity, such straight line paths that are more
   than thirty degrees deviated from the perpendicular shall be referred to as an indirect straight
   line path and do not direct straight line paths. Straight line paths that are not so deviated are
   considered "direct straight" line paths.
10 [00171]          It should be noted that other "grids" and other pockets shapes and pocket
   arrangements may be employed. Some pocket shapes employed will not exhibit any direct or
   for that matter, any straight line, paths to the side margins. These include some arrangements
   previously described herein, including arrangement of circle or elliptical shaped pockets.
   [00172]          Profiled Core Composite
15 [001731          In this preferred embodiment, the method of manufacturing an absorbent core
   includes steps for delivering a profiled core construction. The method is a further version of
   the method previously described, and in one preferred process, incorporates all of the steps of
   the previous method. For example, while the earlier method may employ a single SAP
   applicator, the present method employs a second SAP applicator to augment SAP delivery by
20 the first SAP applicator. The second SAP applicator may be positioned upstream (in front) or
   downstream of the first applicator. Whereas a nozzle of the first applicator may be sized to
   cover the width of the target core, the second applicator may be sized to cover a narrowed
   portion of the core. Further, the second applicator may be programmed for delivery for a
   specified period that is a fraction of the delivery period of the first applicator. For example,
25 the first applicator may be programmed to continuously deliver to almost the entire width of
   the SAP core (except for a narrow SAP-free lane at the side margins). The second applicator
   may be sized and programmed to deliver SAP to a narrower central region and/or for an
   intermittent period that will correspond to a central region of the core. In exemplary
   embodiments, the second SAP applicator is positioned downstream of the first SAP
30 applicator thereby delivering a second dose or load of SAP over the SAP first deposited on
   the web of nonwoven. Thus, the arrangements of SAP aggregates sourced by the second
   applicator (as well as the first applicator) have a higher SAP loading than other SAP
   aggregates sourced only by the first applicator.

   [00174]         As before, the preferred process employs suction mechanisms and screens to
   organize the SAP pockets on the web. Upon delivery, the SAP loads are quickly drawn into
   the SAP aggregate formation. SAP aggregates sourced by two SAP applicators provide
   pockets with a thicker and larger SAP layer, than pockets that are not so sourced.
 5 [00175]         In the preferred arrangement, the dual SAP-loaded pockets are located in a
   central region where most intake occurs. In further embodiments, the constituents of the two
   SAP loadings may be varied to achieve a desired mixture or the desired absorbent or fluid
   handling properties. In yet further embodiments, additional SAP applicators may be
   employed and strategically located to produce the desired SAP pocket pattern and function.
10 [00176]         Use of Bulky Nonwovens
   [00177]         The "bulky" nonwoven referred to herein is, and provides, an open, fibrous
   network or web of hydrophilic but non-absorbent fibres. Further, as used herein, a bulky
   nonwovens is a fibrous web material having a thickness of between 10Opm and 10,00Opm
   (preferably 1,000pm to 5,000pm), basis weight between 15g/m 2 and 200g/m 2 (preferably,
15 between 20g/m2 and 80g/m 2 ), and density between 0.01 g/cc and 0.3 g/cc (preferably between
   0.01- 0.08g/cc). Moreover, the bulky nonwoven will have an effective pore diameter between
   300 pm to 2OOpm. Typically, particles of the SAP selected will have an average particle
   size of about 300 pm, which ensures some penetration or entanglement between SAP and the
   selected bulky nonwoven. Tables 3 and 4 below may be used in further defining the bulky
20 nonwoven and showing the interrelation between the key properties. (The shaded areas in the
   Tables point to bulky nonwoven materials according to the disclosure.) The effective pore
   diameter is estimated from web density, fiber diameter and fiber density values following the
   method of Dunstan & White, J. Colloid Interface Sci, 111 (1986), 60 wherein effective pore
   diameter = 4 * (1-solid volume fraction) / (solid volume fraction * solid density * solid
25 specific surface area).
   [00178]          Suitable fibres include polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET), polylactic acid (PLA), polyolefins, copolymers thereof and any
   combination thereof including bicomponent fibres. The fibres are usually treated with a
   surface active agent, surfactant, to modify the surface tension of the fibres so that they are
30 hydrophilic.

        [00181]          As described above in respect to FIGS. 16 and 17, there are fluid handling
       benefits that arise from the employment of a bulky nonwoven as a fabric in the absorbent
       composite. Furthermore, orientation of the absorbent composite with the bulky nonwoven
 5     positioned on the body side is particularly advantageous as it enhances the absorbent
       composite's capacity for acquisition and distribution of fluid intake. The bulky nonwoven has
       a high void volume and permeability, and allows the composite to quickly capture and
       efficiently distribute the fluid away from the insult point.
        [00182]          Additionally, the bulky nonwoven with the embossing patterns described also
10     has the following features:
                *        The "pillow" structure (see e.g., FIG. 20C, FIG. 29 and FIG. 30 ) provided by
       the bulky nonwoven as a bodyside layer creates a compressible and resilient structure that
       enhances the perception of softness.
                *        Within a pocket area, a pore size gradient exists (see e.g., FIG. 20C and FIG.
15     30) that encourages the liquid to move from the crests (more open area with larger interfiber
       distance, I) to the bonded area (more dense area with smaller interfiber spacing). This is
       illustrated in FIG. 30 which shows the bulky nonwoven 826 exhibiting smaller interfiber
       distances I toward the bond point 828. Since capillarity is inversely related to density, the
       capillarity of the denser area is higher than the more open area hence liquid within the
20     nonwoven will tend to be drawn towards the denser areas. This is particularly important for
       dryness perception since it allows any remaining liquid at the crests to drain away towards
       the bonded areas and further into the underlying SAP structure where the liquid is tightly
       held. Hence, a top surface that is relatively free of liquid is created which contributes to the
       perception of dryness. This pore gradient also discourages fluid from flowing back to the
25     surface.
                *        The discontinuous bonding pattern also contributes to the softness perception
       by creating a more flexible composite.

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   [001831         Spray Adhesive
   [00184]         Adhesives can be used to provide additional bonding for the composite and
   can be used to help secure the SAP on the nonwoven. This is needed during manufacture of
   the composite, subsequent and further processing of the disposable absorbent article
 5 incorporating the composite, and the storage and eventual use of the composite in the
   absorbent article. Ideally, the adhesive is applied to at least one of the nonwoven webs of the
   composite or adhesive can be applied to both the upper and lower nonwoven webs.
   [00185]         Suitable adhesives include hotmelt adhesives that are applied by either a slot
   coat or a spray coat applicator (such as those supplied by Nordson Corporation). In a
10 preferred embodiment, the adhesive is applied by a spray method where continuous beads of
   hotmelt adhesive are directed by air streams into patterns, such as a spiral pattern or a more
   random pattern. FIGS. 22 show one such pattern. The diameter of the spiral is in the range of
    1mm to 25mm. The advantage of such spray patterns is that the adhesive coverage on the
   nonwoven web is not uniform and there are open areas that are substantially free of adhesive.
15 These open areas provide unrestricted access for fluid flow through the nonwoven web and
   into the superabsorbent layer, whereas a uniform coating may slow down or reduce the flow
   of fluid through the web.
   [001861         In other and various embodiments in which adhesives are, the preferred
   adhesive is hydrophillic. Moreover, the concentration of adhesive in a coat varies between 0.5
20 and 100 grams per square meter. Optimally, the concentration is between 1 and 25 GSM. In a
   preferred embodiment, the concentration is between 2 and 10 GSM.
   [00187]         To illustrate possible variations of the preferred embodiment, FIG. 26 provides
   an exploded view of an absorbent core laminate 850 according to an alternate embodiment.
   The absorbent core laminate 850 employs a base nonwoven layer 818 with an adhesive
25 pattern 822 pre-applied thereon, as described previously. The laminate 850 also provides a
   first layer 816 of spaced apart SAP aggregates that occupy substantially the lateral and
   longitudinal expanse of the laminate 850. The adhesive pattern 822 and the SAP aggregates
   may be applied as described previously, with the SAP being delivered by a SAP applicator
   and organized into the desired pocket pattern with the aid of a conventional vacuum system
30 and the like, as described previously. In this variation, a second SAP applicator may be
   positioned downstream of the first SAP applicator to deposit SAP onto a selected region(s) of
   the web having the first layer 816 of SAP aggregates already provided thereon. A region
   selected to receive additional SAP constituent or perhaps, absorbent material having
   properties different from the SAP first delivered, is typically a central region that will
                                                    42

    WO 2014/145312                                                             PCT/US2014/030051
   correspond to a crotch region when the disposable absorbent article is in use. In the process
   in which the machine direction of the laminate 850 coincides with the lateral direction, the
   SAP applicator may be equipped with a nozzle or spray area that is narrower than that of the
   first SAP applicator. The region on which SAP is delivered will, therefore, be narrower than
 5 the SAP layer 816. If the machine direction coincides with the longitudinal direction, the
   second SAP applicator may be programmed to deliver SAP only during a period aligned with
   travel of the central region under the second SAP applicator.
   [00188]         Referring to FIGS. 20A and 20B, the pockets 814 in a central region 854
   contain concentrations or SAP aggregates that are greater than SAP concentrations in pockets
10 814 near longitudinal end regions 856 of the absorbent core laminate 812. Intermediate of
   these regions and the central regions, there are pockets 857 containing SAP in concentrations
   that is somewhere in the middle. The concentrations of SAP in these pockets 857 may be
   determined by the extent of the second SAP applicator and possibly a sharing of excess SAP
   between adjacent pockets. These pockets 857 may serve as a gradual transition between high
15 and low capacities of SAP and absorption and swell properties, and may produce beneficial
   fluid flow (across the absorbent core), as discussed herein.
   [00189]         Referring again to FIG. 26, this embodiment is also equipped with a second
   adhesive pattern 862 to help secure SAP in the pockets. The adhesive pattern 862 may be
   identical to the open pattern 822 preferred for application on the bottom nonwoven, and will
20 be pre-applied to the top nonwoven 826 before introduction of the top nonwoven 826 into the
   resulting laminate 850. In the resulting construction, this second adhesive pattern 862 helps
   secure particles of the SAP aggregate that contact or nearly contact the top non-woven 826.
   If a bulky nonwoven is employed as a top nonwoven 826, the adhesive helps secure SAP in
   the top layer region of the SAP aggregate with fibers of the bulky nonwoven, including
25 promoting SAP entanglement. It is possible that when two adhesive patterns are employed in
   a laminate design, as with the laminate of FIG. 26, the total amount of adhesive (e.g.,
   thickness of the bead, size of the loops) used in each pattern may be reduced. Moreover, the
   number or frequency of bond points may also be reduced. The various mechanisms for
   securing SAP in the pockets 814 act differently on the SAP and from various perspectives,
30 but work together to obtain a common objective.
   [00190]         FIG. 27 illustrates a subsequent stage in an exemplary process of making an
   absorbent core laminate and/or disposable absorbent article. A web 870 of separable
   absorbent core laminates 872 is shown being conveyed with the lateral direction coinciding
   with the machine direction. The laminates 872 are shown being prepared with an hourglass
                                                   43

    WO 2014/145312                                                               PCT/US2014/030051
   shape. The delivery of SAP onto the bottom nonwoven is provided such that SAP-free
   regions 874 are present near or along the eventual side margins 876 of individual absorbent
   core laminates. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 27, wider regions 878 near the center of the
   side margins 876 are also void of SAP in preparation of a cut to accommodate a leg hole
 5 and/or simply, produce the preferably hourglass shape that helps to more readily fit or
   accommodate the user around the crotch region. In this way, SAP usage and material cost
   may be reduced.
   [00191]          In any event, a narrow region or layer 852 of SAP aggregates is deposited atop
   the first layer 816, and in the selected central region. The vacuum system may again be
10 employed to direct the deposit of SAP to the target areas. In this way, SAP aggregates of
   higher concentrations are generated.
   [00192]          Typically, the absorbent core laminate 812 is elongated with a pair of
   longitudinally-spaced apart end regions 856 and a central region 854 therebetween. The
   absorbent core laminate is situated between the topsheet and backsheet in what is referred to
15 as a "core envelope" 880. See also cross-sections FIG. 20A and 20B. FIG. 20A may be
   described as a cross-sectional view laterally across the core envelope 880 (i.e., a cross lateral
   centerline XX) while FIG. 20B is a cross-sectional view longitudinally across the core
   envelope 880 (i.e., across longitudinal centerline YY). Absorbent core laminate 812 may
   also be described as having side margins that extend between the end regions 856. An
20 arrangement of the pockets 814 of SAP aggregates 816 is set between the side margins 812.
    As can be seen from the drawings, the arrangement defines a pattern or grid on the absorbent
   core laminate 812. About the central region 854, a pair of cutouts 882 into the side margin
   856 provides a concavity in the generally rectangular laminate 812, which reduces the
   population of pockets 814 in the central region 854. The concavity makes for a generally
25 hourglass shape to the absorbent core laminate 812. As the central region 854 generally
   corresponds with crotch region of the disposable absorbent article 862, the concavity of the
   absorbent laminate 812 and general absence of the relatively stiffer (than the topsheet and
   backsheet material) core material facilitates the deformation of the absorbent article 862 in
   the crotch region during use and helps to accommodate the contour of the user.
