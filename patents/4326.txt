           FORMABLE AQUATIC COVERINGS FOR PREVENTING BIOFOULING
                                 FIELD OF THE           INVENTION
                   The present           invention relates to                  the protection
      of    structures      from       damage        as    a    result         of    continuous
  5   exposure     to    aquatic        environments;            more      particularly        to
      devices     which     attach         to    submerged         structures,           thereby
      preventing        formation           of    biofouling;             and       even     more
      particularly         to      a       system        for       preventing            aquatic
      biofouling        containing           a    propeller            enclosure          and    a
 10   formable     and     disposable           propeller          glove         having     anti
      aquatic biofouling properties.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE              INVENTION
                   The     growth         and    attachment           of     various      marine
      organisms     on   structures in aquatic                 environments,            known as
 15   biofouling,        is      a     significant            problem           for     numerous
      industries,       including         the boating         and      shipping       industry,
      the   oil  and gas     industry, and the               fishing industry.               Most
      surfaces,      such      as     those       associated           with       boat    hulls,
      underwater      cables,      oil rig        platforms,          buoys,       and   fishing
 20   farms    and   nets,     which       are   exposed        to    coastal,        harbor   or
      ocean     waters      eventually            become        colonized           by     animal
      species, such as barnacles, mussels, bryozoans, hydroids,
      tunicates,       tubeworms,           sea     squirts,          and      various      plant
      species.        Biofouling           results        from      the      interaction        of
 25   polymeric      adhesives         produced         by     the      plant       and    animal
      species    with    the    substrates          for    which      they      are   attached.
      Despite     the     appearance          of     simplicity,           the      process     of
      biofouling       is    actually          complex        and      involves         numerous
      interactions         with      many       types        of     microorganisms            and
 30   macroorganisms.
                   While     biofouling creates                ecological problems by
      distributing        native       plant       and     animal        species        to   non
      native    environments,          its     economic       effects         are    of  greater
                                                   I

WO 2015/027129                                                                           PCT/US2014/052221
      concern.           Large        amounts     of     biofouling            on    ships       result     in
      corrosion         of     the       surfaces      and the          eventual          deterioration
      of     the     ship.           Large     amounts        of     macroorganisms                build-up
      also       cause        increases          in    the        roughness            of     the       ship's
  5   surface such that the ship experiences greater frictional
      resistance,              decreased          maneuverability,                     and        increased
      drag,          resulting              in       increased                fuel          consumption.
      Recreational             boaters        suffer        from       the      same       problems,        as
      barnacles             and        other      animals             attach           to       propellers
 10   submerged          in      water.          Navigational              buoys        or    pier       posts
      containing           surfaces         with    large        amounts         of     biofouling         are
      subjected          to      increased        stress          resulting            from       increased
      weight.                This         increased          stress           often          results        in
      decreasing             the        useful       life         of       the       structures            and
 15   necessitating continuous maintenance and/or replacement.
                        Various           methods        have        been       used        in      reducing
      biofouling            build-up.            One      of     the      more      common         methods,
      particularly              in     the    boating         and       shipping           industry,        is
      scraping.               However,          scraping           is      labor        intensive          and
 20   environmental               issues     have      been       raised        over       the     concerns
      that      scraping results               in the increased spread of                           invasive
      species.          Therefore,           there     exists a need               for devices            that
      eliminate         or     reduce       the   amount         of    biofouling            of     surfaces
      exposed to water.
 25                                DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART
                        One      strategy        for     protecting            objects         in     contact
      with water and preventing                       aquatic biofouling includes                          the
      use       of     physical           coverings.               These        coverings             act   as
      protective             devices         by      shielding               or      separating            the
 30   structures           from the         water.         For example,              U.S.      Patent      No.
      3,220,374           discloses          a    marine          protective             device.           The
      invention          is    directed         towards         a    unique       means        and method
      of    protecting            marine     equipment           from the          corrosive            action

                        U.S.     Patent No. 3,587,508 discloses an outdrive
      protective          apparatus          for     easy      attachment            to     a   boat.          The
  5   apparatus          protects          the     outdrive            of     an     inboard-outboard
      motor        from marine        growth when the boat is                           not     in    use.        A
      bag        is     placed       around           the        outdrive             unit        for        easy
      attachment           to   the      transom         of     a    boat       in     a    manner         which
      provides          a    watertight            seal        between           the        bag      and       the
 10   transom and around the outdrive unit.
                        U.S.     Patent No. 3,870,875 discloses a cover for

  5   strips     88     and      90     (Figure        12)     which       are     attached            to    the
      outside perimeter of the protective enclosure element                                                  64.
      This     provides            attachment           of      the      protective              enclosure

      described herein is that the components of the system are
  5   designed for             easy removal.                The two cables 72 and 74 are
      positioned             on      the      outside         surface       of      the       protective

      propeller           blades       when the protective                enclosure           element        64
      is    fully        extended.            The      two    cables     may     be    positioned            at
 10   points which are                  180 degrees           from each other when facing
      the     back       side      of    the    propeller.           Each       of   the     cables         may
      simply be attached to the protective                                enclosure element                  64
      via      stitching,             gluing,         or    through       the      use     of     a     small

 15   Figures          10    and      14.       The      tube    can    be    secured          at    one     or
      more points             on    each      side      of   the   outside       perimeter           of the
      protective             enclosure            element        64.         The      tubes         can      be
      designed           to    contain          a    90    degree      bend       with       an     opening
      facing         the     aft      and     the       other     end    facing        the      propeller
 20   shaft.           The     cables        72     and    74    are    secured        together           with
      the      attaching            element         76     to    form     the      single         securing
      cable        78.      The securing cable 78                   is led aft and up over a
      portion           of     the       boat,        such     as     the       swim      platform           or
      transom,          and     secured        to     the    inside     of the        boat      through         a
 25   cleat on each side of                      the boat with slight                 tension.            When
      the      boat        is      at     rest,        the    likelihood           that        the      cable
      becomes          entangled          by   an     object     and    results        in     creating          a

      biofouling           sock       20    is     expelled          from     the propellers                    into
      the     water.            The     operator           can      then     simply         retrieve             the
 10   expelled            anti-biofouling                   sock        20        from        the          water.
      Alternatively, if the anti-biofouling sock 20 can be made
      of    a degradable material,                       the      sock    can      be left           safely       in
      the water to naturally disintegrate.

      Preferably,              the       cotter pin              136     is secured to a portion of
 20   a    lanyard          138.            A     second        portion           of     the       lanyard           138     is
      attached            to      either           half        of    the       clam       shell          halves.             As
      shown         in      Figure            18,       the       lanyard            138       attaches             to     the
      bottom          surface            area         140      of     the       first         half         102      or     the
      bottom          surface            142       of     the      second          half       104       through,           for
 25   example,            an       eyelet           144.           The       amount          of      lanyard           which
      attaches            to      the       cotter           pin     136      is      preferably              less       than
      the      amount         of       lanyard          used       to     attach         to      the      bottom.             In
      this         manner,             pulling             on      the       handle           attached             to      the
      lanyard            138        results            in      pulling           the       pin        136       from       the
 30   overlapping                eyelets            132       and     134       first.            As      the      lanyard
      138       is     continually                pulled        back,         at      some       point        a    tension

      the boat.            Since they remain attached to                                  the     lanyard, the
      user       can     simply         retrieve            the       halves         by     pulling        on   the
  5   lanyard        138.         Alternative                securing           mechanisms,             including

                        Referring               to       Figures           20-22,           an      alternative
      embodiment            of   the       anti-biofouling                   structure           is    shown    and
 10   illustrated            as    a bag-like               cover        146.         The bag-like           cover
      146      is   preferably              made        of     a   pliable           plastic         or   natural
      fiber        material           which          is      impregnated,               encapsulated,             or
      coated with             econea.            The bag-like                cover       146     contains       two
      panels        148      and      150,       see       Figures          20      and     21.        Panel    148
 15   contains         a    face      152      which        forms        the      front      portion of         the
      bag-like         cover         146      and       an     edge       154      which       traverses        the
      perimeter of the face 152.                               The panel             150    contains a face
      156      which      forms         the      back        portion          of     the     bag-like        cover

      configuration              provides             for      an     opening          164.         The    opening
       164     provides          a    means         for       the      bag-like           cover        146   to   be
       arranged         over       a     structure             or     object          which       needs      to   be

       stitching            or       chemical          fastening,              their          surfaces.             An
       externally attached                      strap containing VELCRO hooks is used
 10    to     fasten         the       edges       154     and       158      together.             By     placing
       edges         154      and        158     in     close          proximity,             the     strap        168
       containing             the       VELCRO        hooks         is     placed         over      the      VELCRO
       loops 166 portions, see Figure 22.
                           As     illustrated            in     Figure         21,     the     back      face      156
 15    contains           a     slitted          portion           170      which        terminates            in     a
       portion           of        the        bag      which          extends           outwardly            facing
       cylindrical              shape        172.       The      slitted portion                  170    provides
       for       the       bag-like             cover         to       enclose          an      object        which
       contains          portions            which may          not      need      to    be     covered.           For
 20    example,          the      cylindrical            shape         172     shown        in   Figure       21    is
       designed          to     allow         the     bag-like          cover        146      to   enclose         the
       propeller            of     the      boat      but     allow        the     propeller           shaft       174
       to    extend out.                 The portions of the                    face 156          that defines
       the      slitted          areas         can     be     covered          with       VELCRO        loops       as
 25    described            above.            Aligning         the       areas       in     close      proximity
       allows         a   second          strap       176     containing            VELCRO         hooks      to    be
       placed           on      top         to     secure          them         together            around         the
       circumference                 of     the     propeller            shaft       174.          Each      of    the
       straps         168      and       176    may     contain           one     or     more      attached         0
 30    rings          (not       illustrated).                    One       or     more        lanyards           (not
       illustrated) may be attached                               to the        0-rings.            Pulling the
       lanyards            away         from       the       cover         provides            a    force        that
       results          in     removal          of     the      straps         168      and      176     from      the
       VELCRO          loops        166.         Fastened           to     the     interior          portion         of

      straps 168 and 176 through, for example, stitching.                                                      Once
      coupled to          the      D-rings,           the      straps       168     and/or         176     remain
  5   connected         to the bag thereby                       reducing         the     risk that            they
      will        be   displaced.                  One       or      more      openings            along        the
      surface of the bag may be utilized to allow the straps to
      exit the         interior portion                   and couple            to the VELCRO                loops
      166.         Once    the      straps         are      removed         from       the    VELCRO         loops
 10   166,       the    bag     is     partially            opened        and      it     can     be     removed
      from covering the object.
                        Referring              to      Figures          23-25,           an      alternative

 15   constructed of a collapsible plastic material, similar                                                      to
      a standard garbage bag,                        and is         impregnated or               coated with
      econea.          The      bag      178      contains          a   main      body       comprising           an
      opening which is sized and shaped to allow a structure to
      be       stored    within           the      interior           portion          184.         The      outer
 20   edges        186 and 184 may be made                         of a stronger material than
      that       of   the     body        to    allow        the      bag     178      to    maintain          some
       shape.            Tightening                 members,            illustrated               herein          as

       over      the    object.            Drawstring              190   and      192      are      preferably
 25    constructed             in        such        a      manner          that,         as       the        first
       drawstring           190      is       pulled        toward         the      second          drawstring
       192,         opening         182          is      reduced.                 Additionally,                  the
       drawstring          190     and        192,      when       pulled       together           maintain         a

 30    retract        back      to      their        original,           non-pulled             state.           The
       drawstrings           190 and 192              contain         eyelets         194 and          196 which
       align together when the two drawstrings are pulled toward
       each      other.        A   securing member,                    such as a cotter                   pin    198
