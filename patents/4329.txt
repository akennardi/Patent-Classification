ABSTRACT
           A location management system identifies points of interest that may be of
interest to one or more users.    The location management system defines a geofence
boundary encompassing a particular point of interest. When the location management
system determines that the user device is inside the geofence boundary -- but not, for
example, when the location management system determines that the user determines that
the user device is outside the geofence boundary -- the location management system
instructs the user device to determine wireless signals available to the user device. The
location management system then receives wireless signal data from the user device for
available wireless signals.   By matching the received wireless signal data to known
wireless signals available at the identified points of interest, the location management
system determines that the user device (and hence the user) is at the point of interest.

RELATED APPLICATION
[0001]      This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 14/179,209,
filed February 12, 2014 and entitled "Energy-Efficient Location Determination."          The
entire contents of the above-identified application are hereby fully incorporated herein by
reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]      The present disclosure relates generally to location determination, and more
particularly to determining the location of user device at a point of interest in an energy
efficient manner.
BACKGROUND
[0003]      Location data from a mobile device can be used for numerous applications.
Many applications, for example, use location data for locating friends, playing games,
and assisting a user with directions. The location data can also be used to provide an alert
on a user's mobile device when the user is the vicinity of a point of interest, such as a
business, an institution, landmark, park, or other location that would be of interest to a
user.   For example, a user may choose to be alerted every time the user is near a
particular store or restaurant, especially if the alert includes a promotional offer for the
store or restaurant of interest.
[0004]      While location data can be used for a variety of applications, efficiently
obtaining location data from a user device can be challenging -- especially when accurate
location information is needed. Conventionally, to obtain location information for nearby
locations, the user device periodically scans its environment for available wireless signals
every few minutes. The user device then communicates the location data to a location
based service, for example, which then determines the location of the user device by
recognizing the available wireless signals.
[0005]       Such periodic scanning for wireless signals, however, drains the battery life of
the user device, as does the communication of the location data to the location-based
                                               1

service. The periodic scanning for available wireless signals is particularly wasteful of
battery life, for example, when the user device is not near a point of interest.            For
example, a user may be carrying the user device while hiking in a wilderness remote area.
Nevertheless, the user device may continue its periodic scanning for available wireless
signals (even though none exist in the area).
SUMMARY
[0006]      In certain example aspects described herein, a computer-implemented method
for determining the location of a user device is provided.         A location management
system, for example, determines at a first time that a user computing device is outside a
geofence boundary       encompassing a particular point of interest.            The location
management system thus does not invoke a wireless signal detection module associated
with the user device to determine wireless signals available to the user device. At a
second that is subsequent to the first time, however, the location management system
determines that the user computing device is inside the geofence boundary encompassing
the particular point of interest.
[0007]      In response to determining at the second time that the user computing device
is inside the geofence boundary encompassing the particular point of interest, the location
management system communicates instructions to the user computing device to invoke
the wireless signal detection module associated with user computing device.                The
location management system then receives wireless signal data for a particular wireless
signal that is available to the user computing device. Based on the received wireless
signal data, the location management system determines that the particular wireless signal
available to the user computing device is associated with the particular point of interest.
The location management system thus determines -- in response to determining that the
particular wireless signal is associated with the particular point of interest -- that the user
computing device is at the particular point of interest.
[0008]      In certain other example aspects, a system for location determination is
provided herein. Also provided in certain aspects is a computer program product for
location determination.

embodiments will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
Overview
[0015]      As disclosed herein, a location management system identifies points of
interest that may be of interest to one or more users. The location management system
then defines a geofence boundary encompassing a particular point of interest. In certain
examples,    the location management system may define the geofence boundary
encompassing the point of interest in response to determining that a particular user device
is near the point of interest. The location management system may then first determine
that the user device is not at or within the geofence boundary. But when the location
management system thereafter determines that the user device is at or within the geofence
boundary, the location management system instructs the user device to determine
wireless signals available to the user device.     The location management system then
receives wireless signal data from the user device for available wireless signals.      By
matching the received wireless signal data to known wireless signals available at the
                                             3

identified points of interest, the location management system determines that the user
device (and hence the user) is at the point of interest.
[0016]       More particularly, the location management system obtains location data for
multiple points of interest. For example, the location management system may determine
location information for various points of interest that may be of interest to one or more
users.    In certain examples, a location marketing system may provide the location
management system with location information, such as for various merchant storefronts
that may be of interest to the user. The location information can be any information that
establishes the location of a point of interest, such as a street address, Ordnance Survey
Grid Reference information, and/or latitude and longitude coordinates for points of
interest. The location information may also include content regarding the location, such
as an indication of the wireless signals available at the point of interest. For example, the
location information may include a media access control (MAC) address for a wireless
access point (WAP) associated with a particular point of interest.              The location
management system may then store the location information -- along any wireless signal
information for the point of interest -- in a point-of-interest record for each identified
point of interest.
[0017]       After obtaining location information for various points of interest, the location
management system determines geofence boundaries associated with the points of
interest. For example, the location management system may receive geofence boundary
data from a marketing system associated with a point of interest.             Additionally or
alternatively, the location management system may define geofence boundaries for one or
more points of interest. For example, if the location management system determines that
a particular user device is near point of interest, the location management system may
define a geofence boundary that encompasses the point of interest.              The location
management system may then, in certain examples, communicate the geofence boundary
data to the user device that is near the point of interest.
[0018]       Once the location management system determines a geofence boundary for a
particular point of interest, the location management system determines the location of
one or more user devices relative to the geofence boundary.             That is, the location
management system determines if a particular user device is at or outside the geofence
                                               4

boundary. Based on the location of the user device, the location management system
instructs the user device to determine local wireless signals that are available to the user
device. The wireless signals may include any type of non-wired signal available to the
user device, such as a Wi-Fi wireless local area network (WLAN) signal, Bluetooth
signal, near field communication (NFC) signal, or other signals.
[0019]      If the location management system determines that the user device is outside
the geofence boundary, the location management system does not instruct the user device
to determine wireless signals available to the user device. That is, if user device has not
entered the geofence boundary, the location management system determines, for
example, that that user device is not close enough to the point of interest to accurately
determine available wireless signals from the point of interest.       Hence, the location
management system does not instruct the user device to search for wireless signals, which
in turn reduces power consumption by the user device as described herein. The wireless
signals may include any type of signal available to the user device, such as a Wi-Fi
wireless local area network (WLAN) signal, Bluetooth signal, near field communication
(NFC) signal, or other signals.
[0020]      Conversely, if the geofence management system determines that the user
device is within the geofence boundary, the location management system provides
instructions to the user device to determine local wireless signals that are available to the
user device. That is, the location management system determines that -- because the user
device is inside the geofence boundary -- the user device is close enough to the point of
interest to accurately determine available wireless signals.          Hence, the location
management system instructs the user device to determine local wireless signals that are
available to the user device when the user device is inside the geofence boundary. The
user device then determines wireless signal data for wireless signals available to the user
device. For example, by activating a wireless signal detection module associated with the
user device, the user device may determine a media access control (MAC) address for a
wireless access point (WAP) that is available to the user device.          The user device
communicates the wireless signal data to the location management system, and the
location management system receives the wireless signal data.
                                              5

[0021]      After receiving the wireless signal data, the location management system
reads the wireless signal data to determine the wireless signals available to the user
device. The location management system then compares the available wireless signals
with the record of wireless signals associated with the point-of-interest record.   If the
location management system identifies a match for an available wireless signal in the
record -- such as a matching media access control (MAC) address -- the location
management system determines that the available wireless signal is associated with the
corresponding point of interest in the record. Hence, because the user device is close
enough to the point of interest to determine that the wireless signal associated with the
point of interest is available to the user device, the location management system
determines that the user device is at the particular point of interest.
[0022]      By instructing the user device to determine available wireless signals after
determining that the user device is at or inside a geofence boundary, the methods and
systems described herein reduce battery consumption of the device. That is, the methods
and systems described herein shift the timing of when a user device primarily determines
wireless signals available to the device to when the user device is actually close to the
point of interest. Hence, by employing the methods and systems described herein, a user
device does not waste energy (and unnecessarily consume battery power) by attempting
to determine available wireless signals when the user device is outside a geofence
boundary for a point of interest (and thus not near the point of interest).
Example System Architectures
[0023]      Turning now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like (but not
necessarily identical) elements throughout the figures, example embodiments            are
described in detail.
[0024]      Figure 1 is a block diagram depicting a system 100 for energy-efficient
location determination, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
[0025]      As depicted in Figure 1, the exemplary operating environment 100 includes a
user network computing device 110, a location marketing computing system 130, and a
location management computing system 140. In another example embodiment, two or
more of these systems (including systems 110, 130, and 140) or parts thereof are
integrated into the same system. In certain example embodiments, a user 101 associated
                                               6

with a user device 110 must install an application and/or make a feature selection on the
user device 110 to obtain the benefits of the methods and techniques described herein.
[0026]      Each network 105 includes a wired or wireless telecommunication means by
which network devices (including devices 110, 130, and 140) can exchange data. For
example, each network 105 can include a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area
network ("WAN"), an intranet, an Internet, a storage area network (SAN), a personal area
network (PAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wireless local area network
(WLAN), a virtual private network (VPN), a cellular or other mobile communication
network, Bluetooth, near field communication (NFC), or any combination thereof or any
other appropriate architecture or system that facilitates the communication of signals,
data, and/or messages. Throughout the discussion of example embodiments, it should be
understood that the terms "data" and "information" are used interchangeably herein to
refer to text, images, audio, video, or any other form of information that can exist in a
computer-based environment.
[0027]      Each network computing device 110, 130, and 140 includes a device having a
communication module capable of transmitting and receiving data over the network 105.
For example, each network device 110, 130, and 140 can include a server, desktop
computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, a television with one or more processors
embedded therein and / or coupled thereto, smart phone, handheld computer, personal
digital assistant ("PDA"), or any other wired or wireless, processor-driven device. In the
example embodiment depicted in Figure 1, the network devices 110, 130, and 140 are
operated by end-users or consumers, location marketing system operators, and location
management system 140 operators.
[0028]      The user 101 can employ a communication application 111, such as a web
browser application 114 or a stand-alone application, to view, download, upload, or
otherwise access documents or web pages via a distributed network 105.                 The
communication application 111 of the user computing device 110 can interact with web
servers or other computing devices connected to the network 105.         For example, the
communication application 111 can interact with the user network computing device 110,
the location marketing system system 130, and/or the location management system 140.
The communication application 111 may also comprise a web browser (not shown),
                                              7

which provides a user interface, for example, for accessing other devices associated with
the network 105.
[0029]      The user device 110 includes, for example, a location application 112 that is
configured to interact and communicate with the location management system 140 and/or
the location marketing system 130 via the communication application 111 and the
network 105. For example, the location application 112 can be used and configured to
receive and send device location data to the location management system 140 and the
location marketing system 130. As used herein, "location data" can include any data
processed in an electronic communications network or by an electronic communications
service that indicates the geographical position of the user device 110. For example, the
location data may include latitude and longitude for the user device 110 or a location of a
point of interest.
[0030]      The location application 112 may also be configured to communicate and
interact with a location-based service provider (not shown) that, in conjunction with the
user device 110, facilitates determination of the location of the user device 110. For
example, the location application 112 may, along with a location-based service, rely on
Wi-Fi signals and cellular communication towers to determine the location of the user
device 110.     Additionally or alternatively, the location application 112 may rely on
satellites, Global Positioning System ("GPS") location technology, a Network Location
Provider ("NLP"), a map application, or other location identifying technology of the user
device 110 to determine location data for the user device 110.            Additionally or
alternatively, the location application 112 may rely on enhanced GPS systems and
methods, such as those associated with a Differential Global Positioning System
("DGPS").      In certain example embodiments, the location application 112 may be
configured to send and receive alert content from the location management system 120
and/or the location marketing system 130. For example, location application 112 may be
configured to receive content regarding coupons, specials offers, or other items related to
the marketing efforts of the location marketing system 130. The location application 112
may also be configured to receive content unrelated to marketing efforts, such as names
of parks or other geographic landmarks that may be of interest to a user 101.
                                              8

[0031]      The user device 110 also includes a wireless signal detection module 113 that
operates to detect and identify local wireless signals present in the environment of the
user device 110 and hence available to the user device 110. For example, the wireless
signal detection module 113 may detect wireless signal data from a metropolitan area
network (MAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN) signal, a Bluetooth device or
signal, and/or a near field communication (NFC) device or signal. The wireless signal
detection module 113 may also be configured to determine, for example, a media access
control (MAC) address or other identifier that is unique to the network interfaces of the
identified wireless signals.    The wireless signal detection module 113 may also be
configured, for example, to communicate identified wireless signal data to other devices
on the network 105, such as the location management system 140. For example, the
wireless signal detection module 113 may communicate wireless signal data to the
location management system 140 either directly or via the communication application
111.
[0032]      The user device 110 includes a data storage unit 117 that is accessible by the
communication application 111, location application 112, and the wireless signal
detection module 113. In certain embodiments, for example, the data storage unit 117
may store data regarding the location of the device, such as Wi-Fi hotspots or cellular
communication towers that are or have been available to the user device 110. The data
storage unit 117 of the user device 110 can also store content related to the location data,
such as name of the location. The exemplary data storage unit 117 can include one or
more tangible computer-readable media. The data storage unit 117 can be stored on the
user device 110 or can be logically coupled to the user device 110. For example, the data
storage unit 117 can include on-board flash memory and/or one or more removable
memory cards or removable flash memory.
[0033]      The location marketing system 130 represents a system that provides location
data for points of interest to the location management system 140.            The location
marketing system 130 includes a location-marketing server 131 and associated web site
132. The location marketing system server 131, for example, represents the computer
implemented system that the location marketing system 130 employs to provide point-of
interest location data to the location management system 140. For example, the server
                                             9

131 of the location marketing system 130 may determine physical locations of various
merchants that may be of interest to one or more users 101.         The server 131 of the
location marketing system 130 may also determine additional content information
regarding the points of interest, such as the name of the points of interest and local
wireless signals that are available at the points of interest.
[0034]      In certain example embodiments, the location marketing system 130 may
represent any number of systems that location management system 140 may use to obtain
point-of-interest location data and content information for each point of interest. For
example, the location marketing system 130 may be the marketing system of a product
manufacturer or a service provider. The location marketing system 130 may be a social
network system of a user 101 that can provide preferences and historical data of a user's
activities. The location marketing system 130 may be a coupon aggregator or provider
for various merchants.      The location marketing system 130 may also be a mapping
program. The location marketing system 130 may be any other service or system that
may provide location data and content information that the location management system
140 can use to define the location of a point of interest and to obtain content information
for the point of interest. In certain example embodiments, the location marketing system
130 may determine geofence boundaries that encompass one or more points of interest
associated with the location marketing system.
[0035]      In certain example embodiments, the location marketing system 130 may
include a data storage unit 137 accessible by the server 131 of the location marketing
system 130.     The data storage unit 137 can include one or more tangible computer
readable storage devices.      The data storage unit 137 can be stored on the location
marketing system 130 or can be logically coupled to location marketing system 130. For
example, the data storage unit 134 can include on-board flash memory and/or one or
more removable memory cards or removable flash memory.                 In certain example
embodiments, the location marketing system 130 may store point of interest location data
and associated content information for each point of interest on the data storage unit 137.
[0036]      The location management system 140 represents, for example, a system for
identifying points of interest, determining geofence boundaries for the points of interest,
determining when a user device enters the geofence boundary, and instructing a user
                                               10

device 110 to determine wireless signals available to the user device as described herein.
Based on the available wireless signals, the location management system 140 may also
determine the location of the user device 110.
[0037]       The location management computing system 140 comprises a web sever 141
and associated web site 142.        The web server 121, for example, may represent the
computer-implemented system that the location management computing system 140
employs to manage geofences on behalf of a user 101. In certain example embodiments,
a user 101 may access the website 142 of the location management computing system
140 to associate points of interest with the location management computing system 140.
The location management computing system 140, such as through the web server 141,
can also be used and configured to receive point-of-interest location data from the
location marketing system 130 via the network 105, a merchant system (not shown), or
any other system that provides location data for points of interest.          The location
management computing system 140 can likewise be used and configured to receive and
store content information regarding the points of interest. In certain embodiments, the
location management computing system 140 comprises a web-crawler (not shown), for
example, that obtains and indexes location data for points of interest that may be of
interest to users generally or to a particular user 101.
[0038]       The location management computing system 140 may include an accessible
data storage unit 147. In certain example embodiments, the data storage unit 147 stores
location data for the user device, such as cellular communication towers and Wi-Fi
signals that are or have been available to the user device 110. The data storage unit 137
may also store point-of-interest location information and content information received
from the location marketing system 130, for example. The exemplary data storage unit
147 can include one or more tangible computer-readable media. The data storage unit
147 can be stored on the user device 110 or can be logically coupled to the user device
110. For example, the data storage unit 147 can include on-board flash memory and/or
one or more removable memory cards or removable flash memory.           In certain example
embodiments, a record for points of interest -- such as a point-of-interest record 143 that
includes location and content data for one or more points of interest -- may be associated
with the data storage unit 147.
                                                11

[0039]       In certain example embodiments, the location management functions of the
location management system 140 may execute and operate independently of the location
application 112. Additionally or alternatively, the location management functions of the
location management system 140 may execute completely or partially within or as part of
the location application 112, or as a companion application to the location application
112 on the user device 110. In certain example embodiments, the location management
system 140 may use a location provider (not shown) that determines the location of the
user device 110 based on, for example, location data received from the location
application     112.     The location provider may rely on Wi-Fi signals, cellular
communication        data,  satellites, a Global Positioning      System ("GPS") location
technology, a Network Location Provider ("NLP"), a map application, or other location
identifying technology of the user device 110 to determine the user device location.
[0040]       It will be appreciated that the network connections shown in Figure 1 are
exemplary and that other means of establishing a communications link between the
computers and devices can be used. Additionally, those having ordinary skill in the art
having the benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that the user device 110, the
location management system 140, and the location marketing system 130 illustrated in
Figure 1 can have any of several other suitable computer system configurations.           For
example, a user device 110 embodied as a mobile phone or handheld computer may or
may not include all the components described herein.
Example Processes
[0041]       The components of the example operating environment 100 are described
hereinafter with reference to the example methods illustrated in Figures 2-4.
[0042]       Figure 2 is a block flow diagram depicting a method for or energy-efficient
location determination, in accordance with certain example embodiments.
[0043]       With reference to Figures 1 and 2, in block 205, the location management
system 140 identifies points of interest. That is, the location management system 140
obtains and stores location information for multiple, geographical locations that might be
of interest to a broad range of different users 101.        For example, the locations may
comprise specific merchant storefronts, retailers, restaurants, landmarks, buildings, parks,
rail stations, airports, ports, sports arenas, or any other location that might be of interest
                                                12

to one or more users 101. The location information for the points of interest may include
any information that defines the physical location of a point of interest. For example, the
location information may include the latitude and longitude coordinates of each point of
interest.  Additionally or alternatively, the location information may include the street
address for each point of interest or the Ordnance Survey Grid Reference information for
the point of interest. In certain example embodiments, the location management system
140 may convert street address location data to latitude and longitude coordinates for the
points of interest.
[0044]      The location management system 140 may also determine information about
the points of interest, such as content information associated with a particular point of
interest.  For example, the content information may include the name of the point of
interest, such as the name of a merchant storefront. Additionally or alternatively, the
content information for a point of interest may include information for local wireless
signals that are available at the point of interest. That is, the location management system
140 may determine Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth signals, near field communication (NFC)
signals, or other wireless signals that are available to a user device 110 at the geographic
location of the point of interest. For example, the location management system 140 may
obtain a media access control (MAC) address for a Wi-Fi signal available at a particular
point of interest.
[0045]      The location management system 140 can obtain location information -- and
associated location content information -- for each point of interest from any source. For
example, the location marketing system 130 may provide the location management
system 140 with location information and associated content for points of interest related
to the marketing efforts of the location marketing system 130.                Additionally or
alternatively, merchants can provide the location management system 140 with location
information and associated content for merchant storefronts of the merchant.              For
example, merchants may provide the location management system 140 with location data
for point-of-sale terminals associated with the merchant. Additionally or alternatively, a
location-based     service provider (not shown), for example, may provide location
information for various points of interest to the location management system 140.
                                                13

[0046]      In certain example embodiments, the location management system 140 may
gather point-of-interest location information and associated content. For example, the
location management system 140 may rely on a web crawler (not shown) to obtain
location data (and content information) for points of interest, such as by accessing
websites for various points of interest. Additionally or alternatively, a user 101 may
identify points of interest for the location management system 140. For example, a user
101 may, such as through a web site 142 of the location management system 140, provide
names of points of interest to the location management system 140. The user 101 may
also enable the user device 110 to provide available wireless signal information to the
location management system 140, such as when a user 101 is at or near a particular point
of interest. The location management system 140 then determines the location for the
points of interest for the user-provided information, along with any content pertinent to
the points of interest, such as wireless signals available at the location.
[0047]      In certain example embodiments, the location management system 140 may
rely on the user history of the user 101 to identify points of interest for a particular a user
 101.  The user history can include, for example, the user's social network content, user
content, purchase history, search history, or any other items related to the user's online
activities.  For example, if a user 101 frequently purchases electronics, the location
management system 140 may obtain location data for electronics stores -- as points of
interest -- on behalf of the user 101. If a user 101 frequents a coffee shop, the location
management system 140 may determine location information -- and associated content
information such as available wireless signals -- for the coffee shop.
[0048]      Once the location management system 140 obtains location information and
associated content information for multiple points of interest, the location management
system 140 can strip the location information and associated content of any user
identifying information. Hence, the location management system 140 obtains only data
showing the location of a point of interest and content for the point of interest. For
example, the location management system 140 may strip from the location information
and associated content any information placing a particular user device 110 at a particular
location at a particular time.
                                               14

[0049]      The location management system 140 may then store the stripped location
information for points of interest -- along with the stripped content associated with each
point of interest -- in an accessible database.      For example, the location management
system 140 may store the location coordinates for a particular point of interest -- along
with a record of local wireless signals available at the location -- in a point-of-interest
record 143 associated with the location management system 140.                  The location
management system 140 can then later assess the point-of-interest record 143, for
example, so that the location management system 140 can later retrieve the location
information for a point of interest (and the content associated with the point) from the
point-of-interest record 143.
[0050]      In block 210, the location management system 140 determines a geofence
associated with a point of interest.        In certain example embodiments, the location
management system 140 may receive geofence boundary data from a location marketing
service 130. That is, when providing location information to the location management
system 140 for a point of interest, the location marketing service 130 may provide
geofence boundary data to the location management system 140 for a geofence
encompassing the point of interest.        Additionally or alternatively, after identifying a
particular point of interest, the location management system 140 may determine geofence
data for a geofence boundary encompassing the particular point of interest. For example,
an operator of the location management system 140 may configure the geofence
boundary to be a certain radius from the point of interest.              In certain example
embodiments, after determining geofence boundary data for a point of interest, the
location management system 140 communicates the geofence boundary information to
the user device 110.
[0051]      In certain example embodiments, the location management system 140 may
determine a geofence boundary encompassing a point of interest in response to the user
device being near the point of interest. For example, the location management system
140 may determine the location of a user device 110 of a user 101. Based on the location
of the user device 110, the location management system 140 may determine points of
interest that are in the proximity of the user device 110.        The location management
system 140 then defines a geofence boundary around one or more the points of interest
                                               15

that are in the proximity of the user device 110. The details of such an embodiment, as
provided in block 210, are described in further detail below with reference to Figure 3.
[0052]      Figure 3 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 210 for determining a
geofence    for a    specific  point-of-interest,  in  accordance   with   certain  example
embodiments, as referenced in block 210 of Figure 2.
[0053]      With reference to Figures 1 and 2, in block 305 of method 210, the location
management system 140 obtains a location of a user device 110.           That is, to manage
geofence-based alerts for a particular user, the location management system 140, at the
option of the user 101, receives and monitors the location of the user device 110, such as
a mobile phone of the user 101. A location application 112 on the user device 110, for
example, determines the location of the user device 110, such as the latitude and
longitude coordinates of the user device 110. For example, the location application 112
coordinates with a location-based service to determine the location of the user device
110.
[0054]      Additionally or alternatively, the location application 112 can rely on a global
positioning system to determine the location of the user device 110.        Additionally or
alternatively, the location for the user device 110 may comprise any other suitable
location data, such as the street address for the user device 110 or Ordnance Survey Grid
Reference information for the user device 110.          The location application 112, for
example, communicates the location data to the location management system 140, and
the geofence management system receives the location data.              In certain example
embodiments, the user 101 may have to provide or adjust a setting on the user device 110
in order for the location management system 140 to obtain the location of the user device
110. For example, the user 101 may have to provide or adjust a setting of the location
application 112 so that the location application 112 can determine location information of
the user device 110.
[0055]      In certain example embodiments, the location management system 140
converts location data to latitude and longitude coordinates for the user device 110. In
certain example embodiments, the location management system 140 -- and an associated
location provider (not shown) -- operate as a location-based service that, in conjunction
with the location application 112 of the user device 110, determine and monitor the
                                              16

location of the user device 110 (based on user authorization to determine and monitor the
location of the user device 110). For example, the determine and monitor the location of
the user device 110 uses the location provider to determine and monitor the location of
the user device 110 based on location data received from the location application 112 of
the user device 110.
[0056]      In certain example embodiments, an application on the user device 110, such
as the location application 112, may periodically refresh the location data for the user
device 110.     For example, the location application 112 may, in association with a
location-based service or global positioning system, determine the location of the user
device 110 at configurable intervals. By refreshing the location data, location application
112 on the user device 110 obtains new location data when the device moves to a
different location.    In certain example embodiments, the location application 112
communicates the location data of the user device 110 to the location management
system 140 when new location data is obtained.               Additionally or alternatively, the
location application 112 on the user device 110 may periodically communicates the
location data to the location management system 140 at configurable intervals, regardless
of whether new location data was obtained during the refresh. The location management
system 140 then receives the location information for the user device 110.
[0057]      In block 310, the location management system 140 identifies specific points of
interest based on the location of the user device 110.            That is, after determining the
location of the user device 110, the location management system 140 relies on the
location data for points of interest to identify points of interest that are near or nearby the
determined location of the user device 110.            For example, the location management
system 140 accesses point-of-interest location data, such as from the point-of-interest
record 143, to identify points of interest near the user device 110. Nearby points of
interest, for example, can comprise any or all points of interest that are within a
configurable distance or radius around the user device 110. For example, the location
management system 140 may determine that the near or nearby points of interest are
those that are within a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 80, 100, or
more kilometer radius of the user device 110.
                                                 17

[0058]     To determine whether a particular point of interest falls within a configurable
radius around the user device 110, for example, the location management system 140 can
compare the received location data of the user device 110 with the location data for
points of interest that location management system 140 has obtained. For example, the
location management system 140 can compare the latitude and longitude coordinates of
the user device 110 with the latitude and longitude coordinates for points of interest that
location management system 140 maintains in the point-of-interest record 143.        If the
location data for a point of interest places the point of interest within the configurable
radius around the user device, for example, the location management system 140
determines that the point of interest is near the user device 110 (and hence presumably
the user).
[0059]     In certain example embodiments, the location management system 140 may
identify specific points of interests that the location management system 140 anticipates
will be near the user device 110.      That is, the location management system 140 may
receive or obtain information indicating that the user device 110 will be near specific
points of interest.   For example, a user 101 may enter destination information into a
mapping application (not shown) on the user device. Based on the current location of the
user device and the location of the destination, the mapping application can determine a
route for the user device 110.       The location application 112, for example, may be
configured to receive the planned route and destination information from the mapping
application and then communicate the planned route and destination information to the
location management system 140.        The location management system 140 receives the
planned route and intended destination information for the user device 110. The location
management system 140 can then identify specific points of interest along the planned
route and at the expected destination.
[0060]     In block 315, the location management system 140 defines a geofence
boundary encompassing a specific point of interest. That is, the location management
system 140 determines geofence boundary data for a geofence, the boundary of which
contains the point of interest. For example, the location management system 140 may
define latitude and longitude       coordinates that encompass     the point of interest.
Additionally or alternatively, the geofence boundary data encompassing the point of
                                               18

interest can be a predefined boundary, such as city or county line boundaries. In certain
example embodiments, the geofence boundary may be a dynamic boundary.                    For
example, if the user device 110 moves, the location management system 140 may define
a new geofence boundary based on the movement of the user device 110.
[0061]      In certain example embodiments, the geofence boundary data can comprise a
location point and a defined, configurable radius around the location point.            As a
configurable radius, the radius around the location point can be any distance that the
location management system 140 determines. For example, the configurable radius of
the clustered geofence boundary around a mall may be 200 meters, such that a user
device 110 in the mall parking lot, or a user device 110 entering the mall, would be inside
the geofence boundary.       Alternatively, the configurable radius may be larger.       For
example, the location management system 140 may define a geofence boundary radius of
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 80, 100, or more kilometers around a point of
interest.
[0062]      In certain example embodiments, the geofence boundary data may encompass
the point of interest by establishing a geofence that does not rely on a radius, but rather a
defined region or barrier between the point of interest and the user device 110. That is,
the location management system 140 establishes a pass-through geofence barrier between
the point of interest and the user device 110. For example, the location management
system 140 may define a region that is five kilometers long and 200 meters wide and that
lies between the point of interest and the user device 110, thus forming a five kilometer
barrier line between the point of interest and the user device 110. When the user device
110 passes through the geofence barrier line, the location management system 140
determines that the user device 110 is inside the geofence boundary as described herein.
[0063]      In block 320, location management system 140, in certain example
embodiments, communicates the geofence boundary data to the user device 110. That is,
after the location management system 140 determines geofence boundary data
encompassing a specific point of interest, the location management system 140 transmits
the geofence data to the user device 110. For example, the location management system
140 transmits latitude and longitude coordinates for the geofence boundary to the user
device 110, such as via the network 105. The user device 110 receives the transmission,
                                              19

and then stores the geofence boundary data, such as in the cache of the user device 110
and/or on the data storage unit 114 of the user device 110. The user device 110 can then,
for example, determine if the user device has entered the geofence boundary as described
herein. Alternatively, in certain example embodiments that location management system
140 may, after determining the geofence boundary data, rely on received location data
from the user device to determine the location of the user device 110 relative to the
geofence boundary. That is, in certain example embodiments, the location management
system 140 may not communicate the geofence boundary data to the user device 110, but
instead determine -- based on the location the user device 110 -- whether the user device
is inside the geofence boundary.
[0064]      Returning to Figure 2, in block 215 of Figure 2, the location management
system 140 determines the location of a user device 110 relative to the geofence
associated with a point of interest.      That is, the location management system 140
determines whether the user device is at or inside the geofence boundary associated with
the point of interest. For example, the location application 112 on the user device 110,
such as the location application 112, may communicate location data for the user device
110 to the location management system 140. The location management system 140 then
determines that the user device is at or within the geofence boundary. For example, the
location application 112 may periodically communicate location data for the user device
110 to the location management system 140 at configurable intervals, such as at
configurable location data refresh times.
[0065]      Based on the location data received from the user device 110, the location
management system 140 compares the location data of the user device 110 with the
geofence boundary data. At a first time, for example, the location management system
140 may determine that the user device is not at or within a geofence boundary associated
with a point of interest. At a subsequent second time, however, the location management
system 140 may determine that the user device 110 is at or inside the geofence boundary.
Hence, the location management system 140 determines that the user device 110 has
entered the geofence boundary for the point of interest.
[0066]      Additionally or alternatively, an application on the user device 110, such as
the location application 112, monitors the location of the user device 110 relative to the
                                             20

geofence boundary. For example, the location application 112 may periodically refresh
the device location data at configurable intervals.       The location application 112 then
compares the location data of the user device 110 with the geofence boundary data. If at
a first time, for example, the location application 112 determines that the user device 110
is not at or within (inside) the geofence boundary, the location application 112
subsequently determines the location of the user deice 110. If at a subsequent, second
time the location application 112 determines that the user device 110 is at or within the
geofence boundary, the location application 112 may, in certain example embodiments,
communicate a notice of the geofence entrance event to the location management system
140. That is, the location application 112 informs the location management system 140
that the user device 110 is at or within the geofence boundary for the point of interest.
Alternatively, in response to determining that the user device 110 is at or inside the
geofence boundary, the location application 112 may invoke the wireless signal detection
module 113 as described herein.
[0067]       If the user device 110 has not entered the geofence boundary for a particular
point of interest, the method follows the "NO" branch of block 220 to block 225, in
accordance with certain example embodiments.         If, however, the location management
system 140 determines -- or if an application of the user device 110 determines -- that the
user device has entered the geofence boundary associated with a particular point of
interest, then the method follows the "YES" branch of block 220 to block 230, in
accordance with certain example embodiments.
[0068]       In block 225, the location management system 140 does not invoke a wireless
signal detection module 113 of the user device 110. For example, if at a first time the
location application 112 on the user device 110 determines that the user device 110 is not
at or within the geofence boundary for a point of interest, the location application 112
does not inform the location management system 140 of an entrance event. Hence, the
location management system 140, for example, does not instruct the user device 110 to
invoke the wireless signal detection module 113 on the user device 110.          Similarly, if
based on received location data for the user device 110 the location management system
140 determines at a first time that the user device 110 is not at or within a geofence
                                              21

boundary, the location management system 140 does not invoke the wireless signal
detection module 113 on the user device 110.
[0069]      In block 230, based on determining that the user device 110 is at or within
(inside) the geofence boundary, the location management system 140 invokes the
wireless signal detection module 113 on the user device 110.         That is, in response to
determining that the user device 110 is at or within the geofence boundary, the location
management system 140 activates the wireless signal detection module 113 on the user
device 110. The wireless signal detection module 113 then determines wireless signals
available to the user device 110 as described herein.
[0070]      For example, at a first time, the location management system 140 may
determine that the user device 110 has not entered the geofence boundary for a point if
interest, and hence not activate the wireless signal detection module 113 as described
herein. But at a subsequent, second time, for example, the location management system
140 may determine -- based on received location data from the user device 110 -- that the
user device 110 has entered the geofence boundary for the point of interest. Hence, in
response to determining that the user device 110 is at or inside the geofence boundary for
the point of interest, the location management system 140 invokes the wireless signal
detection module 113 on the user device 110.           In certain example embodiments, an
application on the user device 110, such as the location application 112, may -- in
response to determining that the user device 110 has entered the geofence associated with
the point of interest -- invoke the wireless signal detection module 113.
[0071]      By activating an otherwise inactive wireless signal detection module 113, for
example -- when the location management system 140 determines that the user device
110 is at or inside the geofence boundary for the point of interest -- the location
management system 140 reduces battery consumption of the user device 110 (compared
to otherwise activating the wireless signal detection module 113 when the user device is
outside the geofence boundary).       In other words, the user device 110 does not waste
energy scanning for a wireless signal when the user device 110 is not near the point of
interest, as determined by the user device 110 being outside (not at or within) the
geofence boundary for the point of interest.
                                               22

[0072]       In block 235, the location management system 140 receives wireless signal
data from the user device 110. For example, as a consequence of invoking the wireless
signal detection module 113 on a user device 110 as described in block 230, the wireless
signal detection module 113 scans the local environment for available wireless signals.
The wireless signals, for example, may include available Wi-Fi signals, Bluetooth
signals, near field communication (NFC) signals, or other wireless signals that are
available to a user device 110 at the geographic location of the point of interest. The user
device 110, such as via the wireless signal detection module 113 and the communication
application 111, then communicates wireless signal data for the available wireless signals
to location management system 140 via the network 105.           The location management
system 140 then receives the wireless signal data via the network 105.         The wireless
signal data may include, for example, information that is unique to each of the available
wireless signals.    For example, a Wi-Fi signal for a particular point of interest may
include a media access control (MAC) address for the Wi-Fi signal.
[0073]       In block 240, the location management system 140 determines that a wireless
signal available to the user device 110 is associated with the point of interest.        For
example, based on the received wireless data from the user device 110, the location
management system 140 reads the wireless signal data to determine a match for the
wireless signal, such as a match in the point-of-interest record 143.        If the location
management system 140 identifies a match, the location management system determines
that the received wireless signal data corresponds to a wireless signal at the point of
interest. The details of block 240 are described in further detail below with reference to
Figure 4.
[0074]       Figure 4 is a block flow diagram depicting a method 240 for determining an
available wireless signal, in accordance with certain example embodiments, as referenced
in block 240 of Figure 2.
[0075]       With reference to Figures 1 and 2, in block 405 of method 240, the location
management system 140 reads wireless signal data received from user device 110. That
is, the location management system 140 determines the content of the wireless signal data
received from the user device 110. For example, if the wireless signal detection module
113 of the user device 110 detects a wireless Wi-Fi signal for a particular point of
                                             23

interest, the wireless signal data may include a media access control (MAC) address for a
specific Wi-Fi wireless signal. The location management system 140 thus reads the
received wireless data and determines -- based on the content of the data -- the media
access control (MAC) address for the Wi-Fi signal of the point of interest.
[0076]       In block 410, the location management system 140 compares the determined
wireless signal data content with a record of wireless signal information. As described
above in block 205, for example, the location management system 140 may receive
wireless signal information for particular points of interest when identifying points of
interest. For example, the location management system 140 may obtain a media access
control (MAC) address for a Wi-Fi signal available at a particular point of interest. The
location management system 140 may then store the wireless signal information in a
record, such as the point-of-interest record 143. By comparing the content of the wireless
signal data received from the user device 110 with the wireless signal information in the
point-of-interest record 143, for example, the location management system 140 attempts
to determine a match for the wireless signal content.             For example, the location
management system 140 may identify a media access control (MAC) address in the
point-of-interest record 143 that matches a media access control (MAC) address received
from in the wireless signal data from the user device 110.
[0077]       If the location management system 140 identifies a match for the wireless
signal data content, such as in the point-of-interest record 143, then the method follows
the "YES" branch of block 415 to block 420, in accordance with certain example
embodiments.      If, however, the location management system 140 does not identify a
match, the method follows the "NO" branch of block 415 back to block 230, in certain
example embodiments. That is, if the location management system 140 does not identify
a match, the location management system 140 may again invoke the wireless signal
detection module 113 on the user device 110, such as in an attempt to obtain wireless
signal data for which a match may exist.
[0078]       In block 420, the location management system 140 determines that a wireless
signal available to the user device 110 is associated with the location for the point of
interest. That is, based on a match for the wireless signal data, such as a match in the
point-of-interest record 143 for the point of interest, the location management system 140
                                              24

determines that a wireless signal available to the user device 110 corresponds to a
wireless signal available at the point of interest. Hence, the availability of the wireless
signal to the user device 110 at the point of interest provides an indication, for example,
that the user device 110 is at the point of interest.
[0079]      For example, the location management system 140 may identify a specific
coffee shop as a point of interest. In a point-of-interest record 143 for the coffee shop,
the location management system 140 may identify, for example, the name and street
address for the coffee show. The location management system 140 may also determine
that a Wi-Fi signal at the coffee shop includes a media access control (MAC) address of
"01-23-45-67-89-AB," which the location management system 140 includes in the point
of-interest record 143. After a user device 110 enters a geofence boundary for the coffee
shop, the user device 110 may determine, such as via the wireless signal detection
module 113, that a Wi-Fi signal available to the user device 110 includes a "01-23-45-67
89-AB" media access control (MAC) address. After communicating wireless signal data
to the location management system 140 that includes the "01-23-45-67-89-AB" media
access control (MAC) address, the location management system 140 identifies the
corresponding "01-23-45-67-89-AB" media access control (MAC) address in the point
of-interest record 143 for the coffee shop. Hence, based on the matching "01-23-45-67
89-AB" media access control (MAC) address in this example, the location management
system 140 determines that the wireless signal available to the user device 110 is
associated with the coffee shop.
[0080]      In certain example embodiments, after identifying a match for the wireless
signal data as described herein, the location management system 140 may communicate a
signal or other indication to the user device 110 to cease determining available wireless
signals. That is, in certain example embodiments, the wireless signal detection module
113 -- when initially invoked -- may periodically search for wireless signals and then
communicate the wireless signal data to the location management system 140 at
configurable intervals.    The search for available wireless signals may continue, for
example, until the wireless signal detection module 113 receives a signal to cease
determining available wireless signals. For example, the signal may comprise specific
instructions to cease determining available wireless signals. Alternatively, the signal may
                                               25

include a notification that the location management system 140 has identified a match for
the received wireless data. Hence, in response to receiving the signal, the wireless signal
detection module 113 ceases determining available wireless signals.         By ceasing the
determination     of available    wireless  signals in such embodiments,       the  location
management system 140 conserves battery life of the user device 110.
[0081]       Returning to Figure 2, in block 245 of Figure 2, the location management
system 140 determines that the user device 110 is at the point of interest. That is, based
on determining that a wireless signal available to the user device 110 is associated with a
particular point of interest, the location management system 140 determines that the user
device 110 is at (or very close to) the point of interest. In other words, because the user
device 110 is close enough to the point of interest to detect the wireless signal associated
with the point of interest, the location management system 140 determines that the user
device 110 is at the point of interest. For example, the location management system 140
determines that the user device 110 is inside the point of interest or in the parking lot of
the point of interest.
[0082]       In certain example embodiments, an application on the user device 110, such
as the wireless signal detection module 113, may determine that the user device 110 is at
the point of interest. For example, the wireless signal detection module 113 may receive
a signal or other indication that the location management system 140 has identified a
match for the wireless data as described herein. Based on the received signal, wireless
signal detection module 113 may determine that the user device 110 is at the point of
interest.
[0083]       In certain example embodiments, after the location management system 140
or the wireless signal detection module 113 determines that the user device is at the point
of interest, the location management system 140 or the wireless signal detection module
113 may trigger an alert for the user 101 regarding the point of interest. The alert can be
any type of configurable alert.     For example, the location application 112 on the user
device 110 can provide an audible alert, a vibration, a visible alert (such as a text
message), or any combination thereof. In certain example embodiments, the location
application 112 may present point-of-interest details on the display of the user device
110, such as on a map or in e-mail. The location application 112 may also rely on any
                                               26

other configurable alerting process, such as sending an email, a push notification, a text
message, or another communication to the user device 110 of the user 101. The location
application 112 may also store the alert for later use. In certain example embodiments,
the user 101 can configure the alert as desired by setting or modifying user preferences
on the user device 110.
[0084]     The location management system 140 or the wireless signal detection module
113 may also provide content information associated with the alert. Hence, the alert may
be content based, with the content accompanying the alert notification.      For example,
location management system 140 may communicate content to the user device 110
accompany the alert.    The location application 112, for example, receives the content
information along with the alert and provides the content to the user 101 as part of the
alert.  Additionally or alternatively, the location management system 140 informs the
location application 112 of the entrance event at or within the geofence boundary, and the
location application 112 determines content to associate with the alert. The location
application 112 may then store the content in the data storage unit 117 of the user device
110 until the user device 110 is determined to be at the point of interest as described
herein.
[0085]     The content information of the alert comprises any configurable information
about one or more of the clustered points of interest.       For example, if the geofence
boundary encompasses a coffee shop of interest to the user 101, the content information
may include a discount offer for the coffee shop.      The content information may also
include details regarding each merchant location, such as merchant name, location, type
of merchant, products offered at the merchant, offers available to the user for the
merchant, or other suitable information.

opportunity or option to control whether programs or features collect user information
(e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a
user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to
receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user.                In
addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so
that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be
treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a
user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained
(such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be
determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the
user and used by a content server.
