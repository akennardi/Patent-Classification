  SYSTEM FOR MANAGING BETS SELECTING EVENTS AND PARTICIPANTS
  ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
           A system of managing bets is provided. The system includes a processor and
  a memory that receives one or more bets. Each bet comprises a selection of a first
  number of events selected from a group of events, a selection of a respective
5 participant for each of the first number of events selected and a bet amount.   The
  system combines each bet amount to form a betting pool and determines an amount of
  a total payout based at least in part on the betting pool.

   SYSTEM FOR MANAGING BETS SELECTING EVENTS AND PARTICIPANTS
   TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            This invention relates in general to wagering and, more particularly, to a
   system for wagering on selected events.
 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
            Wagering on sporting events, such as horse races, for example, is a large and
   growing industry in many parts of the world. Various types of betting products and
   systems are available for various types of sporting events   For example, many horse
   racing tracks provide one or more "Daily Double" bets in which a bettor may bet on
10 the winners of two consecutive races chosen by the track (e.g., the first two or last two
   races of the day). Some tracks also provide a "Pick Three," where bettors select the
   winners of three consecutive races chosen by the track, a "Pick Four," where bettors
   select the winners of four consecutive races chosen by the track, and/or a "Pick Six,"
   where bettors select the winners of six consecutive races chosen by the track.

   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            According to one embodiment, a system for managing bets includes a memory
   operable to store one or more bets. Each bet comprises a selection of a first number
   of events selected from a group of events, a selection of a respective participant for
20 each of the first number of events selected and a bet amount. The system includes a
   processor coupled to the memory.       The processor is operable to combine each bet
   amount to form a betting pool and determine an amount of a total payout based at
   least in part on the betting pool. The processor may also be operable to receive results
   of the group of events. The results may identify a winning participant for each event
25 of the group of events.     The processor may be operable to determine one or more
   winning bets of the one or more bets based on the results.
            A processor operable to determine one or more winning bets may comprise a
   processor operable to determine for each of the one or more bets if each selected
   respective participant corresponds to the winning participant for each of the first
30 number of events selected in the bet.      The processor may be further operable to
   determine an amount to be paid for each winning bet based on the number of winning

                                                2
   bets, the amount of the total payout, the bet amount of each winning bet and the odds
   of the selected respective participants of each winning bet. The processor may be
   operable to increase a payout for a first winning bet of the one or more winning bets if
   the first winning bet's selected respective participants for each of the first number of
 5 events selected each had specified odds or if at least one of the first winning bet's
   selected events comprises a specified event.
            Various embodiments of the present invention may benefit from numerous
   advantages.    It should be noted that one or more embodiments may benefit from
   some, none, or all of the advantages discussed below.
10          One advantage of particular embodiments is that bettors are given the
   opportunity to select a certain number of events out of a group of events and to bet on
   each event selected, with all such bets going to a pool for distribution to winners of
   such bets. Thus, a bettor may select events that the bettor feels he has the best chance
   to correctly pick the winners. Moreover, if a bettor misses one of his selected events
15 and there are still enough other events that have not yet taken place to place another
   bet, the bettor can re-enter the pool by placing an additional bet selecting more events.
   Another advantage of the invention is that certain incentives may be given to bettors
   selecting certain specified events or participants having certain specified odds in their
   bets. For example, a bet may earn a greater payout of the betting pool if it correctly
20 includes a winner of a certain specified event or if it includes longshot participants
   that win their events. Moreover, bettors may be allowed to miss some picks if they
   correctly select a certain specified event or longshot participants that win their events.
            By allowing a bettor to select the particular races, such as the five races, to be
   used in a bet, rather than having these races be chosen by the track and, therefore, be
25 the same for each bettor, the betting system can receive the bets from the bettors over
   a larger period of time throughout the course of the day. For example, where a horse
   racing track selects the five races that comprise the bet, as in prior techniques, it is
   typical for a bettor to place the bet immediately prior to the first of the five races.
   This causes a bottleneck at the betting window and, potentially, on the betting system.
30 As a result, bettors typically experience delays and long lines at the betting window
   immediately prior to the first of the five races. Such a spike in betting activity within
   a small period of time can cause an over consumption of network resources, thereby
   causing even greater delays. Many times, frustrated bettors forego the bet altogether.

                                                 3
   However, where each bettor is able to select the five races for the bet individually, as
   in the present disclosure, it is more likely that the bets will include different races for
   different bettors. As a result, the bets are more likely to be placed with the betting
   system over a larger period of time and the betting system is not as likely to see a
 5 spike in betting activity at a particular point in time. This frees up network resources.
   Thus, the betting system is better equipped to operate with increased speed,
   throughput and efficiency.
           Although this advantage is described with reference to placing and receiving
   bets, it should be understood that similar advantages may also result when settling
10 bets.   For example, just as with placing and receiving bets under the present
   disclosure, the winning bets under the present disclosure may be determined and paid
   over a larger period of time. This also frees up network resources, and increases
   speed, throughput and efficiency.
           A further advantage of the present disclosure is that a bettor that loses a
15 particular "select five" bet early in the day, for example, may make additional such
   bets throughout the day. Since each such bet is based on the outcome of multiple
   races, it is possible that a particular bettor may be satisfied to make an additional
   "select five" bet rather than five separate bets on five separate races.                By
   consolidating the number of bets being presented to the betting system, the "select
20 five" bet of the present disclosure may have the effect of reducing the overall number
   of trips that a bettor would make to the betting window. As a result, the network
   resources of the betting system would be further liberated and, therefore, the overall
   processing speed, throughput, and efficiency of the betting system would be
   increased.
25         Other advantages will be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the
   art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.

   DETAILED        DESCRIPTION        OF    EXAMPLE       EMBODIMENTS          OF    THE
   INVENTION
15         FIGURE 1 illustrates an example system 10 for receiving and managing bets
   12 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System 10 includes
   one or more betting system interfaces 14 and a betting system platform 16 coupled by
   one or more communications networks 18. In general, one or more bettors 20 may
   receive bet offering information (such as event times, betting rules, betting options
20 and odds, for example) and/or place bets 12 via betting system interfaces 14. Betting
   system interfaces 14 communicate such bets 12 received from bettors 20 to betting
   system platform 16.      Betting system platform 16 stores the received bets 12,
   determines appropriate odds and payouts, and communicates such odds and payouts
   to one or more of the betting system interfaces 14.
25         In a given time period, such as one or more particular hours or days, a number
   of events upon which bets may be placed may be scheduled to take place.            For
   example, in a particular day a number of horse races may be scheduled at one or more
   tracks.   As another example, a number of professional football games may be
   scheduled for a particular Sunday. As an additional example, a number of first round
30 basketball games of a collegiate basketball tournament may be scheduled for a
   particular two days. System 10 permits bettors 20 to select a certain number of events
   out of those scheduled to take place in a given time period and to bet on the winners
   of the events selected. Such a bet may be referred to as an "Event Select" bet or an

                                                5
   "Event Choice" bet, and bets 12 may be referred to herein as Event Select bets 12 or
   Event Choice bets 12.
           In particular embodiments, the number of events that a bettor 20 must select
   on which to bet may be designated by betting system platform 16. A set of events
 5 from which bettors 20 must select on which to bet may also be designated. The set of
   events may include any number of events of various types and/or sports, such as horse
   racing, dog racing, basketball, football, baseball, hockey, soccer, jai-alai, golf, boxing,
   rugby, cricket, auto racing, bicycle racing, tennis, Olympic events or any other
   suitable type of event, and may include events of different types. The set of events
10 may also include non-sporting events, such as political events (e.g., elections) and
   entertainment    events (e.g., Academy Awards and movie box office revenue
   predictions).   The set of events for selection may also include events occurring in
   different areas, such as different time zones or different countries. The designation of
   a group of events from which a bettor 20 must select on which to bet in a particular
15 Event Select bet 12, the number of events that the bettor must select and other suitable
   information    (such as required betting amount and winning payout rules or
   information) may be included in Event Select offerings 13 communicated to bettors
   20 through betting system interfaces 14.
           As an example, an Event Select offering 13 may be provided at betting system
20 platform 16 for betting by bettors 20 that requires selection of six horse races out of a
   designated set of horse races and selection of a winning horse for each respectively
   selected race. Thus, in this example bettors 20 would place Event Select bets 12 in
   response to the Event Select offering 13. The set of races from which six races must
   be selected may include races scheduled to be run at one or more race tracks.
25 Different bettors 20 may choose different races to constitute their selected six races of
   their respective Event Select bets. For example, if the bet allows bettors 20 to choose
   from races being held at Track A, Track B and Track C, and each such track is
   scheduled to run nine races on a particular day designated in the Event Select offering
   13, then one bettor 20 may select Race 2 from Track A, Races 3, 4, and 6 from Track
30 B and Races 7 and 9 from Track C, while another bettor 20 may select Races 4, 5, 6,
   7, 8 and 9 from Track C. Each such bettor 20 will also select a winning participant
   for each race chosen.     In the example given, a winning Event Select bet 12 may
   constitute one that correctly selects the winning participant of each of the six races

                                                6
   selected by the bettor in the bettor's Event Select bet. It is possible that multiple
   bettors may win the Event Select offering, and those winners may have selected
   different races on which to bet in their respective Event Select bets.
           It should be understood that a winning participant of an event for purposes of
 5 an Event Select bet may be the participant that wins an event outright (e.g., a team
   that scores more points than an opposing team or a horse that finishes first in a race)
   or a particular participant according to another method, such as according to the
   participant ahead after a point spread is accounted for in the event outcome.         In
   particular embodiments, a particular Event Select offering may indicate that bettors 20
10 must select outright winning participants or point spread winning participants of their
   respectively selected events in their Event Select bets.
           In particular embodiments, Event Select bets 12 corresponding to an Event
   Select offering 13 may include selection of non-winning participants instead of, or in
   addition to, selection of winning participants.       For example, some Event Select
15 offerings 13 may require selection of second, third or last place finishers in selected
   events instead of, or in addition to, selection of winning participants. Thus, Event
   Select offerings of particular embodiments may require selection of any particular
   designated results of the events selected by the bettor.
           System 10 may be a pari-mutuel betting system in which all Event Select bets
20 12 received corresponding to an Event Select offering 13 are pooled, a commission
   (or "take-out") is taken by the wager provider or host, and the remainder is distributed
   among the winning bettors. Thus, each Event Select offering may have its own such
   pari-mutuel pool.     For example, a plurality of Event Select offerings 13 may be
   offered for betting by bettors 20 at any particular time. Such Event Select offerings
25 may include, for example: (1) Select five professional football games among those
   scheduled for a particular Sunday, (2) Select eight horse races among those scheduled
   for five designated tracks for a particular day, (3) Select two baseball games and three
   basketball games among those scheduled for a particular day, (4) Select seven college
   basketball games among those scheduled for a particular two days, or (5) Select five
30 events among all professional basketball and football games being held on a particular
   weekend. These are mere examples of various types of Event Select offerings 13
   upon which bettors 20 may place Event Select bets 12. As discussed, Event Select
   offerings 13 may designate any number of events scheduled to take place at any

                                                 7
   number of locations at any particular time period. A bettor's corresponding Event
   Select bet 12 for a particular offering will include a selection of the designated
   number of events and a winning participant for each respectively selected event. All
   Event Select bets 12 received for a particular Event Select offering may be pooled,
 5 and the winning bets 12 for such offering may each receive a portion of the pari
   mutuel pool after any applicable commission is taken out by the wager provider or
   host. In particular embodiments, pools for bets received for different Event Select
   offerings may be combined to constitute a larger pool for multiple Event Select
   offerings.
10          In some embodiments, an Event Select offering provider may guarantee a
   certain total Event Select offering payout even if total bet amounts received for the
   offering are not enough to provide the guaranteed payout. If enough bet amounts are
   not received for the offering to provide for a guaranteed payout, the wagering
   provider could contribute extra amounts to provide the guaranteed payout, for
15 example from its own funds or through purchased insurance.
            A bettor 20 may place an Event Select bet 12 at a betting system interface 14
   up until the point when there are fewer events remaining than the number of events
   required for selection to place the Event Select bet 12. For example, if a particular
   Event Select offering 13 requires selection of six events among a group of fifteen
20 events scheduled, then an Event Select bet may be placed at anytime before betting
   has closed for the final six events of those fifteen events.        To elaborate further, a
   particular Event Select offering 13 may require selection of six races out of a total of
   thirty-six races being held at four tracks (e.g., nine races at each track). For purposes
   of this example, assume that all races at one track (e.g., Track 1) are scheduled to take
25 place after all races of the other three tracks (e.g., Tracks 2, 3 and 4) have taken place.
   This may occur for any number of reasons, such some races offered for selection
   being scheduled at night instead of in the day or on different days or tracks being
   located in different time zones. In this example, if a bettor waits until after Race 3 at
   Track 1 to place his Event Select bet, then the bettor must select the winners of Races
30 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of Track 1 in the bettor's Event Select bet (all of the other possible
   races will have taken place).      This enables bettors who may have selected earlier
   events in a particular Event Select bet and missed selecting the winning participants
   of any of those events to place one or more additional Event Select bets encompassing

                                                8
   the required number of remaining events. Thus, such bettors still have a chance to
   win a portion of that particular Event Select offering's pari-mutuel payout.
           It is possible that a particular Event Select offering may not have any Event
   Select bets that correctly select the winners of the bets' respectively selected events.
 5 In those cases, some or all of the Event Select offering payout for that Event Select
   offering may be paid to Event Select bettors who correctly select the most of their
   respectively selected events (e.g., some or all of an Event Select offering payout may
   be split among bettors correctly selecting five out of six respectively selected events).
   In some cases, no payout may be made for a particular Event Select offering if no
10 bettor correctly picks the winners of all of the bettor's selected events.
           In particular embodiments, in the event that any payout is made to a plurality
   of Event Select bettors picking the same number of events correctly, the payout may
   be divided among such Event Select bettors according to dollars wagered by each
   such bettor. For example, if two Event Select bettors correctly select the winners of
15 all events respectively selected and one such bettor wagered $1 for his winning Event
   Select bet while the other Event Select bettor wagered $2 for his winning Event Select
   bet, then the Event Select bettor that wagered $2 may receive twice the amount of the
   Event Select offering payout received by the bettor that wagered $1.
           Any portion of a particular Event Select offering payout not paid to any bettor
20 (e.g., if there are no Event Select bets that correctly pick the winners of all
   respectively selected events and the full Event Select bet payout is not distributed to
   bettors correctly picking less than all respectively selected events) may carry over to a
   future Event Select offering to be combined with the Event Select bets placed for such
   offering to constitute the future Event Select offering's payout. As an example, if an
25 Event Select offering requires selection of ten professional football games occurring
   on a particular Sunday and the respectively selected games' winning teams and no
   Event Select bet accurate picks the winning teams of each selected game, then that
   particular Event Select offering payout may carry over to a similar Event Select
   offering occurring on the following Sunday. Event Select offering payouts may carry
30 over multiple times (e.g., over multiple Event Select offerings) if some or all of the
   multiple offerings' payouts are not paid. In some embodiments, in the event that no
   Event Select bettors for a particular Event Select offering correctly select the winners
   of all selected events but a portion of that offering's payout is paid (e.g., to those

                                                  9
   correctly selecting some selected events), then such portion may not include any
   Event Select bet amounts carried over from a previous Event Select offering. This
   would ensure that any carryover Event Select bet amounts would only be paid to those
   bettors who correctly select the winning participants in all of their respectively
 5 selected events.
            Betting system interfaces 14 may include any suitable interface between a
   bettor 20 and betting system platform 16.         For example, as shown in FIGURE 1,
   betting system interfaces 14 may include physical interfaces, such as on-site interfaces
   26 and/or off-site interfaces 28. On-site interfaces 26 are generally located at sites
10 where events take place, such as a race track, while off-site interfaces 28 are located
   at a site away from where events take place, such as an off-track-betting (OTB) parlor
   or a casino. On-site interfaces 26 and off-site interfaces 28 may include tellers 30,
   which may receive bets 12 from and distribute payouts to bettors 20, and/or monitors
   32, which may be viewed by bettors 20 to monitor betting information such as event
15 times, current odds, and projected or actual payouts for various Event Select offerings
   13, for example. In some situations, such information may be updated substantially in
   real time or at preset intervals (such as every 30 seconds, for example) as new bets 12
   are placed and/or as information regarding the offerings change, for example.
   Monitors 32 may include, for example, tote-boards or closed-circuit televisions
20 located at an event site or off-site establishment.
            On-site interfaces 26 and/or off-site interfaces 28 may also include one or
   more self-service betting machines 33.         In some embodiment, self-service betting
   machines 33 allow bettors 20 to insert payment into the machine (such as cash or by
   using a voucher or a credit or debit card), place one or more Event Select bets 12, and
25 receive a printout (such as a ticket, for example) indicating the bet or bets placed.
   Printouts for winning bets may be inserted into the self-service betting machine, such
   as to receive a payment voucher (which may be used to receive a payout from a teller
   30) or to place additional bets 12.          In other embodiments, self-service betting
   machines 33 allow bettors 20 to use a credit or debit card to place bets 12. The credit
30 or debit card may have an associated account, which may be a betting account
   provided and/or managed by a betting account provider. In some embodiments, after
   the betting event is completed, a bettor 20 may insert or swipe his or her credit or
   debit card in the self-service betting machines 33 in order to update the balance on the

                                              10
   card.   Self-service betting machines 33 may also allow the bettor 20 to print out
   payment vouchers which may be presented to a teller 30 in order to receive payments.
           As shown in FIGURE 1, betting system interfaces 14 may also include various
   non-physical interfaces, such as one or more telephone operators 34 and one or more
 5 websites 36.     Bettors 20 may access or communicate with such non-physical
   interfaces via one or more communications networks 44. Communications networks
   44 may include one or more servers, routers, switches, repeaters, backbones, links
   and/or any other appropriate type of communication devices coupled by links such as
   wire line, optical, wireless, or other appropriate links. In general, communication
10 network 28 may include any interconnection found on any communication network,
   such as a telephone network, a local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network
   (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, portions of the Internet, or any other
   data exchange system. To access betting system interfaces 14 using communication
   networks 44, bettors 20 may use a computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cell
15 phone, a remote paging device, an electronic mail communication device, a handheld
   betting device, or any other suitable mobile device.   In certain embodiments, bettors
   20 may receive any suitable information, such as Event Select offering information,
   from betting     system platform     16  via mobile    devices using,    for example,
   communication networks 44 and betting system interfaces 14.
20         Telephone operators 34 may communicate information concerning Event
   Select offerings 13 (such as event times, offering rules, betting options and odds, for
   example) to, and take bets 12 from, bettors 20.          Similarly, websites 36 may
   communicate offering information to bettors 20 and allow bettors 20 to place bets 12.
   One or more of such websites 36 may be hosted by one or more servers associated
25 with system 10, which server or servers may also host betting system platform 16 in
   some embodiments. In some embodiments, offering information available to bettors
   20 via websites 36 may be updated substantially in real time or at preset intervals
   (such as every 30 seconds, for example) as new bets 12 are placed and/or as
   information regarding an offering changes, for example.
30         In some embodiments, one or more websites 36 may be provided by, or
   associated with, an Internet betting provider 46, for example.         Internet betting
   provider 46 may provide Internet account wagering by providing online betting
   accounts to one or more bettors 20. Using an online betting account, a bettor 20 may

                                              11
   interface with one or more websites 36 associated with the Internet betting provider
   46 in order to fund the account, view Event Select offering information regarding
   offering events, and place Event Select bets.      Such online betting accounts may
   include one or more various types of accounts, such as deposit accounts, credit
 5 accounts, stop-loss accounts, and hybrid accounts, for example.
           As discussed above, betting system platform 16 is operable to communicate
   Event Select offerings 13 to betting system interfaces 14, receive Event Select bets 12
   from betting system interfaces 14, store the received bets 12, determine appropriate
   payouts, and communicate such payouts to one or more of the betting system
10 interfaces 14, which may then display such payouts to bettors 20.         As shown in
   FIGURE 1, betting system platform 16 includes a processor 38 coupled to a memory
   40. Processor 38 is generally operable to execute various algorithms or calculations
   to determine Event Select offering data, such as current odds data 50, current pool
   data 52, current or potential payout data 54 and any other suitable information.
15         As discussed above, betting system platform 16 comprises processor 38 and
   memory 40. Processor 38 may comprise any suitable processor, such as a central
   processing unit (CPU) or other microprocessor, that executes a betting system
   software application 42 or other computer instructions and may include any suitable
   number of processors working together. Memory 40 may comprise one or more
20 memory devices suitable to facilitate execution of the computer instructions, such as
   one or more random access memories (RAMs), read-only memories (ROMs),
   dynamic random access memories (DRAMs), fast cycle RAMs (FCRAMs), static
   RAM (SRAMs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), erasable programmable
   read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable programmable read-only
25 memories (EEPROMs), microcontrollers, or microprocessors.
           Memory 40 is generally operable to store various information that may be
   used by processor 38 in determining odds and/or payouts. For example, memory 40
   may comprise any suitable number of databases, which may be co-located or
   physically and/or geographically distributed. In the example shown in FIGURE 1,
30 memory 40 may store any or all of the following: betting system software application
   42, current odds data 50, current pool data 52, payout data 54, one or more event
   parameters 58, one or more Event Select offering parameters 60, one or more Event

                                               12
   Select bet parameters 61, one or more calculation rules 62, one or more event results
   64, and one or more Event Select offering results 66.
            Event parameters 58 may comprise various parameters of one or more events,
   such as, for example, the type of event, the time, date and location of the event and/or
 5 the number (or in some cases, the name) of each of the participants in the event.
   Event Select offering parameters 60 may comprise various parameters of one or more
   Event Select offerings 13, include events offered for selection, requirements for
   corresponding bets 12 and the commission rate on the offerings 13. Event Select bet
   parameters 61 may also include information concerning received bets 12, such as the
10 identity of the bettor 20 who placed the bet 12, the manner in which the bet 12 was
   placed (such as via telephone, the Internet, or in person at a track or OTB
   establishment, for example), the participant or participants covered by the bet 12
   and/or the amount of the bet 12, for example.       Calculation rules 62 may comprise
   various equations or other algorithms to be used by processor 38 in determining
15 various current odds and/or payout data. Event results 64 may comprise various data
   regarding the results of one or more offering events, such as the winning participant
   of each event. Offering results 66 may comprise various data regarding the results of
   various Event Select offerings 13, such as whether bets 12 are winning bets, the
   identity of bettors 20 who place winning bets 12, the determined payout for the bet 12
20 and/or whether the payout was distributed to the bettor 20, for example. It should be
   understood that particular components stored in memory 40 may be combined or
   separated in any suitable manner in memory 40 according to particular needs. As an
   example, FIGURES 2A, 2B and 4 further discussed below illustrate examples of
   Event Select bet and result data, which may combine data from Event Select bet
25 parameters 61, event results 64 and Event Select offering results 66.
            As discussed above, one or more communications networks 18 couple and
   facilitate wireless and/or wireline communication between one or more betting system
   interfaces 14 and betting system platform 16. Each communication network 18 may
   include one or more servers, routers, switches, repeaters, backbones, links and/or any
30 other appropriate type of communication devices coupled by links such as wire line,
   optical, wireless, or other appropriate links. In general, each communication network
   18 may include any interconnection found on any communication network, such as a

                                               13
   local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network
   (WAN), the Internet, portions of the Internet, or any other data exchange system.
           As discussed above, processor 38 is operable to execute betting system
   software application 42 to determine current odds data 50, current pool data 52,
 5 and/or payout data 54. Processor 38 may determine such data based at least on data
   received from memory 40 and/or one or more betting system interfaces 14.               In
   addition, processor 38 may update such data based on new information being received
   by betting system platform 16. In some embodiments, processor 38 may update such
   data in real time, substantially in real time, or at preset intervals (such as every 30
10 seconds, for example).
           As shown in FIGURE 1, Event Select offerings 13 may be communicated to
   one or more betting system interfaces 14 via communications network 18.             Such
   offerings may include current odds data 50, current pool data 52 and payout data 54.
   Offerings 13 may then be made available to bettors 20, such as via tote boards or
15 monitors 32 located at a track or OTB establishment, for example, or on an
   appropriate website 36 that may be accessed by bettors 20, for example.           In this
   manner, bettors 20 may have access to real-time or substantially real-time odds, pool
   and payout data regarding various Event Select offerings.
           FIGURES 2A and 2B illustrate examples of Event Select bet and result data
20 for example Event Select offerings. In the example Event Select offering of FIGURE
   2A, Bettors 1-4 are required to select six races out of a group twenty total races being
   held at four different tracks. As discussed above, offerings of other embodiments
   may require selection of a different number of events out of a group of a number
   offered other than twenty. Bettor 1 selects to bet on Races 2 and 5 at Track 1, Race 3
25 at Track 2, Races 1 and 2 at Track 3 and Race 3 at Track 4. Bettor 2 selects to bet on
   Races 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 at Track 2 and Race 1 at Track 3. Bettor 3 selects to bet on
   Race 1 at Track 1, Races 1 and 5 at Track 2, Races 1 and 4 at Track 3 and Race 2 at
   Track 4. Bettor 4 selects to bet on Races 1, 3 and 5 at Track 3 and Races 2, 4 and 5 at
   Track 4.    Each Bettor 1-4 selects a horse to win each of the bettors' respectively
30 selected races. Comparing the races and horses selected to the actual race winners,
   one can see that Bettors 2 and 4 accurately selected the winners of each race they
   respectively selected in their Event Select bets.     Bettor 1 accurately selected the
   winners of five out of six selected races (missed the winner of Race 3 at Track 2).

                                               14
   Bettor 3 did not accurately select the winner of any of the bettor's selected races.
   Thus, Bettors 2 and 4 may each receive a portion of the total pari-mutuel payout for
   that particular Event Select offering. Bettors 1 and 3 will not be considered Event
   Select winners if the offering 13 had stipulated that a bet must correctly select winners
 5 of each respectively selected event to win.         It should be understood that some
   embodiments may provide that an Event Select bet 12 missing one or more selected
   events may still be a winner.
           In the example Event Select offering of FIGURE 2B, Bettors 1-4 are required
   to select five games out of a group of ten games and three horse races out of a group
10 of ten horse races. As indicated above, the horse races may be held at different tracks
   and at different times. In this example, each game includes two participating teams
   (Team A and Team B for each game), and each race includes a respective certain
   number of horses.     In one embodiment, the group of ten games may comprise ten
   professional football games and the particular Event Select offering may be called
15 "Ponies and Pros." As discussed above, the winning participant for the game events
   may be determined according to outright winner or by accounting for particular point
   spreads in each game.
           As illustrated, Bettor 1 selects Games 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9 and Races 3, 5 and 8.
   Bettor 2 selects Games 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 and Races 5, 6 and 7. Bettor 3 selects Games
20 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9 and Races 2, 4 and 8. Bettor 4 selects Games 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and
   Races 5, 8 and 9. Comparing the events and participants selected by each bettor to the
   actual winning participants for each event, one can see that Bettor 2 accurately
   selected the winning participant of each event Bettor 2 selected in the bettor's Event
   Select bet.    Thus, Bettor 2 would receive a portion of the total payout for that
25 particular Event Select offering.
           As discussed above, in particular embodiments a portion of a particular Event
   Select offering payout may be paid to bettors accurately picking at least some of their
   respectively selected events. As evident in FIGURE 2B, Bettor 1 correctly selected
   the winning team of each game selected by Bettor 1, and Bettor 3 correctly selected
30 the winning horse of each race selected by Bettor 3.         This particular Event Select
   offering could have designated that any bettor accurately selecting the winner of all of
   the bettor's selected games or all of the bettor's selected races would receive a portion
   of the Event Select offering payout even if the bettor did not accurately pick the

                                                 15
   winning participant in all events selected.      If this were this case, Bettors 1 and 3
   would thus receive at least a portion of the Event Select offering pari-mutuel payout.
   Of course in some embodiments an Event Select offering may designate that no bettor
   missing even a single event receive any portion of the Event Select offering payout if
 5 any other bettor correctly picks the winning participant of all of such other bettor's
   selected events. If this were the case in the example in FIGURE 2B, then Bettors 1
   and 3 would receive no portion of the Event Select offering payout since Bettor 2
   correctly picked all events selected by Bettor 2.
           In particular embodiments, an Event Select offering that requires selection of a
10 certain number of events out of a group of events may allow bettors to select fewer
   events if bettors' selected participants in their selected events have certain odds (e.g.,
   longer odds than other participants in the events). The bets received from such bettors
   that select the fewer events may still be combined with bets received from bettors
   selecting a greater number of events to constitute the particular Event Select offering
15 pool. For example, a particular Event Select offering may require selection of six
   horse races and their winning participants but may allow a bettor to select only four
   races if the bettor selects horses that are 10-1 odds or longer to win each of the bettor's
   four selected races. If the bettor's four selected longshott" horses were to win each of
   their respective races, then the bettor may receive a portion of the Event Select
20 offering payout just as if the bettor had correctly selected six "favored" horses to win
   their respective races. Thus, bettors may be permitted to select fewer events if the
   participants selected by the bettors in such events have longer odds.
           In some embodiments, a bettor who selects participants having longer odds
   may receive a greater portion of an Event Select offering payout upon winning an
25 Event Select bet than a bettor selecting participants that do not have long odds. For
   example, if a bettor placing an Event Select bet correctly chooses winning participants
   that each have 5-1 or longer odds in the bettor's selected events, then that bettor may
   receive 1.5 times the payout of another bettor who accurately picked winning
   participants that had lower than 5-1 odds in such bettor's selected events.
30         When participant odds are taken into account in Event Select bets (e.g., in
   determining the number of events a bettor must select or in determining payout
   portion for a winning bettor), certain weighted averages known in the wagering
   industry may be used to determine payouts or number of events required for selection.

                                                16
   Moreover, the odds used for such purposes may be the odds as of any particularly
   designated time, such as final odds just prior to an event, morning odds or when the
   bettor actually places their Event Select bet. If final odds are used to determine a
   bonus for a bettor, such as an increased winning payout or opportunity to select fewer
 5 winners, then the bettor may face a risk when placing his bet to achieve the bonus.
   This is because a participant may have certain odds when a bet is placed, but those
   odds may change by the time the participant's final odds are determined. Thus, a
   bettor may select certain participants to win selected events in an effort to achieve a
   bonus given based on selecting participants having specified odds, but the bettor may
10 end up not being eligible for the bonus if odds change such that final odds for a
   participant are less than the specified odds required for the bonus.
           Other examples where bettors selecting participants having less probability of
   winning may be used to allow fewer events to be selected or to provide for greater
   payout upon winning may include the selection of lower seeded teams in a sports
15 tournament (e.g., NCAA basketball tournament) or the selection of other "underdog"
   teams, such as underdogs having certain point spreads in an Event Select bet where
   the winning participant is determined by outright event winner.
           In some embodiments, an Event Select offering may require selection of one
   or more certain specified events and such events' winning participants in order to be
20 eligible for the Event Select offering payout. For example, an Event Select offering
   may require selection of six horse races out of a group of horse races and may
   stipulate that one of the selected horse races must be the Kentucky Derby.
           In particular embodiments, an Event Select offering may allow a bettor to
   select fewer events, gain a larger portion of the Event Select offering payout or allow
25 a bettor to miss one of the bettor's selected events if the bettor selects a certain
   specified event and its winning participant. As an example, an Event Select offering
   that requires selection of a certain number of horse races and their winning
   participants to win a portion of the payout may provide that a bettor selecting the
   Kentucky Derby (and its winning horse) as one of the bettor's selected races may
30 receive a greater portion of the Event Select offering payout upon correctly picking
   winning participants of all its selected races than another bettor who correctly picked
   the winner of six selected races but did not include the Kentucky Derby. As another
   example, an Event Select offering that requires selection of six events may provide

                                               17
   that bettors selecting the Kentucky Derby as one of their events only have to select a
   total of five events (one being the Kentucky Derby) and their winning participants.
   As an additional example, an Event Select offering that requires selection of seven
   events and their winning participants in order to receive any portion of the payout
 5 may allow a bettor to receive a portion of the payout if the bettor does not correctly
   pick the winning participant of one of the bettor's selected events but does select the
   Kentucky Derby (and its winning participant) as one of the bettor's selected events.
   Such a bettor may receive the same portion of the payout as another bettor accurately
   selecting the winner of all respectively selected events in some cases.
10          As discussed above, credit or benefit may be given to bettors for selecting
   participants having longer odds (e.g., longshot horses or seeded or point spread
   underdogs) or correctly selecting the winners of certain specified events in their Event
   Select bets. Specified events for selection that may make a bet eligible for such credit
   or benefit may be specified at any time. For example, the offering 13 may specify
15 events that may be selected for such credit or benefit. In some embodiments, events
   that make a bet eligible for a credit or benefit may be specified after bets 12 are
   received or after event results are received. In these cases, such specified events may
   constitute a "wildcard" bonus in that bettors do not know prior to placing their bets
   which events to select to make their bets eligible for the bonus.
20          As discussed above, Event Select offerings 13 may stipulate provisions or
   parameters that trigger credit, benefit or bonus.      A provision that triggers such a
   credit, benefit or bonus may be referred to herein as an "adjustment parameter" (e.g.,
   selecting participants having longer odds or correctly selecting winners of certain
   specified events). Adjustment parameters may lead to a credit, benefit or bonus that
25 may include, among other incentives, a larger portion of the Event Select offering
   payout, allowing the bettor to select fewer events or allowing the bettor to get fewer
   events correct out of their events selected.        It should be understood particular
   embodiments may utilize various types of adjustment parameters not specifically
   enumerated herein to provide extra credit, benefits or bonuses.
30          In some cases, a bettor may be allowed to miss one or more events and still
   receive an identical portion of an Event Select offering payout received by a bettor
   who does not miss any events if the bettor that missed one or more events pays more
   (i.e., wagers more) for his Event Select bet. For example, a bettor that wagers $2 and

                                                 18
   correctly picks winning participants in five out of six events selected by the bettor
   may receive the same portion of an Event Select offering payout as another bettor that
   wagers $1 but correctly picks winning participants in six out of six events selected by
   such bettor.
 5          It is possible that some events of a particular Event Select offering may be
   cancelled or suspended or may otherwise constitute a "no contest" event such that no
   winner is determined. This may occur on some occasions, for example, as a result of
   bad weather. In this case, Event Select bets may exist that may not have missed a
   selected event that actually took place.       For example, bad weather may force the
10 cancellation of consecutively scheduled events (e.g., Events 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15
   at a track on a particular day), or some other problem could force the cancellation of
   non-consecutive events occurring at different places at different times. Certain Event
   Select bettors may still have correctly selected the winning participants in all
   respectively selected races. Moreover, other Event Select bettors may have Event
15 Select bets that are "still alive" in that they have not yet missed selecting a winner of
   any of their selected races.      In these situations, some or all of that Event Select
   offering's payout may be distributed according to any suitable formula, algorithm or
   method. It should be understood that such a formula, algorithm or method may
   change according number of events for selection, type of offering 13 or any other
20 factor.    In some cases no portion of an Event Select offering payout may be
   distributed in the event of any cancelled, suspended or "no contest" events, and such
   payout may or may not carry over to a future Event Select offering.
            As discussed above, processor 38 may calculate various current or potential
   Event Select offering payout data using various algorithms or equations. FIGURE 3
25 illustrates examples of such algorithms or equations in accordance with one
   embodiment of the present invention. In particular, FIGURE 3 illustrates various
   equations for calculating the current potential payout for an Event Select offering 13.
            In particular, FIGURE 3 illustrates equation 100 which indicates that a
   particular Event Select offering's bets received constitutes the Event Select offering
30 pool. Equation 102 shows that an Event Select offering's take-out is calculated by
   multiplying a certain commission (e.g., 15%) by the Event Select offering pool. In
   equation 104, the Event Select offering payout is determined by subtracting the Event
   Select offering take-out from the Event Select offering pool and adding any Event

                                                 19
   Select carryover from previous Event Select offering.          As discussed above, some
   Event Select offerings may include a carryover from one or more previous Event
   Select offerings while other Event Select offerings may include no carryover in the
   Event Select offering payout.
 5          FIGURE 4 illustrates an example of Event Select bet and result data for an
   example Event Select offering.        In this example, some of the concepts discussed
   above relating to extra credit or benefit are utilized and combined into one Event
   Select offering. For the example, the Event Select offering stipulates that each bettor
   must select five races (and their winning horses) out of a group of ten possible races.
10 To win any portion of the Event Select payout, a bettor must correctly pick the
   winning horses of each of the bettor's respectively selected races.         Moreover, the
   Event Select offering includes an adjustment parameter indicating that the bettor may
   also pick the winner of the Kentucky Derby (not one of the ten races from which a
   bettor must select five). If the bettor correctly picks the winner of the bettor's five
15 other races and correctly picks the winner of the Kentucky Derby, then the bettor will
   get double the payout (i.e., a "Kentucky Derby bonus") than if the bettor merely
   correctly picked the winner of the bettor's five selected races. In addition, the Event
   Select offering includes another adjustment parameter indicating that if a bettor
   correctly picks the winning horse of the bettor's five selected races and each such
20 winning horse had 10-1 or longer odds, then the bettor will receive nine times the
   payout (i.e., a "longshot bonus") than if any of the bettor's winning participants had
   shorter than 10-1 odds. Finally, payouts will be distributed on a per dollar wagered
   basis, taking any bonuses into account for satisfaction of the adjustment parameters.
            As illustrated, Bettor 1 selects Races 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8. Bettor 2 selects Races 1,
25 3, 4, 8 and 9. Bettor 3 selects Races 1, 2, 6, 9 and 10. Bettor 4 selects races 3, 4, 5, 6
   and 7. Each bettor also selects a participant to win the Kentucky Derby in an effort to
   gain the double payout Kentucky Derby bonus. As evident from the results given,
   both Bettors 2 and 3 correctly picked the winner of each of their five respectively
   selected races. Moreover, each of such winners for Bettor 2 had 10-1 or longer odds.
30 In addition, Bettor 3 correctly selected the winner of the Kentucky Derby.
   Furthermore, Bettor 2 wagered $5.00, and Bettor 3 wagered $2.00.
            For the purposes of calculating the total amount of the Event Select payout
   that Bettors 2 and 3 will receive, it will be assumed that the total Event Select pool for

                                               20
   this Event Select offering is $100,000 with no carryover from previous Event Select
   bets, the take-out is 15%, and there are no other Event Select bets that correctly
   selected the winner of five selected races (other than the bets of Bettors 2 and 3).
   Thus, the total Event Select offering payout will be $85,000. Bettor 2 wagered $5.00
 5 and Bettor 3 wagered $2.00, so Bettor 2 would normally receive 2.5 times the amount
   received by Bettor 3 without any additional bonuses. However, Bettor 2 will receive
   the longshot bonus (9 times credit), and Bettor 3 will receive the Kentucky Derby
   bonus (double credit). So, if a point system was used, then Bettor 2 would have 45
   total points ((5 points for each dollar wagered) x (the 9 times credit)), and Bettor 3
10 would have 4 total points ((2 points for each dollar wagered) x (the 2 times credit)).
   Therefore there are 49 total points. Bettor 2 will receive 45/49 of the payout, and
   Bettor 3 will receive 4/49 of the payout. Thus, Bettor 2 will receive $78,061.22 of the
   $85,000 payout, and Bettor 3 will receive $6,938.78. It should be understood that the
   example described with respect to FIGURE 4 is merely an example of the manner in
15 which selecting participants with longer odds or selecting the winner of a specified
   event may enable a bettor to receive extra credit or benefit in determining a winning
   portion of an Event Select offering payout.      Other embodiments may utilize other
   methods for dividing an Event Select offering payout among bettors with winning
   bets.
20         FIGURE 5 is a flowchart illustrating an example method of receiving,
   managing and paying Event Select bets 12, in accordance with an embodiment of the
   present invention. At step 200, an Event Select offering is communicated to bettors
   20. The offering may be communicated to one or more betting system interfaces 14.
   The offering may stipulate a number of events that a bet 12 corresponding to the
25 offering must select and a group of events from which the selected events must be
   selected. The offering may also provide certain incentives or bonuses for satisfying
   adjustment parameters, such as selecting specified events (e.g., the Kentucky Derby
   or the Super Bowl) or selecting participants having specified odds to win selected
   events.   It should be understood that certain bonuses (e.g., identification of certain
30 events that make a bet eligible for a bonus) may be specifically identified at a later
   time, such as after bets or results are received. Incentives or bonuses may include a
   higher portion of the offering payout for winning, the opportunity to select fewer
   events and still win or the opportunity to win even while missing one or more winning

                                               21
   participants of the events selected. At step 202, Event Select bets 12 are received
   from one or more bettors 20 via one or more betting system interfaces 14. Each Event
   Select bet 12 received includes a selection of a certain number of events selected from
   a group of events stipulated in the Event Select offering 13, a selection of a respective
 5 participant for each of the events selected and a bet amount. Each Event Select bet 12
   may be stored at step 204, such as within memory 40, for example.
           At step 206, the Event Select bet amounts may be combined to form the Event
   Select offering's pool. At step 208, a total Event Select offering payout is determined.
   Such determination may include deducting a commission from the Event Select
10 offering pool, such as by applying a commission rate to the pool. The determination
   of the Event Select payout may also include adding an Event Select offering carryover
   amount from a previous Event Select offering.
           At step 210 the results of the offering events are received. Such results may
   include an identification of a winning participant for each offering event. At step 212,
15 Event Select winning bets are determined from the Event Select bets 12 received and
   stored at steps 202 and 204, respectively. In some cases, an Event Select bet 12 may
   be considered a winning bet only if the Event Select bet 12 includes a correct
   selection of winning participants for each event selected in the bet. In other cases, an
   Event Select bet 12 may be entitled to some winning amount if the bet 12 includes a
20 correct selection of a winning participant for at least one of the races selected in the
   bet.   This may be the case if no Event Select bets 12 received include a correct
   selection of winning horses for each race respectively selected or if the particular
   Event Select bet 12 satisfies some specified incentive allowing for a bet 12 to miss
   one or more selected events. At step 214, an Event Select payout may be paid to
25 bettors 20 with winning Event Select bets 12. A payout amount may be determined
   based on a per dollar wagered basis, taking into account any payout incentives
   stipulated in the Event Select offering 13.    In some cases, a certain amount of the
   Event Select payout for the offering may carry over to a future Event Select offering
   if no Event Select bets 12 received include a correct selection of winning participants
30 for each event respectively selected.
            Some of the steps illustrated in FIGURE 5 may be combined, modified or
   deleted where appropriate, and additional steps may also be added to the flowchart.

                                                22
   Additionally, steps may be performed in any suitable order without departing from the
   scope of the invention.
           As discussed above, various embodiments of invention provide a number of
   advantages. One advantage is that a bettor may select the events that the bettor feels
 5 he has the best chance to correctly pick the winners.         Such selected events may
   include the most favored participants out of the possible events for selection. If a
   bettor misses one of his selected events early, the bettor can re-enter the pool by
   placing an additional bet and selecting additional events that have not yet taken place.
   In some cases, bettors may win their selected events before all the events are
10 complete, thus giving the bettor an incentive to stay at a betting site longer to collect
   the bettor's winnings (since the final payout may not be determined until there are no
   more Event Select bets for a particular Event Select offering with a chance at
   winning). Staying at a betting site longer may mean that the bettor places additional
   bets at the site thus increasing profit. Bettors may watch the Event Select offering
15 pool grow thus providing a greater incentive to place an Event Select bet in the event
   of a large Event Select offering pool.
           Although the present invention have been described in detail with reference to
   particular embodiments,      it should be understood that various        other changes,
   substitutions, and alterations may be made hereto without departing from the spirit
20 and scope of the present invention. For example, although the present invention has
   been described with reference to a number of elements included within system 10,
   including betting system interfaces 14 and betting system platform 16, these elements
   may be combined, rearranged or positioned in order to accommodate particular
   routing architectures or needs. In addition, components of any of these elements may
25 be provided as separate external components where appropriate.               The present
   invention contemplates great flexibility in the arrangement of these elements as well
   as their internal components.
           Numerous      other    changes,    substitutions,  variations,  alterations  and
   modifications may be ascertained by those skilled in the art and it is intended that the
30 present invention encompass all such changes, substitutions, variations, alterations
   and modifications as falling within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
           Throughout this specification and the claims, unless the context requires
   otherwise, the word "comprise"          and its variations, such as "comprises"      and

                                             23
  "comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or
  group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
  integers or steps.
          The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
5 taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that such art forms part of
  the common general knowledge in Australia.
