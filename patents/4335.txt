                                             ABSTRACT
          The present inventors succeeded in improving the antibody constant region to have
increased stability under acid conditions, reduced heterogeneity originated from disulfide bonds
in the hinge region, reduced heterogeneity originated from the H chain C terminus, and increased
stability at high concentrations as well as in discovering novel constant region sequences having
reduced Fcy receptor-binding, while minimizing the generation of novel T-cell epitope peptides.
As a result, the present inventors successfully discovered antibody constant regions with
improved physicochemical properties (stability and homogeneity), immunogenicity, safety, and
pharmacokinetics.

   Cross-Reference to Related Applications

   Technical Field
            The present invention relates to antibody constant regions that have improved
   physicochemical properties (stability and homogeneity), immunogenicity (antigenicity),
10 and safety, and/or half-life in plasma; and antibodies comprising the constant regions.
   Background Art
            Antibodies are drawing attention as pharmaceuticals as they are highly stable in
   plasma (blood) and have few adverse effects. Of them, a number of IgG-type antibody
   pharmaceuticals are available on the market and many antibody pharmaceuticals are
is currently under development (Non-patent Documents 1 and 2).
            Almost all antibody pharmaceuticals currently available on the market are of the
   IgGI subclass.    IgGI type antibodies are expected be useful as anti-cancer antibody
   pharmaceuticals since they can bind to Fcy receptor and exert ADCC activity. However,
   binding of the Fc domain to Fcy receptor, which is important for effector function such as
20 ADCC, can cause unnecessary adverse effects, and thus it is preferable to eliminate such
   binding activity from antibody pharmaceuticals intended for neutralizing biological
   activity (Non-patent Document 3).        Furthermore, since Fc-y receptor is expressed in
   antigen-presenting cells, molecules that bind to Fcy receptor tend to be presented as
   antigens. It has been reported that immunogenicity is and can be enhanced by linking a
25 protein or peptide to the Fc domain of IgGI (Non-patent Document 4 and Patent
   Document 1). Interaction between the antibody Fc domain and Fcy receptor is thought to
   be a cause of the serious adverse effects encountered in phase-I clinical trials of
   TGN1412 (Non-patent Document 5).            Thus, binding to Fcy receptor is considered
   unfavorable in antibody pharmaceuticals intended for neutralizing the biological activity
30 of an antigen from the perspective of adverse effect and immunogenicity.

                                                la
            A method for impairing the binding to Fcy receptor is to alter the subtype of the
   IgG antibody from IgG1 to IgG2 or IgG4; however, this method cannot completely
   inhibit the binding (Non-patent Document 6).           One of the methods reported for
   completely inhibiting the binding to Fcy receptor is to artificially alter the Fc domain. For
 5 example, the effector functions of anti-CD3 antibodies and anti-CD4 antibodies cause
   adverse effects. Thus, amino acids that are not present in the wild type sequence were
   introduced into the Fcy-receptor-binding domain of Fc (Non-patent Documents 3 and 7),
   and clinical trials are currently being conducted to assess anti-CD3 antibodies that do not
   bind to Fcy receptor and anti-CD4 antibodies that have a mutated Fc domain (Non-patent
10 Documents 5 and 8). Alternatively, Fcy receptor-nonbinding antibodies

                                                     2
  can be prepared by altering the FcyR-binding domain of IgGI (at positions 233, 234, 235, 236,
  327, 330, and 331 in the EU numbering system) to an IgG2 or IgG4 sequence (Non-patent
  Document 9 and Patent Document 2).         However, these molecules contain novel non-natural
  peptide sequences of nine to twelve amino acids, which may constitute a T-cell epitope peptide
  and thus pose immunogenicity risk.       There is no previous report on Fcy receptor-nonbinding
  antibodies that have overcome these problems.
            Meanwhile, physicochemical properties of antibody proteins, in particular, homogeneity
  and stability, are very crucial in the development of antibody pharmaceuticals. For the IgG2
  subtype, heterogeneity originated from disulfide bonds in the hinge region has been reported
  (Non-patent Document 10 and Patent Document 3). It is not easy to manufacture them as a
  pharmaceutical in large-scale while maintaining the objective substances/related substances
  related heterogeneity between productions.      Thus, single substances are desirable as much as
  possible for antibody molecules developed as pharmaceuticals.
            IgG2 and IgG4 are unstable under acidic conditions.      IgG type antibodies are in
  general exposed to acidic conditions in the purification process using Protein A and the virus
  inactivation process. Thus, attention is needed regarding the stability of IgG2 and IgG4 during
  these processes, and it is preferable that antibody molecules developed as pharmaceuticals are
  also stable under acidic conditions.    Natural IgG2 and IgG4, and Fcy receptor-nonbinding
  antibodies derived from IgG2 or IgG4 (Non-patent Documents 6 and 7 and Patent Document 2)
  have such problems. It is desirable to solve these problems when developing antibodies into
  pharmaceuticals.
            IgG 1-type antibodies are relatively stable under acidic conditions, and the degree of
  heterogeneity originated from disulfide bonds in the hinge region is also lower in this type of
   antibodies.   However, IgGl-type antibodies are reported to undergo non-enzymatic peptide
5  bond cleavage in the hinge region in solutions when they are stored as formulations, and Fab
   fragments are generated as impurities as a result (Non-patent Document 11).      It is desirable to
   overcome the generation of impurity when developing antibodies into pharmaceuticals.
            Furthermore, for heterogeneity of the C-terminal sequence of an antibody, deletion of
   C-terminal amino acid lysine residue, and amidation of the C-terminal amino group due to
0  deletion of both of the two C-terminal amino acids, glycine and lysine, have been reported
   (Non-patent Document 12). It is preferable to eliminate such heterogeneity when developing
   antibodies into pharmaceuticals.
             The constant region of an antibody pharmaceutical aimed for neutralizing an antigen
   preferably has a sequence that overcomes all the problems described above. However, a
5   constant region that meets all the requirements has not been reported.
             A preferred form of antibody pharmaceutical administration is thought to be

                                                       3
   subcutaneous formulation in chronic autoimmune diseases and such.         Low-cost, convenient
   antibody pharmaceuticals that can be administered subcutaneously in longer intervals can be
   provided by increasing the half-life of an antibody in the plasma to prolong its therapeutic effect
   and thereby reduce the amount of protein administered, and by conferring the antibody with high
   stability so that high concentration formulations can be prepared.
             In general, it is necessary that subcutaneous formulations are high-concentration
   formulations.     From the perspective of stability or such, the concentration limit of IgG-type
   antibody formulations is in general thought to be about 100 mg/ml (Non-patent Document 13).
   Thus, it is a challenge to secure stability at high concentration. However, there is no report
 ) published on the improvement of the stability of IgG at high concentrations by introducing
   amino acid substitutions into its constant region. A method for prolonging the antibody
   half-life in plasma has been reported and it substitutes amino acids in the constant region
   (Non-patent Documents 14 and 15); however, introduction of non-natural sequences into the
   constant region is not unpreferable from the perspective of immunogenicity risk.
 5            As described above, when the purpose of an antibody pharmaceutical is to neutralize an
   antigen, it is preferable that all the problems described above have been overcome with regard to
   its constant-region sequence. However, a constant region that meets all the requirements has
   not been reported.     Thus, there are demands for antibody constant regions that have overcome
   the problems described above.

   Mode for Carrying Out the Invention
 5           The present invention provides antibody constant regions whose physicochemical
   properties (stability and homogeneity), immunogenicity, safety, and/or pharmacokinetics have
   been improved by altering the amino acid sequence of an antibody constant region; antibodies
    comprising such constant region; pharmaceutical compositions comprising such antibody; and
    methods for producing them.
 3           Herein, the constant region refers to IgGI, IgG2, or IgG4 type constant region.   The
    antibody constant region is preferably a human antibody constant region.     The amino acid
    sequences of human IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 constant regions are known (human IgGl constant
    region, SEQ ID NO: 1; human IgG2 constant region, SEQ ID NO: 2; and human IgG4 constant
    region, SEQ ID NO: 3).      The amino acid substitution-containing antibody constant regions of
.5  the present invention may comprise other amino acid substitutions or modifications as long as
    they comprise the amino acid substitutions of the present invention.   Therefore, IgG2 constant
    regions comprising the amino acid substitutions of the present invention in the IgG2 constant
    region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 include IgG2 constant regions that
    comprise one or more amino acid substitutions and/or modifications in the amino acid sequence
 0  of SEQ ID NO: 2 and further comprise the amino acid substitutions of the present invention, as
    well as IgG2 constant regions that comprise the amino acid substitutions of the present invention
    and further comprise one or more amino acid substitutions and/or modifications.     The same
    applies to IgG1 constant regions comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and
    IgG4 constant regions comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3.        The sequence of
35  human IgG4 constant region has been altered to improve the stability of the hinge region (Mol.
     Immunol. 1993 Jan;30(1):105-8).     Furthermore, the sugar chain at position 297 in the EU

                                                     11
  numbering system may be of any sugar-chain structure, or there may not be any sugar chain
  linked at this site (for example, can be produced with E. coli).
  <IgG2 having altered amino acids>
            The present invention provides IgG2 constant regions with an improved stability under
  acid conditions.
            More specifically, the present invention provides IgG2 constant regions in which Met at
  position 276 (position 397 in the EU numbering system) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
  NO: 2 has been substituted with another amino acid. The type of amino acid after substitution
  is not particularly limited; however, substitution to Val is preferred.   The antibody stability
  under acidic conditions can be improved by substituting Met at position 276 (position 397 in the
  EU numbering system) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 with another amino acid.
            The IgG2 constant regions provided by the present invention, which have an improved
  stability under acid conditions, may also have other amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions,
  and/or insertions, as long as they have at least the amino acid substitution described above.
            The present invention provides IgG2 constant regions with reduced heterogeneity of
  hinge region.
            More specifically, the present invention provides IgG2 constant regions in which Cys at
  position 14 (position 131 in the EU numbering system), Arg af position 16 (position 133 in the
  EU numbering system), and/or Cys at position 102 (position 219 in the EU numbering system) in
  the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 have been substituted with other amino acids. The
  type of amino acid after substitution is not particularly limited; however, substitutions of Ser for
  Cys at position 14 (position 131 in the EU numbering system), Lys for Arg at position 16
  (position 133 in the EU numbering system), and Ser for Cys at position 102 (position 219 in the
  EU numbering system) (IgG2-SKSC) are preferred.
5           These substitutions can reduce the heterogeneity originated from the hinge region of
  IgG2.     The IgG2 constant regions of the present invention comprising amino acid substitutions
  include IgG2 constant regions comprising at least one of the three types of amino acid
  substitutions described above; however, the IgG2 constant regions preferably comprise
  substitutions of Cys at position 14 and Cys at position 102 with other amino acids or all three
0 types of the amino acid substitutions described above.
            The IgG2 constant regions provided by the present invention, which have reduced
  heterogeneity, may also have other amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, and/or
  insertions, as long as they have at least the amino acid substitution described above.
            For example, mutating Cys at position 14 and Arg at position 16 in an IgG2 constant
5 region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 may generate non-natural, novel
  peptide sequences of nine to twelve amino acids, which can become T-cell epitope peptides, and

                                                       12
   thus generate immunogenicity risk.        Even with the introduction of the amino acid substitutions
   described above, the generation of non-natural T-cell epitope peptides can be avoided by
   substituting Glu at position 20 (position 137 in the EU numbering system) and Ser at position 21
    (position 138 in the EU numbering system) with other amino acids.         The type of amino acid
    after substitution is not particularly limited; however, substitutions of Gly for Glu at position 20
    and Gly for Ser at position 21 are preferred.
              The present invention also provides IgG2 constant regions with reduced Fey
    receptor-binding activity.
              More specifically, the present invention also provides IgG2 constant regions comprising
    an amino acid sequence in which Ala at position 209 (EU330), Pro at position 210 (EU33 1),
    and/or Thr at position 218 (EU339) of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 have been
    substituted with Ser, Ser, and Ala, respectively.     The substitutions for Ala at position 209
    (EU330) and for Pro at position 210 (EU33 1) have already been reported to enable the
    impairment of the Fcy receptor binding (Eur. J. Immunol. 1999 Aug;29(8):2613-24).           From the
    perspective of immunogenicity risk, however, these alterations are not preferred because they
    result in generation of non-human derived peptides that can become T-cell epitopes.         However,
    the Fcy receptor binding of IgG2 can be reduced by substituting Ala for Thr at position 218
     (EU339) at the same time, and the 9-12 amino acid peptides which can become T-cell epitopes
     are derived from human only.
              The IgG2 constant regions of the present invention comprising amino acid substitutions
     comprise at least one of the three types of amino acid substitutions described above; however,
     the IgG2 constant regions preferably comprise all three types of the amino acid substitutions
     described above.     In a preferred embodiment, the IgG2 constant regions of the present invention
     comprising amino acid substitutions include IgG2 constant regions comprising an amino acid
5    sequence in which Ala at position 209 (EU330), Pro at position 210 (EU33 1), and Thr at position
     218 (EU339) in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 have been substituted with Ser, Ser,
     and Ala, respectively.
              The IgG2 constant regions provided by the present invention, which have reduced Fey
     receptor-binding activity, may also have other amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions,
0    and/or insertions, as long as they have at least the amino acid substitution described above.
               The present invention provides IgG2 constant regions with reduced C-terminal
     heterogeneity.
               More specifically, the present invention provides IgG2 constant regions comprising an
      amino acid sequence in which Gly at position 325 (position 446 in the EU numbering system)
5 . and Lys at position 326 (position 447 in the EU numbering system) have been deleted in the
      amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.        The heterogeneity originated from the C terminus of

                                                      13
  antibody H chain can be reduced only when both of the amino acids are deleted.
              The IgG2 constant regions provided by the present invention, which have reduced
  C-terminal heterogeneity, may also have other amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions,
  and/or insertions, as long as they have at least the amino acid substitution described above.
              The present invention further provides IgG2 constant regions with improved
  pharmacokinetics.
              Specifically, the present invention provides IgG2 constant regions in which His at
  position 147 (position 268 in the EU numbering system), Arg at position 234 (position 355 in the
  EU numbering system), and Gln at position 298 (position 419 in the EU numbering system) in
  the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 have been substituted with other amino acids. These
  amino acid substitutions enable to improve antibody pharmacokinetics. The type of amino acid
  after substitution is not particularly limited; however, substitutions of Gln for His at position 147
  (position 268 in the EU numbering system), Gln for Arg at position 234 (position 355 in the EU
  numbering system), and Glu for Gln at position 298 (position 419 in the EU numbering system)
  are preferred. The IgG2 constant regions with amino acid substitutions of the present invention
  include IgG2 constant regions comprising at least one of the three types of the amino acid
  substitutions described above; however, the IgG2 constant regions preferably comprise all three
  types of the amino acid substitutions described above.
            . Below is a preferred embodiment of IgG2 of the present invention, which has improved
   stability under acidic conditions, reduced heterogeneity in the hinge region, and/or reduced Fcy
  receptor-binding activity.

   which Ala at position 209, Pro at position 210, Thr at position 218, Met at position 276, Cys at
   position 14, Arg at position 16, Cys at position 102, Glu at position 20, and Ser at position 21 in
5  the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 have been substituted with other amino acids.

  numbering system) have been deleted in the IgG4 constant region comprising the amino acid
  sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3.        The heterogeneity originated from the C terminus of antibody H
  chain can be reduced only when both of the amino acids are deleted.
            The IgG4 constant regions provided by the present invention, which have reduced

   446 in the EU numbering system) and Lys at position 326 (position 447 in the EU numbering
   system) in the above-described IgG4 constant region. Such antibodies include, for example,
   IgG4 constant regions comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 (Ml 1AGK).
   <IgGI having altered amino acids>
 0          The present invention provides IgG1 constant regions with reduced C-terminal
   heterogeneity.
            More specifically, the present invention provides IgGI constant regions having the

   330 (position 447 in the EU numbering system) in the IgG1 constant region comprising the

   terminus of an antibody can be reduced only when both of the amino acids are deleted.
            The present invention provides IgG1 constant regions with improved pharmacokinetics.
            The present invention provides IgG1 constant regions comprising an amino acid
   sequence in which Asn at position 317 (position 434 in the EU numbering system) in the amino

   and/or insertions, as long as they have at least the amino acid deletions described above.
            The present invention also provides antibodies comprising any one of the antibody

                                                    19
  such.    In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are humanized
  antibodies.
            Alternatively, the antibody constant regions described above and/or antibody molecules
  comprising an antibody constant region described above can be linked as a form of Fc fusion
  molecule to antibody-like binding molecule (scaffold molecules), bioactive peptides, binding

  modification products can be obtained by chemically modifying antibodies of the present
  invention.     Methods for modifying antibodies are already established in this field.
            The antibodies of the present invention may also be bispecific antibodies.   "Bispecific
  antibody" refers to an antibody that has in a single molecule variable regions that recognize
  different epitopes.    The epitopes may be present in a single molecule or in separate molecules.
            The antibody constant regions described above can be used as a constant region in an
  antibody against an arbitrary antigen.    The antigen is not particularly limited.
            The antibodies of the present invention can also be obtained by, for example, the
  following methods.       In one embodiment to obtain antibodies of the present invention, one or
  more amino acid residues are first deleted or substituted with amino acids of interest in the
  constant region.     Methods for substituting one or more amino acid residues with amino acids of
  interest include, for example, site-directed mutagenesis (Hashimoto-Gotoh, T., Mizuno, T.,
  Ogasahara, Y., and Nakagawa, M. An oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed dual amber method for
  site-directed mutagenesis. Gene (1995) 152, 271-275; Zoller, M. J., and Smith, M.

  phenotypic selection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1985) 82, 488-492).        These methods can be
  used to substitute target amino acids in the constant region of an antibody with amino acids of
  interest.
            In another embodiment to obtain antibodies, an antibody that binds to an antigen of
5 interest is first prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.    When the prepared
  antibody is derived from a nonhuman animal, it can be humanized.         The binding activity of the

                                                     20
    antibody can be determined by known methods.        Next, one or more amino acid residues in the
    constant region of the antibody are deleted or substituted with amino acids of interest.
             More specifically, the present invention relates to methods for producing antibodies,
    which comprise the steps of:
 5  (a) expressing a DNA encoding an H chain in which one or more amino acid residues in the
    constant region are deleted or substituted with amino acids of interest, and a DNA encoding an L
    chain; and
    (b) collecting the expression products of step (a).
             The first step of the production methods of the present invention is expressing a DNA
 0 encoding an antibody H chain in which one or more amino acid residues in the constant region
   are deleted or substituted with amino acids of interest, and a DNA encoding an antibody L chain.
   A DNA encoding an H chain in which one or more amino acid residues in the constant region
   are deleted or substituted with amino acids of interest can be prepared, for example, by obtaining
   a DNA encoding the constant region of a wild type H chain, and introducing an appropriate
 5 substitution so that a codon encoding a particular amino acid in the constant region encodes an
   amino acid of interest.
             Alternatively, a DNA encoding an H chain in which one or more amino acid residues in
   the constant region are deleted or substituted with amino acids of interest can also be prepared by
   designing and then chemically synthesizing a DNA encoding a protein in which one or more
 0 amino acid residues in the constant region of the wild type H chain are deleted or substituted
   with amino acids of interest.
             The type of amino acid substitution includes the substitutions described herein, but is
   not limited thereto.
             Alternatively, a DNA encoding an H chain in which one or more amino acid residues in
.5 the constant region are deleted or substituted with amino acids of interest can also be prepared as
   a combination of partial DNAs.       Such combinations of partial DNAs include, for example, the
   combination of a DNA encoding a variable region and a DNA encoding a constant region, and
   the combination of a DNA encoding an Fab region and a DNA encoding an Fc region, but are
   not limited thereto.    A DNA encoding an L chain can also be prepared as a combination of
 0 partial DNAs.
             Methods for expressing the above-described DNAs include the methods described
   below.     For example, an H chain expression vector is constructed by inserting a DNA encoding
   an H chain variable region into an expression vector along with a DNA encoding an H chain
   constant region.     Likewise, an L chain expression vector is constructed by inserting a DNA
 5 encoding an L chain variable region into an expression vector along with a DNA encoding an L
   chain constant region.     Alternatively, these H and L chain genes may be inserted into a single

                                                      21
   vector.    Expression vectors include, for example, SV40 virus-based vectors, EB virus-based
   vectors, and BPV (papilloma virus)-based vectors, but are not limited thereto.
             Host cells are co-transformed with an antibody expression vector constructed by the
   methods described above.       Such host cells include the above-described cells such as CHO
 5 (Chinese hamster ovary) cells as well as microorganisms such as E. coli, yeast, and Bacillus
   subtilis, and plants and animals (Nature Biotechnology (2007) 25, 563-565; Nature
   Biotechnology (1998) 16, 773-777; Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications
   (1999) 255, 444-450; Nature Biotechnology (2005) 23, 1159-1169; Journal of Virology (2001)
   75, 2803-2809; Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications (2003) 308, 94-100).
 ) The transformation can be preferably achieved by using electroporation, the lipofectin method (R.
   W. Malone et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1989) 86, 6077; P. L. Felgner et al., Proc. Natl.
   Acad. Sci. USA (1987) 84, 7413), calcium phosphate method (F. L. Graham & A. J. van der Eb,
   Virology (1973) 52, 456-467), DEAE-Dextran method, and the like.
             In the next step of antibody production, the expression products obtained in step (a) are
 5 collected.    The expression products can be collected, for example, by culturing the
   transformants and then separating the products from the transformed cells or culture media.
   Separation and purification of antibodies can be achieved by an appropriate combination of
   methods such as centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, salting out, ultrafiltration,
   columns of 1q, FcRn, Protein A, and Protein G, affinity chromatography, ion exchange
 ) chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography.

  <Pharmaceutical compositions comprising antibodies>
            The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibody of
  the present invention.
            The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be formulated, in
  addition to the antibodies, with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers by known methods.         For
  example, the compositions can be used parenterally, when the antibodies are formulated in a
5 sterile solution or suspension for injection using water or any other pharmaceutically acceptable
  liquid.    For example, the compositions can be formulated by appropriately combining the
  antibodies with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or media, specifically, sterile water or
  physiological saline, vegetable oils, emulsifiers, suspending agents, surfactants, stabilizers,
  flavoring agents, excipients, vehicles, preservatives, binding agents, and such, by mixing them at
0 a unit dose and form required by generally accepted pharmaceutical implementations.         The
  content of the active ingredient in such a formulation is adjusted so that an appropriate dose
  within the required range can be obtained.
            Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated using vehicles such as distilled
  water for injection, according to standard protocols.
5           Aqueous solutions used for injection include, for example, physiological saline and
  isotonic solutions containing glucose or other adjuvants such as D-sorbitol, D-mannose,

                                                     32
   D-mannitol, and sodium chloride.      These can be used in conjunction with suitable solubilizers
   such as alcohol, specifically ethanol, polyalcohols such as propylene glycol and polyethylene
   glycol, and non-ionic surfactants such as Polysorbate 80T and HCO-50.
             Oils include sesame oils and soybean oils, and can be combined with solubilizers such
 5 as benzyl benzoate or benzyl alcohol.      These may also be formulated with buffers, for example,
   phosphate buffers or sodium acetate buffers; analgesics, for example, procaine hydrochloride;
   stabilizers, for example, benzyl alcohol or phenol; or antioxidants. The prepared injections are
   typically aliquoted into appropriate ampules.
             The administration is preferably carried out parenterally, and specifically includes
 0 injection, intranasal administration, intrapulmonary administration, and percutaneous
   administration. For example, injections can be administered systemically or locally by
   intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, or subcutaneous
   injection.
             Furthermore, the method of administration can be appropriately selected according to
 5 the age and symptoms of the patient.      A single dose of the pharmaceutical composition
   containing an antibody or a polynucleotide encoding an antibody can be selected, for example,
   from the range of 0.0001 to 1,000 mg per kg of body weight. Alternatively, the dose may be,
   for example, in the range of 0.001 to 100,000 mg/person. However, the dose is not limited to
   these values.    The dose and method of administration vary depending on the patient's body
 0 weight, age, and symptoms, and can be appropriately selected by those skilled in the art.

               The result is shown in Fig. 1. While the content of aggregate in WT-IgG1 after
    purification was about 2%, those of WT-IgG2 and WT-IgG4 after purification were about 25%.
    This suggests that IgGI is stable to acid during hydrochloric acid elution, and by contrast, IgG2
35  and IgG4 are unstable and underwent denaturation/aggregation. Thus, the stability of IgG2 and
    IgG4 under acidic condition was demonstrated to be lower than that of IgGl. Protein A has

  been frequently used to purify IgG molecules, and the IgG molecules are eluted from Protein A
  under acidic condition. In addition, virus inactivation, which is required when developing IgG
  molecules as pharmaceuticals, is generally carried out under acidic condition. It is thus
  desirable that the stability of IgG molecules under acidic condition is higher. However, the
  stability of IgG2 and IgG4 molecules under acidic condition was found to be lower than that of
  IgG 1, and suggests for the first time that there is a problem of denaturation/aggregation under
  acidic condition in developing IgG2 and IgG4 molecules as pharmaceuticals. It is desirable that
  this problem of denaturation/aggregation be overcome when developing them as pharmaceuticals.
  To date, however, no report has been published on a method for solving this problem through
  amino acid substitution.
  Preparation and assessment of WT-IgG2 and WT-IgG4 having an altered CH3 domain
            The stability of IgG2 and IgG4 molecules under acidic condition was demonstrated to
  be lower than that of IgGl. Thus, altered forms of IgG2 and IgG4 molecules were tested to
  improve the stability under acidic condition. According to models for the constant regions of
  IgG2 and IgG4 molecules, one of the potential destabilizing factors under acidic condition was
  thought to be the instability at the CH3-CH3 domain interface. Methionine at position 397 in
  the EU numbering system in IgG2, or arginine at position 409 in the EU numbering system in
  IgG4 was thought to destabilize the CH3/CH3 interface. Since positions 397 and 409 of IgG1
  in the EU numbering system are valine and lysine, respectively, an altered IgG2 antibody that
  comprises the substitution of valine for methionine at position 397 in the EU numbering system
  (IgG2-M397V, SEQ ID NO: 16 (amino acid sequence)) and an altered IgG4 antibody that
  comprises the substitution of lysine for arginine at position 409 in the EU numbering system
  (IgG4-R409K, SEQ ID NO: 17 (amino acid sequence)) are prepared.
5           The methods used for constructing expression vectors for the antibodies of interest, and
  expressing and purifying the antibodies, were the same as those used for the hydrochloric acid
  elution described above. Gel filtration chromatography analysis was carried out to estimate the
  contents of aggregate in the purified samples obtained by hydrochloric acid elution from Protein
  A.

                                                    36
  By contrast, the contents of aggregate in variants with altered CH3 domain, IgG2-M397V and
  IgG4-R409K, were comparable (approx. 2%) to that in IgGl.         This finding demonstrates that
  the stability of an IgG2 or IgG4 antibody under acidic condition can be improved by substituting
  valine for methionine of IgG2 at position 397 in the EU numbering system or lysine for arginine
  of IgG4 at position 409 in the EU numbering system, respectively.       The purified antibodies of
  were dialyzed against a solution of 20 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0 (EasySEP,
  TOMY). DSC measurement (measurements of midpoint temperature and Tm value) was
  carried out at a heating rate of 1 C/min from 40 to 100*C at a protein concentration of about 0.1
  mg/ml.      Furthermore, the midpoint temperatures of thermal denaturation of WT-IgG2,
  WT-IgG4, IgG2-M397V, and IgG4-R409K were determined. The result showed that the Tm
  value for the altered CH3 domain was higher in IgG2-M397V and IgG4-R409K as compared to
  WT-IgG2 and WT-IgG4, respectively.         This suggests that IgG2-M397V and IgG4-R409K are
  also superior in terms of thermal stability as compared to WT-IgG2 and WT-IgG4, respectively.
             IgG2 and IgG4 are exposed to acidic condition in virus inactivation process and in the
  purification process using Protein A.    Thus, denaturation/aggregation in the above processes
  was problematic.      However, it was discovered that the problem could be solved by using
  IgG2-M397V and IgG4-R409K for the sequences of IgG2 and IgG4 constant regions. Thus,
  these alterations were revealed to be very useful in developing IgG2 and IgG4 antibody
  pharmaceuticals.      Furthermore, the usefulness of IgG2-M397V and IgG4-R409K was also
   demonstrated by the finding that they are superior in thermal stability.

             The result is shown in Fig. 2.   WT-IgG2 showed more than one peak in the ion
 ) exchange analysis while WT-IgG1 and WT-IgG4 exhibited a single peak.             This suggests that
   the IgG2 molecule is more heterogeneous as compared to IgG1 and IgG4.            Indeed, IgG2
   isotypes have been reported to have heterogeneity derived from disulfide bonds in the hinge
   region (Non-patent Document 10).        Thus, the hetero-peaks of IgG2 shown in Fig. 2 are also
   assumed to be objective substance/related substances derived from the disulfide bonds.         It is not
 5 easy to manufacture them as a pharmaceutical in large-scale while maintaining the objective
   substances/related substances related heterogeneity between productions.        Thus, homogeneous
   (less heterogeneous) substances are desirable as much as possible for antibody molecules
   developed as pharmaceuticals.       For wild type IgG2, there is a problem of homogeneity which is
   important in developing antibody pharmaceuticals.       Indeed, US20060194280 (Al) has shown
 ) that natural IgG2 gives various hetero-peaks as a result of the disulfide bonds in ion exchange
    chromatography analysis, and that the biological activity varies among these peaks.
   US20060194280 (Al) reports refolding in the purification process as a method for combining the
   hetero-peaks into a single one, but use of such a process in the production is costly and
    complicated.     Thus, a preferred method for combining the hetero-peaks into a single one is
Z5  based on amino acid substitution.     Although the heterogeneity originated from disulfide bonds
    in the hinge region should be overcome to develop IgG2 as pharmaceuticals, no report has been
    published to date on a method for solving this problem through amino acid substitution.
    Preparation and assessment of altered WT-IgG2 CHI domain and hinge region
30           As shown in Fig. 3, there are various potential disulfide bond patterns for an IgG2
    molecule.     Possible causes of the heterogeneity derived from the hinge region of IgG2 were
    differential pattern of disulfide bonding and free cysteines.   IgG2 has two cysteines (at positions
    219 and 220 in the EU numbering system) in the upper hinge region, and cysteines adjacent to
    the two upper-hinge cysteines include cysteine at position 131 in the EU numbering system in
35  the H chain CH1 domain and L chain C-terminal cysteine, and two'corresponding cysteines in
    the H chain upper hinge of the dimerization partner.     Specifically, there are eight cysteines in

                                                     38
   total in the vicinity of the upper hinge region of IgG2 when the antibody is in the associated form
   of H2L2.      This may be the reason for the various heterogeneous patterns due to wrong disulfide
   bonding and free cysteines.
             The hinge region sequence and CHI domain of IgG2 were altered to reduce the
   heterogeneity originated from the IgG2 hinge region.      Examinations were conducted to avoid
   the heterogeneity of IgG2 due to differential pattern of disulfide bonding and free cysteines.
   The result of examining various altered antibodies suggested that the heterogeneity could be
   avoided without decreasing the thermal stability by substituting seine and lysine for cysteine
   and arginine at positions 131 and 133 in the EU numbering system, respectively, in the H chain
 ) CH1 domain, and substituting seine for cysteine at position 219, EU numbering, in the upper
   hinge of H chain of the wild type IgG2 constant region sequence (hereinafter IgG2-SKSC)
   (IgG2-SKSC, SEQ ID NO: 18).          These substitutions would enable IgG2-SKSC to form a
   homogenous covalent bond between H and L chains, which is a disulfide bond between the
    C-terminal cysteine of the L chain and cysteine at position 220 in the EU numbering system (Fig.
 5 4).
              The methods described in Reference Example 1 were used to construct an expression
    vector for IgG2-SKSC and to express and purify IgG2-SKSC.         The purified IgG2-SKSC and
    wild type IgG2 (WT-IgG2) were analyzed for homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography.

              The result is shown in Fig. 5.  As expected above, IgG2-SKSC was shown to be eluted
    at a single peak while WT-IgG2 gave multiple peaks.      This suggests that the heterogeneity
    derived from disulfide bonds in the hinge region of IgG2 can be avoided by using alterations
    such as those used to generate IgG2-SKSC, which allow formation of a single disulfide bond
30  between the C-terminal cysteine of the L chain and cysteine at position 220 in the EU numbering
    system.     The midpoint temperatures of thermal denaturation of WT-IgG1, WT-IgG2, and
    IgG2-SKSC were determined by the same methods as described in Example 1. The result
    showed that WT-IgG2 gave a peak for Fab domain which has a lower Tm value than WT-IgG1,
    while IgG2-SKSC did not give such a peak. This suggests that IgG2-SKSC is also superior in
35  thermal stability as compared to WT-IgG2.
              Although wild type IgG2 was thought to have a homogeneity problem which is

                                                    39
  important in developing antibody pharmaceuticals, it was found that this problem could be
  solved by using IgG2-SKSC for the constant region sequence of IgG2. Thus, IgG2-SKSC is
  very useful in developing IgG2 antibody pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the usefulness of
  IgG2-SKSC was also demonstrated by the finding that it is superior in thermal stability.
  [Example 3] Improvement of C-terminal heterogeneity in IgG molecules
  Construction of an expression vector for H chain C-terminal AGK antibody from WT-IgGl
            For heterogeneity of the C-terminal sequences of an antibody, deletion of C-terminal
  amino acid lysine residue, and amidation of the C-terminal amino group due to deletion of both
  of the two C-terminal amino acids, glycine and lysine, have been reported (Non-patent
  Document 12).      The absence of such heterogeneity is preferred when developing antibody
  pharmaceuticals. Actually, in humanized PM-1 antibody TOCILIZUMAB, the major
  component is the sequence that lacks the C-terminal amino acid lysine, which is encoded by the
  nucleotide sequence but deleted in post-translational modification, and the minor component
  having the lysine also coexists as heterogeneity.    Thus, the C-terminal amino acid sequence was
  altered to reduce the C-terminal heterogeneity.    Specifically, the present inventors altered the
  nucleotide sequence of wild type IgG1 to delete the C-terminal lysine and glycine from the H
  chain constant region of the IgG1, and assessed whether the amidation of the C-terminal amino
  group could be suppressed by deleting the two C-terminal amino acids glycine and lysine.
            Mutations were introduced into the C-terminal sequence of the H chain using pB-CH
  vector encoding the humanized PM-1 antibody (WT) obtained in Reference Example 1.             The
  nucleotide sequence encoding Lys at position 447 and/or Gly at position 446 in the EU
  numbering system was converted into a stop codon by introducing a mutation using the
5  QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the method described in
  the attached instruction manual. Thus, expression vectors for antibody engineered to lack the
   C-terminal amino acid lysine (position 447 in the EU numbering system) and antibody
   engineered to lack the two C-terminal amino acids glycine and lysine (positions 446 and 447 in
   the EU numbering system, respectively) were constructed. H chain C-terminal AK and AGK
0  antibodies were obtained by expressing the engineered H chains and the L chain of the
   humanized PM-1 antibody.      The antibodies were expressed and purified by the method
   described in Reference Example 1.
            Purified H chain C-terminal AGK antibody was analyzed by cation exchange
   chromatography according to the following procedure. The effect of the C-terminal deletion on
5  heterogeneity was assessed by cation exchange chromatography analysis using the purified H
   chain C-terminal AGK antibody according to the method described below.         The conditions of

  PM-1 antibody, H chain C-terminal AK antibody, and H chain C-terminal AGK antibody were

           The analysis result for the non-altered humanized PM-I antibody, H chain C-terminal
  AK antibody, and H chain C-terminal AGK antibody is shown in Fig. 6.        According to
  Non-patent Document 10, a basic peak with more prolonged retention time than that of the main
  peak contains an H chain C terminus with Lys at position 449 and an H chain C terminus with
  amidated Pro at position 447.    The intensity of the basic peak was significantly reduced in the H
  chain C-terminal AGK antibody, while no such significant reduction was observed in the H chain
  C-terminal AK antibody.     This suggests that the C-terminal heterogeneity of the H chain can be
  reduced only when the two C-terminal amino acids are deleted from the H chain.
           The temperature of thermal denaturation of the H chain C-terminal AGK antibody was
  determined by DSC to assess the effect of the deletion of the two residues at the H chain C
  terminus on thermal stability.    For the DSC measurement, the antibody was dialyzed against 20
  mM acetic acid buffer (pH 6.0) containing 150 mM NaCl to change the buffer.         After thorough
  deaeration, the humanized PM-1 antibody and H chain C-terminal AGK antibody solutions, and
  the reference solution (outer dialysate) were enclosed in calorimetric cells, and thoroughly
  thermally equilibrated at 40*C.    Then, the samples were scanned at from 40 to 100*C with a
5 rate of about lK/min.    The resulting denaturation peaks were assigned (Rodolfo et al.,
  Immunology Letters, 1999, p 47-52).       The result showed that the C-terminal deletion had no
  effect on the thermal denaturation temperature of CH3 domain.
            Thus, the heterogeneity originated from the C-terminal amino acid can be reduced
  without affecting the thermal stability of antibody by deleting the C-terminal lysine and glycine
0  from the H chain constant region at the nucleotide sequence level.   Since all of the constant
   regions of human antibodies IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 contain Gly and Lys at positions 446 and 447
   in the EU numbering system in their C-terminal sequences, the method for reducing the
   C-terminal amino acid heterogeneity discovered in this example and others is also expected to be
   applicable to IgG2 and IgG4 constant regions.

   [Example 4] Construction of M14AGK with a novel optimized constant region sequence
              When an antibody pharmaceutical is aimed at neutralizing an antigen, effector functions
   such as ADCC of Fc domain are unnecessary and therefore the binding to Fcy receptor is
   unnecessary. The binding to Fcy receptor is assumed to be unfavorable from the perspectives
   of immunogenicity and adverse effect (Non-patent Documents 5 and 6).             The humanized
   anti-IL-6 receptor IgG1 antibody TOCILIZUMAB does not need to bind to Fcy receptor,
   because it only needs to specifically bind to IL-6 receptor and neutralize its biological activity in
   order to be used as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with IL-6, such as rheumatoid
   arthritis.
 )
   Construction and assessment of M14AGK, M 11AGK, and M17AGK, Fcy receptor-nonbinding,
   optimized constant regions
              A possible method for impairing the Fcy receptor binding is to convert the IgG antibody
   from IgG1 isotype to IgG2 or IgG4 isotype (Ann. Hematol. 1998 Jun;76(6):231-48).             As a
 5 method for completely eliminating the binding to Fcy receptor, a method of introducing an
   artificial alteration into Fc domain has been reported. For example, since the effector functions
   of anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD4 antibody cause adverse effects, amino acid mutations that
   are not present in the wild type sequence have been introduced into the Fcy receptor-binding
   region of Fc domain (Non-patent Documents 3 and 7), and the resulting Fcy receptor-nonbinding
 ) anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 antibodies are currently under clinical trials (Non-patent Documents 5
   and 8).    According to another report (Patent Document 3), Fcy receptor-nonbinding antibodies
   can be prepared by converting the FcyR-binding domain of IgG1 (at positions 233, 234, 235, 236,
   327, 330, and 331 in the EU numbering system) into the sequence of IgG2 (at positions 233, 234,
   235, and 236 in the EU numbering system) or IgG4 (at positions 327, 330, and 331 in the EU
 5 numbering system).        However, if all of the above mutations are introduced into IgGI, novel
   peptide sequences of nine amino acids, which potentially serve as non-natural T-cell epitope
    peptides, will be generated, and this increases the immunogenicity risk.       The immunogenicity
    risk should be minimized in developing antibody pharmaceuticals.
              To overcome the above problem, alterations in the IgG2 constant region were
 0  considered.     In the FcyR-binding domain of IgG2 constant region, residues at positions 327,
    330, and 331 in the EU numbering system are different from the nonbinding sequence of IgG4
    while those at positions 233, 234, 235, and 236 in the EU numbering system are amino acids of
    nonbinding type.      Thus, it is necessary to alter the amino acids at positions 327, 330, and 331 in
    the EU numbering system to the sequence of IgG4 (G2Aa described in Eur. J. Immunol. 1999
35  Aug;29(8):2613-24).       However, since the amino acid at position 339 in the EU numbering
    system in IgG4 is alanine while the corresponding residue in IgG2 is threonine, a simple

                                                     42
   alteration of the amino acids at positions 327, 330, and 331 in the EU numbering system to the
   sequence of IgG4 unfavorably generates a novel peptide sequence of 9 amino acids, potentially
   serving as a non-natural T-cell epitope peptide, and thus increases the immunogenicity risk.
   Then, the present inventors found that the generation of novel peptide sequence could be
   prevented by introducing the substitution of alanine for threonine at position 339 in the EU
   numbering system in IgG2, in addition to the alteration described above.
             In addition to the mutations described above, other mutations were introduced, and they
   were the substitution of valine for methionine at position 397 in the EU numbering system in
   IgG2, which was discovered in Example 1 to improve the stability of IgG2 under acidic
   condition; and the substitution of serine for cysteine at position 131 in the EU numbering system,
   the substitution of lysine for arginine at position 133 in the EU numbering system, and the
   substitution of serine for cysteine at position 219 in the EU numbering system, which were
   discovered in Example 2 to improve the heterogeneity originated from disulfide bonds in the
   hinge region. Furthermore, since the mutations at positions 131 and 133 generate a novel
 5 peptide sequence of 9 amino acids, potentially serving as a non-natural T-cell epitope peptide,
    and thus generate the immunogenicity risk, the peptide sequence around positions 131 to 139
    was converted into a natural human sequence by introducing the substitution of glycine for
    glutamic acid at position 137 in the EU numbering system and the substitution of glycine for
    serine at position 138 in the EU numbering system.      Furthermore, glycine and lysine at
    positions 446 and 447 in the EU numbering system were deleted from the C terminus of H chain
    to reduce the C-terminal heterogeneity. The constant region sequence having all of the
    mutations introduced was named M14AGK (M14AGK, SEQ ID NO: 5). Although there is a
    mutation of cysteine at position 219 to serine in M14AGK as a novel 9-amino acid peptide
     sequence which potentially serves as a T-cell epitope peptide, the immunogenicity risk was
Z5   considered very low since the amino acid property of seine is similar to that of cysteine. The
     immunogenicity prediction by TEPITOPE also suggested that there was no difference in
     immunogenicity.
              An expression vector for the antibody H chain sequence whose variable region was WT
     and constant region was M14AGK (M14AGK, SEQ ID NO: 5; WT-M14AGK, SEQ ID NO: 19)
30   was constructed by the method described in Reference Example 1. An antibody having
     WT-M14AGK as H chain and WT as L chain was expressed and purified by the method
     described in Reference Example 1.
              Furthermore, in WT-M1 1AGK (M 1AGK, SEQ ID NO: 8; WT-M11AGK, SEQ ID NO:
     21), mutations were introduced with the same method into the IgG4 constant region at positions
35    233, 234, 235, and 236 in the EU numbering system (G4Ab described in Eur. J. Immunol. 1999
      Aug;29(8):2613-24; this alteration newly generates non-human sequence and thus increases the

                                                    43
  immunogenicity risk) to reduce the Fcy receptor binding.       In addition to the above alteration, to
  reduce the immunogenicity risk, mutations were introduced at positions 131, 133, 137, 138, 214,
  217, 219, 220, 221, and 222 in the EU numbering system so that the pattern of disulfide bonding
  in the hinge region was the same as that of M14AGK; a mutation was introduced at position 409
  in the EU numbering system (Example 1) to improve the stability under acidic condition; and the
  amino acids at positions 446 and 447 in the EU numbering system were deleted (Example 3) to
  reduce the C-terminal heterogeneity.
            Furthermore, WT-M17AGK (M17AGK, SEQ ID NO: 10; WT-M17AGK, SEQ ID NO:
  20) was constructed by introducing mutations into the IgGI constant region at positions 233, 234,
  235, 236, 327, 330, 331, and 339 in the EU numbering system (GlAab described in Eur. J.
  Immunol. 1999 Aug;29(8):2613-24) to impair the Fcy receptor binding and by deleting the
  amino acids at positions 446 and 447 in the EU numbering system to reduce the C-terminal
  heterogeneity (Example 3).
            WT-M17AGK or WT-M11AGK was used as the H chain, and WT was used as the L
  chain.    These antibodies were expressed and purified by the method described in Example 1.
  Assessment of WT-M14AGK, WT-M17AGK, and WT-MI 1AGK for Fcy receptor binding
            The FcyRI binding was assessed by the procedure described below.         Using Biacore
  T100, human-derived Fcy receptor I (hereinafter FcyRI) immobilized onto a sensor chip was
   allowed to interact with IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, M 1AGK, M14AGK, or M1AGK 7 as an analyte.
   The amounts of bound antibody were compared.         The measurement was conducted using
  Recombinant Human FcRIA/CD64 (R&D systems) as human-derived FcyRI, and IgG1, IgG2,
   IgG4, M1AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK as samples. FcyRI was immobilized onto the sensor
   chip CM5 (BIACORE) by the amine coupling method.           The final amount of immobilized
5  hFcyRI was about 13000 RU.       The running buffer used was HBS-EP+, and the flow rate was 20
   pd/min.   The sample concentration was adjusted to 100 pg/ml using HBS-EP+.           The analysis
   included two steps: two minutes of association phase where 10 pl of an antibody solution was
   injected and the subsequent four minutes of dissociation phase where the injection was switched
   with HBS-EP+.      After the dissociation phase, the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 20
0  p1 of 5 mM sodium hydroxide.       The association, dissociation, and regeneration constitute one
   analysis cycle.  Various antibody solutions were injected to obtain sensorgrams. As analytes,
   IgG4, IgG2, IgG1, Ml1, M14, and M17 were injected in this order. This series of injection was
   repeated twice.   The result of comparison of data on the determined amounts of bound antibody
   is shown in Fig. 7.  The comparison shows that the amount of bound antibody is reduced in the
5  order of: IgGI > IgG4 >> IgG2    = M1AGK      = M14AGK     = M17AGK.        Thus, it was revealed
   that the FeyRI binding of wild type IgG2, M 11AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK was weaker than

                                                   44
  that of wild type IgG1 and IgG4.
            The FcyRIIa binding was assessed by the procedure described below.        Using Biacore
  T100, human-derived Fcy receptor Ha (hereinafter FeyRIIa) immobilized onto a sensor chip was
  allowed to interact with IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, Ml lAGK, M14AGK, or M17AGK as an analyte.
  The amounts of bound antibody were compared.         The measurement was conducted using
  Recombinant Human FcRIIA/CD32a (R&D systems) as human-derived FcyRIla, and IgG1,
  IgG2, IgG4, M11AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK as samples. FecyRIIa was immobilized onto
  the sensor chip CM5 (BIACORE) by the amine coupling method.            The final amount of
  immobilized FcyRIIa was about 3300 RU.        The running buffer used was HBS-EP+, and the
  flow rate was 20 41/min.     Then, the running buffer was injected until the baseline was stabilized.
  The measurement was carried out after the baseline was stabilized. The immobilized FcyRIIa
  was allowed to interact with an antibody of each IgG isotype (IgGI, IgG2, or IgG4) or antibody
  introduced with mutations (M11AGK, M14AGK, or M17AGK) as an analyte. The amount of
  bound antibody was observed. The running buffer used was HBS-EP+, and the flow rate was
  20 pl/min.    The measurement temperature was 25*C.        The concentration of each IgG or
  altered form thereof was adjusted to 100 jg/ml.     20 p1 of an analyte was injected and allowed to
  interact with the immobilized FcyRIIa.     After interaction, the analyte was dissociated from
  FcyRIIa and the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 200 pl of the running buffer.      As
  analytes, IgG4, IgG2, IgG1, M1 1AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK were injected in this order.
) This series of injection was repeated twice. The result of comparison of data on the amounts of
  bound antibody determined is shown in Fig. 8. The comparison shows that the amount of
  bound antibody is reduced in the order of: IgG1 > IgG2= IgG4 > M 11AGK          = M14AGK    =
  M17AGK.       Thus, it was revealed that the FcyRIIa binding of Ml IAGK, M14AGK, and
  MI7AGK was weaker than that of wild type IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4.
5           The FcyRIIb binding was assessed by the procedure described below.        Using Biacore
  TI 00, human-derived Fcy receptor Ilb (hereinafter FcyRIIb) immobilized onto a sensor chip was
   allowed to interact with IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, M 11AGK, M14AGK, or M17AGK as an analyte.
   The amounts of bound antibody were compared. The measurement was conducted using
   Recombinant Human FcRIIB/C (R&D systems) as human-derived FcyRIIb, and IgG1, IgG2,
0  IgG4, Ml1AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK as samples. FcyRIIb was immobilized onto the
   sensor chip CM5 (BIACORE) by the amine coupling method.            The final amount of
   immobilized FcyRIIb was about 4300 RU.        Then, the running buffer was injected until the
   baseline was stabilized.   The measurement was carried out after the baseline was stabilized.
   The immobilized FcyRIIb was allowed to interact with an antibody of each IgG isotype (IgG1,
5  IgG2, or IgG4) or antibody introduced with mutations (M 11AGK, M14AGK, or M17AGK) as an
   analyte.  The amount of bound antibody was observed.         The running buffer used was

                                                     45
  HBS-EP+ and the flow rate was 20 pl/min.         The measurement temperature was 25'C.        The
  concentration of each IgG or altered form thereof was adjusted to 200 pg/ml.        20 d of an
  analyte was injected and allowed to interact with the immobilized FcyRlIb. After interaction,
  the analyte was dissociated from FeyRIIb and the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 200
  [1 of the running buffer.    As analytes, IgG4, IgG2, IgG1, M1AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK
  were injected in this order.   This series of injection was repeated twice.    The result of
  comparison of data on the amounts of bound antibody determined is shown in Fig. 9.           The
  comparison shows that the amount of bound antibody is reduced in the order of: IgG4 > IgGI >
  IgG2 > M1AGK= M14AGK             = Ml7AGK.       Thus, it was revealed that the FcyRIIb binding of
  M 11AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK was weaker than that of wild type IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4.
            The FcyRIIIa binding was assessed by the procedure described below.         Using Biacore
  T100, human-derived Fcy receptor Ia (hereinafter FcyRIIla) immobilized onto a sensor chip
  was allowed to interact with IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, M1 IAGK, M14AGK, or M17AGK as an analyte.
  The amounts of bound antibody were compared. The measurement was conducted using
  hFcyRIIIaV-His6 (recombinant hFcyRIIIaV-His6 prepared in the applicants' company) as
  human-derived FcyRIIIa, and IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, M 11AGK, M14AGK, and M17AGK as samples.
  FcyRIIIa was immobilized onto the sensor chip CM5 (BIACORE) by the amine coupling method.
  The final amount of immobilized hFcyRIIIaV-His6 was about 8200 RU.             The running buffer
  used was HBS-EP+, and the flow rate was 5 p1/min.         The sample concentration was adjusted to
  250 pg/ml using HBS-EP+.        The analysis included two steps: two minutes of association phase
  where 10 pl of an antibody solution was injected and the subsequent four minutes of dissociation
  phase where the injection was switched with HBS-EP+.          After the dissociation phase, the
   sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 20 pl of 5 mM hydrochloric acid. The association,
   dissociation, and regeneration constitute one analysis cycle. Various antibody solutions were
5  injected to obtain sensorgrams.    As analytes, IgG4, IgG2, IgG1, Ml1AGK, M14AGK, and
   M17AGK were injected in this order.       The result of comparison of data on the determined
   amounts of bound antibody is shown in Fig. 10.       The comparison shows that the amount of
   bound antibody is reduced in the order of: IgG1 >> IgG4 > IgG2 > M17AGK > M 1AGK              =
   M14AGK.       Thus, it was revealed that the FcyRIIIa binding of M 1AGK, M14AGK, and
0  M17AGK was weaker than that of wild type IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4.           Furthermore, the FcyRIIIa
   binding of M 11AGK and M14AGK was found to be weaker than that of M17AGK containing the
   mutation GlAab reported in Eur. J. Immunol. 1999 Aug;29(8):2613-24.
             The finding described above demonstrates that the Fcy receptor binding of
   WT-M 14AGK, WT-M 17AGK, and WT-M 11 AGK is markedly reduced as compared to wild type
5  IgG1.    The immunogenicity risk due to Fcy receptor-mediated internalization into APC and
    adverse effects caused by the effector function such as ADCC can be avoided by using

                                                    46
  WT-Ml4AGK, WT-Ml7AGK, or WT-M11AGK as a constant region. Thus, WT-Ml4AGK,
  WT-M17AGK, and WT-M I1AGK are useful as constant region sequence of antibody
  pharmaceuticals aimed at neutralizing antigens.
  Assessment of WT-M14AGK, WT-M17AGK, and WT-M 11AGK for stability at high
  concentrations
            WT-M14AGK, WT-M17AGK, and WT-Ml lAGK were assessed for stability at high
  concentrations. The purified antibodies of WT-IgGl, WT-M14AGK, WT-Ml7AGK, and
  WT-M11 AGK were dialyzed against a solution of 20 mM histidine chloride, 150 mM NaCl, pH
  6.5 (EasySEP, TOMY), and then concentrated by ultrafilters. The antibodies were tested for
  stability at high concentrations.  The conditions were as follows.
            Antibodies: WT-IgGl, WT-Ml4AGK, WT-M17AGK, and WT-M11AGK
            Buffer: 20 mM histidine chloride, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.5
            Concentration: 61 mg/ml
            Storage temperature and time period: 40*C for two weeks, 40'C for one month, 40'C
  for two months
            Aggregation assessment method:
                     System: Waters Alliance
                     Column: G3000SWxl (TOSOH)
                     Mobile phase: 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM KCl, pH 7.0
                     Flow rate, wavelength: 0.5 ml/min, 220 nm
                     100 times diluted samples were analyzed
            The contents of aggregate in the initial formulations (immediately after preparation) and
  formulations stored under various conditions were estimated by gel filtration chromatography
5 described above.     Differences (amounts increased) in the content of aggregate relative to the
  initial formulations are shown in Fig. 11. The result showed that the amounts of aggregate in
  WT-M14AGK, WT-M17AGK, and WT-M1 1AGK increased only slightly as compared to
  WT-IgG1 and were about half of the content in WT. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 12, the
  amount of increased Fab fragment was comparable between WT-IgG 1 and WT-M 17AGK, while
0 the amounts increased in WT-M14AGK and WT-M 11AGK were about one quarter of the
  amount in WT.      Degeneration pathways of IgG type antibody formulations include formation of
  aggregate and generation of Fab degradate as described in WO 2003/039485. Based on the two
  criteria, aggregation and Fab fragment generation, WT-M14AGK and WT-M 11AGK were
  demonstrated to have a superior stability in formulations as compared to WT-IgGl. Thus, even
5 for antibodies that have an IgG1 constant region with poor stability and could not be prepared as
  antibody pharmaceuticals in high-concentration liquid formulations, the use of WT-Ml4AGK,

                                                     47
   WT-M17AGK, or WT-M1 1AGK as a constant region was expected to allow production of more
   stable high-concentration liquid formulations.
            In particular, M14AGK was expected to be very useful as a novel constant region
   sequence that would (1) overcome the instability of the original IgG2 molecule under acidic
   condition; (2) improve the heterogeneity originated from disulfide bonds in the hinge region; (3)
   not bind to Fcy receptor; (4) have a minimized number of novel peptide sequences of 9 amino
   acids which potentially serve as T-cell epitope peptides; and (5) have a better stability than IgG1
   in high-concentration formulations.
 ) [Example 5] Preparation and assessment of M3 1AGK
            M14AGK prepared in Example 4 was altered by substituting the IgG2 sequence for the
   amino acids at positions 330, 331, and 339 in the EU numbering system to construct M31AGK
   (M31AGK, SEQ ID NO: 7).          An expression vector for a sequence of antibody H chain whose
   variable region is WT and constant region sequence is M3 1AGK (WT-M3 1AGK, SEQ ID NO:
 5 22) was constructed by the method described in Reference Example 1.         Using WT-M31AGK H
   chain and WT L chain, WT-M3 1AGK was expressed and purified by the method described in
   Reference Example 1.
             In addition to WT-M31AGK, WT-IgG2 and WT-M14AGK were expressed and purified
   at the same time, and analyzed by cation exchange chromatography by the procedure described
 ) below.     The conditions used in the cation exchange chromatography analysis were as follows.
   Chromatograms for WT-IgG2, WT-M14AGK, and WT-M3 1AGK were compared.
                       Column: ProPac WCX-10 (Dionex)
                       Mobile phase     A: 25 mmol/l MES/NaOH, pH 6.1
                                        B: 25 mmol/l MES/NaOH, 250 mmol/1 NaCl, pH 6.1
 5                     Flow rate: 0.5 ml/min
                       Gradient: 0% B (5 min) -> (65 min) -> 100% B -> (1 min)
                       Detection: 280 nm
            The analysis result for WT-IgG2, WT-M14AGK, and WT-M31AGK is shown in Fig. 13.
    Like WT-M14AGK, WT-M3 1AGK was demonstrated to be eluted as a single peak, while
30  WT-IgG2 gave multiple peaks.       This indicates that the heterogeneity derived from disulfide
    bonds in the hinge region of IgG2 can also be avoided in WT-M3 1AGK.
    [Example 6] Assessment of the plasma retention of WT-M14
35  Method for estimating the retention in human plasma
              The prolonged retention (slow elimination) of IgG molecule in plasma is known to be

                                                    48
   due to the function of FcRn which is known as a salvage receptor of IgG molecule (Nat. Rev.
   Immunol. 2007 Sep;7(9):715-25). When taken up into endosomes via pinocytosis, under the
   acidic conditions within endosome (approx. pH 6.0), IgG molecules bind to FcRn expressed in
   endosomes. While IgG molecules that do not bind to FcRn are transferred and degraded in
 5 lysosomes, those bound to FcRn are translocated to the cell surface and then released from FcRn
   back into plasma again under the neutral conditions in plasma (approx. pH 7.4).
             Known IgG-type antibodies include the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 isotypes. The
   plasma half-lives of these isotypes in human are reported to be about 36 days for IgGI and IgG2;
   about 29 days for IgG3; and 16 days for IgG4 (Nat. Biotechnol. 2007 Dec; 25(12):1369-72).
 0 Thus, the retention of IgG1 and IgG2 in plasma is believed to be the longest. In general, the
   isotypes of antibodies used as pharmaceutical agents are IgGI, IgG2, and IgG4. Methods
   reported for further improving the pharmacokinetics of these IgG antibodies include methods for
   improving the above-described binding to human FcRn, and this is achieved by altering the
   sequence of IgG constant region (J. Biol. Chem. 2007 Jan 19;282(3):1709-17; J. Imunol. 2006
 5 Jan 1;176(1):346-56).
             There are species-specific differences between mouse FcRn and human FcRn (Proc.
   Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006 Dec 5;103(49):18709-14). Therefore, to predict the plasma
   retention of IgG antibodies that have an altered constant region sequence in human, it is
   desirable to assess the binding to human FcRn and retention in plasma in human FcRn transgenic
 0 mice (Int. Immunol. 2006 Dec;18(12):1759-69).
   Assessment of the binding to human FcRn
             FcRn is a complex of FcRn and    p2-microglobulin.   Oligo-DNA primers were prepared
   based on the human FcRn gene sequence disclosed (J. Exp. Med. (1994) 180 (6), 2377-2381).
25 A DNA fragment encoding the whole gene was prepared by PCR using human cDNA (Human
   Placenta Marathon-Ready cDNA, Clontech) as a template and the prepared primers. Using the
   obtained DNA fragment as a template, a DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain
    containing the signal region (Metl-Leu290) was amplified by PCR, and inserted into an animal
    cell expression vector (the amino acid sequence of human FcRn as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 24).
30 Likewise, oligo-DNA primers were prepared based on the human p2-microglobulin gene
    sequence disclosed (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. (2002) 99 (26), 16899-16903). A DNA
    fragment encoding the whole gene was prepared by PCR using human cDNA (Hu-Placenta
    Marathon-Ready cDNA, CLONTECH) as a template and the prepared primers. Using the
    obtained DNA fragment as a template, a DNA fragment encoding the whole p2-microglobulin

    cell expression vector (the amino acid sequence of human p2-microglobulin as set forth in SEQ

            Soluble human FcRn was expressed by the following procedure.        The plasmids
   constructed for human FcRn and p2-microglobulin were introduced into cells of the human
   embryonic kidney cancer-derived cell line HEK293H (Invitrogen) using 10% Fetal Bovine
   Serum (Invitrogen) by lipofection.    The resulting culture supernatant was collected, and FcRn
   was purified using IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) by the method described
   in J. Immunol. 2002 Nov 1;169(9):5171-80, followed by further purification using HiTrap Q HP
   (GE Healthcare).
            The binding to human FcRn was assessed using Biacore 3000.        An antibody was
   bound to Protein L or rabbit anti-human IgG Kappa chain antibody immobilized onto a sensor
   chip, human FcRn was added as an analyte for interaction with the antibody, and the affinity
   (KD) was calculated from the amount of bound human FcRn.         Specifically, Protein L or rabbit
   anti-human IgG Kappa chain antibody was immobilized onto sensor chip CM5 (BIACORE) by
   the amine coupling method using 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 150 mM
   NaCl as the running buffer. Then, an antibody was diluted with a running buffer containing
   0.02% Tween20, and injected to be bound to the chip. Human FcRn was then injected and the
   binding of the human FcRn to antibody was assessed.
             The affinity was computed using BIAevaluation Software.      The obtained sensorgram
   was used to calculate the amount of hFcRn bound to the antibody immediately before the end of
   human FcRn injection. The affinity of the antibody for human FcRn was calculated by fitting
   with the steady state affinity method.
    Assessment for the plasma retention in human FcRn transgenic mice
             The pharmacokinetics in human FcRn transgenic mice (B6.mFcRn-/-.hFcRn Tg line
5   276 +/+ mice; Jackson Laboratories) was assessed by the following procedure. An antibody
    was intravenously administered once at a dose of 1 mg/kg to mice, and blood was collected at
    appropriate time points.   The collected blood was immediately centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and
    4C for 15 minutes to obtain blood plasma. The separated plasma was stored in a freezer at
    -20'C or below until use. The plasma concentration was determined by ELISA.

    Predictive assessment of the plasma retention of WT-M14 in human
             The bindings of WT-IgG 1 and WT-M14 to human FcRn were assessed by BlAcore.
    As shown in Table 1, the result indicated that the binding of WT-M 14 was slightly greater than
    that of WT-IgG1.

             As shown in Fig. 14, however, the retention in plasma was comparable between
   WT-IgGl and WT-M14 when assessed using human FcRn transgenic mice.                This finding
   suggests that the plasma retention of the M14 constant region in human is comparable to that of
   the IgG1 constant region.
    [Example 7] Preparation of WT-M44, WT-M58, and WT-M73 which have improved
   pharmacokinetics
   Preparation of the WT-M58 molecule
             As described in Example 6, the plasma retention of WT-M14 in human FcRn transgenic
   mice was comparable to that of WT-IgGl.         Known methods to improve pharmacokinetics
    include those to lower the isoelectric point of an antibody and those to enhance the binding to
    FcRn.    Here, the modifications described below were introduced to improve the
    pharmacokinetics of WT-M14.        Specifically, the following substitutions were introduced into
    WT-M31AGK, which was prepared from WT-M14 as described in Example 4: substitution of
    methionine for valine at position 397; substitution of glutamine for histidine at position 268;
    substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 355; and substitution of glutamic acid for
 )  glutamine at position 419 in the EU numbering system.       These four substitutions were
    introduced into WT-M31AGK to generate WT-M58 (amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26).
    Expression vectors were prepared by the same method described in Example 1.          WT-M58 and
    L(WT) were used as H chain and L chain, respectively.       WT-M58 was expressed and purified
    by the method described in Example 1.

     Construction of the WT-M73 molecule
              On the other hand, WT-M44 (amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27) was generated
     by introducing into IgG1 a substitution of alanine for the amino acid at position 434, EU
     numbering.    WT-M83 (amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 58) was also generated by
30   deletions of glycine at position 446, EU numbering and lysine at position 447, EU numbering to
     reduce H chain C-terminal heterogeneity.     Furthermore, WT-M73 (amino acid sequence of
     SEQ ID NO: 28) was generated by introducing into WT-M58 a substitution of alanine at position
     434, EU numbering.
              Expression vectors for the above antibodies were constructed by the method described

                                                   51
  in Example 1. WT-M44, WT-M58, or WT-M73 was used as H chain, while L (WT) was used
  as L chain. WT-M44, WT-M58, and WT-M73 were expressed and purified by the method
  described in Example 1.
  Predictive assessment of the plasma retention of WT-M44, WT-M58, and WT-M73 in human
            The bindings of WT-IgG1, WT-M44, WT-M58, and WT-M73 to human FcRn were
  assessed by BlAcore.      As shown in Table 2, the result indicates that the bindings of WT-M44,
  WT-M58, and WT-M73 are greater than WT-IgG1, and about 2.7, 1.4, and 3.8 times of that of
  WT-IgGl, respectively.

     WT-M73         0.42
            As a result of assessing WT-IgG1, WT-M14, and WT-M58 for their plasma retention in
   human FcRn transgenic mice, as shown in Fig. 24, WT-M58 was confirmed to have increased
   retention in plasma relative to WT-IgGl and WT-M14. Furthermore, WT-IgGl, WT-M44,
   WT-M58, and WT-M73 were assessed for their plasma retention in human FcRn transgenic mice.
   As shown in Fig. 15, all of WT-M44, WT-M58, and WT-M73 were confirmed to have improved
   pharmacokinetics relative to WT-IgGl. The pharmacokinetics-improving effect correlated with
   the binding activity to human FcRn. In particular, the plasma level of WT-M73 at Day 28 was
0  improved to about 16 times of that of WT-IgG1. This finding suggests that the
   pharmacokinetics of antibodies with the M73 constant region in human is also significantly
   enhanced when compared to antibodies with the IgG1 constant region.
    [Example 8] Effect of the novel constant regions M14 and M58 in reducing heterogeneity in
5   various antibodies
             As described in Example 4, it was demonstrated that the heterogeneity originated from
    the hinge region of IgG2 could be reduced by converting the IgG2 constant region to M14 in the
    humanized anti-IL-6 receptor PM1 antibody (WT). IgG2 type antibodies other than the
    humanized PM1 antibody were also tested to assess whether the heterogeneity can be reduced by
0   converting their constant regions into M14 or M58.
             Antibodies other than the humanized PM1 antibody were: the anti IL-6 receptor
    antibody F2H/L39 (the amino acid sequences of F2H/L39_VH and F2H/L39 VL as set forth in

                                                     52
   SEQ ID NOs: 29 and 30, respectively); anti-IL-31 receptor antibody HOLO (the amino acid
   sequences of HOLOVH and HOLO_VL as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 31 and 32, respectively);
   and anti-RANKL antibody DNS (the amino acid sequences of DNSVH and DNS_VL as set
   forth in SEQ ID NOs: 33 and 34, respectively).       For each of these antibodies, antibodies with
   IgGI constant region (SEQ ID NO: 1), IgG2 constant region (SEQ ID NO: 2), or M14 (SEQ ID
   NO: 5) or M58 (SEQ ID NO: 35) were generated.
              The generated antibodies were assessed for heterogeneity by cation exchange
   chromatography using an adequate gradient and an appropriate flow rate on a ProPac WCX-10
   (Dionex) column (mobile phase A: 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), mobile phase B: 20 mM
   sodium acetate/lM NaCl (pH 5.0)).       The assessment result obtained by cation exchange
   chromatography (IEC) is shown in Fig. 16.
              As shown in Fig. 16, conversion of the constant region from an IgG1 type into an IgG2
   type was demonstrated to increase heterogeneity not only in the humanized anti-IL-6 receptor
   PM1 antibody (WT), but also in the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody F2H/L39, anti-IL-31 receptor
 5  antibody HOLO, and anti-RANKL antibody DNS.           In contrast, heterogeneity could be decreased
    in all of these antibodies by converting their constant region into M14 or M58.     Thus, it was
    demonstrated that, regardless of the type of antigen or antibody variable region sequence, the
    heterogeneity originated from natural IgG2 could be reduced by substituting serines for cysteines
    at position 131, EU numbering, in the H-chain CHI domain and at position 219, EU numbering,
 )  in the upper hinge of H chain.
     [Example 9] Effect of the novel constant region M58 to improve the pharmacokinetics in various
    antibodies
               As described in Example 7, it was demonstrated that conversion of the constant region
.5   from IgG1 into M58 in the humanized anti-IL-6 receptor PM1 antibody (WT) improved the
    binding to human FcRn and pharmacokinetics in human FcRn transgenic mice.            So, IgG1 type
     antibodies other than the humanized PM1 antibody were also tested to assess whether their
     pharmacokinetics can be improved by converting their constant region into M58.
               Antibodies other than the humanized PM1 antibody (WT) were the anti-IL-31 receptor
30   antibody HOLO (the amino acid sequences of HOLOVH and HOLO_VL as set forth in SEQ ID
     NOs: 31 and 32, respectively) and anti-RANKL antibody DNS (the amino acid sequences of
     DNSVH and DNSVL as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 33 and 34, respectively). For each of
     these antibodies, antibodies with IgGI constant region (SEQ ID NO: 1) or M58 (SEQ ID NO:
     35) were generated and assessed for their binding to human FcRn by the method described in
35   Example 6.     The result is shown in Table 3.

            As shown in Table 3, it was demonstrated that as a result of conversion of the constant
  region from the IgG1 type to M58, as with anti-IL-6 receptor antibody WT, the bindings of both
  the anti-IL-31 receptor antibody HOLO and anti-RANKL antibody DNS to human FcRn were
  improved.     This suggests the possibility that regardless of the type of antigen or sequence of
  antibody variable region, the pharmacokinetics in human is improved by converting the constant
  region from the IgG1 type to M58.
) [Example 10] Effect of cysteine in the CHI domain on heterogeneity and stability
            As described in Example 2, cysteines in the hinge region and CHI domain of IgG2 were
  substituted to decrease the heterogeneity of natural IgG2. Assessment of various altered
  antibodies revealed that heterogeneity could be reduced without decreasing stability by using
  SKSC (SEQ ID NO: 154). SKSC (SEQ ID NO: 38) is an altered constant region obtained by
5 substituting serine for cysteine at position 131 and lysine for arginine at position 133, EU
  numbering, in the H-chain CHI domain, and seine for cysteine at position 219, EU numbering,
  in the H-chain upper hinge of the wild type IgG2 constant region sequence.
            Meanwhile, another possible method for decreasing heterogeneity is a single
  substitution of serine for cysteine at position 219, or seine for cysteine at position 220, EU
0 numbering, in the H-chain upper hinge. The altered IgG2 constant region SC (SEQ ID NO: 39)
  was prepared by substituting seine for cysteine at position 219 and CS (SEQ ID NO: 40) was
  prepared by substituting seine for cysteine at position 220, EU numbering, in IgG2. WT-SC
  (SEQ ID NO: 41) and WT-CS (SEQ ID NO: 42) were prepared to have SC and CS, respectively,
  and compared with WT-IgG1, WT-IgG2, WT-SKSC, and WT-M58 in terms of heterogeneity
5 and thermal stability.   Furthermore, F2H/L39-IgGl, F2H/L39-IgG2, F2H/L39-SC,
  F2H/L39-CS, F2H/L39-SKSC, and F2H/L39-M14, which have the constant region of IgGI
   (SEQ ID NO: 1), IgG2 (SEQ ID NO: 2), SC (SEQ ID NO: 39), CS (SEQ ID NO: 40), SKSC
   (SEQ ID NO: 38), or M14 (SEQ ID NO: 5), respectively, were prepared from F2H/L39 (the
   amino acid sequences of F2H/L39_VH and F2H/L39_VL as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 29 and 30,
0 respectively), which is an anti IL-6 receptor antibody different from WT. The antibodies were
   compared with regard to heterogeneity.
            WT-IgGl, WT-IgG2, WT-SC, WT-CS, WT-SKSC, WT-M58, F2H/L39-IgG1,

                                                    54
   F2H/L39-IgG2, F2H/L39-SC, F2H/L39-CS, F2H/L39-SKSC, and F2H/L39-M14 were assessed
   for heterogeneity by cation exchange chromatography using an adequate gradient and an
   appropriate flow rate on a ProPac WCX- 10 (Dionex) column (mobile phase A: 20 mM sodium
   acetate (pH 5.0), mobile phase B: 20 mM sodium acetate/1M NaCl (pH 5.0)). The assessment
   result obtained by cation exchange chromatography is shown in Fig. 17.
             As shown in Fig. 17, conversion of the constant region from an IgGI type to an IgG2
   type was demonstrated to increase heterogeneity in both WT and F2H/L39. In contrast,
   heterogeneity was significantly decreased by converting the constant region into SKSC and M14
   or M58.     Meanwhile, conversion of the constant region into SC significantly decreased
 ) heterogeneity, as in the case of SKSC. However, conversion into CS did not sufficiently
   improve heterogeneity.
             In addition to low heterogeneity, high stability is generally desired when preparing
    stable formulations in development of antibody pharmaceuticals. Thus, to assess stability, the
   midpoint temperature of thermal denaturation (Tm value) was determined by differential
 5  scanning calorimetry (DSC) (VP-DSC; Microcal). The midpoint temperature of thermal
    denaturation (Tm value) serves as an indicator of stability. In order to prepare stable
    formulations as pharmaceutical agents, a higher midpoint temperature of thermal denaturation
    (Tm value) is preferred (J. Pharm. Sci. 2008 Apr;97(4):1414-26). WT-IgGl, WT-IgG2,
    WT-SC, WT-CS, WT-SKSC, and WT-M58 were dialyzed (EasySEP; TOMY) against a solution
 D  of 20 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.0. DSC measurement was carried out at a
    heating rate of 1'C/min in a range of 40 to 100 0 C, and at a protein concentration of about 0.1
    mg/ml. The denaturation curves obtained by DSC are shown in Fig. 18. The Tm values of the
    Fab domains are listed in Table 4 below.
?5  Table 4
                       Tm/*C
       WT-IgGl          94.8

       WT-SKSC          93.7
        WT-M58          93.7
              The Tm values of WT-IgG1 and WT-IgG2 were almost the same (about 94'C; Tm of
     IgG2 was about 1C lower).      Meawhile, the Tm values of WT-SC and WT-CS were about 86'C,
     and thus significantly lower than those of WT-IgGl and WT-IgG2. On the other hand, the Tm
30   values of WT-M58 and WT-SKSC were about 94'C, and comparable to those of WT-IgGl and
     WT-IgG2.     This suggests that WT-SC and WT-CS are markedly unstable as compared to IgG2,

                                                      55
  and thus, WT-SKSC and WT-M58, both of which also comprise substituion of serine for
  cysteine in the CHI domain, are preferred in the development of antibody pharmaceuticals.
  The reason for the significant decrease of Tm in WT-SC and WT-CS relative to IgG2 is thought
  to be differences in the disulfide-bonding pattern between WT-SC or WT-CS and IgG2.
            Furthermore, comparison of DSC denaturation curves showed that WT-IgGl,
  WT-SKSC, and WT-M58 each gave a sharp and single denaturation peak for the Fab domain.
  In contrast, WT-SC and WT-CS each gave a broader denaturation peak for the Fab domain.
  WT-IgG2 also gave a shoulder peak on the lower temperature side of the Fab domain
  denaturation peak.     In general, it is considered that a single component gives a sharp DSC
  denaturation peak, and when two or more components with different Tm values (namely,
  heterogeneity) are present, the denaturation peak becomes broader. Specifically, the
  above-described result suggests the possibility that each of WT-IgG2, WT-SC, and WT-CS
  contains two or more components, and thus the natural-IgG2 heterogeneity has not been
  sufficiently reduced in WT-SC and WT-CS.           This finding suggests that not only cysteines in the
  hinge region but also those in the CHl domain are involved in the wild type-IgG2 heterogeneity,
  and it is necessary to alter not only cysteines in the hinge region but also those in the CHl
   domain to decrease the DSC heterogeneity.        Furthermore, as described above, stability
   comparable to that of wild type IgG2 can be acheived only when cysteines in both the hinge
  region and CHl domain are substituted.
             The above finding suggests that from the perspective of heterogeneity and stability, SC
   and CS, which are constant regions introduced with seine substitution for only the hinge region
   cysteine, are insufficient as constant regions to decrease heterogeneity originated from the hinge
   region of IgG2.    It was thus discovered that the heterogeneity could be significantly decreased
   while maintaining an IgG2-equivalent stability, only when the cysteine at position 131, EU
5  numbering, in the CHi domain was substituted with serine in addition to cysteine at hinge region.
   Such constant regions include M14, M31, M58, and M73 described above.            In particular, M58
   and M73 are stable and less heterogeneous, and exhibit improved pharmacokinetics, and
   therefore are expected to be very useful as constant regions for antibody pharmaceuticals.
0   [Example 11] Generation of fully humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies with improved PK/PD
             To generate a fully humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody with improved PK/PD, the
   molecules described below were created by altering TOCILIZUMAB (H chain, WT-IgGl (SEQ
   ID NO: 12); L chain, WT (SEQ ID NO: 15).          The following fully humanized IL-6 receptor
    antibodies were prepared which use as constant region M73 or M83 prepared in Example 7:
5   Fv3-M73 (H chain, VH4-M73, SEQ ID NO: 48; L chain, VL1-kappa, SEQ ID NO: 49),
    Fv4-M73 (H chain, VH3-M73, SEQ ID NO: 46; L chain, VL3-kappa, SEQ ID NO: 47), and

                                                      56
  Fv5-M83 (H chain, VH5-M83, SEQ ID NO: 44; L chain, VL5-kappa, SEQ ID NO: 45).
            The affinities of prepared Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 against IL-6 receptor were
  compared to that of TOCILIZUMAB.            The affinities of these anti- IL-6 receptor antibodies
  determined are shown in Table 5 (see Reference Example for method).            Furthermore, their
  BaF/gp130-neutralizing activities were compared to those of TOCILIZUMAB and the control
  (the known high affinity anti-IL-6 receptor antibody described in Reference Example, and
  VQ8F11-21 hIgG1 described in US 2007/0280945) (see Reference Example for method).                  The
  results obtained by determining the biological activities of these antibodies using BaF/gpl30 are
  shown in Fig. 19 (TOCILIZUMAB, the control, and Fv5-M83 with a final IL-6 concentration of
  300 ng/ml) and Fig. 20 (TOCILIZUMAB, Fv3-M73, and Fv4-M73 with a final IL-6
  concentration of 30 ng/ml).     As shown in Table 5, Fv3-M73 and Fv4-M73 have about two to
  three times higher affinity than TOCILIZUMAB, while Fv5-M83 exhibits about 100 times
  higher affinity than TOCILIZUMAB (since it was difficult to measure the affinity of Fv5-M83,
  instead the affinity was determined using Fv5-IgG1, which has an IgGl-type constant region; the
  constant region is generally thought to have no effect on affinity). As shown in Fig. 20,
  Fv3-M73 and Fv4-M73 exhibit slightly stronger activities than TOCILIZUMAB. As shown in
  Fig. 19, Fv5-M83 has a very strong activity, which is more than 100 times greater than that of
  TOCILIZUMAB in terms of 50% inhibitory concentration.              Fv5-M83 also exhibits about 10
  times higher neutralizing activity in terms of 50% inhibitory concentration than the control (the
  known high-affinity anti-IL-6 receptor antibody).

            The isoelectric points of TOCILIZUMAB, the control, Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and
5  Fv5-M83 were determined by isoelectric focusing using a method known to those skilled in the
   art.  The result showed that the isoelectric point was about 9.3 for TOCILIZUMAB; about 8.4
   to 8.5 for the control; about 5.7 to 5.8 for Fv3-M73; about 5.6 to 5.7 for Fv4-M73; and 5.4 to 5.5
   for Fv5-M83.     Thus, each antibody had a significantly lowered isoelectric point when compared
   to TOCILIZUMAB and the control.           Furthermore, the theoretical isoelectric point of the
0  variable regions VH/VL was calculated by GENETYX (GENETYX CORPORATION).                         The
   result showed that the theoretical isoelectric point was 9.20 for TOCILIZUMAB; 7.79 for the
   control; 5.49 for Fv3-M73; 5.01 for Fv4-M73; and 4.27 for Fv5-M83.           Thus, each antibody had

                                                    57
  a significantly lowered isoelectric point when compared to TOCILIZUMAB and the control.
  Accordingly, the pharmacokinetics of Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 was thought to be
  improved when compared to TOCILIZUMAB and the control.
           T-cell epitopes in the variable region sequence of TOCILIZUMAB, Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73,
  or Fv5-M83 were analyzed using TEPITOPE (Methods. 2004 Dec;34(4):468-75). As a result,
  TOCILIZUMAB was predicted to have T-cell epitopes, of which many could bind to HLA. In
  contrast, the number of sequences that were predicted to bind to T-cell epitopes was significantly
  reduced in Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83.          In addition, the framework of Fv3-M73,
  Fv4-M73, or Fv5-M83 has no mouse sequence and is thus fully humanized. These suggest the
  possibility that immunogenicity risk is significantly reduced in Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and
  Fv5-M83 when compared to TOCILIZUMAB.
   [Example 12] PK/PD test of fully humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies in monkeys
            Each of TOCILIZUMAB, the control, Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 was
  intravenously administered once at a dose of 1 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkeys to assess the time
   courses of their plasma concentrations (see Reference Example for method). The plasma
   concentration time courses of TOCILIZUMAB, Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 after
   intravenous administration are shown in Fig. 21. The result showed that each of Fv3-M73,
   Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 exhibited significantly improved pharmacokinetics in cynomolgus
   monkeys when compared to TOCILIZUMAB and the control. Of them, Fv3-M73 and
   Fv4-M73 exhibited substantially improved pharmacokinetics when compared to
   TOCILIZUMAB.
            The efficacy of each antibody to neutralize membrane-bound cynomolgus monkey IL-6
   receptor was assessed.    Cynomolgus monkey IL-6 was administered subcutaneously in the
5  lower back at 5 ptg/kg every day from Day 6 to Day 18 after antibody administration (Day 3 to
   Day 10 for TOCILIZUMAB), and the CRP concentration in each animal was determined 24
   hours later (see Reference Example for method).     The time course of CRP concentration after
   administration of each antibody is shown in Fig. 22.    To assess the efficacy of each antibody to
   neutralize soluble cynomolgus monkey IL-6 receptor, the plasma concentration of free soluble
0  cynomolgus monkey IL-6 receptor in the cynomolgus monkeys was determined and percentage
   of soluble IL-6 receptor neutralization were calculated (see Reference Example for method).
    The time course of percentage of soluble IL-6 receptor neutralization after administration of each
    antibody is shown in Fig. 23.
             Each of Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 neutralized membrane-bound cynomolgus
5   monkey IL-6 receptor in a more sustainable way, and suppressed the increase of CRP over a
    longer period when compared to TOCILIZUMAB and the control (the known high-affinity

                                                      58
  anti-IL-6 receptor antibody).     Furthermore, each of Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83
  neutralized soluble cynomolgus monkey IL-6 receptor in a more sustainable way, and suppressed
  the increase of free soluble cynomolgus monkey IL-6 receptor over a longer period when
  compared to TOCILIZUMAB and the control. These findings demonstrate that all of Fv3-M73,
  Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 are superior in sustaining the neutralization of membrane-bound and
  soluble IL-6 receptors than TOCILIZUMAB and the control.             Of them, Fv3-M73 and Fv4-M73
  are remarkably superior in sustaining the neutralization.      Meanwhile, Fv5-M83 suppressed CRP
  and free soluble cynomolgus monkey IL-6 receptor more strongly than Fv3-M73 and Fv4-M73.
  Thus, Fv5-M83 is considered to be stronger than Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and the control (the
) known high-affmity anti-IL-6 receptor antibody) in neutralizing membrane-bound and soluble
  IL-6 receptors.     It was considered that results in in vivo of cynomolgus monkeys reflect the
  stronger affinity of Fv5-M83 for IL-6 receptor and stronger biological activity of Fv5-M83 in the
  BaF/gpl30 assay system relative to the control.
            These findings suggest that Fv3-M73 and Fv4-M73 are highly superior in sustaining
i their activities as an anti-IL-6 receptor-neutralizing antibody when compared to
  TOCILIZUMAB and the control, and thus enable to significantly reduce the dosage and
  frequency of administration.      Furthermore, Fv5-M83 was demonstrated to be remarkably
  superior in terms of the strength of activity as an anti-IL-6 receptor-neutralizing antibody as well
  as sustaining their activity.   Thus, Fv3-M73, Fv4-M73, and Fv5-M83 are expected to be useful
) as pharmaceutical IL-6 antagonists.

             The IL-6 receptor neutralizing activity was assessed using BaF3/gp 130 which
  proliferates in an IL-6/IL-6 receptor-dependent manner.      After three washes with RPMI1640
0  supplemented with 10% FBS, BaF3/gpl3O cells were suspended at 5 x 104 cells/ml in
