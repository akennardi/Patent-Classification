10                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
          This invention relates to certain isoxazolines and their compositions suitable for
   agronomic, nonagronomic and animal health uses, methods of their use for controlling
   invertebrate pests such as arthropods in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments,
   and for treatment of parasite infections in animals or infestations in the general environment.
15                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
          The control of invertebrate pests is extremely important in achieving high crop
   efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause
   significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer.
   The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery crops,
20 stored food and fiber products, livestock, household, turf, wood products, and public health is
   also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need
   continues for new compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally
   safer or have different sites of action.
          The control of animal parasites in animal health is essential, especially in the areas of
25 food production and companion animals. Existing methods of treatment and parasite control
   are being compromised due to growing resistance to many current commercial parasiticides.
   The discovery of more effective ways to control animal parasites is therefore imperative.

          This invention further provides a spray composition for controlling an invertebrate pest
   comprising a compound of Formula 1 (i.e. in a biologically effective amount) or the
 5 composition described above, and a propellant.           This invention also provides a bait
   composition for controlling an invertebrate pest comprising a compound of Formula 1 (i.e. in
   a biologically effective amount) or the compositions described in the embodiments above,
   one or more food materials, optionally an attractant, and optionally a humectant.
          This invention further provides a trap device for controlling an invertebrate pest
10 comprising said bait composition and a housing adapted to receive said bait composition,
   wherein the housing has at least one opening sized to permit the invertebrate pest to pass
   through the opening so the invertebrate pest can gain access to said bait composition from a
   location outside the housing, and wherein the housing is further adapted to be placed in or
   near a locus of potential or known activity for the invertebrate pest.

   effective amount of a compound of Formula 1 (e.g., as a composition described herein) is
   administered to the environment (e.g., a stall or blanket) in which an animal resides.
                                  DETAILS OF THE INVENTION
          As used herein, the terms "comprises," "comprising," "includes," "including," "has,"
35 "having," "contains" or "containing," or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a
   non-exclusive inclusion. For example, a composition, a mixture, process, method, article, or
   apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements

                                                    5
   but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such composition, mixture,
   process, method, article, or apparatus. Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, "or"
   refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is
   satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A
 5 is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present).
          Also, the indefinite articles "a" and "an" preceding an element or component of the
   invention are intended to be nonrestrictive regarding the number of instances (i.e.
   occurrences) of the element or component. Therefore "a" or "an" should be read to include
   one or at least one, and the singular word form of the element or component also includes the
10 plural unless the number is obviously meant to be singular.
          As referred to in this disclosure, the term "invertebrate pest" includes arthropods,
   gastropods and nematodes of economic importance as pests. The term "arthropod" includes
   insects, mites, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, pill bugs and symphylans. The term
   "gastropod" includes snails., slugs and other Stylommatophora.            The term "nematode"
15 includes    all of the helminths, such as roundworms, heartworms, and phytophagous
   nematodes (Nematoda), flukes (Tematoda), Acanthocephala, and tapeworms (Cestoda).
          In the context of this disclosure "invertebrate pest control" means inhibition of
   invertebrate pest development (including mortality, feeding reduction, and/or mating
   disruption), and related expressions are defined analogously.
20        The term "agronomic" refers to the production of field crops such as for food and fiber
   and includes the growth of corn, soybeans and other legumes, rice, cereal (e.g., wheat, oats,
   barley, rye, rice, maize), leafy vegetables (e.g., lettuce, cabbage, and other cole crops),
   fruiting vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, pepper, eggplant, crucifers and cucurbits), potatoes, sweet
   potatoes, grapes, cotton, tree fruits (e.g., pome, stone and citrus), small fruit (berries,
25 cherries) and other specialty crops (e.g., canola, sunflower, olives).
          The term "nonagronomic" refers to other than field crops, such as horticultural crops
   (e.g., greenhouse, nursery or ornamental plants not grown in a field), residential, agricultural,
   commercial and industrial structures, turf (e.g., sod farm, pasture, golf course, lawn, sports
   field, etc.), wood products, stored product, agro-forestry and vegetation management, public
30 health (i.e. human) and animal health (e.g., domesticated animals such as pets, livestock and
   poultry, undomesticated animals such as wildlife) applications.
          Nonagronomic applications include protecting an animal from an invertebrate parasitic
   pest by administering a parasiticidally effective (i.e. biologically effective) amount of a
   compound of the invention, typically in the form of a composition formulated for veterinary
35 use, to the animal to be protected. As referred to in the present disclosure and claims, the
   terms "parasiticidal" and "parasiticidally" refers to observable effects on an invertebrate
   parasite pest to provide protection of an animal from the pest. Parasiticidal effects typically

                                                    6
   relate to diminishing the occurrence or activity of the target invertebrate parasitic pest. Such
   effects on the pest include necrosis, death, retarded growth, diminished mobility or lessened
   ability to remain on or in the host animal, reduced feeding and inhibition of reproduction.
   These effects on invertebrate parasite pests provide control (including prevention, reduction
 5 or elimination) of parasitic infestation or infection of the animal.
          A parasite "infestation" refers to the presence of parasites in numbers that pose a risk to
   humans or animals. The infestation can be in the environment (e.g., in human or animal
   housing, bedding, and surrounding property or structures), on agricultural crops or other
   types of plants, or on the skin or fur of an animal. When the infestation is within an animal
10 (e.g., in the blood or other internal tissues), the term infestation is also intended to be
   synonymous with the term "infection" as that term is generally understood in the art, unless
   otherwise stated.
          In the above recitations, the term alkyll", used either alone or in compound words such
   as "alkylthio" or "haloalkyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl,
15 n-propyl, i-propyl, or the different butyl, pentyl or hexyl isomers.
           "Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the
   different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers.              "Alkylthio" includes branched or
   straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio,
   butylthio, pentylthio and hexylthio isomers. "Alkylsulfinyl" includes both enantiomers of an
20 alkylsulfinyl group.       Examples of "alkylsulfinyl" include S(O)CH 3 , S(O)CH 2 CH 3 ,
   S(O)CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 , S(O)CH(CH 3 )2 and the different butylsulfinyl, pentylsulfinyl and
   hexylsulfinyl isomers.      Examples of "alkylsulfonyl" include S(O) 2 CH 3 , S(O) 2 CH 2 CH 3 ,
   S(O) 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 , S(O) 2 CH(CH 3) 2 , and the different butylsulfonyl, pentylsulfonyl and
   hexylsulfonyl isomers. "Alkylamino" and "dialkylamino" are defined analogously to the
25 above examples.
          The term "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", or when
   used in descriptions such as "alkyl substituted with halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine,
   bromine or iodine. Further, when used in compound words such as "haloalkyl", or when
   used in descriptions such as "alkyl substituted with halogen" said alkyl may be partially or
30 fully substituted with halogen atoms which may be the same or different. Examples of
   "haloalkyl" or "alkyl substituted with halogen" include CF 3 , CH 2 CI, CH2 CF 3 and CCI2 CF 3
   The term "haloalkoxy" is defined analogously to the term "haloalkyl".               Examples of

   CO 2 CH(CH 3 ) 2 and the different butoxy- or pentoxycarbonyl isomers.
 5        "Alkylaminocarbonyl" denotes a straight-chain or branched alkyl moiety bonded to a
   C(O)NH moiety. The chemical abbreviations C(O)NH, C(=O)NH, C(O)N and C(=O)N as
   used herein represent an amide moiety (i.e. an aminocarbonyl group).                Examples of
   "alkylaminocarbonyl" include C(O)NHCH 3 , C(O)NHCH 2 CH2CH 3 and C(O)NHCH(CH 3 ) 2.
   "Dialkylaminocarbonyl" denotes two independent straight-chain or branched alkyl moieties
10 bonded to a C(O)N moiety. Examples of "dialkylaminocarbonyl" include C(O)N(CH 3)2 and
   C(O)N(CH 3)(CH 2 CH 3 ).
          "Haloalkylaminocarbonyl"      denotes a straight-chain or branched haloalkyl moiety
   bonded to a C(O)NH moiety, wherein "haloalkyl" is as defined above.                 Examples of
   "haloalkylaminocarbonyl"        include     C(O)NHCH2CF 3        and    C(O)NHCH 2 CH 2 CH2 Cl.
15 "Halodialkylaminocarbonyl" denotes one straight-chain or branched alkyl moiety and one
   straight-chain or branched haloalkyl moiety bonded to a C(O)N moiety, or two independent
   straight-chain   or branched haloalkyl moieties bonded to a C(O)N moiety, wherein
   "haloalkyl" is as defined above.             Examples of "halodialkylaminocarbonyl" include
   C(O)N(CH2CH 3 )(CH 2 CH 2 Cl) and C(O)N(CF 2 CF3 )2 .        Examples of "C2 alkyl substituted
20 with C1 alkylaminocarbonyl" include CH 2 CH 2 C(O)NHCH 3 and CH(CH 3 )C(O)NHCH 3.
         When R 5 is CI-C   6 alkyl or CI-C  6 haloalkyl, each further substituted with one group as
   defined in the Summary of the Invention, the carbon atom through which said alkyl or
   haloalkyl group is bonded to the remainder of Formula 1 is assigned the 1-position. An
   example of a C 2 alkyl group substituted with a C3 haloalkylaminocarbonyl group attached at
25 the 1-position of the C2 alkyl group is *CH(CH 3 )C(O)NHCH 2 CF 3 , wherein the asterisk
   denotes the 1-position.
         The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Ci-C3"
   prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 9. For example, C1 -C 6 alkylsulfonyl designates
   methylsulfonyl through hexylsulfonyl.
30       When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R 4 , then
   when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said
   group being unsubstituted.

 5 will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial
   effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other
   stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to
   selectively prepare said stereoisomers. The compounds of the invention may be present as a
   mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers or as an optically active form. For
10 example, two possible enantiomers of Formula 1 are depicted as Formula la and Formula lb
   involving the isoxazoline chiral center identified with an asterisk (*). Analogously, other
   chiral centers are possible at, for example, R5 .

15        Molecular depictions drawn herein follow standard conventions for depicting
   stereochemistry. To indicate stereoconfiguration, bonds rising from the plane of the drawing
   and towards the viewer are denoted by solid wedges wherein the broad end of the wedge is
   attached to the atom rising from the plane of the drawing towards the viewer. Bonds going
   below the plane of the drawing and away from the viewer are denoted by dashed wedges
20 wherein the narrow end of the wedge is attached to the atom further away from the viewer.
   Constant width lines indicate bonds with a direction opposite or neutral relative to bonds
   shown with solid or dashed wedges; constant width lines also depict bonds in molecules or
   parts of molecules in which no particular stereoconfiguration is intended to be specified.
          The more biologically active enantiomer is believed to be Formula la. Formula la has
25 the (S) configuration at the chiral carbon and Formula lb has the (R) configuration at the
   chiral carbon.
          This invention comprises racemic mixtures, for example, equal amounts of the
   enantiomers of Formulae la and lb. In addition, this invention includes compounds that are
   enriched compared to the racemic mixture in an enantiomer of Formula 1. Also included are

                                                   9
   the essentially pure enantiomers of compounds of Formula 1, for example, Formula la and
   Formula 1b.
          When enantiomerically enriched, one enantiomer is present in greater amounts than the
   other, and the extent of enrichment can be defined by an expression of enantiomeric excess
 5 ("ee"), which is defined as (2x-1).100 %, where x is the mole fraction of the dominant
   enantiomer in the mixture (e.g., an ee of 20 % corresponds to a 60:40 ratio of enantiomers).
          Preferably the compositions of this invention have at least a 50 %enantiomeric excess;
   more preferably at least a 75 % enantiomeric excess; still more preferably at least a 90 %
   enantiomeric excess; and the most preferably at least a 94 % enantiomeric excess of the more
10 active isomer. Of particular note are enantiomerically pure embodiments of the more active
   isomer.
          Compounds of Formula 1 can comprise additional chiral centers. For example,
   substituents and other molecular constituents such as R5 may themselves contain chiral
   centers. The more biologically active enantiomers of compounds wherein R5 contains the
15 CH(CH 3 )C(O)N moiety (e.g., compounds 94 and 106 of Index Table A) are believed to
   contain the (R) configuration at the chiral carbon. This invention comprises racemic mixtures
   as well as enriched and essentially pure stereoconfigurations at these additional chiral
   centers.
          Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more conformational isomers due to
20 restricted rotation about the amide bond in Formula 1. This invention comprises mixtures of
   conformational isomers. In addition, this invention includes compounds that are enriched in
   one conformer relative to others.
          Compounds of this invention may exist as one or more crystalline polymorphs. This
   invention comprises both individual polymorphs and mixtures of polymorphs, including
25 mixtures enriched in one polymorph relative to others.

20 iodides or triflates of Formula 2 wherein X is Br, I or OS(O)2CF 3 , with appropriately
   substituted amino compounds of Formula 3 as shown in Scheme 1.

          This reaction is typically carried out with an aryl bromide of Formula 2 wherein X is Br
   in the presence of a palladium catalyst under a CO atmosphere. The palladium catalysts used
   for the present method typically comprises palladium in a formal oxidation state of either 0
   (i.e. Pd(0)) or 2 (i.e. Pd(II)). A wide variety of such palladium-containing compounds and
30 complexes are useful as catalysts for the present method. Examples of palladium-containing

                                                     22
   compounds and complexes useful as catalysts in the method of Scheme 1 include
   PdCl2(PPh 3 ) 2        (bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II)            dichloride),          Pd(PPh 3 ) 4
   (tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)),       Pd(C 5 H7 02)2 (palladium(II) acetylacetonate),
   Pd2(dba) 3 (tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)),            and PdCl 2 (dppf) [1,1'-bis(diphenyl
 5 phosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II).        The method of Scheme 1 is generally conducted
   in a liquid phase, and therefore to be most effective the palladium catalyst preferably has
   good solubility in the liquid phase. Useful solvents include, for example, ethers such as 1,2
   dimethoxyethane, amides such as N,N-dimethylacetamide, and non-halogenated aromatic
   hydrocarbons such as toluene.
10        The method of Scheme 1 can be conducted over a wide range of temperatures, ranging
   from about 25 to about 150 'C.         Of note are temperatures from about 60 to about 110 'C,
   which typically provide fast reaction rates and high product yields. The general methods and
   procedures for aminocarbonylation with an aryl bromide and an amine are well known in the
   literature; see, for example, H. Horino et al., Synthesis 1989, 715; and J. J. Li, G. W. Gribble,
15 editors, Palladiumin Heterocyclic Chemistry: A Guidefor the Synthetic Chemist, 2000.
          Compounds of Formula 1 can also be prepared by coupling carboxylic acids of
   Formula 4 with appropriately substituted amino compounds of Formula 3 as shown in
   Scheme 2.

   stepwise manner by the following method. Coupling of the compounds of Formula 2 or the
   carboxylic acids of Formula 4 with amino esters by the general methods described for
   Schemes 1 and 2 yields ester intermediates. These ester intermediates are hydrolyzed to the
   corresponding carboxylic acids, which are then coupled with the appropriate amines to form
 5 the abovementioned compounds of Formula 1. For example, see Synthesis Example 4 (Steps
   C, D and E), Synthesis Example 5 (Steps B, C and D) and Synthesis Example 6.

         In the method of Scheme 3, the ester of Formula 5 is converted to the corresponding
   carboxylic acid of Formula 4 by general procedures well known in the art. For example,
15 treatment of a methyl or ethyl ester of Formula 5 with aqueous lithium hydroxide in
   tetrahydrofuran, followed by acidification yields the corresponding carboxylic acid of
   Formula 4.
         Esters of Formula 5 can be prepared from compounds of Formula 2 by a method
   analogous to the method of Scheme I wherein an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol is

          The method of Scheme 4 typically involves the chlorination of oximes of Formula 6 to
   form the hydroximoyl chlorides of Formula 6a.            The intermediates of Formula 6a are
 5 dehydrochlorinated under basic conditions to form nitrile oxides, which then undergo 1,3
   dipolar cycloaddition with styrenes of Formula 7 to afford compounds of Formula 5.        In a
   typical procedure, a chlorinating reagent such as sodium hypochlorite, N-chlorosuccinimide,
   or chloramine-T is combined with the oxime in the presence of the styrene. Depending on
   the reaction conditions, amine bases such as pyridine or triethylamine may be necessary to
10 facilitate the dehydrochlorination reaction.      The reaction can be run in a wide variety of
   solvents including tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, methylene chloride, dioxane, and toluene
   with temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent.
   General procedures for cycloaddition of nitrile oxides with olefins are well documented in
   the chemical literature; for example, see Lee, Synthesis, 1982, 6, 508-509; Kanemasa et al.,
15 Tetrahedron, 2000, 56, 1057-1064; EP 1,538,138-Al, as well as references cited within.
          Compounds of Formula 2 can be prepared by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of styrenes
   of Formula 7 with nitrile oxides derived from oximes of Formula 8 as shown in Scheme 5.

          It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for
   preparing compounds of Formula 1 may not be compatible with certain functionalities
   present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection
   sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the
10 desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled
   in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in
   Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize
   that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual
   scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in

                                                    37
   detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula 1. One skilled in the art will also
   recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the
   above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to
   prepare the compounds of Formula 1.
 5        One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of Formula 1 and the
   intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical,
   organometallic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to add substituents or modify existing
   substituents.
          Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art using the preceding
10 description can utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.      The following Synthesis
   Examples are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limiting of the
   disclosure in any way whatsoever. Steps in the following Synthesis Examples illustrate a
   procedure for each step in an overall synthetic transformation, and the starting material for
   each step may not have necessarily been prepared by a particular preparative run whose
15 procedure is described in other Examples or Steps. Percentages are by weight except for
   chromatographic solvent mixtures or where otherwise indicated. Parts and percentages for
   chromatographic solvent mixtures are by volume unless otherwise indicated.                IH NMR
   spectra are reported in ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane; "s" means singlet, "d" means
   doublet, "t" means triplet, "q" means quartet, "n" means multiplet, "dd" means doublet of
20 doublets, "dt" means doublet of triplets, "br s" means broad singlet, and "br t" means broad
   triplet.

   Step A:         Preparation of methyl 4-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]-1-naphthalenecarboxylate
          A solution of hydroxylamine (1.33 mL, 50% in water) was added to a stirred solution
   of methyl 4-formyl-1-naphthalenecarboxylate (2.2 g, prepared as described in Journal of

   added. After stirring at room temperature for an additional 1 h, the reaction mixture was
30 concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography
   on silica gel eluted with ethyl acetate/hexanes to provide the title compound (235 mg), a
   compound of this invention, as a white solid.        1H NMR (CD 3 C(O)CD 3 ): 6 8.92 (d, IH), 8.49

       A compound of this invention will generally be used as an invertebrate pest control
active ingredient in a composition, i.e. formulation, with at least one additional component
selected from the group consisting of surfactants, solid diluents and liquid diluents, which

                                                  95
   serves as a carrier. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent
   with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental
   factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature.
          Useful formulations include both liquid and solid compositions. Liquid compositions
 5 include solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including
   microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like, which optionally can be thickened into
   gels. The general types of aqueous liquid compositions are soluble concentrate, suspension
   concentrate, capsule suspension, concentrated emulsion, microemulsion and suspoemulsion.
   The general types of nonaqueous liquid compositions are emulsifiable concentrate,
10 microemulsifiable concentrate, dispersible concentrate and oil dispersion.
          The general types of solid compositions are dusts, powders, granules, pellets, prills,
   pastilles, tablets, filled films (including seed coatings) and the like, which can be
   water-dispersible ("wettable") or water-soluble. Films and coatings formed from film
   forming solutions or flowable suspensions are particularly useful for seed treatment. Active
15 ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid
   formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or
   "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. An
   emulsifiable granule combines the advantages of both an emulsifiable concentrate
   formulation and a dry granular formulation. High-strength compositions are primarily used as
20 intermediates for further formulation.
          Sprayable formulations are typically extended in a suitable medium before spraying.
   Such liquid and solid formulations are formulated to be readily diluted in the spray medium,
   usually water. Spray volumes can range from about one to several thousand liters per
   hectare, but more typically are in the range from about ten to several hundred liters per
25 hectare. Sprayable formulations can be tank mixed with water or another suitable medium
   for foliar treatment by aerial or ground application, or for application to the growing medium
   of the plant. Liquid and dry formulations can be metered directly into drip irrigation systems
   or metered into the furrow during planting. Liquid and solid formulations can be applied
   onto seeds of crops and other desirable vegetation as seed treatments before planting to
30 protect developing roots and other subterranean plant parts and/or foliage through systemic
   uptake.
          The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent
   and surfactant within the following approximate ranges which add up to 100 percent by
   weight.

          Solid diluents include, for example, clays such as bentonite, montmorillonite,
   attapulgite and kaolin, gypsum, cellulose, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, starch, dextrin, sugars
   (e.g., lactose, sucrose), silica, talc, mica, diatomaceous earth, urea, calcium carbonate,
   sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, and sodium sulfate. Typical solid diluents are described in
 5 Watkins et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers,2nd Ed., Dorland Books,
   Caldwell, New Jersey.
          Liquid diluents include, for example, water, NN-dimethylalkanamides (e.g.,
   N,N-dimethylformamide), limonene, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-alkylpyrrolidones (e.g.,
   N-methylpyrrolidinone), ethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene
10 glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, paraffins (e.g., white
   mineral oils, normal paraffins, isoparaffins), alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, glycerine,
   glycerol triacetate, sorbitol, triacetin, aromatic hydrocarbons, dearomatized aliphatics,
   alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, ketones such as cyclohexanone, 2-heptanone, isophorone
   and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, acetates such as isoamyl acetate, hexyl acetate, heptyl
15 acetate, octyl acetate, nonyl acetate, tridecyl acetate and isobornyl acetate, other esters such
   as alkylated lactate esters, dibasic esters and y-butyrolactone, and alcohols, which can be
   linear, branched, saturated or unsaturated, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropyl
   alcohol, n-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, n-hexanol, 2-ethylhexanol, n-octanol, decanol, isodecyl
   alcohol, isooctadecanol, cetyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, tridecyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol,
20 cyclohexanol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, diacetone alcohol and benzyl alcohol. Liquid
   diluents also include glycerol esters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (typically
   C6 -C22 ), such as plant seed and fruit oils (e.g, oils of olive, castor, linseed, sesame, corn
   (maize), peanut, sunflower, grapeseed, safflower, cottonseed, soybean, rapeseed, coconut and
   palm kernel), animal-sourced fats (e.g., beef tallow, pork tallow, lard, cod liver oil, fish oil),

                                                  97
   and mixtures thereof. Liquid diluents also include alkylated fatty acids (e.g., methylated,
   ethylated, butylated) wherein the fatty acids may be obtained by hydrolysis of glycerol esters
   from plant and animal sources, and can be purified by distillation. Typical liquid diluents are
   described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950.
 5        The solid and liquid compositions of the present invention often include one or more
   surfactants.   When added to a liquid, surfactants (also known as "surface-active agents")
   generally modify, most often reduce, the surface tension of the liquid.       Depending on the
   nature of the hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in a surfactant molecule, surfactants can be
   useful as wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers or defoaming agents.
10        Surfactants can be classified as nonionic, anionic or cationic.      Nonionic surfactants
   useful for the present compositions include, but are not limited to: alcohol alkoxylates such
   as alcohol alkoxylates based on natural and synthetic alcohols (which may be branched or
   linear) and prepared from the alcohols and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide
   or mixtures thereof; amine ethoxylates, alkanolamides and ethoxylated alkanolamides;

   oxide or propylene oxide and reverse block polymers where the terminal blocks are prepared
20 from propylene oxide; ethoxylated fatty acids; ethoxylated fatty esters and oils; ethoxylated

   polymers and star polymers; polyethylene glycols (pegs); polyethylene glycol fatty acid
   esters; silicone-based surfactants; and sugar-derivatives such as sucrose esters,          alkyl
   polyglycosides and alkyl polysaccharides.
30        Useful anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to: alkylaryl sulfonic acids and
   their salts; carboxylated alcohol or alkylphenol ethoxylates; diphenyl sulfonate derivatives;

   anhydrides; olefin sulfonates;     phosphate esters such as phosphate esters of alcohol
   alkoxylates, phosphate esters of alkylphenol alkoxylates and phosphate esters of styryl
35 phenol ethoxylates; protein-based surfactants; sarcosine derivatives; styryl phenol ether
   sulfate; sulfates and sulfonates of oils and fatty acids; sulfates and sulfonates of ethoxylated
   alkylphenols; sulfates of alcohols; sulfates of ethoxylated alcohols; sulfonates of amines and

                                                  98
   amides such as NN-alkyltaurates; sulfonates of benzene, cumene, toluene, xylene, and
   dodecyl and tridecylbenzenes; sulfonates of condensed naphthalenes; sulfonates of
   naphthalene and alkyl naphthalene; sulfonates of fractionated petroleum; sulfosuccinamates;
   and sulfosuccinates and their derivatives such as dialkyl sulfosuccinate salts.
 5        Useful cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to: amides and ethoxylated
   amides; amines such as N-alkyl propanediamines, tripropylenetriamines                      and
   dipropylenetetramines, and ethoxylated amines, ethoxylated diamines and propoxylated
   amines (prepared from the amines and ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or
   mixtures thereof); amine salts such as amine acetates and diamine salts; quaternary
10 ammonium salts such as quaternary salts, ethoxylated quaternary salts and diquaternary salts;
   and amine oxides such as alkyldimethylamine oxides and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-alkylamine
   oxides.
          Also useful for the present compositions are mixtures of nonionic and anionic
   surfactants or mixtures of nonionic and cationic surfactants. Nonionic, anionic and cationic
15 surfactants and their recommended uses are disclosed in a variety of published references
   including McCutcheon's Em ulsifiers and Detergents, annual American and International
   Editions published by McCutcheon's Division, The Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing
   Co.; Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surftce Active Agents, Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New
   York, 1964; and A. S. Davidson and B. Milwidsky, Synthetic Detergents, Seventh Edition,
20 John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1987.
          Compositions of this invention may also contain formulation auxiliaries and additives,
   known to those skilled in the art as formulation aids (some of which may be considered to
   also function as solid diluents, liquid diluents or surfactants). Such formulation auxiliaries
   and additives may control: pH (buffers), foaming during processing (antifoams such
25 polyorganosiloxanes), sedimentation of active ingredients (suspending agents), viscosity
   (thixotropic thickeners), in-container microbial growth (antimicrobials), product freezing
   (antifreezes), color (dyes/pigment dispersions), wash-off (film formers or stickers),
   evaporation (evaporation retardants), and other formulation attributes. Film formers include,
   for example, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl
30 acetate copolymer, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and waxes. Examples
   of formulation auxiliaries and additives include those listed in McCutcheon's Volume 2:
   Functional Materials, annual International and North American editions published by
   McCutcheon's Division, The Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Co.; and PCT
   Publication WO 03/024222.
35        The compound of Formula 1 and any other active ingredients are typically incorporated
   into the present compositions by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent or by grinding
   in a liquid or dry diluent. Solutions, including emulsifiable concentrates, can be prepared by

                                                  99
   simply mixing the ingredients. If the solvent of a liquid composition intended for use as an
   emulsifiable concentrate is water-immiscible, an emulsifier is typically added to emulsify the
   active-containing solvent upon dilution with water. Active ingredient slurries, with particle
   diameters of up to 2,000 pm can be wet milled using media mills to obtain particles with
 5 average diameters below 3 pm.        Aqueous slurries can be made into finished suspension
   concentrates (see, for example, U.S. 3,060,084) or further processed by spray drying to form
   water-dispersible granules.    Dry formulations usually require dry milling processes, which
   produce average particle diameters in the 2 to 10 pm range. Dusts and powders can be
   prepared by blending and usually grinding (such as with a hammer mill or fluid-energy mill).
10 Granules and pellets can be prepared by spraying the active material upon preformed
   granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques.             See Browning, "Agglomeration",
   Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, pp 147-48, Perry's Chemical Engineer's
   Handbook, 4th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1963., pages 8-57 and following, and WO
   91/13546.    Pellets can be prepared as described in U.S. 4,172,714.       Water-dispersible and
15 water-soluble granules can be prepared as taught in U.S. 4,144,050, U.S. 3,920,442 and
   DE 3,246,493. Tablets can be prepared as taught in U.S. 5,180,587, U.S. 5,232,701 and U.S.
   5,208,030. Films can be prepared as taught in GB 2,095,558 and U.S. 3,299,566.

          Compounds of this invention exhibit activity against a wide spectrum of invertebrate
   pests.   These pests include invertebrates inhabiting a variety of environments such as, for
 5 example, plant foliage, roots, soil, harvested crops or other foodstuffs, building structures or
   animal integuments.      These pests include, for example, invertebrates feeding on foliage
   (including leaves, stems, flowers and fruits), seeds, wood, textile fibers or animal blood or
   tissues, and thereby causing injury or damage to, for example, growing or stored agronomic
   crops, forests, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery crops, stored foodstuffs or fiber
10 products, or houses or other structures or their contents, or being harmful to animal health or
   public health.     Those skilled in the art will appreciate that not all compounds are equally
   effective against all growth stages of all pests.
          These present compounds and compositions are thus useful agronomically for
   protecting field crops from phytophagous invertebrate pests, and also nonagronomically for
15 protecting other horticultural crops and plants from phytophagous invertebrate pests. This
   utility includes protecting crops and other plants (i.e. both agronomic and nonagronomic) that
   contain genetic material introduced by genetic engineering (i.e. transgenic) or modified by
   mutagenesis to provide advantageous traits.        Examples of such traits include tolerance to
   herbicides, resistance to phytophagous pests (e.g., insects, mites, aphids, spiders, nematodes,
20 snails, plant-pathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses), improved plant growth, increased
   tolerance of adverse growing conditions such as high or low temperatures, low or high soil
   moisture, and high salinity, increased flowering or fruiting, greater harvest yields, more rapid
   maturation, higher quality and/or nutritional value of the harvested product, or improved
   storage or process properties of the harvested products. Transgenic plants can be modified to
25 express multiple traits. Examples of plants containing traits provided by genetic engineering
   or mutagenesis include varieties of corn, cotton, soybean and potato expressing an
   insecticidal    Bacillus thuringiensis toxin      such  as  YIELD GARD, KNOCKOUT",

                                                 104
   STARLINK", BOLLGARD@, NuCOTN" and NEWLEAF", and herbicide-tolerant varieties
   of corn, cotton, soybean and rapeseed such as ROUNDUP READY", LIBERTY LINK
   IMI, STSO"and CLEARFIELD", as well as crops expressing N-acetyltransferase (GAT) to
   provide resistance to glyphosate herbicide, or crops containing the HRA gene providing
 5 resistance to herbicides inhibiting acetolactate synthase (ALS). The present compounds and
   compositions may interact synergistically with traits introduced by genetic engineering or
   modified by mutagenesis, thus enhancing phenotypic expression or effectiveness of the traits
   or increasing the invertebrate pest control effectiveness of the present compounds and
   compositions.      In particular, the present compounds and compositions may interact
10 synergistically with the phenotypic expression of proteins or other natural products toxic to
   invertebrate pests to provide greater-than-additive control of these pests.
          Compositions of this invention can also optionally comprise plant nutrients, e.g., a
   fertilizer composition comprising at least one plant nutrient selected from nitrogen,
   phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, calcium, magnesium, iron, copper., boron, manganese, zinc,
15 and molybdenum. Of note are compositions comprising at least one fertilizer composition
   comprising at least one plant nutrient selected from nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur,
   calcium and magnesium. Compositions of the present invention which further comprise at
   least one plant nutrient can be in the form of liquids or solids. Of note are solid formulations
   in the form of granules, small sticks or tablets. Solid formulations comprising a fertilizer
20 composition can be prepared by mixing the compound or composition of the present
   invention with the fertilizer composition together with formulating ingredients and then
   preparing the formulation by methods such as granulation or extrusion. Alternatively solid
   formulations can be prepared by spraying a solution or suspension of a compound or
   composition of the present invention in a volatile solvent onto a previous prepared fertilizer
25 composition in the form of dimensionally stable mixtures, e.g., granules, small sticks or
   tablets, and then evaporating the solvent.

         In certain instances, combinations of a compound of this invention with other
   biologically active (particularly invertebrate pest control) compounds or agents (i.e. active
15 ingredients) can result in a greater-than-additive (i.e. synergistic) effect.         Reducing the
   quantity of active ingredients released in the environment while ensuring effective pest
   control is always desirable. When synergism of invertebrate pest control active ingredients
   occurs at application rates giving agronomically satisfactory levels of invertebrate pest
   control, such combinations can be advantageous for reducing crop production cost and
20 decreasing environmental load.
         Compounds of this invention and compositions thereof can be applied to plants
   genetically transformed to express proteins toxic to invertebrate pests (such as Bacillus
   thuringiensis delta-endotoxins).     Such an application may provide a broader spectrum of
   plant protection and be advantageous for resistance management.                  The effect of the
25 exogenously applied invertebrate pest control compounds of this invention may be
   synergistic with the expressed toxin proteins.

   typically between about 1:3000 and about 3000:1. Of note are weight ratios between about
35 1:300 and about 300:1 (for example ratios between about 1:30 and about 30:1). One skilled
   in the art can easily determine through simple experimentation the biologically effective
   amounts of active ingredients necessary for the desired spectrum of biological activity. It

                                                  115
   will be evident that including these additional components can expand the spectrum of
   invertebrate pests controlled beyond the spectrum controlled by the compound of Formula 1
   alone.
          Table A lists specific combinations of a compound of Formula 1 with other invertebrate
 5 pest control agents illustrative of the mixtures, compositions and methods of the present
   invention. The first column of Table A lists the specific invertebrate pest control agents (e.g.,
   "Abamectin" in the first line). The second column of Table A lists the mode of action (if
   known) or chemical class of the invertebrate pest control agents. The third column of Table
   A lists embodiment(s) of ranges of weight ratios for rates at which the invertebrate pest
10 control agent can be applied relative to a compound of Formula 1 (e.g., "50:1 to 1:50" of
   abamectin relative to a compound of Formula 1 by weight). Thus, for example, the first line
   of Table A specifically discloses the combination of a compound of Formula 1 with
   abamectin can be applied in a weight ratio between 50:1 to 1:50. The remaining lines of
   Table A are to be construed similarly. Of further note Table A lists specific combinations of
15 a compound of Formula 1 with other invertebrate pest control agents illustrative of the
   mixtures, compositions and methods of the present invention and includes additional
   embodiments of weight ratio ranges for application rates.

         Invertebrate pests are controlled in agronomic and nonagronomic applications by
   applying one or more compounds of this invention, typically in the form of a composition, in
   a biologically effective amount, to the environment of the pests, including the agronomic
   and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests
 5 to be controlled.
         Thus the present invention comprises a method for controlling an invertebrate pest in
   agronomic and/or nonagronomic applications, comprising contacting the invertebrate pest or
   its environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the
   invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound or a composition
10 comprising at least one such compound and a biologically effective amount of at least one
   additional biologically active compound or agent.          Examples of suitable compositions
   comprising a compound of the invention and at least one additional biologically active
   compound or agent include granular compositions wherein the additional active compound is
   present on the same granule as the compound of the invention or on granules separate from
15 those of the compound of the invention.
         To achieve contact with a compound or composition of the invention to protect a field
   crop from invertebrate pests, the compound or composition is typically applied to the seed of
   the crop before planting, to the foliage (e.g., leaves, stems, flowers, fruits) of crop plants, or
   to the soil or other growth medium before or after the crop is planted.
20       One embodiment of a method of contact is by spraying.            Alternatively, a granular
   composition comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or
   the soil. Compounds of this invention can also be effectively delivered through plant uptake
   by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied
   as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the soil, a nursery box
25 treatment or a dip of transplants.   Of note is a composition of the present invention in the
   form of a soil drench liquid formulation.        Also of note is a method for controlling an
   invertebrate pest comprising contacting the invertebrate pest or its environment with a
   biologically effective amount of a compound of the present invention or with a composition
   comprising a biologically effective amount of a compound of the present invention.             Of
30 further note is this method wherein the environment is soil and the composition is applied to
   the soil as a soil drench formulation. Of further note is that compounds of this invention are
   also effective by localized application to the locus of infestation. Other methods of contact
   include application of a compound or a composition of the invention by direct and residual
   sprays, aerial sprays, gels, seed coatings, microencapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, ear
35 tags, boluses, foggers, fumigants, aerosols, dusts and many others.       One embodiment of a
   method of contact is a dimensionally stable fertilizer granule, stick or tablet comprising a

                                                 127
   compound or composition of the invention. The compounds of this invention can also be
   impregnated into materials for fabricating invertebrate control devices (e.g., insect netting).
          Compounds of this invention are also useful in seed treatments for protecting seeds
   from invertebrate pests. In the context of the present disclosure and claims, treating a seed
 5 means contacting the seed with a biologically effective amount of a compound of this
   invention, which is typically formulated as a composition of the invention.            This seed
   treatment protects the seed from invertebrate soil pests and generally can also protect roots
   and other plant parts in contact with the soil of the seedling developing from the germinating
   seed.   The seed treatment may also provide protection of foliage by translocation of the
10 compound of this invention or a second active ingredient within the developing plant. Seed
   treatments can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically
   transformed to express specialized traits will germinate.     Representative examples include
   those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis toxin or
   those expressing herbicide resistance such as glyphosate acetyltransferase, which provides
15 resistance to glyphosate.
          One method of seed treatment is by spraying or dusting the seed with a compound of
   the invention (i.e. as a formulated composition) before sowing the seeds.          Compositions
   formulated for seed treatment generally comprise a film former or adhesive agent. Therefore
   typically a seed coating composition of the present invention comprises a compound of
20 Formula 1, and a film former or adhesive agent. Seed can be coated by spraying a flowable
   suspension concentrate directly into a tumbling bed of seeds and then drying the seeds.
   Alternatively, other formulation types such as wetted powders, solutions, suspoemulsions,
   emulsifiable concentrates and emulsions in water can be sprayed on the seed.        This process
   is particularly useful for applying film coatings on seeds.      Various coating machines and
25 processes are available to one skilled in the art. Suitable processes include those listed in P.
   Kosters et al., Seed Treatment: Progress and Prospects, 1994 BCPC Mongraph No. 57, and
   references listed therein.
          The treated seed typically comprises a compound of the present invention in an amount
   from about 0.1 g to 1 kg per 100 kg of seed (i.e. from about 0.0001 to 1% by weight of the
30 seed before treatment).     A flowable suspension formulated for seed treatment typically
   comprises from about 0.5 to about 70% of the active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30%
   of a film-forming adhesive, from about 0.5 to about 20% of a dispersing agent, from 0 to
   about 5% of a thickener, from 0 to about 5% of a pigment and/or dye, from 0 to about 2% of
   an antifoaming agent, from 0 to about 1% of a preservative, and from 0 to about 75% of a
35 volatile liquid diluent.
          The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into a bait composition that is
   consumed by an invertebrate pest or used within a device such as a trap, bait station, and the

                                                  128
   like.   Such a bait composition can be in the forn of granules which comprise (a) active
   ingredients, namely a compound of Formula 1; (b) one or more food materials; optionally (c)
   an attractant, and optionally (d) one or more humectants.         Of note are granules or bait
   compositions which comprise between about 0.001-5% active ingredients, about 40-99%
 5 food material and/or attractant; and optionally about 0.05-10% humectants, which are
   effective in controlling soil invertebrate pests at very low application rates, particularly at
   doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct contact.    Some
   food materials can function both as a food source and an attractant. Food materials include
   carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Examples of food materials are vegetable flour, sugar,
10 starches, animal fat, vegetable oil, yeast extracts and milk solids. Examples of attractants are
   odorants and flavorants, such as fruit or plant extracts, perfume, or other animal or plant
   component, pheromones or other agents known to attract a target invertebrate pest.
   Examples of humectants, i.e. moisture retaining agents, are glycols and other polyols,
   glycerine and sorbitol. Of note is a bait composition (and a method utilizing such a bait
15 composition) used to control at least one invertebrate pest selected from the group consisting
   of ants, termites and cockroaches. A device for controlling an invertebrate pest can comprise
   the present bait composition and a housing adapted to receive the bait composition, wherein
   the housing has at least one opening sized to permit the invertebrate pest to pass through the
   opening so the invertebrate pest can gain access to the bait composition from a location
20 outside the housing, and wherein the housing is further adapted to be placed in or near a locus
   of potential or known activity for the invertebrate pest.
          The compounds of this invention can be applied without other adjuvants, but most
   often application will be of a formulation comprising one or more active ingredients with
   suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending
25 on the contemplated end use.          One method of application involves spraying a water
   dispersion or refined oil solution of a compound of the present invention. Combinations with
   spray oils, spray oil concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and
   synergists such as piperonyl butoxide often enhance compound efficacy. For nonagronomic
   uses such sprays can be applied from spray containers such as a can, a bottle or other
30 container, either by means of a pump or by releasing it from a pressurized container, e.g., a
   pressurized aerosol spray can. Such spray compositions can take various forms, for example,
   sprays, mists, foams, fumes or fog.       Such spray compositions thus can further comprise
   propellants, foaming agents, etc. as the case may be.          Of note is a spray composition
   comprising a compound or a composition of the present invention and a carrier.              One
35 embodiment of such a spray composition comprises a compound or a composition of the
   present invention and a propellant. Representative propellants include, but are not limited to,
   methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, butene, pentane, isopentane, neopentane,

                                                   129
   pentene, hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, dimethyl ether, and mixtures of the
   foregoing. Of note is a spray composition (and a method utilizing such a spray composition
   dispensed from a spray container) used to control at least one invertebrate pest selected from
   the group consisting of mosquitoes, black flies, stable flies, deer flies, horse flies, wasps,
 5 yellow jackets, hornets, ticks, spiders, ants, gnats, and the like, including individually or in
   combinations.
          Nonagronomic uses refer to invertebrate pest control in the areas other than fields of
   crop plants. Nonagronomic uses of the present compounds and compositions include control
   of invertebrate pests in stored grains, beans and other foodstuffs, and in textiles such as
10 clothing and carpets. Nonagronomic uses of the present compounds and compositions also
   include invertebrate pest control in ornamental plants, forests, in yards, along roadsides and
   railroad rights of way, and on turf such as lawns, golf courses and pastures. Nonagronomic
   uses of the present compounds and compositions also include invertebrate pest control in
   houses and other buildings which may be occupied by humans and/or companion, farm,
15 ranch, zoo or other animals. Nonagronomic uses of the present compounds and compositions
   also include the control of pests such as termites that can damage wood or other structural
   materials used in buildings.
          Nonagronomic uses of the present compounds and compositions also include protecting
   human and animal health by controlling invertebrate pests that are parasitic or transmit
20 infectious diseases.      The controlling of animal parasites includes controlling external
   parasites that are parasitic to the surface of the body of the host animal (e.g., shoulders,
   armpits, abdomen, inner part of the thighs) and internal parasites that are parasitic to the
   inside of the body of the host animal (e.g., stomach, intestine, lung, veins, under the skin,
   lymphatic tissue).     External parasitic or disease-transmitting pests include, for example,
25 chiggers, ticks, lice, mosquitoes, flies, mites and fleas. Internal parasites include heartworms,
   hookworms and helminths.          Compounds and compositions of the present invention are
   particularly   suitable   for combating     external parasitic   or disease-transmitting    pests.
   Compounds and compositions of the present invention are suitable for systemic and/or non
   systemic control of infestation or infection by parasites on animals.
30        Compounds and compositions of the present invention are suitable for combating
   parasites that infest animal subjects including those in the wild, livestock and agricultural
   working animals.        Livestock is the term used to refer (singularly or plurally) to a
   domesticated animal intentionally reared in an agricultural setting to make produce such as
   food or fiber, or for its labor; examples of livestock include cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs,
35 donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, hens, turkeys, ducks and geese (e.g., raised for meat, milk,
   butter, eggs, fur, leather, feathers and/or wool).       By combating parasites, fatalities and
   performance reduction (in terms of meat, milk, wool, skins, eggs, etc.) are reduced, so that

                                                  130
   applying a composition comprising a compound of the present invention allows more
   economic and simple husbandry of animals.
          Compounds and compositions of the present invention are especially suitable for
   combating parasites that infest companion animals and pets (e.g., dogs, cats, pet birds and
 5 aquarium fish), research and experimental animals (e.g., hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and
   mice), as well as animals raised for/in zoos, wild habitats and/or circuses.
          In an embodiment of this invention, the animal is preferably a vertebrate, and more
   preferably a mammal, avian or fish. In a particular embodiment, the animal subject is a
   mammal (including great apes, such as humans).              Other mammalian subjects include
10 primates (e.g., monkeys), bovine (e.g., cattle or dairy cows), porcine (e.g., hogs or pigs),
   ovine (e.g., goats or sheep), equine (e.g., horses), canine (e.g., dogs), feline (e.g., house cats),
   camels, deer, donkeys, buffalos, antelopes, rabbits, and rodents (e.g., guinea pigs, squirrels,
   rats, mice, gerbils, and hamsters).       Avians include Anatidae (swans, ducks and geese),
   Columbidae (e.g., doves and pigeons), Phasianidae (e.g., partridges, grouse and turkeys),
15 Thesienidae (e.g., domestic chickens), Psittacines (e.g., parakeets, macaws, and parrots),
   game birds, and ratites (e.g., ostriches).
          Of particular note is the embodiment wherein the animals to be protected are
   domesticated dogs (i.e. Canis lupusfamiliaris)and domestic house cats (i.e. Felis catss.
          Birds treated or protected by the inventive compounds can be associated with either
20 commercial or noncommercial aviculture. These include Anatidae, such as swans, geese, and
   ducks, Columbidae, such as doves and domestic pigeons, Phasianidae, such as partridge,
   grouse and turkeys, Thesienidae, such as domestic chickens, and Psittacines, such as
   parakeets, macaws, and parrots raised for the pet or collector market, among others.
          For purposes of the present invention, the term "fish" shall be understood to include
25 without limitation, the Teleosti grouping of fish, i.e., teleosts. Both the Salmoniformes order
   (which includes the Salmonidae family) and the Perciformes order (which includes the
   Centrarchidae family) are contained within the Teleosti grouping. Examples of potential fish
   recipients include the Salmonidae, Serranidae, Sparidae, Cichlidae, and Centrarchidae,
   among others.
30        Other animals are also contemplated to benefit from the inventive methods, including
   marsupials (such as kangaroos), reptiles (such as farmed turtles), and other economically
   important domestic animals for which the inventive methods are safe and effective in treating
   or preventing parasite infection or infestation.
          Examples of invertebrate parasitic pests controlled by administering a parasiticidally
35 effective amount of a compound of this invention to an animal to be protected include
   ectoparasites (arthropods, acarines, etc) and endoparasites (helminths, e.g., nematodes,
   trematodes, cestodes, acanthocephalans, etc.).

                                                  131
         The disease or group of diseases described generally as helminthiasis is due to infection
   of an animal host with parasitic worms known as helminths. The term 'helminths' is meant
   to include nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans.          Helminthiasis is a
   prevalent and serious economic problem with domesticated animals such as swine, sheep,
 5 horses, cattle, goats, dogs, cats and poultry.
         Among the helminths, the group of worms described as nematodes causes widespread
   and at times serious infection in various species of animals.           Nematodes that are
   contemplated to be treated by the compounds of this invention and by the inventive methods
   include, without limitation, the following genera: Acanthocheilonema, Aelurostrongylus,
10 Ancylostoma, Angiostrongylus, Ascaridia, Ascaris, Brugia, Bunostomun, Capillaria,
   Chabertia,      Cooperia,     Crenosoma,       Dictyocaulus,  Dioctophyme,      Dipetalonema,

   Heterakis, Lagochilascaris, Loa,          Mansonella, Muellerius, Necator, Nematodirus,
   Oesophagostoium,         Ostertagia,    Oxyuris,    Parafilaria, Parascaris, Physaloptera,
15 Protostrongylus, Setaria, Spirocerca, Stephanofilaria, Strongyloides, Strongylus, Thelazia,
   Toxascaris, Toxocara, Trichinella, Trichonena, Trichostrongylus, Trichuris, Uncinaria and
   Wiuchereria.
         Of the above, the most common genera of nematodes infecting the animals referred to
   above are Haenonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Nenatodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris,
20 Bunostomum,       Oesophagostomum,         Chabertia,  Trichuris,  Strongylus,    Trichonena,
   Dictyocaulus, Capillaria,Heterakis, Toxocara, Ascaridia, Oxyuris, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria,
   Toxascaris and Parascaris.          Certain of these, such as Nematodirus, Cooperia and
   Oesophagostonum attack primarily the intestinal tract while others, such as Haemonchus and
   Ostertagia,are more prevalent in the stomach while others such as Dictyocaulus are found in
25 the lungs. Still other parasites may be located in other tissues such as the heart and blood
   vessels, subcutaneous and lymphatic tissue and the like.
         Trematodes that are contemplated to be treated by the compounds of this invention and
   by the inventive methods include, without limitation, the following genera: Alaria, Fasciola,
   Nanophyetus, Opisthorchis,Paragonimusand Schistosoma.
30       Cestodes that are contemplated to be treated by the compounds of this invention and by
   the inventive methods include, without limitation, the following genera: Diphyllobothriun,
   Diplydium, Spironetraand Taenia.
         The most common genera of parasites of the gastrointestinal tract of humans are
   Ancylostoma, Necator, Ascaris, Strongyloides, Trichinella, Capillaria, Trichuris and
35 Enterobius. Other medically important genera of parasites which are found in the blood or
   other tissues and organs outside the gastrointestinal tract are the filarial worms such as

                                                   132
   Wuchereria, Brugia, Onchocerca and Loa, as well as Dracunculusand extra intestinal stages
   of the intestinal worms Strongyloides and Trichinella.
          Numerous other helminth genera and species are known to the art, and are also
   contemplated to be treated by the compounds of the invention. These are enumerated in great
 5 detail in Textbook of Veterinary Clinical Parasitology, Volume 1, Helmninths, E. J. L.
   Soulsby, F. A. Davis Co., Philadelphia, Pa.; Helininths, Arthropods and Protozoa, ( 6 "h
   Edition of Monnig's Veterinary Helminthology and Entomology), E. J. L. Soulsby, The
   Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, Md.
          The compounds of Formula 1 are effective against a number of animal ectoparasites
10 (e.g., arthropod ectoparasites of mammals and birds).
          Insect and acarine pests include, e.g., biting insects such as flies and mosquitoes, mites,

          Generally, flies, fleas, lice, mosquitoes, gnats, mites, ticks and helminths cause
   tremendous losses to the livestock and companion animal sectors. Arthropod parasites also
   are a nuisance to humans and can vector disease-causing organisms in humans and animals.
          Numerous other arthropod pests and ectoparasites are known to the art, and are also
 5 contemplated to be treated by the compounds of the invention. These are enumerated in great
   detail in Medical and Veterinary Entomology, D. S. Kettle, John Wiley & Sons, New York

   Analogues (JHAs) such as diflubenzuron, triflumuron, fluazuron, cyromazine, methoprene,
   etc., thereby providing both initial and sustained control of parasites (at all stages of insect
   development, including eggs) on the animal subject, as well as within the environment of the
   animal subject.
15        Of note are biologically active compounds or agents useful in the compositions of the
   present invention selected from the avermectin class of antiparasitic compounds. As stated
   above, the avermectin family of compounds includes very potent antiparasitic agents known
   to be useful against a broad spectrum of endoparasites and ectoparasites in mammals.
          A preferred compound for use within the scope of the present invention is ivermectin.
20 Ivermectin is a semi-synthetic derivative of avermectin and is generally produced as a
   mixture of at least 80 % 22,23-dihydroavermectin Bia and less than 20% 22,23
   dihydroavermectin Bib. Ivermectin is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,199,569.
          Abamectin is an avermectin that is disclosed as avermectin Bla/Bib in U.S. Patent No.
   4,310,519. Abamectin contains at least 80% of avermectin Bia and not more than 20% of
25 avermectin BIb
          Another preferred avermectin is doramectin, also known as 25-cyclohexyl-avermectin
   B1 . The structure and preparation of doramectin is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,089,480.
          Another preferred avermectin is moxidectin. Moxidectin, also known as LL-F28249
   alpha, is known from U.S. Patent No. 4,916,154.
30        Another preferred avermectin is selamectin. Selamectin is 25-cyclohexyl-25-de(1
   methylpropyl)-5-deoxy-22,23-dihydro-5-(hydroxyimino)-avermectin BI monosaccharide.
          Milbemycin, or B41, is a substance which is isolated from the fermentation broth of a
   milbemycin-producing strain of Streptomyces.          The microorganism, the fermentation
   conditions and the isolation procedures are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,950,360 and
35 3,984,564.
          Emamectin (4"-deoxy-4"-epi-methylaminoavermectin B1 ), which can be prepared as
   described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,288,710 and 5,399,717, is a mixture of two homologues, 4"-

                                                 136
   deoxy-4"-epi-methylaminoavermectin BIa and 4"-deoxy-4"-epi-methylaminoavermectin Blb
   Preferably, a salt of emnamectin is used. Non-limiting examples of salts of emamectin which
   may be used in the present invention include the salts described in U.S. Patent No. 5,288,710,
   e.g., salts derived from benzoic acid, substituted benzoic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, citric
 5 acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, and the like. Most preferably, the emamectin
   salt used in the present invention is emamectin benzoate.
          Eprinomectin is chemically known as 4"-epi-acetylamino-4"-deoxy-avermectin B 1.
   Eprinomectin was specifically developed to be used in all cattle classes and age groups. It
   was the first avermectin to show broad-spectrum activity against both endo- and ecto
10 parasites while also leaving minimal residues in meat and milk. It has the additional
   advantage of being highly potent when delivered topically.
          The composition of the present invention optionally comprises combinations of one or
   more of the following antiparasite compounds: imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds as
   described by U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0182059 Al; 1-(4-mono and di
15 halomethylsulphonylphenyl)-2-acylamino-3-fluoropropanol compounds, as described by U.S.

   Suitable flukicides include, for example, triclabendazole, fenbendazole, albendazole,
   clorsulon and oxibendazole. It will be appreciated that the above combinations may further
   include combinations of antibiotic, antiparasitic and anti-fluke active compounds.
          In addition to the above combinations, it is also contemplated to provide combinations
25 of the inventive methods and compounds, as described herein, with other animal health
   remedies such as trace elements, anti-inflammatories, anti-infectives, hormones,
   dermatological preparations, including antiseptics and disinfectants, and immunobiologicals
   such as vaccines and antisera for the prevention of disease.
          For example, such antinfectives include one or more antibiotics that are optionally co
30 administered during treatment using the inventive compounds or methods, e.g., in a
   combined composition and/or in separate dosage forms. Art-known antibiotics suitable for
   this purpose include, for example, those listed herein below.
          One     useful antibiotic is florfenicol,          also known as D-(threo)-1-(4
   methylsulfonylphenyl)-2-dichloroacetamido-3-fluoro-1-propanol.             Another preferred
35 antibiotic compound is D-(threo)-1-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-2-difluoroacetamido-3-fluoro

   these antibiotic compounds, and intermediates useful in such processes, are described in U.S.

                                                 137
   Patent Nos. 4,31,857; 4,582,918; 4,973,750; 4,876,352; 5,227,494; 4,743,700; 5,567,844;
   5,105,009; 5,382,673; 5,352,832; and 5,663,361.      Other florfenicol analogs and/or prodrugs
   have been disclosed and such analogs also can be used in the compositions and methods of
   the present invention (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 7,041,670 and 7,153,842).
 5       Another useful antibiotic compound is tilmicosin. Tilmicosin is a macrolide antibiotic
   that is chemically defined       as 20-dihydro-20-deoxy-20-(cis-3,5-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl)
   desmycosin and is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,820,695.
         Another useful     antibiotic for use in the       present invention is tulathromycin.
   Tulathromycin may be prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth in U.S. Patent
10 No. 6,825,327.
         Further antibiotics for use in the present invention include the cephalosporins such as,
   for example, ceftiofur, cefquinome, etc.      The concentration of the cephalosporin in the
   formulation of the present invention optionally varies between about I mg/mL to 500
   mg/mL.
15       Another useful antibiotic includes the fluoroquinolones,         such as, for example,
   enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, difloxacin, orbifloxacin and marbofloxacin.         In the case of
   enrofloxacin, it may be administered in a concentration of about 100 mg/mL. Danofloxacin
   may be present in a concentration of about 180 mg/mL.
          Other useful macrolide antibiotics include compounds from the class of ketolides, or,
20 more specifically, the azalides. Such compounds are described in, for example, U.S. Patent
   Nos.    6,514,945;   6,472,371;   6,270,768;   6,437,151;   6,271,255;   6,239,12;   5,958,888;
   6,339,063; and 6,054,434.
         Other useful antibiotics include the tetracyclines, particularly chlortetracycline and
   oxytetracycline. Other antibiotics may include B-lactams such as penicillins, e.g., penicillin,
25 ampicillin, amoxicillin, or a combination of amoxicillin with clavulanic acid or other beta
   lactamase inhibitors.
         Nonagronomic applications in the veterinary sector are by conventional means such as
   by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, drenching
   preparations, granulates, pastes, boli, feed-through procedures, or suppositories; or by
30 parenteral administration, such as by injection (including intramuscular, subcutaneous,
   intravenous, intraperitoneal) or implants; by nasal administration; by topical administration,
   for example, in the form of immersion or dipping, spraying, washing, coating with powder,
   or application to a small area of the animal, and through articles such as neck collars, ear
   tags, tail bands, limb bands or halters which comprise compounds or compositions of the
35 present invention.
         Any of the compounds of the present invention, or a suitable combination of such
   compounds, may be administered directly to the animal subject and/or indirectly by applying

                                                  138
   it to the local environment in which the animal dwells (such as bedding, enclosures, or the
   like). Direct administration includes contacting the skin, fur or feathers of a subject animal
   with the compounds, or by feeding or injecting the compounds into the animal.
          The compounds of the present invention may be administered in a controlled release
 5 form, e.g., in a subcutaneous slow release formulation, or in the form of a controlled release
   device affixed to an animal such as a flea collar. Collars for the controlled release of an
   insecticide agent for long term protection against flea infestation in a companion animal are
   art-known, and are described, for example, by U.S. Patent Nos. 3,852,416; 4,224,901;
   5,555,848; and 5,184,573.
10        Typically a parasiticidal composition according to the present invention comprises a
   mixture of a compound of Formula 1 with one or more pharmaceutically or veterinarily
   acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries selected with regard to the intended
   route of administration (e.g., oral, topical or parenteral administration such as injection) and
   in accordance with standard practice. In addition, a suitable carrier is selected on the basis of
15 compatibility with the one or more active ingredients in the composition, including such
   considerations as stability relative to pH and moisture content. Therefore of note is a
   composition for protecting an animal from an invertebrate parasitic pest comprising a
   compound of the invention (i.e. in a parasiticidally effective amount) and at least one
   veterinarily acceptable carrier.
20        For parenteral administration including intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous
   injection, a compound of the present invention can be formulated in suspension, solution or
   emulsion in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain adjuncts such as suspending,
   stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The compounds of the present invention may also be
   formulated for bolus injection or continuous infusion. Pharmaceutical compositions for
25 injection include aqueous solutions preferably in physiologically compatible buffers
   containing other excipients or auxiliaries as are known in the art of pharmaceutical
   formulation. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared in a
   lipophilic vehicle. Suitable lipophilic vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, synthetic
   fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate and triglycerides, or materials such as liposomes.
30 Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the
   suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Formulations for
   injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers.
   Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable
   vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.
35        In addition to the formulations described supra, the compounds of the present invention
   may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be
   administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by

                                                   139
   intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The compounds of the present invention may be
   formulated for this route of administration with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials
   (e.g., in an emulsion with a pharmacologically acceptable oil).
          For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention can be
 5 delivered in the form of an aerosol spray using a pressurized pack or a nebulizer and a
   suitable propellant, e.g., without limitation, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane,
   dichlorotetrafluoroethane or carbon dioxide. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage
   unit may be controlled by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and
   cartridges of, for example, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated
10 containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or
   starch.
          Compounds of the present invention have been discovered to have favorable
   pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties providing systemic availability from oral
   administration and ingestion. Therefore after ingestion by the animal to be protected,
15 parasiticidally effective concentrations of compounds of the invention in the bloodstream
   protect the treated animal from blood-sucking pests such as fleas, ticks and lice. Therefore of
   note is a composition for protecting an animal from an invertebrate parasite pest in a form for
   oral administration (i.e. comprising, in addition to a parasiticidally effective amount of a
   compound of the invention, one or more carriers selected from binders and fillers suitable for
20 oral administration and feed concentrate carriers).
          For oral administration in the form of solutions (the most readily available form for
   absorption), emulsions, suspensions, pastes, gels, capsules, tablets, boluses, powders,
   granules, rumen-retention and feed/water/lick blocks, a compound of the present invention
   can be formulated with binders/fillers known in the art to be suitable for oral administration
25 compositions, such as sugars and sugar derivatives (e.g., lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol),
   starch (e.g., maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch), cellulose and derivatives
   (e.g., methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, ethylhydroxycellulose), protein derivatives
   (e.g., zein, gelatin), and synthetic polymers (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone).
   If desired, lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate), disintegrating agents (e.g., cross-linked
30 polyvinylpyrrolidinone, agar, alginic acid) and dyes or pigments can be added. Pastes and
   gels often also contain adhesives (e.g., acacia, alginic acid, bentonite, cellulose, xanthan gum,
   colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate) to aid in keeping the composition in contact with the
   oral cavity and not being easily ejected.
          A preferred embodiment is a composition formulated into a chewable and/or edible
35 product (e.g., a chewable treat or edible tablet). Such a product would ideally have a taste,
   texture and/or aroma favored by the animal to be protected so as to facilitate oral
   administration of the compound of Formula 1.

                                                  140
          If the parasiticidal compositions are in the form of feed concentrates, the carrier is
   typically selected from high-performance feed, feed cereals or protein concentrates.         Such
   feed concentrate-containing      compositions can, in addition to the parasiticidal         active
   ingredients, comprise additives promoting animal health or growth, improving quality of
 5 meat from animals for slaughter or otherwise useful to animal husbandry. These additives
   can include, for example, vitamins, antibiotics, chemotherapeutics, bacteriostats, fungistats,
   coccidiostats and hormones.
          The compounds of Formula 1 may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as
   suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g., conventional suppository bases such as cocoa
10 butter or other glycerides.
          Formulations for topical administration are typically in the form of a powder, cream,
   suspension, spray, emulsion, foam, paste, aerosol, ointment, salve or gel. More typically a
   topical formulation is a water-soluble solution, which can be in the form of a concentrate that
   is diluted before use. Parasiticidal compositions suitable for topical administration typically
15 comprise a compound of the present invention and one or more topically suitable carriers. In
   applications of a parasiticidal composition topically to the exterior of an animal as a line or
   spot (i.e. "spot-on" treatment), the active ingredient migrates over the surface of the animal to
   cover most or all of its external surface area. As a result, the treated animal is particularly
   protected from invertebrate pests that feed off the epidermis of the animal such as ticks, fleas
20 and lice. Therefore formulations for topical localized administration often comprise at least
   one organic solvent to facilitate transport of the active ingredient over the skin and/or
   penetration into the epidermis of the animal. Carriers in such formulations include propylene
   glycol, paraffins, aromatics, esters such as isopropyl myristate, glycol ethers, alcohols such as
   ethanol,    n-propanol,   2-octyl   dodecanol    or  oleyl  alcohol;   solutions   in  esters   of
25 monocarboxylic acids, such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalic
   ester, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate,
   caproic acid esters of saturated fatty alcohols of C 12 -CIg chain length; solutions of esters of
   dicarboxylic acids, such as dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl
   ester, di-n-butyl adipate or solutions of esters of aliphatic acids, e.g., glycols. It may be
30 advantageous for a crystallization inhibitor or a dispersant known from the pharmaceutical or
   cosmetic industry also to be present.
          A pour-on formulation may also be prepared for control of parasites in an animal of
   agricultural value. The pour-on formulations of this invention can be in the form of a liquid,
   powder, emulsion, foam, paste, aerosol, ointment, salve or gel. Typically, the pour-on
35 formulation is liquid. These pour-on formulations can be effectively applied to sheep, cattle,
   goats, other ruminants, camelids, pigs and horses. The pour-on formulation is typically
   applied by pouring in one or several lines or in a spot-on the dorsal midline (back) or

                                                  141
   shoulder of an animal. More typically, the formulation is applied by pouring it along the back
   of the animal, following the spine. The formulation can also be applied to the animal by other
   conventional methods, including wiping an impregnated material over at least a small area of
   the animal, or applying it using a commercially available applicator, by means of a syringe,
 5 by spraying or by using a spray race. The pour-on formulations include a carrier and can also
   include one or more additional ingredients. Examples of suitable additional ingredients are
   stabilizers such as antioxidants, spreading agents, preservatives, adhesion promoters, active
   solubilisers such as oleic acid, viscosity modifiers, UV blockers or absorbers, and colourants.
   Surface active agents, including anionic, cationic, non-ionic and ampholytic surface active
10 agents, can also be included in these formulations.
          The formulations of this invention typically include an antioxidant, such as BHT
   (butylated hydroxytoluene). The antioxidant is generally present in amounts of at 0.1-5%
   (wt/vol). Some of the formulations require a solubilizer, such as oleic acid, to dissolve the
   active agent, particularly if spinosad is used. Common spreading agents used in these pour-on
15 formulations include isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, caprylic/capric acid esters of
   saturated C 12 -C 18 fatty alcohols, oleic acid, oleyl ester, ethyl oleate, triglycerides, silicone
   oils and dipropylene glycol methyl ether. The pour-on formulations of this invention are
   prepared according to known techniques. When the pour-on formulation is a solution, the
   parasiticide/insecticide is mixed with the carrier or vehicle, using heat and stirring if required.
20 Auxiliary or additional ingredients can be added to the mixture of active agent and carrier, or
   they can be mixed with the active agent prior to the addition of the carrier. If the pour-on
   formulation is an emulsion or suspension, the formulations can be similarly prepared using
   known techniques.
          Other delivery systems for relatively hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds can be
25 employed.     Liposomes and emulsions are well-known examples of delivery vehicles or
   carriers for hydrophobic drugs. In addition, organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide can
   be used, if needed.
          For agronomic applications, the rate of application required for effective control (i.e.
   "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to
30 be controlled, the pest's life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or
   animal, feeding behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like.
   Under normal circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredients per
   hectare are     sufficient to control pests     in agronomic      ecosystems,    but as    little as
   0.0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as 8 kg/hectare may be required.                  For
35 nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 mg/square
   meter but as little as 0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square

                                                  142
   meter may be required. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective
   amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control.
         In general for veterinary use, a compound of Formula 1 is administered in a
   parasiticidally effective amount to an animal to be protected from invertebrate parasite pests.
 5 A parasiticidally effective amount is the amount of active ingredient needed to achieve an
   observable effect diminishing the occurrence or activity of the target invertebrate parasite
   pest. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the parasitically effective dose can vary for
   the various compounds and compositions of the present invention, the desired parasitical
   effect and duration, the target invertebrate pest species, the animal to be protected, the mode
10 of application and the like, and the amount needed to achieve a particular result can be
   determined through simple experimentation.
         For oral, subcutaneous or spot-on administration to homeothermic animals, a dose of a
   compound of the present invention administered at suitable intervals typically ranges from
   about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, and preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30
15 mg/kg of animal body weight. For other topical (e.g., dermal) administration, including dips
   and sprays, a dose typically contains from about 0.01 ppm to about 150,000 ppm, more
   typically from about 0.01 ppm to about 100,000 ppm, preferably from about 0.01 ppm to
   about 5,000 ppm, and most preferably from about 0.01 ppm to about 3,000 ppm, of a
   compound of the present invention.
20       Suitable intervals for the administration of compounds of the present invention to
   homeothermic animals range from about daily to about yearly. Of note are administration
   intervals ranging from about weekly to about once every 6 months. Of particular note are
   monthly adminstration intervals (i.e. administering the compound to the animal once every
   month).
25       The following Tests demonstrate the control efficacy of compounds of this invention
   on specific pests. "Control efficacy" represents inhibition of invertebrate pest development
   (including mortality) that causes significantly reduced feeding. The pest control protection
   afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables A-D
   for compound descriptions. The following abbreviations are used in the Index Tables which
30 follow: Pr is CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 , i-Pr is CH(CH 3) 2 and i-Bu is CH 2 CH(CH 3 ) 2. (R) or (S) denotes
   the absolute chirality of the asymmetric carbon center. The abbreviation "Ex." stands for
   "Example" and is followed by a number indicating in which synthesis example the
   compound is prepared.

                                                   TEST A
          For evaluating control of diamondback moth (Plutellaxylostella) the test unit consisted
   of a small open container with a 12-14-day-old radish plant inside. This was pre-infested
 5 with about 50 neonate larvae that were dispensed into the test unit via corncob grits using a
   bazooka inoculator. The larvae moved onto the test plant after being dispensed into the test
   unit.
          Test compounds were formulated using a solution containing 10% acetone, 90% water
   and    300 ppm X-77TM         Spreader Lo-Foam Formula         non-ionic   surfactant containing
10 alkylarylpolyoxyethylene, free fatty acids, glycols and isopropanol (Loveland Industries, Inc.
   Greeley, Colorado, USA).        The formulated compounds were applied in 1 mL of liquid
   through a SUJ2 atomizer nozzle with 1/8 JJ custom body (Spraying Systems Co. Wheaton,
   Illinois, USA) positioned 1.27 cm (0.5 inches) above the top of each test unit.                All
   experimental compounds in these tests were sprayed at 50 ppm, and the test was replicated
15 three times. After spraying of the formulated test compound, each test unit was allowed to
   dry for 1 h and then a black, screened cap was placed on top. The test units were held for 6
   days in a growth chamber at 25 'C and 70% relative humidity. Plant feeding damage was
   then visually assessed based on foliage consumed, and a pest mortality rating was also
   counted and calculated for each test unit.
