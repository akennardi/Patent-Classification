   By any range disclosed herein, it is meant that all hundredth, tenth and integer unit amounts
   within the range are specifically disclosed as part of the invention. Thus, for example, 0.01
   mg to 50 mg means that 0.02, 0.03 ... 0.09; 0.1, 0.2    ... 0.9; and 1, 2 ... 49 mg unit amounts are
20  included as embodiments of this invention.
    A characteristic of a compound refers to any quality that a compound exhibits, e.g., peaks or
    retention times, as determined by 1H nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy,
    infrared, ultraviolet or fluorescence spectrophotometry, gas chromatography, thin layer
25  chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, elemental analysis, Ames test,
    dissolution, stability and any other quality that can be determined by an analytical method.
    Once the characteristics of a compound are known, the information can be used to, for
    example, screen or test for the presence of the compound in a sample.
30  As used herein, a "pharmaceutically acceptable" carrier or excipient is one that is suitable for
    use with humans and/or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity,
    irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.

                                                 -10
   As used herein, "drug substance" refers to the active ingredient in a drug product, which
   provides pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
   treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of
   man or animals.
 5
   As used herein, "drug product" refers to the finished dosage form containing the drug
   substance as well as at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
   As used herein, an "isolated" compound is a compound isolated from the crude reaction
10 mixture following an affirmative act of isolation. The act of isolation necessarily involves
   separating the compound from the other known components of the crude reaction mixture,
   with some impurities, unknown side products and residual amounts of the other known
   components of the crude reaction mixture permitted to remain. Purification is an example of
   an affirmative act of isolation.
15
   As used herein, a "composition" is distinct from a "pharmaceutical composition", and is
   substantially stable and unchanging over the course of a day. Thus, a composition as used
   herein is understood to be present in an inert environment. As used herein, a composition that
    is "free" of a chemical entity means that the composition contains, if at all, an amount of the
20 chemical entity which cannot be avoided following an affirmative act intended to eliminate
   the presence of the chemical entity in the composition.
    As used herein, "stability testing" refers to tests conducted at specific time intervals and
    various environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) to see if and to what
25  extent a drug product degrades over its designated shelf life time. The specific conditions and
    time of the tests are such that they accelerate the conditions the drug product is expected to
    encounter over its shelf life. For example, detailed requirements of stability testing for
    finished pharmaceuticals are codified in 21 C.F.R §211.166, the entire content of which is
    hereby incorporated by reference.

                                              Laquinimod
   It is an oral immunomodulator which has demonstrated therapeutic effect in various
 5 experimental inflammatory/autoimmune animal models, such as Experimental Autoimmune
   Encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Dextran Sodium
   Solphate (DSS) induced colitis for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Non-Obese Diabetic
   (NOD) mice for Type I Diabetes (IDDM), Experimental Autoinmmune Neuritis (EAN) for
   Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Multiple Sclerosis, lupus
10 nephritis, lupus arthritis, Crohn's Disease and Rheumatoid arthritis. The therapeutic activity
   of laquinimod in these models results from a variety of mechanistic effects, including
   reduction of leukocyte infiltration into target tissues by modulation of chemokine-mediated
   T-cell adhesion, modulation of cytokine balance, down regulation of MHC class II resulting
   in alteration of antigen presentation, and effects on dendritic cells subpopulations.
15
   A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of laquinimod includes lithium, sodium, potassium,
   magnesium, calcium, manganese, copper, zinc, aluminum and iron. Salt formulations of
   laquinimod and the process for preparing the same are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent
   Application Publication No. 2005/0192315 and PCT International Application Publication No.
20 WO 2005/074899, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this application.
   A dosage unit may comprise a single compound or mixtures of compounds thereof. A dosage
   unit can be prepared for oral dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, and
   granules.
25
   Laquinimod can be administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents,
   extenders, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as a pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration and
    as consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. The unit is preferably in a form

                                                - 12
   suitable for oral administration. Laquinimod can be administered alone but is generally mixed
   with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and co-administered in the form of a tablet or
   capsule, liposome, or as an agglomerated powder. Examples of suitable solid carriers include
   lactose, sucrose, gelatin and agar. Capsule or tablets can be easily formulated and can be
 5 made easy to swallow or chew; other solid forms include granules, and bulk powders. Tablets
   may contain suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring
   agents, flow-inducing agents, and melting agents. For instance, for oral administration in the
   dosage unit form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an
   oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, gelatin, agar,
10 starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol,
   sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose and the like. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin,
   natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn starch, natural and synthetic gums such as
   acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, povidone, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene
   glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate,
15 sodium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, stearic acid, sodium
   stearyl fumarate, talc and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl
   cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate and
   the like.
20 Specific examples of the techniques, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that
   may be used to formulate oral dosage forms of the present invention are described, e.g., in
   U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0192315, PCT International Application
   Publication Nos. WO 2005/074899, WO 2007/047863, and WO 2007/146248.

   DELAQ as an Impurity
   DELAQ(des-ethyl-laquinimod;                5-chloro-4-hydroxy-l-methyl-2-oxo-N-phenyl-1,2
   dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide), having the following chemical structure, is an undesirable
10 synthetic by-product of laquinimod synthesis and a potential degradation by-product of
   laquinimod.

   Any activity of DELAQ has not been fully characterized. Thus, it is generally desirable to
15 minimize the amount of any impurity such as DELAQ in the laquinimod drug substance and
   the final drug product containing laquinimod.
   DELAQ as an impurity in the laquinimod sodium drug substance is tested by a HPLC
   method and the specification for this impurity is provided as not more than 0.1%. The GMP
20 drug substance batches of laquinimod sodium have been tested and the levels of DELAQ in
   these batches have been found to be less than 3 ppm.
   Several analytical and bioanalytical methods were developed for determination of DELAQ
   concentrations. The current bioanalytical methods for DELAQ analysis in various matrices
25 are based on LC-MS and have sensitivity at the low pg/mL plasma level.
   This invention will be better understood by reference to the Experimental Details which
   follow, but those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific experiments

                                             -14
detailed are only illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which
follow thereafter.

   Example 1: Preparation of DELAO
   Synthesis of DELAQ from 5-chloro-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-l-methyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3
 5 carboxylic acid methyl ester
   Preparation of 5-chloro-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid
   methyl ester is described in Example 1 of U.S. Patent No. 7,560,557, entire content of which
   is hereby incorporated by reference.
10 5-chloro-1,2-dihydro-4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic     acid methyl ester
   (10.0 g), aniline (1.5 eq.), heptane (60 ml) and octane (60 ml) were mixed and heated. The
   volatiles, mainly heptane and formed methanol, were distilled off during 5 hours. After
   cooling to room temperature, the crystalline suspension was filtered and the crystals were
   washed with heptane and dried in vacuum to yield DELAQ (10.4g, 85% yield, >99% purity
15 by HPLC).

   Example 2: Analysis of DELAO as an Impurity in Laquinimod
   DELAQ can be formed as an impurity in the manufacture of laquinimod, when starting
   material N-ethylaniline (NEA) contains aniline as an impurity. Therefore, the level of aniline
   in the starting material N-ethylaniline is monitored and N-ethylaniline is used for
 5 manufacture of laquinimod only if the aniline amount is less than 0.5%.
   Doping starting material N-ethylaniline with aniline has resulted in a higher level of DELAQ
   in the laquinimod sodium crude as shown in the table below.

   described above. Figure 3 is a HPLC chromatogram showing analytical results of a sample of
   N-ethylaniline under such HPLC conditions. As shown in Figure 3, aniline was present in the
 5 sample of N-ethylaniline at retention time of 3.003 minutes using the above HPLC method.
   The DELAQ as an impurity in the laquinimod sodium drug substance has been monitored. A
   batch of the laquinimod sodium drug substance is approved for the preparation of final drug
   product only if the DELAQ impurity is not more than 0.1% using HPLC analysis.
