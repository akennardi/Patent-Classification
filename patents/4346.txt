                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
        The present disclosure relates to certain heterocycle fused morphianans. Compounds of
the present disclosure are mixed mu agonist delta antagonists or dual mu agonist/delta agonists
or antagonists at mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors. Compounds of the present disclosure are
useful as analgesics and as treatment agents for neurological and other disorders where opioid
systems play a modulatory or pathological role. More particularly compounds of the present
disclosure are useful for treating a patient in need of an analgesic for pain relief, in need of an
immunosuppressant to prevent rejection in organ transplant and skin graft, in need of an anti
allergic agent, in need of an anti-inflammatory agent, in need of a brain cell protectant, for drug
and/or alcohol abuse, to decrease gastric secretion, for diarrhea, for cardiovascular disease, for a
respiratory disease, in need of a cough and/or respiratory depressant, for mental illness, for
epileptic seizures and other neurologic disorders.
                                               BACKGROUND
        Chronic pain represents a major health and economic problem throughout the world.

      WO 2013/166271                                                          PCT/US2013/039242
         Despite major advances in understanding the physiological and pathological basis of
pain, an ideal analgesic is yet to be discovered. Among analgesic drugs, the opioid class of
compounds still remains the effective treatment agents for severe and chronic pain. For instance,
see Parrot,Using opioid analgesic to manage chronic non-cancer pain in primary care, J. Am.
Board Fam. Pract, 1999, 12, 293-306 and Cherny, New strategies in opioid therapy for cancer
pain, J. Oncol. Manage 2000, 9, 8-15.
         The existence of three opioid receptor types, mu opioid receptors (MOR), delta opioid
receptor (DOR) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has been clearly established and is confirmed
by cloning of these three receptors from mouse, rat, and human cDNAs. Along these lines, see
Dhawan et al., International Union of Pharmacology. XII. Classification of Opioid Receptors,
Pharmacol. Rev. 1996, 48, 567-592; and McCurdy et al., Opioid Receptor Ligands. In Burger's
Medicinal Chemistry, Drug Discovery and Development, 7th ed.; Abraham et al.,
Eds. John Wiley & Sons: New York, NY, 2010.
         All three opioid receptor types are located in the human central nervous system and each
has a role in the mediation of pain. Morphine and related opioids currently prescribed as potent
analgesics for the treatment of pain produce their analgesic activity primarily through their
agonist action at the mu opioid receptors. The general administration of these medications is
limited by significant side effects such as respiratory depression, muscle rigidity, emesis,
constipation, tolerance, and physical dependence. For example, see Duthie, Adverse Effects of
Opioid Analgesic Drugs, Br. J. Anaesth. 1987, 59, 6177 and van Ree et al., Opioids, Reward and
Addiction: An Encounter of Biology, Psychology, and Medicine. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999, 51,
341-396.
        A large body of evidence indicates the existence of physiological and functional
interactions between mu and delta receptors. Ligands with agonist or antagonist action at the
delta receptor, for example, have been shown to modulate the analgesic and adverse effects of
mu agonists. See, for instance, Traynor et al., Delta opioid receptor subtypes and cross-talk with
mu receptors. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993, 14, 84-86; Rothman et al., Allosteric Coupling
                                                   2

opioid Receptors: Generation of novel signaling units, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 2002, 2, 76-81.
         On the other hand, agonist action at the delta receptors potentiate mu receptor mediated
analgesic effects and antagonist action at the delta receptor suppresses the tolerance, physical
dependence, and related side effects off mu agonists without affecting their analgesic activity. In
a study using the nonpeptide ligand naltrindole, Abdelhamid et al. demonstrated that the delta
receptor antagonist greatly reduced the development of morphine tolerance and dependence in
mice in both the acute and chronic models without affecting the analgesic actions of morphine.
See Abdelhamid et al., Selective blockage of delta opioid receptors prevents the development of
morphine tolerance and dependence in mice. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991, 258, 299-303.
Fundytus et al., reported that continuous infusion of the delta selective antagonist TIPP{T) by
the intracerbroventricular (icv) route in parallel with continuous administration of morphine by
the subcutaneous route to rats attenuated the development of morphine tolerance and dependence
to a large extent. See Fundytus, et al., Attenuation of morphine tolerance and dependence with
the highly selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist TIPP[']. Eur. J. Pharmacol 1995, 286,
105-108.
         Schiller et al., found that the peptide ligand DIPP-NH2[Y] displayed mixed mu
agonist/delta antagonist properties in vitro and that the compound given icv produced analgesic
effect with no physical dependence and less tolerance than morphine in rats. See Schiller et al.,
Four different types of Opioid Peptides with mixed mu agonist/delta Antagonist Properties
Analgesia 1995, 1, 703-706; and Schiller et al., The Opioid mu agonist/delta antagonist DIPP
NH2   -[ T] produces a potent analgesic effect, no physical dependence, and less tolerance than
morphine in rats, J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 3520-3526.
         Studies with antisense oligonucleotides of delta receptors have demonstrated that
reduction of receptor expression diminishes the development and/or expression of morphine
                                                     3

dependence without compromising antinociception produced by mu agonists. See Suzuki et al.,
Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to delta opioid receptors attenuates morphine dependence in
mice, Life Sci. 1997, 61, PL 165-170; and Sanchez-Blazquez et al., Antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides to opioid mu and delta receptors reduced morphine dependence in mice:
Role of delta-2 opioid receptors, J. Pharmacsol. Exp. There. 1997, 280, 1423-1431. Furthermore,
genetic deletion studies using delta receptor knockout mice have shown that these mutant mice
retain supraspinal analgesia and do not develop analgesic tolerance to morphine. Zhu et al.,
Retention of supraspinal delta-like analgesia and loss of morphine tolerance in delta opioid
receptor knockout mice, Neuron, 1999, 24, 243-252.
         Discovery of nonpeptide opioid ligands possessing a balanced profile of mixed mu
agonist/delta antagonist activity has been a challenge. In an early study focusing on naltrexone
derived heterocycle annulated morphinan ligands, it was found that compounds arising by fusion
of a heteroaromatic ring such as a pyridine ring on the C5-C6 of the C-ring gave
pyridomorphinans that displayed high affinity binding at the opioid receptors. The binding
affinity and functional activity are modulated by the substituents placed at the 5'-position on the
pyridine moiety. For example, the introduction of aromatic groups such as a phenyl group or a 1
pyrrolyl group at this position gave ligands with high binding affinity and improved antagonist
potency as determined in bioassays using mouse vas deferens smooth muscle preparations. See
Ananthan et al., Synthesis, opioid receptor binding, and biological activities of naltrexone
derived pyrido- and pyrimidomorphinans, J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 3527-3538; and Ananthan et
al., Synthesis, opioid receptor binding, and functional activity of 5'-substituted 17
cyclopropylmethylpyrido[2',3':6,7]morphinans. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003, 13, 529-532,
         Interestingly, among phenyl ring substituted analogues, the p-chlorophenyl compound
displayed a mixed mu agonist/delta antagonist profile of activity in the smooth muscle assays in
vitro. In analgesic activity evaluations, this compound displayed partial agonist activity in the
tail-flick assay and a full agonist activity in the acetic acid writhing assay after icv or ip
administration in mice, and it did not produce tolerance to antinociceptive effects on repeated ip
injections. Studies in mice with selective antagonists, characterized this compound as a partial
mu agonist/delta antagonist. See Wells et al., In Vivo Pharmacological Characterization of SoRI
9409, a Nonpeptidic opioid mu-agonist/delta-antagonist that produces limited antinociceptive
                                                    4

       WO 2013/166271                                                         PCT/US2013/039242
tolerance and attenuates morphine physical dependence. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 297,
597-605. In in vitro biochemical assays using [3 5S]GTP-y-S binding, this compound, however,
failed to display mu agonist activity in guinea pig caudate membranes as well as in cloned cells
expressing human mu receptors. See Xu et al., SoRI-9409, a Non-peptide opioid mu receptor
agonist/delta receptor antagonist, fails to stimulate [3 S]-GTP- y-S binding at cloned opioid
receptors. brain res. bull. 2001, 55, 507-511. A similar pyridine annulations strategy when
applied to oxymorphone and hydromorphone frameworks led to ligands that displayed mixed mu
agonist/delta antagonist activity although with somewhat weak mu agonist potency. See
Ananthan et al., Identification of ligands possessing mixed pt agonist/6 antagonist activity among
pyridomorphinans derived from naloxone, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone. J. Med. Chem.
2004, 47, 1400-1412.
         Bivalent ligands possessing a mu agonist unit such as oxymorphone tethered to a delta
antagonist unit such as naltrindole by a 16 to 21 atom chain have been investigated as ligands
targeting mu-delta heterodimers. Among such compounds, bivalent ligand whose spacer was 16
atoms or longer produced less dependence than morphine; ligands possessing spacer lengths of
 19 atoms or greater produced less physical dependence and tolerance. See Daniels et al., Opioid
induced tolerance and dependence in mice is modulated by the distance between
pharmacophores in a bivalent ligand series. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005, 102,
 19208-19213.
         Schmidhamner and coworkers explored a number of morphinans possessing an alkoxy
substituent at the 14-position. The morphinan templates explored include 6-oxomoprhinans, 6
aminomorphinans, indolomorphinans and benzofuromorphinans. Depending upon the template
and the substituents, compounds with varying profiles were obtained. See Schmidhammer, et al.,

        Compounds of the present disclosure can be prepared from commercially available
morphinan ketones using the pyridine annulation methodology described earlier followed by
appropriate functional group transformation methods as shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2.
        For the synthesis of the desired target compounds, the previously reported 17
cyclopropylmethyl- and 17-methyl-3,14-dihydroxypyridomorphinans 6 (Ananthan et al.,
Synthesis, opioid receptor binding, and biological activities of naltrexone-derived pyrido- and
pyrimidomorphinans. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 3527-3538) and 9 (Ananthan et al., Identification
of opiod ligands possessing mixed p agonist/S antagonist activity among pyridomorphinans
derived from naloxone, oxymorphonem and hydromorphone. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47,
1400-1412) served as suitable starting materials. For the synthesis of 14-alkoxy target
compounds we found it convenient to perform dialkylation at the phenolic hydroxyl at the 3
position and the tertiary alcohol at the 14-position followed by selective dealkylation of the
phenolic ether function. Thus, dimethylation of 6 with dimethyl sulfate or dialkylation of 6 or 9
with appropriate alkyl bromides using sodium hydride as the base yielded the corresponding

dialkyl derivatives 19a-d and 19f Treatment of these with boron tribromide led to selective
removal of the alkyl group from the ether function at C-3 yielding the target compounds 17a-d
and 17f. For the preparation of 17e, 17g and 17h, the oxycodone-derived pyridomorphinan 20
(Ananthan et al, Identification of opiod ligands possessing mixed p agonist/6 antagonist activity
among pyridomorphinans derived from naloxone, oxymorphone and hydromorphone. J. Med.
Chem. 2004, 47, 1400-1412) was used as the starting material. Alkylation of 20 with the
appropriate alkylating agent followed by 3-0-demethylation of the resulting diethers 19e, 19g
and 19h delivered the desired target compounds (Scheme 1).

            The starting materials 6 and 9 were reacted with an excess of the appropriate acid
chloride and the resulting intermediates were treated with aqueous base to remove the acyl group
from the phenolic hydroxyl group to obtain the desired 14-O-acylated target compounds 18a-f.
The yields of the final products in these acylation reactions were only modest possibly due to
elimination reactions setting in as side reactions. For example, isolation of the products from the
reaction of 6 with benzoyl chloride after a 5 h reaction time gave the dibenzoate 21 and the
elimination product 22 in 60:40 ratio. When the reaction was allowed to proceed for a longer
period of time (16 h) the elimination product became the main product with a distribution ratio of

         Ligand Binding at the Opioid Receptors. All target compounds were evaluated for
binding affinities at DOR, MOR and KOR using a radioligand displacement assay with
membranes prepared from CHO cells stably expressing these receptors. The radioligands
13 H]DADLE, [3HJDAMGO and [3HJU69,593 were used for labeling the DOR, MOR and KOR
sites, respectively. These evaluations were performed as previously described. (See Fontanaet
al, Synthetic studies of neoclerodane diterpenoids from Salvia splendens and evaluation of
Opioid Receptor affinity. Tetrahedron 2008, 64, 10041-10048. Rothman et al., Allosteric

comparison of noninternalizing (herkinorin) and internalizing (DAMGO) p-opioid agonists on
cellular markers related to opioid tolerance and dependence. Synapse 2007, 61, 166-175.) The
affinity and selectivity data for the target compounds are given in Table 1. With the exception of
18a and 18d, all of the ligands displayed high affinity binding at DOR with Ki <5 nM. In general,
all of the ligands displayed relatively non-selective binding profiles at all three opioid receptor
subtypes. The 14-methoxy compound 17a arising from 14-O-methylation displayed a binding
profile somewhat similar to that of the parent compound 6. In contrast, methylation of 9
produced the ligand 17e that displayed markedly improved binding affinity at MOR and KOR.
Among the N-CPM compounds, installation of the arylalkyl groups such as benzyl, cinnamyl and
phenethyl on the oxygen at C-14 (compounds 17b, 17c, and 17d) consistently increased the
binding affinity at MOR. A similar trend of increasing MOR affinity is seen among the N-Me
compounds 17e, 17f, and 17g. Placement of a benzoyloxy group at C-14 is generally not well
tolerated. The two benzoyloxy compounds 18a and 18d are 45- and 10-fold weaker in binding to
DOR compared to their 14-benzyloxy counterparts, 17b and 17f, respectively. These benzoyloxy

ligands also displayed comparable decrease in affinity at MOR and KOR indicating a general
unfavorable interaction trend among all receptor subtypes. In contrast, installation of
phenylacetyl and phenylpropionyl groups (18b, 18c, 18e and 18f) gave ligands with moderate to
high affinity at all three receptors. In fact the phenylpropoxy and phenylpropionyl ligands
possessing three atom separation between 14-0 and the pendant phenyl group (17d vs 18c and
17h vs 18f) display somewhat comparable affinity profiles. The relatively high affinity of these
ligands at all three receptors may be attributable to the conformational flexibility afforded by the
longer chain to position the pendant phenyl group to occupy a suitable binding pocket for
favorable hydrophobic or aryl-n interactions at the ligand binding pocket. The binding profile of
compound 23 lacking an ether function with unsaturation between C-8 and C-14 resembles that
of the saturated (6) or the methoxy (17a) analogues exhibiting lower affinity at MOR compared
to affinities at DOR and KOR.

         In vitro Functional Activity at the Opioid Receptors.
         Compound selections and in vitro functional activity determinations were performed with
the primary aim of identifying ligands possessing the desired mixed MOR agonist/DOR
antagonist activity. The agonist efficacy (Em,) and potency (ECso) values were determined using
previously described ["S]GTP-y-S binding assays with cells expressing MOR, DOR or KOR.
The agonist Ema values were normalized to the stimulation produced by the standard agonists
DAMGO, DADLE and U69,593 at MOR, DOR and KOR, respectively. The antagonist potency
of the ligands was determined using a [3 5 JGTP-y-S binding assay by measuring the shift in EC50
value of standard agonists. The functional activity data thus obtained are presented in Table 2.
With the exception of 18d, all of the compounds 17e-h, 18e and 18f possessing the classical
MOR agonist N-Me structural feature displayed full agonist efficacy at MOR with Ema values
>100. The weak MOR agonist potency and partial efficacy of 18d is in conformity with its poor
binding affinity at MOR. In terms of agonist potency; whereas, the methyl and benzyl ethers
were weak (17e, EC5 0 = 379 nM; 17f, EC 5 o= 301 nM), the cinnamyl (17g) and the 3
phenylpropyl (17h) ethers were nearly 100-fold more potent with ECs0 values of 4.27 nM and
2.15 nM, respectively. Compared to these ethers, the esters displayed diminished MOR agonist
potencies (18e ECso = 87 nM; 18f EC 50 = 48 nM). All of the esters (18a-c) as well as the
unsaturated compound 23 possessing the classical antagonist N-CPM structural feature did
 indeed turn out to be antagonists at MOR. Similarly, the methyl, benzyl and cinnamyl ethers
 17a-c possessing the N-CPM group also displayed a non-agonist profile at MOR. Most
 interestingly, however, the phenylpropyl ether 17d possessing the N-CPM group displayed an
agonist profile at MOR (Ema = 72%, EC5 o = 1.74 nM). This transformative influence on the
 functional activity at MOR brought about by installation of a 3-phenylpropoxy group at the 14
 position of the 17-cyclopropylmethyl-4,5-epoxypyridomorphinan is similar to the effect of such
 a group on17-cyclopropylmethyl-4,5-epoxy-6-oxomorphinans.
         It has been demonstrated that pyridomorphinans in general, and those possessing an aryl
 group such as the 4-chlorophenylgroup at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring in particular,
 showed a non-agonist functional profile at DOR, irrespective of whether the ligands possessed a
 MOR-agonist methyl group (9 and 10) or a MOR-antagonist CPM group (6 and 8) on the
 morphinan nitrogen. The functional activity profile of the current series of compounds at DOR,
 however, is influenced by the nature of the substituent at C-14. In the current series of

compounds, all of the ligands possessing an N-CPM group were antagonists at DOR including
17d. However, ligands possessing N-methyl group (17f, 17g, 17h, 18e and 18f) displayed weak
to potent partial agonist activity at DOR. Among the N-methyl compounds, the 14-methoxy
compound 17e is the only exception retaining antagonistactivity at DOR. The N-CPM
containing MOR agonist ligand 17d also turned out to be the most potent DOR antagonist with a
Ke of 0.091 nM.
        At KOR, most of the tested ligands displayed weak partial agonist activity (Emax <36%)
with varying potencies as antagonists. The phenylpropoxy compound 17d was devoid of agonist
activity at KOR. Thus, the incorporation of the phenylpropoxy group on a pyridomorphinan
possessing the N-CPM group did not induce agonist activity at DOR or KOR as it did at MOR.
This is in contrast to the results from incorporation of a phenylpropoxy group on 6
oxomorphinans reported by Sclunidhammer and coworkers, who found that introduction of a
phenylpropoxy group at the C 14-position of naltrexone (1) yielded the agonist 13, devoid of any
antagonist activity. (see Greiner et al., Synthesis and biological evaluation of 14
alkoxymorphinans. 18. N-substituted 14-phenylpropyloxymorphinan-6-ones with unanticipated

Chem. 2003, 46, 1758-1763.) Among the compounds of the present disclosure, 17d emerged as
a compound of particular interest as it displayed a balanced profile of potent agonist activity at
MOR coupled with antagonist activity at DOR and KOR.

          In Vitro Studies on Tolerance and Dependence.
          Two experiments using CHO cells co-expressing MOR and DOR (dimer cells) to
determine the effect of 17d on the development of tolerance and dependence, respectively. As a
control, the MOR/DOR dual agonist 17h was used in these experiments. Dimer cells were
treated for 20 h with medium (control), morphine (1 pM), 17d (30 nM) or 17h (30 nM). These
concentrations were chosen to be approximately 25-fold greater than the corresponding EC 5 0
values for stimulation of [3 5S]GTP-y-S binding to membranes prepared from dimer cells. As
reported in Figure 1, chronic morphine and chronic 17h resulted in an ~ 7-fold increase in the
                                                                 33

EC5 0 value for DAMGO-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation.
Unlike morphine, 17d and 17h decreased the Eniax value for DAMGO-mediated inhibition of
forskolin-stimulated cAMP by 40% and 20%, respectively.
         In the "dependence" experiments (Figure 2), dimer cells were treated chronically as
described above. After 20 h treatment, the cells were washed to remove drugs, and the degree of
cAMP accumulation produced by forskolin/IBMX (100 tM/500 pM) was determined in the
absence and presence of 10 pM naloxone. Chronic morphine produced a significant increase in
forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, a phenomenon called "cAMP superactivation". The
combination of forskolin plus naloxone produced a further increase in cAMP accumulation, a
phenomenon called "naloxone-induced cAMP overshoot." The MOR agonist/DOR agonist
compound (17h) produced effects similar to that of morphine, whereas the MOR agonist/DOR
antagonist compound (17d) did not.
         Chronic treatment of cells that express MOR with MOR agonists produce a variety of
cellular adaptations that together produce tolerance and dependence. See Waldhoer et al., Opioid
receptors. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004, 73, 953-990. Three such changes were assessed: 1)
tolerance, as determined by shifts in the DAMGO-dose response curve for inhibition of
forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, 2) cAMP superactivation and 3) the naloxone-induced
cAMP overshoot. These latter two measures are generally considered as cellular signs related to
dependence. The cAMP overshoot reflects the formation of constitutively active receptors, which
are receptors that activate G proteins in the absence of an agonist. The constitutively active
MORs decrease forskolin-stimulated cAMP, and naloxone, as an inverse agonist, decreases the
activity of the constitutively active MORs, thereby relieving the inhibition. The net result is a
further increase in forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation.
         The results observed here with chronic morphine treatment of dimer cells are similar to
what was observed previously using CHO cells that stably express the cloned human MOR. Xu
et al., A comparison of noninternalizing (herkinorin) and internalizing (DAMGO) j-opioid
agonists on cellular markers related to opioid tolerance and dependence. Synapse 2007, 61, 166
175. In contrast, chronic treatment of dimer cells with the MOR agonist/DOR antagonist 17d did
not produce either tolerance, as defined as an increase in the EC5 0 value for DAMGO-mediated
inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP, or dependence, as defined by the presence of cAMP

superactivation or a naloxone-induced cAMP overshoot. The MOR agonist/DOR agonist 17h
had similar effects to that of morphine.
        These data support the hypothesis that the mu/delta heterodimer may be a crucial
mediator of tolerance and dependence. See Waldhoer et al., A heterodimer-selective agonist
shows in vivo relevance of G protein-coupled receptor dimers. Proc. Nat!. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
2005, 102, 9050-9055.
        Analgesic Activity and Tolerance Studies in Mice.
        The analgesic activity of selected ligands were tested in mice using the 55 C warm-water
tail-withdrawal test as described previously. See Wells et al, In vivo pharmacological
characterization of SoRI 9409, a nonpeptidic opioid mu-agonist/delta-antagonist that produces
limited antinociceptive tolerance and attenuates morphine physical dependence. J. Pharmacol.
Exp. Ther. 2001, 297, 597-605. Compounds that were evaluated were 17d, 17e, 17g, and 17h.
These compounds were administered by the intracerebroventricular (icv) route. All of the tested
compounds produced full antinociceptive effects. The antinociceptive effects of these
compounds were blocked by naloxone pretreatment confirming that the analgesic activity of
these compounds is mediated through opioid receptors. The antinociceptive dose-response
curves for 17d and 17e are shown in Figures 3A and 3B, repsectively. The calculated
antinociceptive Aso values of all the tested compounds and the morphine control are listed in
Table 3. In this assay, compounds 17d, 17g, and 17h displayed potency equivalent to or better
than that of morphine. This is attributable to potent agonist activity of these ligands at MOR
(1 7d) or at both MOR and DOR (17g and 17h) as determined in the [3 5S]GTP-7-S assays.
Despite the very weak MOR agonist potency displayed by 17e in the [ 5S]GTP-y-S assay (MOR
agonist EC50 = 379 nM), this compound produced significant analgesic effect and was only 6
fold weaker than other tested ligands. As evaluated in the in vitro tolerance assays, it was of
interest to determine the effects of two compounds, 17d, a MOR agonist/DOR antagonist and
17h, a MOR-DOR dual agonist. The studies were carried out using the tolerance development
assay involving repeated injection of the test compound for 3 days twice daily. The degree of
tolerance development is indicated by the fold-shift in the antinociceptive A50 values when tested
in naive control mice and in the repeated injection paradigm. In this repeated administration
paradigm, morphine produces a significant development of tolerance inducing a 45-fold shift in
A50 value. Compared to morphine, the mixed MOR agonist/DOR antagonist ligand displayed
                                                 35

only 7.9-fold shift in antinociceptive potency, thus confirming that this ligand indeed produces
significantly less tolerance than morphine (Figures 4A and 4B). Based on the results from the in
vitro tolerance study, the MOR-DOR dual agonist ligand 1.7h might be expected to display
robust tolerance development in the repeated injection paradigm. Unfortunately, undue toxicity
displayed by this compound on repeated administration precluded the determination of induction
of analgesic tolerance.

         Pharmacological evaluations with the mixed MOR agonist/DOR antagonist ligand 17d
demonstrated that the mixed function ligand indeed produces diminished tolerance and
dependence effects in a cellular model system as compared to the MOR/DOR dual agonist ligand
17h. Moreover, the MOR agonist/DOR antagonist 17d, when tested using the repeated
administration procedure in mice produced greatly diminished tolerance development as
compared to morphine.

[bacitracin (100 pg/mL), bestatin (10 gg/mL), leupeptin (4 pg/mL) and chymostatin (2 pg/mL)],
in a final assay volume of 1.0 mL. All drug dilution curves were made up with buffer containing
I mg/mL BSA. Nonspecific binding was determined using 20 pM levallorphan ([ 3HI]DAMGO
and [3H]DADLE) and 1 gM (-)-U69,593 (for [3H]U69,593 binding). [3H]Radioligands were used
at - 2 nM concentrations. Triplicate samples were filtered with Brandel Cell Harvesters
(Biomedical Research & Development Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), over Whatman GF/B filters,
after a 2 hr incubation at 25 'C. The filters were punched into 24-well plates to which was added
0.6 mL of LSC-cocktail (Cytoscint). Samples were counted, after an overnight extraction, in a
Trilux liquid scintillation counter at 44% efficiency. Opioid binding assays had -30   Ig protein

[35S]GTP-y-S binding assays. [35S]GTP-y-S binding was determined as described previously.
Briefly, test tubes received the following additions: 50 pL buffer A plus 0. 1%BSA, 50 pL GDP

mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 40 pM GDP and 0.1% BSA. Incubations proceeded for 3 h at 25 0C.
Nonspecific binding was determined using GTP-y-S (40 [M). Bound and free [3 5SIGTP-y-S

         Data Analysis and Statistics. These methods are described in Rothman et aL, A:
Allosteric interactions at the p-opioid receptor. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007, 320, 801-810 and
Xu et aL, A comparison of noninternalizing (herkinorin) and internalizing (DAMGO) [p-opioid
agonists on cellular markers related to opioid tolerance and dependence. Synapse 2007, 61, 166
175. For opioid binding experiments, the pooled data of three experiments (typically 30 data
points) are fit to the two-parameter logistic equation for the best-fit estimates of the IC50 and N
values: Y=100/(1 +([INHIBITOR]/ICo)N), where "Y" is the percent of control value. Ki values
for test drugs are calculated according to the standard equation: Ki = IC50/(1+[radioligand]/Kd]).
For the [3H]radioligands, the following Kd values (nM+fzSD, n=3) were used in the Ki calculation:
[3H]DAMGO (0.93±0.04), [3H]DADLE (1.9±0.3) and [3H](-)-U69,593 (11+0.6). The
corresponding Bm, values were (fmol/mg protein±SD, n=3): [3HJDAMGO (1912+68),
[3H]DADLE (3655+391) and [3H](-)-U69,593 (3320±364).
         For the [35S]GTP-y-S binding experiments, the percent stimulation of [3 SIGTP-y-S
binding was calculated according to the following formula: (S - B)/B x 100, where B is the basal
level of [3 5S]GTP-y-S binding and S is the stimulated level of [3 5 ]GTP-y-S binding. Agonist

dose-response curves (ten points/curve) are generated, and the data of several experiments, 3 or

PC (Civilized Software, Bethesda, MD), KaleidaGraph (Version 3.6.4, Synergy Software,
Reading, PA) or Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA). In most cases, the percent
stimulation of the test compound is reported as a percent of the maximal stimulation of 1000 nM
DAMGO, 500 nM SNC80 or 500 nM (-)-U50,488 in the appropriate cell type. For determination
of K, values using the "shift" experimental design, agonist (DAMGO, (-)-U50,488 or SNC80)
dose-response curves are generated, using the appropriate cell type, in the absence and presence
(ten points/curve) of a test compound. The data of several experiments, 3 or more, are pooled,
and the Ke values are calculated according to the equation: [Test Drug]/(EC 5 0-2 /EC5so - 1), where
EC5 0 -2 is the EC 50 value in the presence of the test drug and EC 50 1 is the value in the absence of

(cMyc-m6-HpCHO cells) were produced by stable transfection with the mouse 8 opioid receptor
with N-cMyc tag and human p opioid receptor cDNA. Cells were grown on plastic flasks in F-12
Nutrient Mixture (HAM, GIBCO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin,
100 pg/mL streptomycin, 400 pg/mL hygromycin B (for 6 receptor selection), and 400 pg/mL
geneticin (for pv receptor selection) under 95% air/5% CO 2 at 37 'C. After 80% confluence, cell
monolayers were plated in 24-well plates and grown in F-12 Nutrient Mixture (HAM, GIBCO)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 ig/mL streptomycin, 400
pg/mL hygromycin B and 400 pg/mL geneticin under 95% air/5% CO 2 at 37 'C. On the day of
the experiment, cells (control or drug-treated) were washed three times with serum free medium,
and incubated with serum free medium, containing IBMX (500 pLM). After a 20-min incubation
at 37 'C, medium was removed and then cells incubated with fresh serum free medium
containing IBMX (500 jiM) and forskolin (100 pM) and appropriate agonist or antagonist for 15
min (assay for opioid inhibition of cAMP accumulation) or 10 min (assay for naloxone-induced
cAMP overshoot) at 37 *C. The reaction was terminated by aspiration of the medium and the
addition of 0.5 mL of 0.1 N HCL After chilling plates at 4 'C for at least I h, 0.4 mL was
removed, neutralized, vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, supernatants were used
for cAMP assay. These assay monitored inhibition of [3H]cAMP binding to cAMP-dependent

protein kinase. Assays took place in 50 mM Tris-HC, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCI and 5
mM EDTA. After a 2 h incubation at 4 'C (protected from light), bound and free [ 3H]cAMP
were separated by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/B filters with two 4 mL washes with
ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4. Filters were punched into wells of plate to which was added
0.6 mL LSC-cocktail (CytoScint) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter at 44% efficiency.
        Data Analysis and Statistics. The amount of cAMP in the samples was quantitated from
a cAMP standard curve ranging from 0.25 to 256 pmol of cAMP/assay. Forskolin (100 pM)
stimulated cAMP formation in the absence of agonist was defined as 100%. The EC5 o (the
concentration of agonist that produces fifty percent inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP
formation) and Em, (% of maximal inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP) were calculated
using program Prizm version 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data from three
experiments were analyzed using the program Prizm version 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E.M.
        Antinociceptive Studies. Male ICR mice (Harlan) were used for all evaluations. Mice
were housed in a temperature and humidity controlled vivarium on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle
with unlimited access to food and water prior to the formal procedures. (Wells et al., In vivo
pharmacological characterization of SoR 9409, a nonpeptidic opioid mu-agonist/delta
antagonist that produces limited antinociceptive tolerance and attenuates morphine physical
dependence. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 297, 597-605.) Graded doses of morphine or the test
compounds were injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) under light ether anesthesia. Morphine
sulfate was dissolved in distilled water and injected in a volume of 5 pL. The test compounds
were dissolved in 100% DMSO and injected in a volume of 5 p.L. Antinociceptive assays were
performed at various times after injection.
        Warm-Water Tail-Withdrawal Assay. Naive mice were baselined in the 55 'C warm
water tail-withdrawal test as previously described by Wells et al., In vivo pharmacological
characterization of SoRI 9409, a nonpeptidic opioid mu-agonist/delta-antagonist that produces
limited antinociceptive tolerance and attenuates morphine physical dependence. J. Pharmacol.
Exp. Ther. 2001, 297, 597-605 and Bilsky et al, Competitive and non-competitive NMDA
antagonists block the development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine, but not to selective
mu or delta opioid agonists in mice. Pain 1996, 68, 229-237. Doses of morphine or the test
compound were injected icy, and antinociception was assessed at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 80, 120 and
                                                 40

 180 min post injection. Percent antinociception was calculated using the formula: %MPE
(maximal possible effect) = 100 x (test - control)/(cutoff - control) where control is the predrug
observation, test is the post drug observation, and cutoff is the maximal length of stimulus
allowed (10 s for 55 'C tail-withdrawal). Antinociceptive A50 values and 95% confidence
intervals were determined using linear regression software (FlashCalc). Opioid activity of the
test compounds was assessed by pretreating animals with naloxone (10 mg/kg ip, -10 min)
followed by an icv injection of an approximate Ago dose of test compound. If a compound did
not produce a full agonist effect, then the dose that produced the greatest antinociceptive effect
was used. Antinociception was assessed in the 55 'C warm-water tail-withdrawal test at 10, 20
and 30 min. A positive response to a fixed dose of naloxone was indicated when greater than
80% reduction in the antinociceptive effect of the agonist was observed.
        Tolerance Regimen. Mice were injected twice daily (8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) with an
approximate Ago dose of morphine or Ago dose of 17d for 3 days. Antinociceptive dose-response
curves in the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay were generated on the morning of the fourth day
using the procedures outlined above.

        One skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable methods of exogenously administering
a compound of the present disclosure to an animal are available, and , although more than one
route can be used to administer a particular compound, a particular route can provide a more
immediate and more effective reaction than another route.
        As regards these applications, the present method includes the administration to an
animal, particularly a mammal, and more particularly a human, of a therapeutically effective
amount of the compound effective in the treatment of a condition that is capable of treatment
with an agonist and/or antagonist of the opioid receptors. The dose administered to an animal,
particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to affect a
therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable time frame. One skilled in the art will
recognize that dosage will depend upon a variety of factors including the condition of the animal,
the body weight of the animal, as well as the severity and stage of the cancer.
        The total amount of the compound of the present disclosure administered in a typical
treatment is preferably between about 10 mg/kg and about 1000 mg/kg of body weight for mice,
and between about 100 mg/kg and about 500 mg/kg of body weight, and more preferably
between 200 mg/kg and about 400 mg/kg of body weight for humans per daily dose. This total
amount is typically, but not necessarily, administered as a series of smaller doses over a period of
about one time per day to about three times per day for about 24 months, and preferably over a
period of twice per day for about 12 months.
        The size of the dose also will be determined by the route, timing and frequency of
administration as well as the existence, nature and extent of any adverse side effects that might
accompany the administration of the compound and the desired physiological effect. It will be
appreciated by one of skill in the art that various conditions or disease states, in particular
chronic conditions or disease states, may require prolonged treatment involving multiple
administrations.
