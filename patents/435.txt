        COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR QUANTIFYING A NUCLEIC ACID

                     CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 5         This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/621,975,
   filed April 9, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           Nucleic acid amplification technologies have provided a means of understanding
10 complex biological processes, detection, identification, and quantification of pathogenic and
   non-pathogenic organisms, forensic criminology analysis, disease association studies, and
   detection of events in genetically modified organisms, etc. The polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) is a common thermal cycling dependent nucleic acid amplification technology used to
   amplify DNA consisting of cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA
15 melting and enzymatic replication of the DNA using a DNA polymerase. Real-Time
   quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a technique used to quantify the number of copies of a given
   nucleic acid sequence in a biological sample. Currently, qPCR utilizes the detection of
   reaction products in real-time throughout the reaction and compares the amplification profile
   to the amplification of controls which contain a known quantity of nucleic acids at the
20 beginning of each reaction (or a known relative ratio of nucleic acids to the unknown tested
   nucleic acid). The results of the controls are used to construct standard curves, typically
   based on the logarithmic portion of the standard reaction amplification curves. These values
   are used to interpolate the quantity of the unknowns based on where their amplification
   curves compared to the standard control quantities.
25         In addition to PCR, non-thermal cycling dependent amplification systems or
   isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies exist including, without limitation:
   Nicking and Extension Amplification Reaction (NEAR), Rolling Circle Amplification
   (RCA), Helicase-Dependent Amplification (HDA), Loop-Mediated Amplification (LAMP),
   Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA), Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA),
30 Self-Sustained Sequence Replication (3SR), Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification
   (NASBA), Single Primer Isothermal Amplification (SPIA),       Q-0 Replicase    System, and
   Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA).

    WO 2013/155056                                                              PCT/US2013/035750
            NEAR amplification has similarities to PCR thermocycling. Like PCR, NEAR
   amplification employs oligonucleotide sequences which are complementary to a target
   sequences referred to as primers in PCR and templates in NEAR. In addition, NEAR
   amplification of target sequences results in a logarithmic increase in the target sequence, just
 5 as it does in standard PCR. Unlike standard PCR, the NEAR reaction progresses
   isothermally. In standard PCR, the temperature is increased to allow the two strands of DNA
   to separate. In a NEAR reaction, the target nucleic acid sequence is nicked at specific
   nicking sites present in a test sample. The polymerase infiltrates the nick site and begins
   complementary strand synthesis of the nicked target nucleotide sequence (the added
10 exogenous DNA) along with displacement of the existing complimentary DNA strand. The
   strand displacement replication process obviates the need for increased temperature. At this
   point, template/primer molecules anneal to the displaced complementary sequence from the
   added exogenous DNA. The polymerase now extends from the 3' end of the template,
   creating a complementary strand to the previously displaced strand. The second
15 template/primer oligonucleotide then anneals to the newly synthesized complementary strand
   and extends making a duplex of DNA which includes the nicking enzyme recognition
   sequence. This strand is then liable to be nicked with subsequent strand displacement
   extension by the polymerase, which leads to the production of a duplex of DNA which has
   nick sites on either side of the original target DNA. Once this is synthesized, the molecule
20 continues to be amplified exponentially through replication of the displaced strands with new
   template molecules. In addition, amplification also proceeds linearly from each product
   molecule through the repeated action of the nick translation synthesis at the template
   introduced nick sites. The result is a very rapid increase in target signal amplification; much
   more rapid than PCR thermocycling, with amplification results in less than ten minutes.
25          Quantification has been problematic, however. Optimal performance of a real-time
   NEAR system depends on the generation and amplification of a specific product. NEAR
   systems are known to generate significant levels of non-specific background products in
   addition to the specific product by the reaction enzymes. These background products can
   serve as amplifiable entities and their generation can out-compete the generation of specific
30 product. While it is possible to design detection probes specific to the desired target (and thus
   the specific product is detectable in a complex background), significant levels of non-specific
   background products sequester reaction components that may have otherwise been utilized
   for the amplification of the specific product. Thus, sequestration of reaction components due
                                                   2

    WO 2013/155056                                                               PCT/US2013/035750
   to non-specific background product generation results in a reaction that is suboptimal. This
   is particularly troublesome when the target nucleic acid is initially in very low abundance and
   where a highly optimized reaction is required for reliable detection of the target. Also, a
   suboptimal reaction may not represent true quantification of a target nucleic acid even though
 5 it is detectable. It would be advantageous to generate optimized NEAR reactions that
   eliminate the amplification of non-specific background products. Doing so would provide a
   reaction that is suitable for quantification either by a standard curve based system or relative
   quantification.
            Also, it is common practice to evaluate NEAR reactions using mass spectrometry.
10 High levels of background products can obscure the interpretation of mass spectrometry data.
   If, for instance, a reaction contains background products, one or more products derived from
   non-specific amplification (from related yet dissimilar targets), and the specific product, it
   would be challenging to identify these matrix-derived products from the background
   products. Elimination of background products leads to a clear determination of the
15 performance/specificity of the particular assay.
            Additionally, high levels of background products can impede the optimal
   amplification of intentionally-duplexed or multiplexed reactions. While multiple,
   differentially labeled detection probes are compatible with real-time detection, there still
   exists the problem of reactant limitations due to non-specific product formation. This is
20 particularly true for duplex or multiplex reactions in that these reactions contain more than
   two templates/primers that can potentially form complex populations of background
   products. A NEAR reaction system that eliminates the amplification of background products
   also provides conditions for the detection of intentionally duplexed or multiplexed reactions
   in real time. It would be highly advantageous to provide a means to eliminate amplifiable
25 background products thus maximizing the potential of generating specific products in NEAR
   reactions. It would be desirable if a quantitative result could be provided by accurately
   monitoring the progress of the reaction in real-time.

   generation of background products, allowing for the quantification of the sample target
   oligonucleotide. These methods are compatible with target oligonucleotides amplified using

             In one aspect, the invention provides an isolated oligonucleotide having, from 5' to 3',
10 a first region, and a second region, where the first region has a nicking enzyme recognition
   sequence; where the second region has at least 9 or more nucleotides (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

   that specifically bind a complementary sequence on a target nucleic acid molecule; and where
   the second region has one or more 2' modified nucleotides. In other embodiments, the

                                               Definitions
            In this disclosure, "comprises," "comprising," "containing" and "having" and the like
20 can have the meaning ascribed to them in U.S. Patent law and can mean " includes,"
   "including," and the like; "consisting essentially of" or "consists essentially" likewise has the
   meaning ascribed in U.S. Patent law and the term is open-ended, allowing for the presence of
   more than that which is recited so long as basic or novel characteristics of that which is
   recited is not changed by the presence of more than that which is recited, but excludes prior
25 art embodiments.
            By "polymerase-arresting molecule" is meant a moiety associated with a
   polynucleotide template/primer that prevents or significantly reduces the progression of a
   polymerase on the polynucleotide template. Preferably, the moiety is incorporated into the
   polynucleotide. In one preferred embodiment, the moiety prevents the polymerase from
30 progressing on the template.
            By "polymerase extension" is meant the forward progression of a polymerase from a
   accessible 3'-hydroxyl group that incorporates incoming monomers complementary to their
   opposing nucleotides on a template polynucleotide strand.

            By "exonuclease deficient polymerase" is meant a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase
   and/or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that is devoid of a 5'-3' exonuclease activity or that
   has virtually undetectable levels of such activity.
            By "nucleotide adduct" is meant a moiety that is bound covalently or otherwise fixed
 5 to a standard nucleotide base.
            As used herein, the term "detectable polynucleotide probe" refers to any, at least
   partially single stranded, polynucleotide labeled with a detectable moiety with a sequence
   region complementary to at least one strand of the target sequence, which releases a
   detectable signal from the detectable moiety upon binding to the target sequence, whereas
10 signal generation by that detectable moiety does depend on cleavage of the detectable
   polynucleotuide probe by a non-specific 5'-3' exonuclease activity. An example of a
   "detectable polynucleotide probe" as used herein is, but is not limited to, a fluorescent
   molecular beacon probe as described in prior art.
            As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleotides,
15 ribonucleotides, or modified nucleotides, and polymers thereof in single- or double-stranded
   form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified
   backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally
   occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are
   metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs
20 include, without limitation, 2' modified ribonucleotides (e.g., 2'-O-methyl ribonucleotides,
   2'-F nucleotides).
            As used herein, "modified nucleotide" refers to a nucleotide that has one or more
   modifications to the nucleoside, the nucleobase, pentose ring, or phosphate group. For
   example, modified nucleotides exclude ribonucleotides containing adenosine
25 monophosphate, guanosine monophosphate, uridine monophosphate, and cytidine
   monophosphate and deoxyribonucleotides containing deoxyadenosine monophosphate,
   deoxyguanosine monophosphate, deoxythymidine monophosphate, and deoxycytidine
   monophosphate. Modifications include those naturally occuring that result from modification
   by enzymes that modify nucleotides, such as methyltransferases.. Modified nucleotides also
30 include synthetic or non-naturally occurring nucleotides. Synthetic or non-naturally
   occurring modifications in nucleotides include those with 2' modifications, e.g., 2'-alkyl,
   such as 2'-O-methyl and 2'-methoxyethoxy, 2'-fluoro, 2'-hydroxyl (RNA), 2'-allyl, 2'-0-[2

            By "base substitution" is meant a substituent of a nucleobase polymer that does not
   cause significant disruption of the hybridization between complementary nucleotide strands.
 5          By "specific product" is meant a polynucleotide product resulting from the

   nicking and extension leading to amplification of a polynucleotide of interest.
10          By "substantially isothermal condition" is meant at a single temperature or within a
   narrow range of temperatures that does not vary significantly. In one embodiment, a reaction
   carried out under substantially isothermal conditions is carried out at a temperature that varies
   by only about 1-5' C (e.g., varying by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 degrees). In another embodiment, the
   reaction is carried out at a single temperature within the operating parameters of the
15 instrument utilized.
            By "nicking enzyme" is meant a polypeptide capable of recognizing and binding to a
   specific structure in double stranded nucleic acid molecules and breakinga phosphodiester
   bond between adjoining nucleotides on a single strand upon binding to its recognized specific
   structure, thereby creating a free 3'-hydroxyl group on the terminal nucleotide upstream of
20 the nick site that can be extended by a exonuclease deficient polymerase.
            By "nick site" is meant the position of a "broken" phosphodiester bond in one strand
   of a double stranded nucleic acid molecule hydrolyzed by a nicking enzyme.
            By "amplicon" is meant a polynucleotide or a multitude of polynucleotides generated
   during the amplification of a polynucleotide of interest. In one example, an amplicon is
25 generated during a polymerase chain reaction.
            By "semi-quantitative" is meant providing an estimate of relative quantity based on an
   internal control.

30          By "amplification rate modifiers" is meant an agent capable of affecting either the
   rate of polymerase extension or the rate of single strand nicking by the nicking enzyme, or
   both.

            By "monitoring a reaction" is meant detecting the progress of a reaction. In one
   embodiment, monitoring reaction progression involves detecting polymerase extension
   and/or detecting a complete NEAR reaction.
            "Detect" refers to identifying the presence, absence or amount of the analyte to be
 5 detected.
            By "detectable moiety" is meant a composition that when linked to a molecule of
   interest renders the latter detectable, via spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical,
   immunochemical, or chemical means. For example, useful labels include radioactive
   isotopes, magnetic beads, metallic beads, colloidal particles, fluorescent dyes, electron-dense
10 reagents, enzymes (for example, as commonly used in an ELISA), biotin, digoxigenin, or
   haptens.
            By "fragment" is meant a portion of a nucleic acid molecule. This portion contains,
   preferably, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the entire length
   of the reference nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide. A fragment may contain 5, 10, 15, 20,
15 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 nucleotides.
            "Hybridization" means hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or
   reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleobases. For example,
   adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases that pair through the formation of
   hydrogen bonds.
20          By "isolated polynucleotide" is meant a nucleic acid (e.g., a DNA) that is free of the
   genes which, in the naturally-occurring genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid
   molecule of the invention is derived, flank the gene. The term therefore includes, for
   example, a recombinant DNA that is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously
   replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote; or that
25 exists as a separate molecule (for example, a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment
   produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion) independent of other sequences. In
   addition, the term includes an RNA molecule that is transcribed from a DNA molecule, as
   well as a recombinant DNA that is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide
   sequence.
30          The terms "isolated," "purified," or "biologically pure" refer to material that is free to
   varying degrees from components which normally accompany it as found in its native state.
   "Isolate" denotes a degree of separation from original source or surroundings. "Purify"
   denotes a degree of separation that is higher than isolation. A "purified" or "biologically

   pure" protein is sufficiently free of other materials such that any impurities do not materially
   affect the biological properties of the protein or cause other adverse consequences. That is, a
   nucleic acid or peptide of this invention is purified if it is substantially free of cellular
   material, viral material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant DNA techniques,
 5 or chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. Purity and
   homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques, for example,
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. The term
   "purified" can denote that a nucleic acid or protein gives rise to essentially one band in an
   electrophoretic gel. For a protein that can be subjected to modifications, for example,
10 phosphorylation or glycosylation, different modifications may give rise to different isolated
   proteins, which can be separately purified.
            As used herein, "obtaining" as in "obtaining an agent" includes synthesizing,
   purchasing, or otherwise acquiring the agent.
            By "reference" is meant a standard or control condition. As is apparent to one skilled
15 in the art, an appropriate reference is where an element is changed in order to determine the
   effect of the element.
            By "hybridize" is meant pair to form a double-stranded molecule between
   complementary polynucleotide sequences (e.g., a gene described herein), or portions thereof,
   under various conditions of stringency. (See, e.g., Wahl, G. M. and S. L. Berger (1987)

   mammal, such as a bovine, equine, canine, ovine, or feline.
            By "target nucleic acid molecule" is meant a polynucleotide to be analyzed. Such
   polynucleotide may be a sense or antisense strand of the target sequence. The term "target
25 nucleic acid molecule" also refers to amplicons of the original target sequence.

20 michiganensis sepidonicus (Cms) target DNA. Exemplary results from the titration of Cms
   synthetic "long-mer" target and detection via a fluorobeacon are shown. NEAR assay for
   Cms performed without input target nucleic acid is indicated as No Target Control (NTC).
   Figure 2A is a graph showing that the signal in the No Target Controls (NTC' s) was
   suppressed in the 2'-0-methyl modified primer/template-containing reactions. Figure 2B is a

   showing the elimination of non-specific amplification products in No Target Controls (NTC)
   of the Cms assay system using 2'-0-methyl modified primers/templates (right panel), as
   compared to unmodified primers/templates (left panel). To determine the effect of the 2'-0
30 methyl modified primers/templates on the generation of background products, samples (10
   pl) of No Target Control reactions depicted in Figure 2A were analyzed via HPLC/Mass
   Spectrometry. Mass spectra data clearly demonstrate in the presence of 2'-0-methyl
   modified primers/templates the presence of only the expected molecular species was detected

   suppressed.
            Figure 5 depicts exemplary polymerase arresting entities using 2'-O-methyl modified
   primers/templates or ratios of 2'-O-methyl modified primers/templates can be used to
20 manipulate both the time-to-detection and the efficiency of the reaction, thus 'tuning' the
   reactions. Schematic representations of exemplary 2'-0-methyl modified templates/primers
   for the tuning of a specific reaction are shown, including a primer/template having a block of
   five 2'-0-methyl nucleotides at the 3' end ("Terminal" template; left) and a primer/template
   having a block of five 2'-0-methyl nucleotides starting at the 3d nucleotide after the nick site
25 ("Nick +2" template"; right). Each tuning condition comprises specific ratios of forward and
   reverse templates with each set of templates having varying structures.

   modification of templates/primers for the 'tuning' of a specific reaction. Exemplary
   amplification data using 2'-0-methyl modified primers/templates are shown. All of the
30 reactions (in duplicate) contained 10,000 genome equivalents of Cms DNA. Each tuning
   condition represents specific ratios of forward and reverse templates with each set of
   templates having varying structures. The red circles demonstrate a shift in the time-to

   contracted and the slope of the curve was shifted.
            Figures 7 depicts the design of two primer/template sets (TS3 & TS6) used in a
   NEAR assay to amplify a fragment of the corn ADHi gene. The target specific region in the
 5 sequences of TS3 & TS6 primer/template sets are significantly longer (15 - 17 bases) than in
   primer/template sets of typical NEAR assays (9 to 12 bases) in the prior art. In the TS3
   primer/template set the block of 5 consecutive 2'-O-methyl modified nucleotides adjacent to
   the 3'-terminus is preceded by an upstream region of 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotides
   alternating with unmodified nucleotides starting with a 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotide 5 or
10 4 nucleotides downstream from the nick site, respectively. In contrast to TS3, there are only
   five 2'-O-methyl modified nucleotides in each of the primers/templates of the TS6 set, which
   form a block of consecutive nucleotides adjacent to the unmodified 3'-terminal nucleotide.
            Figure 8 shows amplification plots of the ADHi assay using two sets of
   primers/templates (TS3 & TS6) recorded in the SYBRGreen dye detection channel.

   ROX channel.
            Figure 10 depicts the amplification plots of the NTC ADHi assay reactions recorded .
   Comparing the results shown in figure 8 and 9 it becomes evident that only the
   primer/template set TS3 produces the ADH 1-specific amplicon, while the signal generated by
20 set TS6 is mostly based on non-specific amplification of background products detected only
   by SYBRgreen.
                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
25          The invention features compositions and methods that are useful for the quantification
   of a target nucleic acid molecule in an isothermal reaction. In particular embodiments, the
   invention provides compositions and methods for the quantification of a target nucleic acid
   molecule in a NEAR reaction (e.g., in real time).
            The invention is based, at least in part, on the surprising discovery that primer
30 template oligonucleotides comprising a 2' modified (e.g., 2'-0-methyl, 2'-Fluoro) nucleotide
   reduces or eliminates illegitimate amplification by 5'-3'exonuclease deficient derivatives of
   Bst DNA polymerase I.

    WO 2013/155056                                                                 PCT/US2013/035750
   NEAR Reaction.
            The NEAR reaction has been used as an endpoint reaction that provides for the non
   quantitative detection of target oligonucleotides. The conventional NEAR assay comprises
 5 (1) a target nucleic acid molecule; (2) two oligonucleotide molecules that are analagous to the
   primer molecules of PCR; termed "template-primers" comprising some number of
   oligonucleotides that are complementary to the target nucleic acid molecule and a site that
   can be cleaved by a nicking enzyme; (3) dNTPs; (4) a strand displacing, 5'-3'-exonuclease
   deficient polymerase; and (5) a nicking enzyme. Current methods for quantifying the NEAR
10 reaction, particularly in real time, are inadequate due in part to the illegitimate amplification
   of non-target molecules present in a sample that can obscure detection of target sequences in
   a conventional NEAR reaction. For example, there is a consistent undesirable amplification
   in NEAR reactions that results in a detectable signal in the absence of a target molecule or
   with signals that do not accurately reflect the amount of target nucleic acid molecule present
15 in the reaction. Although this provides for detection of an endpoint product, it fails to
   provide for real time monitoring of the reaction.
            The present invention provides modified primer/template oligonucleotides that
   overcome the problem of accurately quantitating a target nucleic acid molecule in a NEAR
   reaction. It is particularly useful for quantitating a target nucleic acid molecule in a NEAR
20 reaction in real time. The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that primer
   template oligonucleotides comprising a 2' modified (e.g., 2'-O-methyl, 2'-Fluoro) reduces or
   eliminates illegitimate amplification without preventing the extension of those modified
   primer-templates in order to amplify the specific product. The primer/template
   oligonucleotides of the invention are useful in NEAR reactions comprising one or more of the
25 aforementioned NEAR components.
            In other embodiments, the invention provides for primer-template oligonucleotides
   comprising a 2' modified (e.g., 2'-O-methyl, 2'-Fluoro) that is positioned at or adjacent to the
   3' terminus of the primer-template. Surprisingly, 2'-0-methyl nucleotides positioned in the
   3'-terminal region of a primer-template not only do comprise effective priming substrates for
30 5'-3'-exonuclease deficient derivatives of Bst DNA polymerase I in isothermal DNA
   amplification reactions, but use of such modified primer-templates completely suppresses
   nonspecific primer-dimer amplification. This is particularly surprising because conventional
   thinking in the field of isothermal DNA amplification teaches that modified nucleotides (e.g.,
                                                  16

    WO 2013/155056                                                              PCT/US2013/035750
   2'-O-methyl ribonucleotides, unmodified ribonucleotides) could only be introduced at the 5'
   terminal region of the primer/template away the 3'-terminus, because placement of 2'-0
   methoyl - as well as ribonucleotides within 6 nuleotides from the 3'-terminus of a primer
   had been demonstrated to inhibit primer extension by DNA polymerases(include as
 5 references the paptent application from Amersham and the patent from Qiagen).
   5'-3' exonuclease deficient derivatives of Bst DNA polymerase I used in NEAR and other
   isothermal amplification technologies (LAMP) belongs to polA-type bacterial DNA
   polymerases involved in low synthesis fidelity DNA repair processes. In contrast, high
   fidelity genome replication in bacteria is catalyzed by DNAE- & POLC type DNA
10 polymerase III holoenzymes, which utilize exclusively RNA primers to initiate DNA
   replication.   In the published prior art the discrimination between RNA and DNA primers
   was thought to be one mechanism for preventing the interference of high error rate DNA
   polymerase I enzymes with high fidelity genome replication. In this context the surprising
   discovery that derivatives of Bst DNA polymerase I can efficiently utilize 2'-modified
15 ribonucleotides as primers for DNA synthesis is remarkable and counterintuitive.
   Primer-Template Design
            Exemplary polymerase-arresting entity structures from 5' to 3' comprise a stabilizer
20 sequence, nicking enzyme recognition sequence, nicking enzyme spacer sequence, and target
   specific recognition sequence, the target specific recognition sequence comprising one or
   more 2' modified nucleotides (e.g., 2'-O-methyl, 2'-methoxyethoxy, 2'-fluoro, 2'-allyl, 2'-0
   [2-(methylamino)-2-oxoethyl], 2'-hydroxyl (RNA), 4'-thio, 4'-CH 2-0-2'-bridge, 4'-(CH 2) 2-0
   2-bridge, 2'-LNA, and 2'-O-(N-methylcarbamate)).       Without being bound to theory, it is
25 hypothesized that incorporating one or more 2' modified nucleotides in the recognition
   regions renders those modified regions unsuitable to serve as template for polymerase
   extension in nonspecific intermolecular and/or intramolecular complexes formed by
   interactions of primers/templates (e.g., primer-dimer formation), and, thereby, reduces or
   eliminates the background signal in isothermal amplification. The 2' modified nucleotide
30 preferably has a base that base pairs with the target sequence. In particular embodiments,
   two or more 2' modified nucleotides (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5 or more 2' modified nucleotides) in the
   target specific recognition region are contiguous (e.g., a block of modified nucleotides). In
   some embodiments, the block of 2' modified nucleotides is positioned at the 3' end of the
                                                  17

    WO 2013/155056                                                                  PCT/US2013/035750
   target specific recognition region. In other embodiments, the block of 2' modified
   nucleotides is positioned at the 5' end of the target specific recognition region. When the
   block of 2' modified nucleotides is positioned at the 5' end of the target specific recognition
   region, the 2' modified nucleotides may be separated from the nick site by one or more non
 5 modified nucleotides (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5 or more 2' unmodified nucleotides). Applicants have
   found that positioning of one or more 2' modified nucleotides or of a block of 2' modified
   nucleotides alters the kinetics of amplification. When the one or more 2' modified
   nucleotides or block of 2' modified nucleotides are positioned at or near the 5' end of the
   recognition region or proximal to the nick site, real-time amplification reactions showed
10 decreased time to detection. Additionally, the signal curve was contracted and the slope of
   the curve shifted. The applicants have alsofound that in recognition regions exceeding 12
   nucleotides in length a single block of 5 consecutive 2'-modified nucleotide is not sufficient
   to suppress nonspecific amplification and therefore the entire recognition region up to 4 or 5
   nucleotides downstream from the nick site must be substituted by 2'-modified nucleotides
15 alternating with unmodified nucleotides.
           In a related embodiment, ratios of a primer/template oligo having one or more 2'
   modified nucleotides can be used to alter the time-to-detection and/or the efficiency of the
   reaction for the 'tuning' of reactions, resulting in a predictable control over amplification
   kinetics. Increasing the ratio of primer/template oligo having one or more 2' modified
20 nucleotides at the 3' -end of the recognition sequence to primer/template oligo having one or
   more 2' modified nucleotides at the 5' end of the recognition sequence contracted the signal
   curve and shifted the slope of the curve. It is advantageous to be able to "tune" a reaction
   providing a means to manipulate both the time-to-detection as well as the efficiency of the
   reaction. Relative quantification using an internal control requires that two important
25 conditions be met. First, it is beneficial to be able to modify a reaction's time-to-detection
   creating a non-competitive reaction condition. Thus, by affecting the control reaction to be
   detectable at a later time-point (relative to the target of interest) the control reaction does not
   out-compete the specific target of interest even when the target of interest is in low initial
   abundance. Second, to ensure a true relative abundance calculation, it is required that the
30 control and specific target reactions have matched efficiencies. By controlling the efficiency
   of each reaction using a "tuning" condition enables reactions to be matched allowing for
   satisfactory relative quantification calculations. Tuning the reactions can be used to match
   efficiencies of target nucleic acid amplification and reference nucleic amplification (e.g.,

    WO 2013/155056                                                               PCT/US2013/035750
   internal standard) in quantitative PCR (qPCR). Additionally, amplification curves of the
   target nucleic acid and the internal standard may be altered so time of detection of their
   amplification products are separated, while providing the same efficiency for target nucleic
   acid amplification and internal standard amplification. Through the use of specific
 5 combinations and ratios of oligonucleotide structures within a reaction it is possible to create
   conditions which enable tuned reaction performance.
             In various embodiments, primer/template pairs are constructed with a stem and loop
   configuration. The 5' end of the primer/template oligonucleotide comprises a self
   complementary region that forms at least part of the stem. In some embodiments of the
10 invention the stem further encompasses at least a portion or all of the nicking enzyme
   recognition sequence. In other various embodiments of the invention the nicking enzyme
   recognition sequence in the primers-templates is not part of the double stranded stem
   structure, but resides within the mostly single stranded loop. This nicking enzyme recognition
   site is linked at the 3' end to a secondary-structure-free site comprising a nicking site that is
15 linked at the 3' end to a sequence that is complementary to a target sequence. If desired, the
   sequence that is complementary to the target sequence may comprise a secondary structure or
   may be free of secondary structure. The presence of absence or secondary structure, which
   may comprise a self-complementary region, will be determined to optimize the particular
   NEAR assay.
20           In one embodiment, the methods of the invention provide a NEAR reaction that
   comprises the standard NEAR components, but also comprises an enzyme capable of nicking
   a RNA nucleotide when present in a heteroduplex with a complementary DNA strand. In one
   example, the cleaved RNA nucleotide will be present in a string of 4-15 non-cleavable RNA
   nucleotides (i.e. O-2-Me-RNAs) toward the 5' end of the target complementary region of the
25 PTO, and the 3' end of the template oligonucleotide will have a 3' terminal 'cap'. Only upon
   complete proper hybridization of the template oligonucleotide, with the heteroduplex
   cleaving molecule (i.e. RNase H) will be able to cleave the RNA base, creating a 3' end for
   the nick translation enzyme to extend from; and allowing the NEAR reaction to progress to
   completion. Aberrant template binding (primer dimers, partial non-target hybridization, etc)
30 will not lead to the RNA-DNA heteroduplex to form; and thus prevent the progression of the
   NEAR reaction. These templates will only be amplified after binding to a complementary
   nucleotide sequence through the removal of the 3' polymerase extension 'cap'. This will lead
   to an increased level of specificity and sensitivity of the NEAR reaction.

            The template oligonucleotides of the invention are included in a NEAR reaction that
   comprises (1) a target nucleic acid molecule; (2) two template oligonucleotide molecules
   comprising some number of oligonucleotides that are complementary to the target nucleic
   acid molecule and a site that can be cleaved by a nicking enzyme and comprised of 4-15
 5 RNA nucleotides, one of which is RNase liable; (3) dNTPs; (4) a strand displacing
   polymerase; (5) a nicking enzyme; and (6) a DNA-RNA heteroduplex RNA nicking enzyme
   and a 3' terminal polymerase extension cap. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of
   using these components to quantitate a target nucleic acid molecule.
            The method involves contacting a target nucleic acid molecule under substantially
10 isothermal conditions with a polymerase, two template oligonucleotides, each of which
   specifically binds to a complementary sequence on the target nucleotide molecule, a nicking
   enzyme, and a DNA-RNA heteroduplex nicking enzyme (e.g. RNase H) with a 3' terminal
   polymerase extension cap; generating a detectable amplicon that comprises at least a portion
   of a template oligonucleotide that binds a target sequence.

            Methods and compositions of the invention are useful for the identification of a target
   nucleic acid molecule in a test sample. The target sequences is amplified from virtually any
20 samples that comprises a target nucleic acid molecule, including but not limited to samples
   comprising fungi, spores, viruses, or cells (e.g., prokaryotes, eukaryotes). In specific
   embodiments, compositions and methods of the invention detect Clavibactermichiganensis

   been grown), environmental samples, agricultural products or other foodstuffs, and their
30 extracts, DNA identification tags. If desired, the sample is purified prior to inclusion in a
   NEAR reaction using any standard method typically used for isolating a nucleic acid
   molecule from a biological sample.

    WO 2013/155056                                                                PCT/US2013/035750
            In one embodiment, primer/template oligonucleotides amplify a target nucleic acid of
   a pathogen to detect the presence of a pathogen in a sample. Exemplary pathogens include
   fungi, bacteria, viruses and yeast. Such pathogens may be detected by identifying a nucleic
   acid molecule encoding a pathogen protein, such as a toxin, in a test sample. Exemplary
 5 toxins include, but are not limited to aflatoxin, cholera toxin, diphtheria toxin, Salmonella
   toxin, Shiga toxin, Clostridium botulinum toxin, endotoxin, and mycotoxin. For
   environmental applications, test samples may include water, liquid extracts of air filters, soil
   samples, building materials (e.g., drywall, ceiling tiles, wall board, fabrics, wall paper, and
   floor coverings), environmental swabs, or any other sample.
10          In one embodiment disclosed herein, primer/template oligonucleotides amplify a
   target nucleic acid of plant used as an internal control in molecular breeding experiments
   geared towards improving, for example, the plant's resistance to drought, the plant's
   resistance to herbicides, to predation by harmful insects. One example of such an internal
   control target nucleic reduced to praxis herein is the ADHI gene (alcoholdehydrogenase 1)
15 from corn.
            Target nucleic acid molecules include double-stranded and single-stranded nucleic
   acid molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, and other nucleobase polymers known in the art capable of
   hybridizing with a nucleic acid molecule described herein). RNA molecules suitable for
   detection with a detectable oligonucleotide probe or detectable primer/template
20 oligonucleotide of the invention include, but are not limited to, double-stranded and single
   stranded RNA molecules that comprise a target sequence (e.g., messenger RNA, viral RNA,
   ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, microRNA and microRNA precursors, and siRNAs or other
   RNAs described herein or known in the art). DNA molecules suitable for detection with a
   detectable oligonucleotide probe or primer/template oligonucleotide of the invention include,
25 but are not limited to, double stranded DNA (e.g., genomic DNA, plasmid DNA,
   mitochondrial DNA, viral DNA, and synthetic double stranded DNA). Single-stranded DNA
   target nucleic acid molecules include, for example, viral DNA, cDNA, and synthetic single
   stranded DNA, or other types of DNA known in the art.
            In general, a target sequence for detection is between 10 and 100 nucleotides in length
30 (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 nucleotides. The GC content of
   the target nucleic acid molecule is selected to be less than about 45, 50, 55, or 60%.
   Desirably, the target sequence and nicking enzymes are selected such that the target sequence
                                                  21

   does not contain nicking sites for any nicking enzymes that will be included in the reaction
   mix.
   Detectable Oligonucleotide Probes
 5          The present invention provides for the quantitative detection of target nucleic acid
   molecules or amplicons thereof in a NEAR reaction using non-amplifiable detectable
   polynucleotide probescomprising at least one polymerase-arresting molecule (e.g., nucleotide
   modification or other moiety that renders the oligonucleotide capable of binding a target
   nucleic acid molecule, but incapable of supporting template extension utilizing the detectable
10 oligonucleotide probe as a target). Without wishing to be bound by theory, the presence of
   one or more moieties which does not allow polymerase progression likely causes polymerase
   arrest in non-nucleic acid backbone additions to the oligonucleotide or through stalling of a
   replicative polymerase (i.e. C3-spacer, damaged DNA bases, other spacer moiety, 0-2-Me
   bases). These constructs thus prevent or reduce illegitimate amplification of the probe during
15 the course of a NEAR reaction. This distinguishes them from conventional detection probes,
   which must be added at the end of the NEAR reaction to prevent their amplification.
            Conventional detection probes have proven impractical for quantitating a NEAR
   reaction in real time. If conventional detection probes are incorporated into the NEAR
   reaction, these conventional detection probes are amplified concurrently with the target. The
20 amplification of these detection molecules masks the detection of legitimate target amplicons
   due to the number of starting molecules of the detection detection probe at the start of the
   reaction.
            The invention provides non-amplifiable detectable polynucleotide probe that comprise
   least one polymerase-arresting molecule. A polymerase-arresting molecule of the invention
25 includes, but is not limited to, a nucleotide modification or other moiety that blocks primer
   template extension by replicative DNA polymerases, thereby preventing the amplification of
   detection molecules; but can allow proper hybridization or nucleotide spacing to the target
   molecule or amplified copies of the target molecule. In one embodiment, a detectable
   oligonucleotide probe of the invention comprises a 3 carbon spacer (C3-spacer) that prevents
30 or reduces the illegitimate amplification of a detection molecule.
            In one embodiment, the detectable oligonucleotide probe of the invention is a hair-pin
   shaped oligonucleotide comprising a detectable moiety. In another embodiment, the non
   amplifiable detectable polynucleotide probe is a hair-pin shaped oligonucleotide that
                                                 22

    WO 2013/155056                                                              PCT/US2013/035750
   comprises a fluorophore on one end and a quenching dye on the opposite end. The loop of
   the hair-pin comprises a sequence that is complementary to and capable of hybridizing with a
   target sequence. The stem of the hair-pin is formed by annealing of complementary arm
   sequences located on either side of the loop. A fluorophore and a quenching molecule are
 5 covalently linked at opposite ends of each arm. When the detectable oligonucleotide probe is
   in the hair pin configuration, the fluorescent and quenching molecules are proximal to one
   another, thereby leading to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and quenching of
   the fluorescence of the fluorophore. When the detectable oligonucleotide probe encounters a
   target molecule, hybridization occurs; the loop structure is converted to a duplex
10 conformation with the target molecule, causing separation of the fluorophore and quencher
   molecules resulting in fluorescence (Tyagi et al. Nature Biotechnology 14: March 1996, 303
   308).
           The detectable oligonucleotide probes are specific to the target sequence. In one
   embodiment, a detectable oligonucleotide probe comprises one or more modified nucleotide
15 bases having enhanced binding affinity to a complementary nucleotide. Examples of bases
   include, but are not limited to locked nucleic acids (LNA), 2' Fluoro amidites, and 2'OMe
   RNA amidites (also functioning as a polymerase arresting molecule). Detectable
   oligonucleotide probes of the invention can be synthesized with different colored
   fluorophores and may be designed to hybridize with virtually any target sequence. In view of
20 their remarkable specificity, a non-amplifiable detectable polynucleotide probe of the
   invention is used to detect a single target nucleic acid molecule in a sample, or is used in
   combination with detectable oligonucleotide probes each of which binds a different target
   nucleic acid molecule. Accordingly, the non-amplifiable detectable polynucleotide probes of
   the invention may be used to detect one or more target nucleic acid molecules in the same
25 reaction, allowing these targets to be quantitated simultaneously. The present invention
   encompasses the use of such fluorophores in conjunction with the detectable oligonucleotide
   probes described herein.
   Use of Non-Amplifiable Detectable Polynucleotide Probes
30         Non-amplifiable detectable polynucleotide probe are useful in methods for
   quantitating a target nucleic acid molecule in a nicking and extension amplification reaction
   (NEAR). The method involves contacting a target nucleic acid molecule under substantially
   isothermal conditions with a polymerase, two primer/template oligonucleotides, each of
                                                 23

    WO 2013/155056                                                               PCT/US2013/035750
   which specifically binds to a complementary sequence on the target nucleotide molecule, a
   nicking enzyme, and the detectable oligonucleotide probe in the presence of a suitable buffer
   and dNTPs, generating amplicons comprising at least a portion of said target nucleic acid
   molecule; and determining the level of target nucleic acid molecule present in the reaction by
 5 quantitating the oligonucleotide probe that hybridizes to the target nucleic acid molecule in
   real time during the reaction based on fluorescent intensity from the probe molecules in the
   reaction. Advantageously, such methods are useful for monitoring NEAR in real time.
            In general, non-amplifiable detectable polynucleotide probes of the invention are
   included in a NEAR reaction that comprises (1) a target nucleic acid molecule; (2) two
10 template oligonucleotide molecules comprising some number of oligonucleotides that are
   complementary to the target nucleic acid molecule and a site that can be cleaved by a nicking
   enzyme; (3) dNTPs; (4) a strand displacing polymerase; and (5) a nicking enzyme.
   Accordingly, the invention provides a method of using these components to quantitate a
   target nucleic acid molecule.

   NEAR Assays
            The invention provides for the detection of target nucleic acid molecules amplified in
   a NEAR assay. Such assays are known in the art and described herein. See, for example, US
   Patent Application Publication 2009/0081670, PCT Application 2009/012246, and US Patent
20 Nos. 7,112,423 and 7,282,328, each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
   Polymerases useful in the methods described herein are capable of catalyzing the
   incorporation of nucleotides to extend a 3' hydroxyl terminus of an oligonucleotide (e.g., a
   primer/template oligonucleotide or other primer) bound to a target nucleic acid molecule.
   Such polymerases include those that are thermophilic and/or those capable of strand
25 displacement. Polymerases useful in methods described herein lack a 5'-3' exonuclease
   activity, which would otherwise degrade the displaced single stranded nucleic acid strand.
   olymerase also has reverse transcriptase activity (e.g., derivatives of Bst (large fragment)
   DNA polymerase, Therminator DNA polymerase, Therminator II DNA polymerase).
   Exemplary polymerases include, but are not limited to the Bst large fragments of Bst DNA
30 polymerase I, E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), Klenow fragment (3-5' exo-),
   T4 DNA polymerase, T7 DNA polymerase, Deep VentR. (exo-) DNA Polymerase, Deep
   VentR DNA Polymerase, , Therminator, Therminator II DNA Polymerase, AmpliTherm DNA
   Polymerase, SP6 DNA polymerase,. The following non-limiting examples of Reverse

    WO 2013/155056                                                              PCT/US2013/035750
   Transcriptases (RT) can be used in the reactions of the present method to improve
   performance when detecting an RNA sequence: OmniScript (Qiagen), SensiScript (Qiagen),
   MonsterScript (Epicentre), Transcriptor (Roche), HIV RT (Ambion), SuperScript III
   (Invitrogen), ThermoScript (Invitrogen), Thermo-X (Invitrogen), ImProm II (Promega).
 5          A nicking enzyme binds to a recognition sequence in double-stranded DNA and
   cleaves one strand of a double-stranded helix. Nicking enzymes may cleave either upstream
   or downstream of their recognition site or within the enzyme's recognition site. For methods
   disclosed herein, only nicking enzymes that cleave the top strand downstream of the
   recognition site can be used to launch repetitive cycles of substrate DNA nicking and nick
10 extension by the polymerase to drive exponential amplification of the target nucleic fragment
   between the primer-templates. Ideally, the nicking enzyme is functional under the same
   reaction conditions as the polymerase. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
   nicking enzyme is thermostable and active between 50'C and 60'C. Exemplary nicking
   enzymes useful for methods disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, Nt.BspQI(NEB),
15 Nt.BspD6I, Nt.BsmAI(NEB), , Nt.AlwI(NEB), Nt.BbvCI(NEB), N.Bst9I(Sibenzyme), and
   Nt.BstNBI(NEB),,.
            A NEAR reaction typically comprises nucleotides, such as, for example,
   dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). The reaction may also be carried out in the
   presence of dNTPs that comprise a detectable moiety including but not limited to a radiolabel
20 (e.g., 2p   ,   125, 3 S) an enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase), a fluorescent label (e.g.,
   fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)), biotin, avidin, digoxigenin, antigens, haptens, or
   fluorochromes. The NEAR reaction further comprises certain salts and buffers that provide
   for the activity of the nicking enzyme and polymerase.
            Advantageously, the NEAR reaction is carried out under substantially isothermal
25 conditions where the temperature of the reaction is more or less constant during the course of
   the amplification reaction. Because the temperature does not need to be cycled between an
   upper temperature and a lower temperature, the NEAR reaction can be carried out under
   conditions where it would be difficult to carry out conventional PCR. Typically, the reaction
   is carried out at about between 35 'C and 90 'C (e.g., 35, 37, 42, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, or 85 C).
30 Advantageously, it is not essential that the temperature be maintained with a great degree of
   precision. Some variability in temperature is acceptable.
            Melt temperature (Tm) and reaction rate modifiers may also be used to lower the
   melting temperature of the oligonucleotides, such as (but not limited to) ethylene glycol and
                                                 25

    WO 2013/155056                                                               PCT/US2013/035750
   glycerol. In addition, DNA polymerase reaction rate modifiers (such as dNTP and
   magnesium concentration) may be used to alter the reaction rate to lead to a greater
   quantification precision.
            This invention provides methods of monitoring a NEAR reaction in real time,
 5 utilizing NEAR amplification strategy as described above and in patents US007112423B2
   and US20090017452A1.         In one embodiment, quantitative NEAR utilizes target nucleic acids
   amplification alongside a control amplification of known quantity. The amount of target
   nucleic acid can be calculated as an absolute quantification or a relative quantification (semi
   quantitative) based on the source of the control (exogenous or endogenous control).
10          Quantitation of the unknown nucleotide sequence can be achieved either through
   comparison of logarithmic threshold amplification of the unknown to a series of known target
   sequences in either a separate set of reactions or in the same reaction ; or as an internal
   endogenous or exogenous co-amplification product which produces a threshold value,
   indicative of either a positive result (if the unknown exceeds the threshold) or negative result
15 (if the unknown does not exceed the threshold).
   Applications
            The present invention provides for the real-time monitoring of the isothermal
   amplification NEAR reaction which can provide a quantitative measure of the amount of the
20 starting target nucleic acid. Compositions and methods of the invention are useful in human
   diagnostics, where a rapid quantitative answer is desired (e.g., detectable amplification in
   under 15, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 min. or less). In particular embodiments, the invention provides for
   the use of NEAR reaction assays in human diagnostics in clinical settings. In other
   embodiments, the invention provides for the use of NEAR reaction assays in diagnostic field
25 work, where access to thermocycling equipment is unavailable or would be prohibitively
   expensive. In still other embodiments, the invention provides for the use of NEAR reaction
   assays in an academic setting where rapid quantitative answers are desired.
   Kits
30          The invention also provides kits for the amplification of a target nucleic acid
   molecule. Such kits are useful for the detection or quantitation of a target nucleic acid in a
   biological sample obtained from a subject. Kits of the present invention may comprise, for
   example, one or more polymerases, forward and reverse primer-templates, and one or more

   nicking enzymes, as described herein. Where one target is to be amplified, one or two
   nicking enzymes may be included in the kit. Where multiple target sequences are to be
   amplified, and the primer-templates designed for those target sequences comprise the nicking
   enzyme sites for the same nicking enzyme, then one or two nicking enzymes may be

   sufficient for amplification). In various embodiments, the primary primer-templateand
   secondary primer-template, each have a 3'-end specific recognition region sequence
   complementary or substantially complementary to the target sequence, where the end specific
   recognition region comprises one or more 2' modified nucleotides; a 5'-end tail sequence
15 containing a nicking enzyme recognition site upstream of the 3'-end specific recognition
   region sequences; and a stabilizing sequence upstream (5') of the nicking enzyme binding
   site.
            In one aspect, the kits of the present invention comprise a homogenous mix of all
   NEAR reaction components, including, but not limited to, dNTP's, forward and reverse
20 primer-templates, nicking enzyme, polymerase, a detectable target specific polynucleotide
   probe, reaction buffer and stabilizers, except the target nucleic acid.
            The kits of the present invention may also comprise one or more of the components in
   any number of separate containers, packets, tubes (e.g., <0.2 ml, 0.2 ml, 0.6 ml, 1.5 ml, 5.0

25 well), ArrayTape, and the like, or the components may be combined in various combinations
   in such containers. In various embodiments, the kit further comprises a pair of primer
   template oligonucleotides capable of binding to and amplifying a reference sequence. In yet
   other embodiments, the kit comprises a sterile container which contains the primer-template
   oligonucleotides; such containers can be boxes, ampules, bottles, vials, tubes, bags, pouches,
30 blister-packs, or other suitable container form known in the art. Such containers can be made
   of plastic, glass, laminated paper, metal foil, or other materials suitable for holding nucleic
   acids.

                                               EXAMPLES
            Currently, the NEAR reaction is used to quickly and isothermally detect the presence
   or absence of a target oligonucleotide in a sample. Due to technical limitations, conventional
15 NEAR methods are unsuitable for quantifying target oligonucleotides in real time due, at
   least in part, to illegitimate amplification of non-target molecules in the sample, which
   obscures the detection and accurate quantification of target amplicons. The present invention
   provides compositions and methods that overcome these limitations by providing detectable
   primer/templates that are not susceptible to illegitimate amplification. In one embodiment, a
20 quantifiable NEAR assay employs a primer comprising one or more 2'-0-Me modifications
   that prevents or reduces the illegitimate amplification of non-target molecules during the
   NEAR reaction. Currently, the design of NEAR amplification assays is limited to very short
   regions within the target nucleic acid that have at least one naturally occurring nicking
   enzyme recognition site in close proximity. Strand displacement synthesis initiated from this
25 nick site provides single stranded target DNA molecules to which primer-templates with
   short target specific regions can bind and start the cycles of nicking/polymerase extension
   target amplification reactions. The present invention provides compositions and methods that
   overcome this limitation by utilizing primer-templates with longer target specific regions,
   which therefore are capable of strand invasion between 50'C to 60'C during the first phase of
30 the amplification reaction without the assistance of strand displacement synthesis. Longer
   target specific regions in primer-templates come with the disadvantage of providing more real
   estate to form nonspecific DNA hybrids with extendable 3'-ends that can launch synthesis of
   nonspecific amplification products. Compositions in the present invention mitigate that
                                                  29

    WO 2013/155056                                                             PCT/US2013/035750
   disadvantage by extending the placement of 2'-modified nucleotides beyond a 3'-terminal
   block of five consecutive modified nucleotides to cover the entire target specific region
   utilizing an alternate sequence of 2'-modified and unmodified nucleotides.
 5 Example 1: Primer-template oligonucleotides comprising 2'--O-methyl nucleotides
   reduce or eliminate background signal in NEAR amplification.
            When NEAR amplification is performed without input target nucleic acid (i.e., No
   Target Controls; NTC's) signal is generated despite the absence of template. Thus,
   generation of background signal has the potential to decrease the accuracy of target nucleic
10 acid quantitation using NEAR amplification. It was hypothesized that the background signal
   was generated, in part, by formation of primer-dimers by primer/template oligonucleotides.
   Without being bound to theory, polymerase arresting structures comprising 2' modified
   nucleotides could by used to reduce or eliminate intermolecular and/or intramolecular
   interactions of primers/templates (e.g., primer-dimer formation), and, thereby, reduce or
15 eliminate the background signal in NEAR assay.
            Exemplary polymerase-arresting entity structures from 5' to 3' comprise a stabilizer
   sequence, nicking enzyme recognition sequence, nicking enzyme spacer sequence, and target
   specific recognition sequence, the target specific recognition sequence comprising one or
   more 2' modified nucleotides (e.g., 2'-O-methyl ribonucleotides). Where two or more 2'
20 modified nucleotides are present in the target specific recognition sequence the 2' modified
   nucleotides may be contiguous (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5 or more 2' modified nucleotides).    Titration of
   Clavibactermichiganensissepidonicus (Cms) synthetic double stranded target DNA
   molecule was evaluated using detection via a fluorobeacon. Target DNA was serially diluted
   from a stock solution of a synthesized 250 basepair DNA 'longmer' which was designed with
25 the target sequence and a single nick site.
            The signal in the No Target Controls (NTC's) was suppressed in the 2'-O-methyl
   modified template-containing reactions (Figure 2A). The Standard Curve displayed a wide
   dynamic range using the 2'-O-methyl template reactions (Figure 2B). Samples (10 pl) of the
   No Target Control reactions were analyzed via HPLC/Mass Spectrometry and confirmed
30 suppression of background amplification products (Figure 2C). The spectra derived from
   reactions using unmodified oligos showed a complex spectrum composed of multiple
   amplification products derived from non-specific background products along with unreacted
   templates (Figure 2C, left panel). The spectra derived from reactions using 2'-O-methyl
                                                30

    WO 2013/155056                                                               PCT/US2013/035750
   modified oligos showed a simple spectrum composed of unreacted templates without the
   presence of non-specific background products (Figure 2C, right panel).
            To study the effect of the 2'-0-methyl modified template-containing reactions on the
   amplification of a biological sample, genomic Clavibactermichiganensis sepidonicus (Cms)
 5 was used as target DNA. Amplified products were detection by SYBR green, which detects
   double-stranded DNA (Figures 3A and 3B) or Molecular Beacons, which detected a specific
   product (Figures 4A and 4B). Standard reactions were carried out with DNA oligonucleotide
   templates (Figures 3A and 4A) and 2'-O-methyl modified template-containing reactions
   (DNAble) reactions were carried out with oligonucleotides containing a block of 5
10 contiguous 2'-O-methyl nucleotides at the 3'-end in the target specific recognition sequence
   (Figures 3B and 4B). The signal in the No Target Controls (NTC's) was suppressed in the
   2'-O-methyl modified template-containing reactions (Figures 3B and 4B) whereas significant
   signal is observed in the No Target Controls (NTC's) (Figures 4A and 4B) indicating
   generation of background product in the absence of target DNA.
15          Thus, these results indicate that primers comprising 2'-0-methyl nucleotides reduce
   or eliminate background signal in NEAR amplification.
   Example 2: Positioning of 2'-O-methyl nucleotides in primer/template oligonucleotides
   altered time-to-detection and efficiency of NEAR reactions.
20          Exemplary polymerase arresting entities having 2'-O-methyl modified nucleotides at
   different positions within the specificity region were used in NEAR amplification reactions
   and their reaction kinetics studied. In particular, the primer/templates studied included a pair
   of oligonucleotides having a block of five 2'-O-methyl nucleotides placed at the 3' end of the
   specificity region or at the 5' end of the specificity region (2 nucleotides downstream of the
25 nick site) (Figure 5). Standard reactions were carried out in duplicate with a block of 2'-0
   methyl nucleotides on the 3'-end or starting at the 3 d nucleotide after the nick site and
   continuing for 5 bases or a mixture of these two structures as indicated. Target DNA was
   genomic Clavibactermichiganensissepidonicus (Cms). Detection was based on Molecular
   Beacon at a final concentration of 1OOnM.
30          Reaction rate modifying entities having 2'-0-methyl modified nucleotides at different
   positions within the specificity region of the primer/template oligonucleotide displayed
   different amplification kinetics (Figure 6). The reactions using primer/templates having a
   block of five 2'-0-methyl nucleotides at the 3' end showed decreased time to detection
                                                  31

    WO 2013/155056                                                              PCT/US2013/035750
   ("Terminal" template; 170 sec) compared to primer/templates having a block of five 2'-0
   methyl nucleotides starting at the 3d nucleotide after the nick site ("Nick +2" template"; 430
   sec). Thus, it was hypothesized that ratios of the two primer/template oligos can be used to
   manipulate the time-to-detection and/or the efficiency of the reaction for the 'tuning' of
 5 reactions. Reactions with varying ratios of "Terminal" template:"Nick +2" template showed
   intermediate time-to-detection between that of the two templates (Figure 6). Additionally,
   with increasing ratio of "Terminal" template:"Nick +2" template, the curve was contracted
   and the slope of the curve shifted. Thus, it was shown that positioning of 2' modified
   nucleotides in primer/template oligonucleotides and ratios of primer/template
10 oligonucleotides with differentially positioned 2' modified nucleotides altered time-to
   detection and efficiency of NEAR reactions. The invention is at least based in part on these
   discoveries.
15 Example 3: Complete suppression of nonspecific amplification in NEAR assays utilizing
   primer-templates with long target specific regions
            A NEAR assay for the quantification of the corn alcohol dehydrogenase 1 gene
   (ADHI) was designed utilizing two alternative sets of forward and reverse primer-templates
   (TS3 & TS3). No suitable nicking enzyme recognition site could be located within 500
20 nucleotides upstream or downstream from the target sequence region in corn gDNA. Both
   sets of primers-templates feature longer target complementary regions (16 and 19
   nucleotides, respectively) capable of strand invasion mediated hybridization with the target
   DNA. In the first set (TS3) the target complementary regions of the forward and reverse
   primer-templates contain a block of 5 consecutive 2'-O-methyl modified ribonucleotides
25 immediately upstream from the 3'-terminal deoxynucleotide. The remainder of the target
   sequence complementary region comprises a sequence of alternating unmodified
   deoxynucleotides and 2'-0-methyl ribonucleotides starting five nucleotides (forward primer
   template) or four nucleotides (reverse primer-template) downstream from the nick site. The
   second set (TS6) of primer-templates features only a block of five 2'-0-methyl
30 ribonucleotides adjacent to the 3'-terminal unmodified deoxynucleotide, while the rest of the
   target complementary region comprises only unmodified dexynucleotides.
