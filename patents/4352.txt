15                                          BACKGROUND
   [0002]     There are many different types of electronic devices including laptop computers,
   tablet computers, smart phones, among others. Such devices can work in cooperation with
   one or more accessory devices (e.g., a keyboard, a game controller, a clock radio, etc.) to
   expand the capabilities and functionality of the primary or host electronic device. To do so, a
20 connection can be established between the host electronic device and the accessory electronic
   device.
   [0003]     Connections can be established with a variety of conventional physical connectors
   that adhere to pre-defined formats, such as USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Firewire, and the like, or
   connections can be established wirelessly using protocols such as Bluetooth, WiFi, etc. In
25 some instances, a physical, wired connection can be beneficial to exchange power and
   exchange data.
   [0004]     Wired connections require some amount of real estate within the device. As an
   example, a USB receptacle connector typically requires a certain amount of surface area at an
   exterior surface of a host device along with a certain amount of volume within the host device
30 for the cavity of the receptacle connector into which a plug connector can be inserted and for
   the associated contacts and circuitry of the receptacle connector. Physical connectors can
                                                    1

   1002067402
   also become a potential source of corrosion and may detract somewhat from the aesthetic
   appearance of the device.
   [0004A]      Reference to any prior art in the specification is not, and should not be taken as,
   an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common
 5 general knowledge in any jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be
   understood, regarded as relevant and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a person
   skilled in the art.
                                          BRIEF SUMMARY
10 [0004B] As used herein, except where the context requires otherwise, the term "comprise"
   and variations of the term, such as "comprising", "comprises" and "comprised", are not
   intended to exclude further additives, components, integers or steps.
   [0005]      Embodiments of the disclosure pertain to an electronic device, such as a host
   electronic device, that includes a physical connector that is highly corrosion resistant,
15 requires a small amount of real estate and is aesthetically pleasing. Some embodiments
   provide an external physical connector that includes contacts that are substantially flush with
   an exterior surface of the electronic device. The exterior surface can be flat or can be curved
   and an exterior surface of the contacts can include a profile that matches that of the exterior
   surface. In some embodiments, for example where the enclosure is made from metal or
20 another conductive material, a nonconductive material can surround the contacts in the
   connector to electrically insulate each contact from the other contacts as well as from the
   housing of the electronic device.
   [0006]     In some embodiments the connector does not provide alignment by itself for mating
   with a corresponding connector of an accessory electronic device. Instead, an alignment
25 feature, such as a magnet or an array of magnets, can be incorporated into the connector. The
   alignment feature cooperates with a corresponding alignment feature in the accessory
   electronic device so that the contacts in the host electronic device are properly aligned with
   the contacts in the accessory electronic device during a mating event so that electric signals
   can be passed between the two devices through the mated contacts.
30 [0007]     In some embodiments an electronic device is provided that includes a device
   enclosure having an exterior surface and a contact area positioned at the exterior surface. The
                                                    2

   1002067402
   contact area has first and second ends and a plurality of contacts arranged between the first
   and second ends that are substantially flush with the exterior surface. The electronic device
   further includes an alignment feature within the enclosure that includes first and second
   magnets positioned on opposing sides of the contact area with the first magnet being
 5 positioned adjacent to the first end of the contact area and the second magnet being
   positioned adjacent to the second end of the contact area.
   [0008]     In some embodiment the portion of the device enclosure in the contact can be made
   from an electrically conductive material that includes one or more openings in which the
   plurality of contacts are positioned. One or more insulators can also be positioned in the
10 opening surrounding the plurality of contacts and electrically isolating the plurality of contact
   from the device enclosure. In some embodiments the one or more insulators include a
   plurality of insulation rings equal in number to the plurality of contacts.
   [0009]     In some embodiments the exterior surface of the device enclosure and exterior
   surfaces of the one or more contacts and the one or more insulators can combine to form a
15 continuous smooth surface. And, in some embodiments, there are no gaps between the
   exterior surface of the housing and each of the one or more insulators and there are no gaps
   between each of the one or more contacts and the one or more insulators. In some
   embodiments the device enclosure can have a curved exterior surface within the contact area
   and each contact in the plurality of contacts has a curvature at an outer contact surface that
20 corresponds to a curvature of the curved exterior surface.
   [0010]     In some embodiments, an electronic device according to the disclosure includes: a
   device enclosure having an exterior surface; a contact area positioned at the exterior surface
   and having first and second ends, the contact area having at least one contact positioned
   between the first and second ends and substantially flush with the exterior surface; and an
25 alignment feature within the enclosure comprising at least one magnet positioned within the
   device enclosure within or adjacent to the contact area.
   [0011]     In still other embodiments, an electronic device according the disclosure includes: a
   device enclosure that forms a cavity; and has an exterior surface; a processor and a computer
   readable memory positioned within the cavity; a transparent cover glass coupled to the
30 enclosure; a display positioned within the cavity adjacent to the cover glass; and a battery
   positioned within the enclosure and operatively coupled to the processor and the display. The
   electronic device can further include a contact area positioned at the exterior surface of the
                                                    3

   1002067402
   device enclosure, the contact area having first and second ends. A plurality of circular
   contacts can be spaced apart from each other in a single row between the first and second
   ends with each of the plurality of circular contacts being positioned within an opening formed
   through device enclosure and having an exterior surface that is flush with, or recessed less
 5 than one millimeter from, an exterior surface of the device enclosure in the contact area. An
   insulating ring can be positioned in each of the plurality of openings that surrounds the
   contact in the opening and isolates the contact from the device enclosure where the exterior
   surface of the housing and exterior surfaces of the plurality of circular contacts and the
   exterior surface of the plurality of insulator rings can combine to form a continuous smooth
10 surface. The electronic device can further include an alignment feature within the enclosure
   that includes first and second arrays of magnets positioned on opposing sides of the contact
   area with the first array of magnets positioned adjacent to the first end of the contact area and
   the second array of magnets positioned adjacent to the second end of the contact area.
   [0012]     Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the embodiments will be, or
15 will become, apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following
   figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods,
   features and advantages be included within this description and this summary, be within the
   scope of the embodiments, and be protected by the following claims.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0047]      Reference will now be made in detail to representative embodiments of the
   disclosure illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Although these embodiments are
   described in sufficient detail to enable one skilled in the art to practice the described
15 embodiments, it is understood that these examples are not limiting. To the contrary, the
   present disclosure is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as can be
   included within the spirit and scope of the described embodiments. It is to be understood that
   other embodiments may be used, and changes may be made without departing from the spirit
   and scope of the described embodiments.
20 [0048]      The following disclosure relates to a host electronic device suitable for use with an
   accessory electronic device. The host electronic device can include a physical connector that
   is highly resistant to corrosion, requires a small amount of real estate and is aesthetically
   pleasing. In some embodiments the host electronic device can include an external physical
   connector having one or more contacts that are flush with, or slightly recessed from, an
25 exterior surface of the host electronic device. The exterior surface can be flat or can be
   curved and an exterior surface of the contacts can include a profile that matches that of the
   exterior surface. In some embodiments, for example where the enclosure is made from metal
   or another conductive material, a nonconductive material can surround the contacts in the
   connector to electrically insulate each contact from the other contacts as well as from the
30 housing of the electronic device.
   [0049]     FIG. 1 illustrates an electronic system 100 according to some embodiments of the
   present disclosure. System 100 includes a host electronic device 110 that can be connected to
                                                     7

   1002067402
   an accessory electronic device 120 in order to share data, power, or both between the
   accessory and the host. Specifically, one or more contacts 112 on host device 110 can be
   electrically connected to one or more contacts 122 on accessory device 120 by, for example,
   a cable connector 130. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, contacts 112 on host
 5 device 110 can be directly and electrically connected to contacts 122 on accessory device 120
   using connectors different than cable connector 130. In still other embodiments of the
   present disclosure, one or more optical contacts supporting one or more optical connections
   between host device 110 and accessory device 120 can be included.
   [0050]     To facilitate a direct connection between contacts 112 on host electronic device 110
10 and contacts 122 on accessory electronic device 120, contacts 112 can be part of a surface
   mount connector incorporated into the host device 110 in which the contacts are located at an
   external surface of device 110 and are either flush with, or recessed a limited amount relative
   to, an enclosure of device 110. Some examples of a surface mount connector that includes
   contacts 112 are shown in the following figures and discussed below.
15 [0051]      FIG. 2 illustrates an isometric view of an electronic device 200 according to some
   embodiments of the present disclosure. Electronic device 200 is representative of one the
   many different types of electronic devices that can be host electronic device 110 shown in
   FIG. 1. In some embodiments, electronic device 200 is a mobile communications device,
   such as a smartphone. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, electronic device 200 is a tablet
20 computing device. Electronic device 200 can vary in shape and size. Also, electronic device
   200 can include an enclosure 202 that forms a cavity and is designed to enclose and protect
   various internal components of device 200 within the cavity, such as a battery, one or more
   processors, one or more computer-readable memories, wireless interfaces, etc. In some
   embodiments, enclosure 202 is formed from a metal, such as aluminum, or another
25 electrically conductive material.
   [0052]      Electronic device 200 can also include a display assembly 204 designed to present
   visual content. In some embodiments, display assembly 204 includes a touch sensitive layer
   designed to receive a touch input and generate commands, in accordance with the touch
   input, to the electronic device 200. Further, in some embodiments, display assembly 204
30 includes a capacitive touch sensitive layer designed to generate an input based upon a
   capacitive coupling with the display assembly 204. An outer protective layer 206 made from
   a transparent material, can overlay display assembly 204 and be attached to enclosure 202
                                                    8

   1002067402
   with an adhesive or other means thereby covering the display and the cavity formed by the
   enclosure. Outer protective layer 206 can be made from glass or similar materials and is
   sometimes referred to as a cover glass. In some embodiments, electronic device 200 can
   further include a force detection sensor (not shown) designed to detect an amount of force
 5 applied to display assembly 204 and/or outer protective layer 206.
   [0053]      Electronic device 200 can include one or more input buttons, such as button 208,
   designed to receive an input corresponding to a command to the electronic device (for
   example, to change the visual content shown on display assembly 204). Further, in some
   embodiments, electronic device 200 includes a receptacle connector 210 designed to receive
10 power and/or data from another device. For example, power from a power source (not shown)
   can be supplied to device 200 through connector 210 in order to power internal components
   of electronic device 200 and/or power one or more power sources (not shown) disposed in
   electronic device 200. Receptacle connector 210 can include a cavity in which the contacts
   of the receptacle connector are located.
15 [0054]      Separate from connector 210, electronic device 200 can further include one or
   more electrical contacts 212 within a contact area 211 located at an exterior surface of device
   200. Electrical contacts are designed to electrically couple with corresponding contacts
   associated with an accessory device, such as accessory device 500 (shown in FIG. 5).
   Contacts 212 can allow for electrical communication between electronic device 200 and
20 accessory device 500 just as contacts 112 can allow electrical communication between
   devices 110 and 120. For example, in some embodiments contacts 212 can include one or
   more data contacts that enable the exchange of data between devices 200 and 500. Contacts
   212 can also include one or more power contacts that enable an accessory device to provide
   power to electronic device 200 or enable an accessory device to draw power from device 200
25 and/or ground contacts.
   [0055]      Contacts 212 can be substantially flush with an exterior surface of housing 202.
   That is, in some embodiments contacts 212 are not formed within an exposed opening or
   other type of cavity in housing 202 that is typically required by a receptacle connector, such
   as connector 210, and that might otherwise be a source for dust or other debris to collect.
30 Instead, contacts 212 are part of a continuous exterior surface of the device housing 202
   making the contacts less noticeable than when standard connectors are incorporated into
   housing 202, which can be beneficial to the aesthetic appearance of electronic device 200.
                                                    9

   1002067402
   As used herein, contacts 212 can be said to be "substantially flush" with an exterior surface
   of housing 202 when the exterior surface of the contacts is flush with (e.g., in the same plane
   as) the surrounding housing surface as well as when an exterior surface of each individual
   contact 212 is recessed a limited amount, such as 1 millimeter or less, from the surface of the
 5 exterior housing 202 that surrounds the contact. In other embodiments contacts 212 are
   recessed 0.5 mm or less and in still other embodiments, contacts 212 are recessed 0.25 mm or
   less from the surrounding exterior housing surface. When the contacts are substantially flush
   with the surrounding exterior surface of housing 202, the contact and exterior housing can
   combine such that there is a continuous smooth transition between the portion of the housing
10 exterior surface surrounding the contact and the exterior surface of the contact.
   [0056]     Since contacts 212 are not positioned within a cavity of housing 202 or other
   exposed opening of housing 202 that can provide alignment for a corresponding connector to
   mate and electrically connect to contacts 202, in some embodiments electronic device 200
   includes an alignment feature to facilitate connector mating. In some particular
15 embodiments, the alignment feature can include a first array 214 of alignment magnets and a
   second array 216 of alignment magnets disposed along a sidewall of enclosure 202 on
   opposite sides of contacts area 211. Each of first array 214 and second array 216 of magnets
   can include several magnets having a magnetic polarity arrangement to magnetically couple
   the arrays with corresponding arrays of magnets in the accessory electronic device as
20 explained below. The magnetic circuits formed by multiple magnetic couplings can allow
   electronic device 200 to magnetically couple with an accessory electronic device, such as
   accessory device 500 shown in FIG. 5, and align contacts 212 with contacts of the accessory
   electronic device. In other embodiments, the alignment feature can include fewer or more
   magnets or magnetic components or other types of alignments structures.
25 [0057]     FIG. 3 illustrates a contact area 300 in a device enclosure according to an
   embodiment of the present disclosure. Contact area 300 can be, for example, contact area
   211 shown in FIG. 2. In this example, contact area 300 includes three individual contacts
   312 (labeled as contacts 312a, 312b and 312c) each of which is located at and substantially
   flush with a surrounding exterior surface of a device enclosure 310. Embodiments of the
30 disclosure are not limited to any particular number of contacts, however, and other
   embodiments can include fewer or more than three contacts within contact area 300. Each of
   contacts 312 can be similar to or identical to contacts 212 while device enclosure 310 can be,
   for example, housing 202 of electronic device 200. In some embodiments device enclosure
                                                   10

   1002067402
   310 can be made from a metal or similar electrically conductive material in which case an
   insulating ring 320 can surround an outside edge of each individual contact 312 between each
   contact 312 and device enclosure 310. The insulating rings 320 can be made from plastic or
   another nonconductive material and can electrically isolate contacts 312 from device
 5 enclosure 310. In these and other embodiments of the present disclosure, contacts 312 and
   insulating rings 320 can be substantially flush with a surrounding surface of device enclosure
   310. These surfaces can be curved, they can be substantially flat, or they can have other
   contours. In some embodiments the exterior surfaces of contacts 312 and surrounding
   insulating rings 320 can combine such that, when the contacts and insulating ring are
10 recessed by the limited amount, the exterior surfaces of the contact, insulating ring and device
   housing all combine to form a continuous smooth exterior surface that can be slightly
   recessed in the areas of the contact and/or insulating ring. forming three side-by-side dimples
   in the contact area, as shown in FIG. 3.
   [0058]      FIG. 4 illustrates a cutaway side view of a portion of contact area 300 along lines
15 A-A' in FIG. 3. In this example, a contact structure 400 is illustrated. Contact structure 400
   includes an individual contact 312 (e.g., one of contacts 312a-312c) positioned in and filling
   an opening in device enclosure 310. Plastic insulating ring 320 is located between contact
   312 and device enclosure 310 surrounding the contact. Plastic ring 320 closely abuts both
   device enclosure 310 and contact 312 such that no gaps are formed between the three
20 components. Further, as evident from FIG. 4, the exterior surface of contact structure 400 is
   essentially a continuous, smooth (to a user's touch) and curved surface from the portion of
   enclosure 310 at the top of the figure, to the upper portion of insulating ring 320, to contact
   312, to the lower portion of insulating ring 320, and to the portion of enclosure 310 at the
   bottom of the figure.
25 [0043]     As also shown in FIG. 4, a flexible circuit board 420 can connect to contact 312,
   and a bracket 410 can be used to secure contact 312 in place in device enclosure 310. In
   various embodiments of the present disclosure, various adhesives can be used to secure these
   structures in place. Specifically, adhesive layers 430 can be used to secure contact 312 to
   plastic insulator 320. Adhesive layers 430 can also be used to secure plastic insulator 320 to
30 device enclosure 310. Also, adhesive layers 430 can be used to secure bracket 410 in place in
   device enclosure 310.

   [0060]      Further details of contact structure 400 as well as examples of contacts and contact
   structures that can be incorporated into a host electronic device instead of contact structure
   400 according to embodiments of the disclosure are discussed below with respect to FIGS.
   14-52. Before turning to those additional details and examples, however, reference is made
 5 to FIG. 5, which illustrates an isometric view of an embodiment of an electronic device that is
   representative of accessory electronic device 120 shown in FIG. 1. As such, electronic
   device 500 can be connected to a host electronic, such as host electronic device 110 shown in
   FIG. 1 or host electronic device 200 shown in FIG. 2. Accessory device 500 includes a cover
   502 coupled with a keyboard assembly 504. Cover 502 can be sized and shaped to overlay
10 and cover an electronic device, such as device 110 or device 200, that can be used with
   accessory device 500. In some embodiments, cover 502 includes multiple sections, which
   can also be referred to as panels or segments. For example, as shown in FIG. 5, cover 502
   can include a first segment 506, a second segment 508, and a third segment 510. Each of first
   segment 506, second segment 508, and third segment 510 can be moveable or rotatable with
15 respect to the remaining segment. In this regard, cover 502 may be referred to as a foldable
   cover. Further, as shown in FIG. 5, third segment 510 can be raised or elevated with respect
   to first segment 506 and second segment 508 such that when the keyboard assembly 504 is
   folded over and onto first segment 506 and second segment 508, keyboard assembly 504 is
   generally co-planar, or flush, with respect to third segment 510.
20 [0061]      Each of the first, second and third segments can be covered or overlaid by a fabric
   layer 512, such as a microfiber, or generally any material that provides a cosmetic
   enhancement while also not causing damage to a display assembly (e.g., display 204 shown
   in FIG. 2) of the host electronic device that accessory keyboard 500 is designed to operate
   with. Also, each of the segments can include a rigid panel formed from a material, such as
25 glass fiber, disposed below fabric layer 512. Further, the segments previously described can
   be folded to define a folded configuration of cover 502 in which the electronic device that the
   accessory keyboard is designed to cooperate with can be positioned in a propped-up position.
   [0062]      Cover 502 can further include an attachment feature 514 designed to receive and
   secure a host electronic device, such host electronic device 110 or host electronic device 200,
30 with accessory device 500. Attachment feature 514 can include several magnets, or arrays of
   magnets, (not shown in FIG. 5) that can be aligned to magnetically couple to several magnets
   disposed in the host electronic device to accessory device 500 is to be attached. Further,
   accessory device 500 can include one or more electrical contacts within an accessory contact
                                                     12

   1002067402
   structure 515 designed to electrically couple with electrical contacts 312 of a host electronic
   device, such as host device 110 or 200. Generally the number of electrical contacts in contact
   structure 515 will equal the number of contacts in the corresponding contact area 300 that
   accessory 500 is manufactured to be paired with. In some embodiments, for example as
 5 shown in FIG. 5, accessory contact structure 515 includes three contacts 516a, 516b, 516c
   that align with and can be electrically coupled to contacts 312a, 312b, 312c, respectively.
   Embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to any particular number of contacts within
   accessory contact structure 515, however, and can include more or fewer than three contacts
   in various embodiments. Further details of accessory contact structure 515 are discussed later
10 in this application with respect to at least FIGS. 6 and 7.
   [0063]      Attachment feature 514 can be coupled with cover 502 by way of an exterior layer
   518, or outer layer, that extends along an exterior surface of cover 502 and wraps around the
   attachment feature 514 to define a top, or upper, surface of attachment feature 514. In some
   embodiments, exterior layer 518 includes a polymer-based, low modulus elastomeric material
15 that allows some flexibility of attachment feature 514 and cover 502. Further, exterior layer
   518 can include a mixture of polyurethane and coal tar and can come in a variety of colors.
   Also, the material forming exterior layer 518 can further include relatively high adhesion to
   other components and can further be abrasion-resistant. In this regard, exterior layer 518 can
   include a relatively high coefficient of friction, which can limit movement of the electronic
20 device when engaged with attachment feature 514. In order to lower the coefficient of
   friction, attachment feature 514 can include a first layer 522 and a second layer 524
   surrounding the electrical contact. First layer 522 and second layer 524 can include a lower
   coefficient of friction relative to attachment feature 514, which can facilitate alignment and
   coupling between an electronic device and attachment feature 514.
25 [0064]      Keyboard assembly 504 can include keys 526 disposed according to a QWERTY
   configuration commonly known in the art for a keyboard. However, in other embodiments,
   the keys 526 can include a different configuration according to a language or dialect.
   Keyboard assembly 504 can include a printed circuit board (not shown) that receives the keys
   526. Keyboard assembly 504 can further include a retention feature 528 disposed across, and
30 protruding from, a top surface 530 of the keyboard assembly 504. Retention feature 528 can
   be designed to receive attachment feature 514, or at least a portion of attachment feature 514,
   when cover 502 is in a particular folded configuration. Retention feature 528 can provide a
                                                    13

   1002067402
   mechanical stop for attachment feature 514 and an electronic device secured with attachment
   feature 514.
   [0065]      As shown in FIG. 5, retention feature 528 includes a ring-like configuration
   protruding from a top surface 530. However, in other embodiments, retention feature 528
 5 includes two or more discontinuous features that provide the mechanical stop previously
   described. Still, in other embodiments, top surface 530 include a trough or "valley" in a
   location within retention feature 528 that positions a portion of attachment feature 514 below
   top surface 530. Also, retention feature 528 can include an array of magnets designed to
   magnetically couple with magnets in attachment feature 514 that combines with the
10 mechanical stop to further limit movement of attachment feature 514. Further details of
   attachment feature 514 are discussed below with respect to FIGS. 8-9.
   [0066]      Reference is now made to FIG. 6, which is a simplified perspective view of
   accessory contact structure 515 according to some embodiments of the disclosure. As shown
   in FIG. 6, contact structure 515 can include a contact housing 605 (also shown in FIG. 7) that
15 includes a raised portion 610. The raised portion 610 can be positioned within and extend
   through an opening in a device enclosure, such as enclosure 620 shown in FIG. 7, which can
   be part of the housing of the accessory device or can be, for example, an exterior surface of
   attachment feature 514. Accessory contact structure 515 also includes three individual
   contacts 516a, 516b and 516c, each of which can be made from metal or another conductive
20 material. The raised portion 610 of the contact structure can include separate openings for
   each of the individual contacts 516a, 516b and 516c.
   [0067]      Contacts 516a-516c can be low-profile contacts that allow contact structure 515 to
   provide contacts for a connector without consuming a large volume in the electronic device
   housed by enclosure 620. In various embodiments, contacts 516a-516c can be spring-biased
25 contacts. For example, contacts 516a-516c can be biased by a spring, flexible arm, or other
   flexible structure such that they can be pushed or depressed and may return to their original
   position once released. Spring-biased contacts can provide an amount of compliance with
   contacts in a corresponding connector, thereby assisting in forming electrical connections
   between multiple contacts 516a-516c and corresponding contacts of a second connector on a
30 second device, such as contacts 312a-312c of host electronic device 200.
   [0068]      FIG. 7 is a simplified side cross-sectional view of contact structure 515 according
   some embodiments of the present disclosure taken along the dotted plane, shown in FIG. 6.
                                                    14

   1002067402
   Contact structure 515 can be located in an accessory electronic device having a housing or
   enclosure 620. As noted above, raised portion 610 of cover 210 of contact structure 515 can
   be located in an opening in device enclosure 620. Contact housing 605 of contact structure
   515 can support contacts 516a, 516b, 516c (e.g., opening 548 shown in FIG. 8) having
 5 contacting portions 622a, 622b, and 622c, respectively. These contacting portions 622a-622c
   can be attached to ends of flexible lever arms 624a, 624b, and 624c, respectively. Each
   flexible arm may terminate in a second end and can include a barb, which may be inserted
   into notches or grooves in contact housing 605. Specifically, flexible lever arm 624a can
   include barb 626a, flexible lever arm 624b can include barb 626b, and flexible lever arm
10 624c can include barb 626c. In some embodiments, the center contact can have contact
   housing 605 insert molded around it and barb 626b may not be needed.
   [0069]     During assembly, the central contact including contact portion 622b can be inserted
   through an opening in a bottom of connector housing 605. Without more, contacting portion
   622b could be pushed deep into connector housing 605. In some instances, contacting
15 structure 622b could be pushed below a top surface of raised portion 610. If contacting
   portion 622b were to be laterally offset at this time, contacting portion 622b may not emerge
   from its opening in contact housing 605. Accordingly, a bottom stop portion 630 can be
   located under contacting portion 622b. Bottom stop portion 630 can limit a depth to which
   contacting portion 622b canbe depressed, thereby preventing possible damage to contact
20 structure 515. In other embodiments, the center contact can have contact housing 605 insert
   molded around it and bottom stop portion 630 may not be needed.
   [0070]     Reference is now made to FIG. 8, which illustrates an exploded view of various
   components of attachment feature 514 according to some embodiments of the disclosure. For
   example, attachment feature 514 can include a first array 532 of magnets and a second array
25 534 of magnets. In some embodiments, first array 532 and second array 534 include several
   magnets (such as neodymium magnets) aligned together prior to assembly. In the
   embodiment shown in FIG. 8, first array 532 and second array 534 are formed form a
   composition of non-magnetized material and magnetized prior to an assembly of attachment
   feature 514. First array 532 and second array 534 can be placed under a camera/sensor
30 assembly (not shown) and aligned with a magnetizer (not shown) according to a desired
   alignment between electrical contacts 516a-c and an electronic device (not shown). This
   allows for a custom magnetization that improves a magnetic alignment of an electronic
   device.
                                                    15

   1002067402
   [0071]      FIG. 8 further shows first array 532 and second array 534 having several
   magnetized regions. For example, first array 532 can include a first magnetized region 536
   and a second magnetized region 538 adjacent to first magnetized region 136. Also, the
   magnetized regions can include dissimilar magnetic regions, or magnetic region of different
 5 sizes. As known by one of ordinary skill in the art, a magnet generally includes magnetic
   polarity arrangement having a "North" facing polarity, or North Pole, and a region of a
   "South" facing polarity, or South Pole, with magnetic field lines extending in a direction from
   the North Pole to the South Pole. Also, it is also understood by one of ordinary skill in the art
   that a North Pole of a magnet can be magnetically attracted to a South Pole of a magnet, and
10 that two North poles, or two South poles, can magnetically repel one another. In this regard,
   adjacent magnetic regions of first array 532 and second array 534 can include magnet polarity
   arrangements designed to produce magnetic field lines in opposite directions. For example,
   as shown in FIG. 8, first magnetized region 536 includes magnetic field lines (shown as
   dotted lines) extending in a first direction, indicative of a top surface have a North polarity
15 and a bottom surface (not shown) opposite the top surface having a South polarity.
   Conversely, second magnetized region 538 includes magnetic field lines (shown as dotted
   lines) extending in a second direction opposite the first direction, indicative of a top surface
   have a South polarity and a bottom surface (not shown) opposite the top surface having a
   North polarity. This pattern can be representative of magnetized regions of first array and the
20 second array. Further, in other embodiments, the pattern is reversed such that first
   magnetized region 536 and second magnetized region 538 include magnetic field lines in the
   opposite direction as those shown in FIG. 8. Also, first magnetized region 536 can be smaller
   than that of second magnetized region 538. Similar, but complementary, magnet polarity
   arrangements can be employed in magnet arrays 214 and 216 of device 200 to facilitate
25 magnet coupling of the attachment feature to device 200.
   [0072]      Also, as shown in FIG. 8, electrical contact structure 515 can be disposed on a
   flexible circuit assembly 535, and a magnetic shunt 537 can be disposed below first array 532
   and second array 534. Magnetic shunt 537 can be formed from a metal, including soft steel,
   magnetically attracted to first array 532 and second array 534. Also, magnetic shunt 537 can
30 alter the direction of the magnetic fields of the first and second arrays in a direction towards
   magnets in a host electronic device, such as magnet arrays 214 and 216 in electronic device
   200, to which attachment feature secures accessory 500. Attachment feature 514 can further
   include a protective component 540 that include a metal layer (not shown) that can include
                                                    16

   1002067402
   stainless steel. An outer coating 542 can cover the metal layer and provide an aesthetic
   finish. In some embodiments, outer coating 542 includes a photothermolplastic ("PTP")
   material that includes polyurethane plus a thermoplastic.
   [0073]      Attachment feature 514 can further include or receive several additional features.
 5 For example, an electrically conductive fabric 544 designed to carry electrical signals from an
   electronic device to a connector (not shown) of keyboard assembly 504 (shown in FIG. 5), or
   vice versa. Electrically conductive fabric 544 can wrap around protective component 540
   electrically couple with flexible circuit assembly 535, and electrically conductive fabric 544
   can be electrically coupled with one or more of the individual electrical contacts 516 within
10 contact structure 515 (i.e., one or more of contacts 516a-516c). In some embodiments,
   electrically conductive fabric 544 is electrically conductive throughout (the electrically
   conductive fabric 544). In the embodiment shown in FIG. 8, electrically conductive fabric
   544 includes an electrically conductive region 546 that includes three electrically independent
   signal traces (not shown) that electrically couple to respective ones of contacts 516a-516c.
15 Exterior layer 518 can also wrap around attachment feature 514 and combine with first layer
   522 and second layer 524 to define a top surface of the attachment feature. As shown,
   exterior layer 518 can include an opening 548 that allows each individual electrical contact
   516 to couple with an electrical contact of an electronic device.
   [0074]      FIG. 9 illustrates a cross-sectional view of attachment feature 514 through the
20 dashed line shown in FIG. 8 and with the various components shown in FIG. 8 assembled
   together. As shown, metal layer 552, surrounded by outer coating 542, is generally U
   shaped, but can vary according to a desired shape of attachment feature 514. Also, exterior
   layer 518 and electrically conductive fabric 544 generally wrap around protective component
   540, with exterior layer 518 extending over a magnet 554 (of either first array 532 or second
25 array 534, shown in FIG. 8) and electrically conductive fabric 544 extending below magnet
   554, between magnet 554 and magnetic shunt 537. Also, electrically conductive fabric 544
   can be covered by a cosmetic layer 556, which further provides a protective cover to the
   electrically conductive fabric 544. The cosmetic layer 556 can include PTP.
   [0075]      Also, cosmetic layer 556 can be adhesively secured with an upper portion of
30 attachment feature 514. For example, an adhesive layer 558 between cosmetic layer 556 and
   outer coating 542 can extend only along a fraction (less than half) of outer coating 542. This
   allows for better ease of movement of the attachment feature in a clockwise and/or
                                                     17

   counterclockwise manner (denoted by arrow 560). Also, although not specifically shown,
   several features shown and described in FIG. 9 can be adhesively secured together.
   [0076]      Referring now to FIG. 10, which illustrates a side view of accessory device 500
   resting on a surface 1000 (e.g., a desktop) and coupled with electronic device 200. As shown
 5 in FIG. 5, accessory device 500 is in a folded configuration to allow use of keyboard
   assembly 504 with electronic device 200. In the folded configuration, attachment feature 514
   of accessory device 500 couples cover 502 to the retention feature 128 portion of keyboard
   assembly 504. At the same time, attachment feature 514 also couples accessory device 500
   to host electronic device 200 such that contact area 300 in host device 200 is mated with and
10 electrically connected to contact structure 515 in accessory device 500. As shown, the folded
   configuration can include first segment 506, second segment 508, and third segment 510
   folded to form a triangular support for the electronic device 200. Further, the electronic
   device 200 can abut against third segment 510.
   [0077]      In the configuration shown in FIG. 10, keyboard assembly 504 can be used as an
15 input device in order to generate input or command to electronic device 300 and change the
   visual content (denoted as several diagonal lines) of display assembly 204 (shown in FIG. 2)
   of electronic device 200. This is due in part to electrically conductive fabric 544, shown in
   the enlarged view, folding with cover 502, and extending through cover.
   [0078]      While not shown in FIG. 10, one or more arrays of magnets are disposed below
20 retention feature 528 of keyboard assembly 504 and couple with the magnets in the first array
   532 and second array 534 of attachment feature 514 when attachment feature 114 is
   positioned, or nearly positioned, in retention feature 128. In this regard, each magnet in first
   array 532 and second array 534 can include a magnetic polarity arrangement to magnetically
   couple with a magnet in one or more arrays of magnets (not shown) under retention feature
25 528. This allows retention feature 528 to simultaneously secure attachment feature 514 and
   electronic device 300 coupled with attachment feature 514. In some embodiments, the
   combined number of magnets in the one or more magnet arrays under retention feature 528 is
   equal to the combined number of magnets in first array 532 and second array 534.
   [0079]      To more clearly illustrate the magnetic coupling associated with attachment feature
30 514 and both retention feature 528 and electronic device 200, reference is made to FIG. 11,
   which illustrates an enlarged partial cross-sectional view of a portion of FIG. 10 shown in
   dotted lines taken through portions of attachment feature 514 and retention feature 528 that
                                                   18

   1002067402
   include alignment magnets as discussed. As shown in FIG. 11, attachment feature 514 is
   positioned in retention feature 528 and the retention feature is used as a mechanical stop for
   attachment feature 514. Also, as shown, attachment feature 514 can include a magnet 554
   that can be part of first array 532 of magnets or second array 534 of magnets (shown in FIG.
 5 8) magnetically coupled with a magnet 1102 that can be part of the first array 214 or the
   second array 216 of magnets, respectively (shown in FIG. 2). The magnetic field lines are
   shown as dotted lines having arrows. Magnet 554 in attachment feature 514 can further be
   magnetically coupled with a magnet 1104 that is part of an array of magnets in the keyboard
   assembly 504. This magnetic coupling can, in combination with the retention feature 528,
10 maintain the attachment feature 514 and the electronic device 200 in a stationary position.
   [0080]      As discussed above, when accessory device is in the folded position shown in FIG.
   10 such that attachment feature 514 is properly aligned with and secured within retention
   feature 528, each contact 516 is accessible to be electrically coupled to a respective contact
   212 that is part of host device 200. This connection sequence is illustrated in FIGS. 12 and
15 13, each of which represents the same enlarged partial cross-sectional view of FIG. 10 that is
   shown in FIG. 11 but through a pair mating contacts, a contact 212 (from electronic device
   200) and a contact 516 (e.g., one of contacts 516a-516c from accessory device 500) instead of
   through the alignment magnets. Specifically, FIG. 12 depicts host electronic device 200 in a
   position in which contact 212 is spaced apart from, and thus not yet mated with, contact 516.
20 As shown in FIG. 12, contact 516 protrudes slightly above an exterior surface 1202 of
   attachment feature 514.
   [0044]     As shown in FIG. 13, as electronic device 200 is moved closer to attachment feature
   514 and magnets 1102 and 554 pull device 200 into the attachment feature, contact 516
   becomes physically and electrically connected to contact 212. Contact 516 is attached to a
25 flexible lever arm (e.g., one of lever arms 624a-624c discussed with respect to FIG. 7) and is
   thus pushed into the enclosure 620 of the attachment feature by contact 212 (as shown by
   arrow 1302) until device 200 reaches its fully mated position in which exterior surface 1204
   of device 200 is in physical contact with exterior surface 1202 of attachment feature 514 at an
   interface 1205.
30 [0045]     Turning our attention back to details of contact 212, reference is made to FIG. 14,
   which illustrates an embodiment of contact 312 shown in FIG. 4 as an example of a contact
   212. As shown in FIG. 14, contact 312 can include a contacting portion 1402 emerging from
                                                   19

   a front face 1404. Contact 312 can further have a rear angle portion 1406 that can connect to
   flexible circuit board 320. Contact 312 can be formed by machining, forging, printing,
   etching, stamping, or in other ways. In other embodiment of the present disclosure, contacts
   312 can be formed by a deep drawn process.
 5 [0046]     FIG. 15 illustrates a plastic insulator 1500 according to an embodiment of the
   present disclosure. In this example, plastic insulator 1500 includes a ring 320 (also shown in
   FIG. 3) that define an opening 1502 for accepting contact 312. Rear surfaces 1504 can be
   covered with adhesives and contact 312 can be joined to plastic insulator 120 at those
   locations.
10 [0047]     FIGS. 16-18 illustrate a method of assembling a set of contacts according to an
   embodiment of the present disclosure. In FIG. 16, a number of contacts 312 Can be mated to
   a flexible circuit board 420 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Contacts
   on flexible circuit board 420 can be attached to rear portions 1406 of contacts 312 by
   soldering, laser, spot, or resistance welding, or by other method. In this example, flexible
15 circuit board 420 can have three portions, each connected to an angled portion 1406 of a
   contact 312. Diodes 1610 can be connected between flexible circuit board traces in flexible
   circuit board 420 and the device enclosure 310 (shown in FIG. 4) to provide ESD protection.
   In this example, flexible circuit board 420 can be split into three portions as shown to provide
   a greater flexibility in attaching flexible circuit board 420 to rear portions 1406 of contacts
20 312. Contacts 312 can be aligned with openings 1502 in plastic insulators 1500.
   [0048]     In FIG. 17, barrels including contacts 312 in plastic insulators 1500 (as shown in
   FIG. 16) can be aligned with openings 1702 in device enclosure 310. Plastic insulators 1500
   can be glued in place. In FIG. 18, bracket 1810 can be glued in place in notch 1802 in device
   enclosure 310.
25 [0049]     In various embodiments of the present disclosure, different portions of these contact
   structures and other contact structures can be formed of various materials. For example,
   bracket 1810 and plastic insulators 1500 can be formed of the same or different materials,
   such as plastic, LPS, or other non-conductive or conductive material. Contacts 312 can be
   formed of noncorrosive materials, such as gold, gold plated copper, gold plated nickel, gold
30 nickel alloy, and other materials.
   [0050]     In various embodiments of the present disclosure, different portions of these contact
   structures and other contact structures can be formed in various ways. For example, bracket
                                                     20

   1810 and plastic insulators 1500 can be formed using injection or other molding, printing, or
   other technique. Contacts 312 can be machined, stamped, coined, forged, printed, or formed
   in different ways, such as by using a deep drawn process. Plastic insulator 1500 can be
   formed around contacts 312 using injection molding.

   be used for the contact structure of FIG. 3. In this example, a contact 1912 can be located in
   an opening in device enclosure 310. A plastic insulator 1920 can be located between contact
   1912 and device enclosure 310 and the exterior surface of contact structure 1900 can be an
   essentially continuous, smooth (to a user's touch) and curved surface across the enclosure,
10 insulating ring and contact. A flexible circuit board 1920 can connect to contact 1912 at rear
   portion 1914. An optional bracket (not shown) can be used to secure contacts 1912 in place
   in device enclosure 310, though in other embodiments of the present disclosure, contacts
   1912 and insulators 1920 can be glued or otherwise fixed in place. In various embodiments
   of the present disclosure, various adhesives can be used to secure these structures in place.
15 Specifically, an adhesive layer can be used to secure contact 1912 to plastic insulator 1920.
   Adhesive layers can also be used to secure plastic insulator 1920 to device enclosure 310.
   Also, adhesive layers can be used to secure an optional bracket in place in device enclosure
   310. Support 1910 can provide mechanical support for flexible circuit board 1920. Support
   1910 can include ESD diodes (as shown below in FIG. 22.)
20 [0051]     FIG. 20 illustrates the contact structure of FIG. 19. In this example, a force can be
   applied at rear surface 2002 to form contacts 1912 in a deep drawn process. As before,
   contact 1912 can include a rear angle piece 1914 that can be mated with a flexible circuit
   board. In other embodiment of the present disclosure, contact 1912 can be formed by
   machining, forging, printing, etching, stamping, or in other ways.

   this example, flexible circuit board 420 can have three portions, each connected to a rear
   portion 1914 of a contact 1912. Diodes 1610 can be connected between flexible circuit board
   traces in flexible circuit board 420 and the device enclosure 310 to provide ESD protection.
 5 In this example, flexible circuit board 420 can be split into three portions as shown to provide
   a greater flexibility in attaching flexible circuit board 420 to rear portions 1914 of contacts
   1912.
   [0054]     FIG. 23 illustrates a cutaway side view of another contact structure 2300 that can be
   used for the contact structure of FIG. 3. In this example, contact 2312 can be located in an
10 opening in device enclosure 310. A plastic insulator 2320 can be located between contact
   2312 and device enclosure 310 and, as evident from FIG. 23, the exterior surface of contact
   structure 2300 can be an essentially continuous, smooth (to a user's touch) and curved
   surface across the enclosure, insulating ring and contact. A bridging piece 2315 can connect
   flexible circuit board 2320 to contact 2312 at rear portion 2314. An optional bracket (not
15 shown) can be used to secure contacts 2312 in place in device enclosure 310, though in other
   embodiments of the present disclosure, contacts 2312 and insulators 2320 can be glued or
   otherwise fixed in place. In various embodiments of the present disclosure, various adhesives
   can be used to secure these structures in place. Specifically, adhesive layers can be used to
   secure contact 2312 to plastic insulator 2320. An adhesive layer can also be used to secure
20 plastic insulator 2320 to device enclosure 310. Also, adhesive layers can be used to secure an
   optional bracket in place in device enclosure 310. Support 2310 can provide mechanical

   can be split and placed on a dummy carrier 3000 such that contacts 2712 can have the same
25 special relationship to each other as they will when placed in a device enclosure. In FIG. 31,
   plastic insulators 2820 can be formed around contacts 2712. In other embodiments of the
   present disclosure, plastic insulators 2820 can be formed in a separate step and then placed
   around contacts 2712. In these and other embodiments of the present disclosure, instead of
   one plastic insulator 2820, three plastic insulators or insulators can be used, each around one
30 of the contacts 2712. Plastic insulators 2820 can be glued or otherwise fixed to contacts
   2712. Dummy carrier 3000 can be removed.

   embodiment of the present disclosure. In this example, contact area 3500 include three
10 contacts 3512 at a surface of a device enclosure 3530. An insulating ring formed by a plastic
   insulator 3520 can surround an outside edge of contacts 3512 and can be located between
   contacts 3512 and device enclosure 3530. As shown in FIG. 35 contacts 3512 and the
   insulating ring formed by plastic insulator 3520 can be substantially flush with a surrounding
   surface of device enclosure 1730. These surfaces can be curved, they can be substantially
15 flat, or they can have other contours and the contacts, insulating ring and surrounding exterior
   surface can combine to form a continuous smooth exterior surface of the device that contact
   area 3500 is incorporated into.
   [0063]     FIG. 36 illustrates a cutaway side view of a contact structure that can be used as the
   contact structure of FIG. 35. Again, contacts 3512 can be located in openings in device
20 enclosure 3530. Plastic insulator 3520 can be located between contact 3512 and device
   enclosure 3530. A surface of contact 3512 and a surface of plastic insulator 3520 can be
   substantially flush with a surface of device enclosure 3530. These surfaces can be curved,
   substantially flat, or they can have other contours. A silicone gasket or other seal 3610 can
   be located between plastic insulator 3520 and device enclosure 3530. Silicone gasket 3610
25 can prevent the ingress of liquids, moisture, or debris into the electronic device. Contacts
   3512 can include a contacting portion 3513 that can be soldered or otherwise attached to a
   trace on flexible circuit board 3620. A heat-activated film or adhesive 3630 can be used to
   fix flexible circuit board 3620 to plastic insulator 3520. Contact 3512 can further include
   tabs 3515 (of which contacting portion 3513 may be one of) and handle 3514. Bracket 3640

   [0064]     In various embodiments of the present disclosure, it may be desirable that a surface
   of contacts in a contact structure to be at least substantially flush with a surface of a device
   housing the contacts. But the sizes of the various components of this connector structure
   each have a manufacturing tolerance associated with them. The accumulation of these
 5 tolerances can lead to the surface of one or more contacts not being flush with a surface of the
   device. Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure can employ shims or other
   adjustments features to account for the errors that these tolerances can create. An example is
   shown in the following figures.
   [0065]     FIG. 37 illustrates a cutaway side view of another contact structure that can be used
10 as the contact structure of FIG. 35. Again, contacts 3512 can be located in openings in device
   enclosure 3530. Plastic insulator 3520 can be located between contact 3512 and device
   enclosure 3530. A surface of contact 3512 and a surface of plastic insulator 3520 can be
   substantially flush with, or recessed a limited amount relative to, a surface of device
   enclosure 3530. The surface of contact 3512, the surface of plastic insulator 3520, and the
15 surface of device enclosure 3530 can be curved, substantially flat, or they can have other
   contours. A silicone gasket or other seal 3610 can be located between plastic insulator 3520
   and device enclosure 3530. Silicone gasket 3610 can prevent the ingress of liquids, moisture,
   or debris into the electronic device. Contacts 3512 can include a contacting portion 3513 that
   can be soldered or otherwise attached to a trace on flexible circuit board 3620. A heat
20 activated film or adhesive 3630 can be used to fix flexible circuit board 3620 to plastic
   insulator 3520. Contact 3512 can further include tabs 3515 (of which contacting portion
   3531 can be one of) and handle 3514. Bracket 3640 can be located behind flexible circuit
   board 3620 and can hold contact 3512 in place in device enclosure 3530.
   [0066]     Again, it may be desirable that the surface of contact 3512 and a surface of plastic
25 insulator 3520 be substantially flush with a surface of device enclosure 3530. But the sizes of
   the various components of this connector structure each have a manufacturing tolerance
   associated with them. The accumulation of these tolerances can lead to the surface of one or
   more contacts 3512 not being flush with a surface 3530 of the device. Accordingly,
   embodiments of the present disclosure can employ shims 3710. Shim 3710 can be selected
30 from a set of shims having different sizes. Shim 3710 can have a size that is selected to
   compensate for the accumulated tolerances of the sizes of the different components in this
   connector structure such that the surface of contact 3512 and a surface of plastic insulator
   3520 can be substantially flush with a surface of device enclosure 3530.

   Bracket or cowling 3640 can be located behind flexible circuit board 3620 and can hold
   contacts 3512 in place in device enclosure 3530. Shim 3710 can be placed between plastic
   insulator 3520 and device enclosure 3530. Shim 3710 can be selected from a set of shims

   microns, between 0.5 to 0.85 microns, between 0.75 to 0.85 microns thick, or it can have
   another thickness. At an exposed surface of the contact, gold plating layer can be below the
   top plate. On other portions of the contact, the top plate can be omitted and the gold plating
   layer can be the first layer. This layer can be between 0.01 to 0.5 microns or between 0.05
