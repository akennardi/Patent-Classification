 5            Conventional shoes have a determined size and specification so that the
   shoes cannot exactly satisfy the requirement of users of different foot sizes. In
   addition, when the size of the shoes is too large, the user has to place cushions or
   pads into the shoes to compensate the clearance between the shoes and the user's
   feet, thereby easily causing uncomfortable sensation to the user. Further, it is often
10 necessary to provide shoelaces to tighten the shoes, thereby causing inconvenience
   to the user when needing to tie the shoelaces.
              It would be desirable to provide a shoe structure having an airbag device

   and 443 1a of the second oneway valve seat 443, the second oneway air outlet
   442 of the second control valve 44, the second outlet pipe 425a, the second air
   bag 42, the first outlet pipe 424a, the first oneway air outlet 432, the other one
 5 of the two first connecting pipes 4331 and 4331a, and the first connecting
   channel 4342 of the first regulating lever 434. Thus, when the second air bag
   42 is stepped by the foot heel 51, the second air bag 42 is contracted to
   compress the compression elastomer 422, and the air in the second air bag 42
   in turn passes through the first outlet pipe 424a, the first oneway air outlet 432,
10 the other one of the two first connecting pipes 4331 and 4331a, and the first
   connecting channel 4342 of the first regulating lever 434, and is drained
   outward from the first connecting channel 4342 of the first regulating lever 434
   as shown in FIG. 12. On the contrary, when the second air bag 42 is released
   from the foot heel 51, the second air bag 42 is expanded by the restoring force
15 of the compression elastomer 422 to produce a suction force, and the air in the
   first air bag 41 is drawn outward and in turn passes through the air nozzle 413,
   the air pipe 4433, the second connecting channel 4442 of the second regulating
   lever 444, the other one of the two second connecting pipes 4431 and 4431 a of
   the second oneway valve seat 443, the second oneway air outlet 442 of the
20 second control valve 44 and the second outlet pipe 425a into the second air bag
   42 as shown in FIG. 12. In such a manner, the second air bag 42 is contracted
                                             13

   and expanded reciprocally by actions of the foot heel 51, so that the first air bag
   41 is deflated successively.
              Accordingly, the first air bag 41 and the second air bag 42 construct a
   double airbag structure with a pressure regulating function to cover the user's
 5 foot elastically so as to provide a great buffering effect to the user's foot and
   provide a comfortable sensation to the user. In addition, the first air bag 41
   supports the user's foot elastically to release the pressure of the user's foot.
   Further, the first air bag 41 is inflated or deflated to support the user's foot
   ergonomically, without having to provide a shoelace, thereby facilitating the
10 user wearing the shoes. Further, the first air bag 41 is inflated or deflated by
   operation of the second air bag 42, so that the first air bag 41 encompasses the
   user's foot exactly to satisfy the ergonomics design. Further, the first air bag 41
   is inflated or deflated to fit the foot sizes of different users, thereby enhancing
   the versatility of the airbag device.
