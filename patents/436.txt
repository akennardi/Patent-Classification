HEARING AID WITH ELECTRONICS FRAME AND ANTENNA
INTEGRATED THEREIN
[0001] The invention relates to a hearing aid according to the preamble of claim 1 with a
housing and, inserted in the latter, an (electronics) frame which carries electrical or electronic
components of the hearing aid, and with an antenna which is designed to transmit and/or receive
electromagnetic waves (in particular radio signals, also called RF signals). Such a hearing aid is
known from WO 2014/090419 Al.
[0002] "Hearing aids" include portable hearing devices that serve to assist those with hearing
impairments. In order to satisfy the numerous individual needs, various structural types of
hearing aids are made available, such as behind-the-ear hearing devices (BTE), hearing aids
with an external receiver (RIC: receiver-in-canal), and in-the-ear hearing devices (ITE), e.g. also
concha hearing devices or canal hearing devices (ITE, CIC). The listed examples of hearing aids
are worn on the outer ear or in the auditory canal. In addition, however, bone conduction hearing
aids, implantable or vibrotactile hearing aids, are also available on the market. In these, the
damaged hearing is stimulated either mechanically or electrically. Such hearing aids are also
designated as "hearing devices".
[0003] In addition to the classic hearing aids described above, hearing aids have also recently
been developed that assist people with normal hearing. Such hearing aids are also referred to as
"Personal Sound Amplification Products" or "Personal Sound Amplification Devices"
(abbreviated to "PSAD"). These hearing aids are not provided to compensate for hearing losses.
Instead, such hearing aids are used precisely to assist and improve normal human hearing
capacity in specific hearing situations, e.g. to assist hunters out on the hunt, or in order to assist
in the observation of animals, to be better able to perceive animal noises and other sounds
generated by animals, for sports reporters in order to permit improved speaking and/or speech
understanding under difficult conditions, for musicians, in order to reduce the stress on their
hearing, and so on.
[0004] In principle, the essential components of hearing aids are an input transducer, an
amplifier and an output transducer. The input transducer is normally an acoustic-electric
transducer, e.g. a microphone, and/or an electromagnetic receiver, e.g. an induction coil. The
output transducer is generally realized as an electroacoustic transducer, e.g. a miniature

                                                  2
loudspeaker (receiver), or an electromechanical transducer, e.g. a bone-conduction receiver. The
amplifier is usually integrated in a signal-processing device.
[0005] Modem hearing aids are often equipped with transmitting and/or receiving units that
permit wireless communication with other electronic devices, in particular with other hearing
aids (e.g. in order to form a binaural hearing aid system), remote controls, programming devices
or cell phones. The wireless communication is often effected by means of electromagnetic
waves in the radiofrequency range, e.g. using Bluetooth technology at 2.4 GHz.
[0006] A problem with hearing aids lies in the realization of the (RF) antennas needed for them,
since standard antenna designs cannot easily be used on account of the free-space wavelength
(corresponding to the abovementioned frequency range) of more than 10 cm and on account of
the electrically small volume of conventional hearing aids. This problem is becoming
increasingly important as the miniaturization of hearing aids gathers pace.
[0007] In the hearing aid known from WO 2014/090419 Al, the antenna is formed by a
conductive structure which is an integral part of the (electronics) frame of the hearing aid. This
allows the antenna to be accommodated in a space-saving manner in the housing of the hearing
aid. Moreover, the antenna can be installed with the frame in a large number of different
housings, without the antenna design always having to be reconfigured.
[0008] The object of the invention is to at least substantially address the above problem or at
least provide an alternative to the antenna design known from WO 2014/090419 Al.
[0009] The hearing aid according to the invention comprises a housing and, inserted in the
housing, an (electronics) frame for receiving electrical and/or electronic assemblies. The
assemblies received in the frame comprise a transmitting and/or receiving unit for
electromagnetic waves, in particular radio waves in the MHz or GHz range (e.g. 2.4 GHz). The
hearing aid moreover comprises an antenna which is assigned to the transmitting and/or
receiving unit and which is configured as an integral part of the frame. Integral part is to be
understood here in particular as meaning that the antenna or a structure partially or completely
forming the antenna cannot be released from the frame without destruction and/or is
substantially part of the outer shape of the frame, i.e. does not protrude much therefrom, wherein
the frame is made of a different, non-conductive material, in particular a plastic. In an

                                                   3
alternative embodiment of the invention, the antenna is designed as a stamped/bent part
(connected to the frame) or as an inlay part (connected to the frame) made of metal.
[0010] According to the invention, the antenna comprises two parts which are each configured
as an open loop, wherein these two loop-shaped parts of the antenna, hereinafter abbreviated to
"antenna loops", are electrically shorted to each other by one of the two (loop) ends. At least one
of the two other ends of the two antenna loops is in contact with the transmitting and/or
receiving unit. In particular, the antenna is designed as a folded dipole antenna. The ends of both
antenna loops are preferably arranged at the same longitudinal end of the frame.
[0011] Through the integration of the antenna on the frame, in combination with the double
loop shape of the antenna, it is considerably easier to achieve the antenna length that is
necessary for effective transmitting and/or receiving characteristics of the antenna. Each antenna
loop then preferably has a length which corresponds with good approximation to a quarter or an
eighth of the wavelength of the radio waves for which the transmitting and/or receiving unit is
designed.
[0012] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the two antenna loops are connected to each
other electrically conductively, i.e. shorted, via at least one bridge. Such a bridge or a part of
such a bridge is formed for example by at least one electrical conductor track which completely
or at least partially bridges the distance between the short-circuit ends of the antenna loops and
which is therefore referred to below as a "bridging conductor". Like the entire antenna, the or
each bridging conductor is configured as an integral part of the frame, stamped/bent part or inlay
part.
[0013] In one expedient configuration, the frame is formed by two frame halves, each one of the
two antenna loops being arranged respectively on one of the two frame halves. The two antenna
loops are preferably configured symmetrically to each other with respect to a separating plane
that separates the frame halves. The symmetrical configuration of the antenna advantageously
facilitates a side-independent use of the hearing aid. This feature in other words allows one and
the same housing, including the frame and the components received in the latter, to be used both
for use on the left ear and also for use on the right ear.
[0014] However, in differing embodiments of the invention, the two antenna loops can also be
formed asymmetrically with respect to each other. The asymmetric configuration of the two

                                                   4
antenna loops is preferably always chosen when a symmetrical configuration of the antenna
loops would lead to stronger electromagnetic interference between the antenna and the other
electrical or electronic assemblies in or on the frame. The asymmetry between the two antenna
loops is preferably slight. The antenna loops are in particular made as symmetrical as possible
while avoiding said interference.
[0015] In embodiments of the invention with a two-part frame, the two antenna loops in a
preferred embodiment of the invention are shorted to each other via two bridging conductors
which, as has been mentioned above, are designed as integral parts of the frame, with one of
said bridging conductors being arranged respectively on one of the two frame halves. To
produce an electrical cross-connection between the antenna loops, the two bridging conductors
are soldered to each other. In this case, a bridge connecting the two antenna loops electrically to
each other is then formed by the two bridging conductors and a soldered connection or a solder
point. The antenna, on the other hand, is typically formed by the two antenna loops and the
bridge or bridges connecting the two antenna loops.
[0016] In an expedient embodiment, at least one of the two bridging conductors is arranged on a
collar structure of the associated frame half which extends over the entire width of the frame as
far as the lateral surface of the other frame half. The two bridging conductors are in this case
soldered to each other on this surface of the other frame half. This configuration of the frame
halves and of the bridging conductors allows the bridging conductors to be laterally soldered in
a manner that is advantageous from the point of view of process engineering (in particular
through ease of access), i.e. soldered on one side surface of the frame.
[0017] It is also of advantage if the two antenna loops are each arranged on a flank or in a side
region of the frame. Here, side region or flank designates a side of the frame that connects an
upper face and an underside of the frame. The corresponding designation of the sides of the
frame with upper face, underside and flank relates to the intended orientation of the hearing aid
relative to a wearer or user of the hearing aid while wearing the corresponding hearing aid. The
underside of the frame then typically points in the direction of the trunk of the user or wearer,
and one of the two flanks or one of the side regions points in the direction of the head, while the
other of the two flanks or the other of the two side regions is directed away from the head. The
resulting relative arrangement and/or orientation of the two antenna loops relative to the user or

                                                  5
wearer of the hearing aid is relevant as regards the radiating characteristics of the antenna during
transmission.
[0018] Particularly when the two antenna loops are arranged in the region of the two flanks of
the frame, it is moreover of advantage if, in order to form a bridge, a conductor structure, for
example a conductor track or an aforementioned bridging conductor, is routed over the upper
face of the frame. This conductor structure is then designed, for example, as a continuous
conductor track or as a continuous conductor strip and extends from one of the ends of one
antenna loop to one of the ends of the other antenna loop.
[0019] It is furthermore advantageous for the embodiment and the arrangement of the antenna
and the conductor structures thereof if the corresponding conductor structures are positioned as
far away as possible from other metallic elements, such as for example, electronic components
arranged in or on the frame. In this way, undesired interactions may be reduced or avoided.
[0020] If the frame is designed in one part, or if the conductor structures partially or completely
forming the antenna are realized or formed after a multi-part frame has been assembled, the
conductor structures can be configured or designed in such an way that no visible or clearly
defined transition can be discerned between the antenna loops and the conductor structure that
forms the bridge and connects the two ends of the two antenna loops. In this case, the position of
the ends of the two antenna loops is then virtually defined by the geometry of the frame. That is
to say, the antenna loops in such a case extend only over the flanks of the frame, whereas the
conductor structure forming the bridge extends only over the upper face of the frame.
[0021] However, an above-described two-part design of the frame is preferred. The two-part
design is preferably such that the separating plane separating the two frame halves divides the
upper face and the underside of the frame in two, but not the flanks. In this case, in order to form
a bridge on both frame halves, a conductor structure, in particular a conductor track or a
bridging conductor, is preferably formed which extends from the end of the antenna loop,
positioned on the corresponding frame half, as far as the separating plane, specifically in such a
way that the corresponding two conductor structures or bridging conductors of the two frame
halves meet each other head on at the separating plane or lie opposite each other in a manner
separated by the separating plane. In this case, the conductor structures partially or completely

                                                   6
forming the antenna can be mounted on the individual frame parts before the frame is
assembled.
[0022] After the frame has been assembled, i.e. after the individual frame parts have been joined
together, the bridge is then completed, for example by a contact, or by the fact that the
conductor structures or bridging conductors lying opposite each other or abutting each other in
the region of the separating plane are soldered to each other, in particular by application of a
solder point, or electrically conductively connected to each other in another way.
[0023] Particularly if the application of a solder point or a connection via an additional
connection element of relevant volume is provided, it is moreover of advantage if a depression
is formed on the frame in the region of the separating plane and in the region in which the
conductor structures or the bridging conductors meet at the separating plane. In this way, a
produced solder point or another connection element completing the bridge is arranged in a
recessed state and thus, for example, protected from damage.
[0024] In one embodiment variant, a bridge of this kind spanning the upper face is arranged in
the region of the front face or front of the frame, i.e. the side of the frame that is directed toward
the wearer's face when the hearing aid is being worn.
[0025] In an advantageous refinement, the two antenna loops are in addition electrically
conductively connected to each other via a second bridge, in particular a second bridge spaced
apart from the first one. In this case, the second bridge is preferably likewise routed over the
upper face of the frame. If the frame is in two parts in the manner described above, then, in the
case of the second bridge too, conductor structures or bridging conductors are preferably also
arranged on both frame halves and are then electrically conductively connected to each other in
the region of the separating plane, for example by a solder point. Here too, it is again preferable
for a depression to be arranged on the frame in this region in order for a corresponding
connection element, e.g. a solder point, to be arranged in a recessed position.
[0026] Through the formation of a second bridge, a conductor structure is realized in which the
two bridges, together with conductors of the two antenna loops connecting the two bridges, form
a conductor ring, i.e. a closed annular structure made of a conductive material. In addition, this
has a favorable effect on the radiating characteristics of the antenna during transmission.

                                                    7
[0027] If two bridges are now provided, then, according to an expedient embodiment variant,
one bridge is arranged in the region of the front of the frame and routed over the upper face of
the frame, and one bridge is arranged in the region of the rear face of the frame lying opposite
the front and is routed over the upper face of the frame.
[0028] Particularly if two bridges are provided, it is moreover preferable that one of the two
bridges is positioned in a region above the position of the battery or of the battery compartment
of the hearing aid.
[0029] In this case, the positions of the linking points or connecting points of the bridges are
also of particular importance, that is, the positions along the two antenna loops, to which the
bridges connect or at which the bridges are connected to the two antenna loops. The latter are
expediently chosen such that an advantageous, relative phase position is the result. In so doing,
it is the aim to ensure that the partial waves radiated away from the conductor structures of the
antenna overlap one another, that is, particularly in a structural sense.
[0030] According to an advantageous refinement of the invention, the frame is made from a
non-conductive material, in particular a plastic, that has a higher permittivity than the material
of the housing. The frame material of the hearing aid according to the invention also has in
particular a higher permittivity than materials that are generally used for electronics frames of
conventional hearing aids. In particular, the frame material of the hearing aid according to the
invention has a relative permittivity of at least 3.8, preferably at least 4.5. It has been found that
the increased permittivity of the frame material as a result of dielectric interaction with the
electromagnetic field that is produced or received by the antenna allows significant shortening
of the antenna length at given transmitting/receiving characteristics. This in turn represents a
considerable advantage for accommodating the antenna on the frame.
[0031] For the integration of the antenna or parts of the antenna in the frame, the surface of the
frame is preferably first of all structured in such a way that, when the conductive layer is
applied, the latter is applied only as per the structuring. This is effected, for example, by means
of laser direct structuring (LDS). The surface of the frame is in this case treated with a laser in
such a way that a conductor track deposits only on the treated locations in an electroplating bath.

                                                   8
[0032] In another embodiment of the method, a conductive layer is first of all applied to the
surface of the frame, after which the conductive layer is structured. In this case, the conductive
layer is applied, for example, by bonding, sputtering or some other means.
[0033] In a further alternative in this context, the antenna is printed onto the frame or parts of
the antenna are printed onto the frame.

[0048] Parts that correspond to each other are always provided with the same reference signs in
all of the figures.
[0049] Fig. 1 simply shows the principal elements of a hearing aid 100, without reproducing the
true positions, connections or shapes of said elements.
[0050] The hearing aid 100 shown in Fig. 1 is a behind-the-ear hearing aid 100. However, the
invention is also conceivable for in-the-ear hearing aids, in which case there is then a different
arrangement of the components shown.
[0051] The hearing aid 100 has a housing 1 which is made of plastic and in which a frame 11 is
inserted. The frame 11 is an injection-molded plastics part. The frame 11 serves generally to
hold electrical and electronic assemblies of the hearing aid 100 and to fix these assemblies in
defined positions relative to one another. Specifically, one or more microphones 2 for receiving
sound (i.e. acoustic signals) from the environment are arranged in the frame 11. For this
purpose, a printed circuit board (PCB) carrying at least some of said electrical or electronic
components is in particular folded into the frame 11.
[0052] The microphones 2 are acoustic-electric transducers for converting the sound into audio
signals. A signal-processing device 3, which is likewise integrated in the housing 1, processes
these audio signals. The output signal of the signal-processing device 3 is transmitted to a
loudspeaker or receiver 4, which emits an acoustic signal. The sound is transmitted to the
eardrum of the device wearer, possibly via a sound tube that is fixed in the auditory canal with
an ear mold. The power supply for the hearing aid and particularly for the signal-processing
device 3 is provided by a battery 5 that is likewise integrated in the housing 1. The signal
processing device 3, the receiver 4 and the battery 5 are likewise arranged in the frame 11, such

                                                  10
that the frame with the components arranged therein can easily be removed from the housing,
for example in order to be able to exchange the housing 1.
[0053] The signal-processing device 3 according to the invention is also designed to process
electromagnetic waves. The signal-processing device 3 has a transmitting and receiving device 6
for producing and detecting electromagnetic waves and/or for decoding. The transmitting and
receiving device 6 is electrically connected to an antenna 10 in order to transmit and receive
electromagnetic waves.
[0054] The antenna 10 is configured as an integral part of the frame 11, namely as a conductive
structure integrated in the frame 11. The antenna 10 is mounted directly on the frame 11. It is
not spaced apart from the surface and cannot be released from the frame 11 without destruction.
[0055] The antenna 10 is mounted on the frame 11 in particular using MID technology. This is
accomplished in particular by using laser direct structuring (LDS). In an alternative
embodiment, the antenna 10 is printed directly onto the frame 11. The conductor structures put
onto the surface of the frame 11 are then optionally electrically insulated and protected against
damage by a protective lacquer or coating.
[0056] Figures 2 to 6 show a first embodiment of the frame 11 with the antenna 10 integrated
therein. An opening 30, below which the microphone 2 (or one of several microphones 2) is
arranged, is provided on the upper face 36 of the frame 11 as seen in the view according to Fig.
2. Recesses in the frame 11, which are not shown explicitly, serve to accommodate the receiver
4 and the transmitting and receiving unit 6. Moreover, the frame 11 forms a battery
compartment 34 (see Fig. 3) for accommodating the battery 5.
[0057] When the hearing aid 100 is operated as intended, a sound tube is attached to a tip or
front 35 of the frame 11 and allows the sound generated by the receiver 4 to be conveyed to an
ear mold insertable into the auditory canal of a user. The sound tube and the ear mold are not
shown in Fig. 2. When the hearing aid is being worn as intended on the ear, the frame 11 is
oriented in its longitudinal direction 21 with the tip of front 35 facing forward in the viewing
direction of the wearer. A transverse direction 20 of the frame 11 is perpendicular to the viewing
direction of the wearer and more or less parallel to the connecting line between the ears of the
wearer. Parts of the antenna 10 are arranged on the lateral surfaces or flanks 37 of the frame 11.

                                                  11
[0058] The frame 11 is divided into two frame halves 42 and 43 lengthwise (i.e. perpendicular
to the transverse direction 20) along a dividing plane or separating plane 38. After the insertion
of the assemblies accommodated therein, the frame halves 42 and 43 are in this case connected
by means of clipping, screwing, adhesive bonding and/or by means of retaining pins.
[0059] In the embodiment of the hearing aid 100 shown in Figures 2 to 6, the antenna 10 has
two parts which each have the shape of an open loop and are therefore designated below as
antenna loops 40 and 41. The antenna loop 40 is arranged on the frame half 42, while the
antenna loop 41 is arranged on the other frame half 43.
[0060] The two antenna loops 40 and 41, seen transversely with respect to the dividing plane or
separating plane 38 of the frame 11, run parallel to each other and are thus aligned with each
other. The antenna 10 therefore has mirror symmetry with respect to the dividing plane or
separating plane 38 of the frame 11.
[0061] Each of the two antenna loops 40 and 41 has two respective ends 44 and 45 (cf. Fig. 4).
In this case, both ends 44 and 45 are each arranged at the same longitudinal end of the frame 11
(namely at the tip or front 35). The two ends 44 of the two antenna loops 40 and 41 are
electrically shorted to each other via an electrical cross-connection or bridge 46 that also spans
the separation of the two frame halves 42, 43. The two other ends 45 are in contact with the
transmitting and receiving device 6.
[0062] In the embodiment shown in Figures 2 to 6, the cross- connection or bridge 46 is formed
at least partly by conductor tracks, which are referred to below as bridging conductors 47 and 48
(cf. Fig. 6), and which are likewise mounted directly on the frame halves 42 and 43 of the frame
11 using MID technology (particularly by means of LDS). The bridging conductor 47 connected
to the antenna loop 40 is in this case mounted on a collar structure 49 of the frame half 42 that
extends over the entire width of the frame 11 as far as the opposite lateral surface of the other
frame half 43. This can be seen particularly in Fig. 6, which shows the frame 11 in the closed
state with the frame halves 42 and 43 fully joined together. By contrast, Fig. 5 shows the frame
11 in a partially opened state in which the frame halves 42 and 43 are drawn slightly apart from
each other. The bridging conductor 48 connected to the antenna loop 41 is mounted on the frame
half 43 such that it meets the bridging conductor 47 at the end of the collar structure 49 at a
meeting point 50. At this meeting point 50, bridging conductors 47 and 49 are electrically

                                                  12
connected to each other by a solder joint 51. The meeting point 50 situated on the lateral surface
of the frame half 43 allows the bridging conductors 47 and 49 to be soldered laterally in a
manner that is advantageous in terms of process engineering.
[0063] The frame half 43 is also provided with a collar structure 52 that reaches as far as the
lateral surface of the other frame half 42. The collar structures 49 and 52 engage in a toothed
manner into the respective other frame half 43 or 42. The collar structures 49 and 52 therefore
bring about mechanical stabilization of the frame 11. This stability is advantageous particularly
for stabilizing the solder joint 51 between the bridging conductors 47, 48. The bridging
conductor 47 runs between the collar structures 49 and 52. It is protected thereby and routed at a
distance from other electrical or electronic components, such that electromagnetic interference
between the antenna 10 and said other electrical or electronic components is avoided.
[0064] The distribution of the antenna 10 over both frame halves 42 and 43 firstly facilitates the
provision of the required antenna length. Secondly, the symmetrical formation of the antenna 10
with respect to the two frame halves 42 and 43 advantageously facilitates side-independent use
of the hearing aid 100. In other words, this feature allows one and the same housing 1, including
the frame 11 and the components received therein, to be used both for use on the left ear and for
use on the right ear.
[0065] The frame 11 is produced from a plastic that has a much higher permittivity than the
housing 1. It has been found that the increased permittivity of the frame material as a result of
dielectric interaction with the electromagnetic field that is produced and received by the antenna
10 allows significant shortening of the antenna length.
[0066] Figures 7 and 8 show a variant or second embodiment of the above-described hearing aid
100. The variant according to Figures 7 and 8 differs from the embodiment of the hearing aid
100 described above in that the bridging conductors 47 and 48 and the solder joint 51 are absent.
Instead, the variant shown in Figures 7 and 8 is provided with an electrically conductive
retaining pin 60 that passes through the two frame halves 42 and 43, such that the ends 44 of the
two antenna loops 40 and 41 are electrically shorted to each other. The retaining pin 60 is
furthermore also used for mechanically fixing the two frame halves 42 and 43 to each other.
[0067] A further embodiment variant of the hearing aid 100 is shown in Fig. 9. The main
difference here from the above-described embodiment variants lies in the design of the bridge

                                                  13
46 with which the two antenna loops 40, 41 are shorted. In the embodiment according to Fig. 9,
the whole bridge 46 is formed externally on the frame 11 and routed over the upper face 36 of
the frame 11.
[0068] The frame 11 is again designed in two parts, and an antenna loop 40, 41 is positioned on
each frame half 42, 43, in each case in the region of the flank 37. The antenna loops 40, 41
terminating at the transition to the upper face 36 of the frame 11 are here continued by external
bridging conductors 61, 62 as far as the separating plane 38 and meet each other at the
separating plane 38 or terminate here opposite each other. To form an electrical connection
between these bridging conductors 61, 62, the latter are preferably connected electrically
conductively to each other by means of a connection element, for example a solder point 64.
The corresponding solder point 64 or the corresponding connection element is more preferably
recessed in a depression 66 in the frame 11. In this illustrative embodiment, the antenna 10 is
then formed only by conductor structures or conductor elements positioned externally on the
frame 11, as is also depicted in Fig. 10. Only the antenna 10 is shown in this view, as the frame
11 has been faded out.
[0069] An advantageous development of the hearing aid 100 according to Fig. 9 is shown in
Fig. 11 to Fig. 13. Here, a second bridge 46 is additionally formed which in turn connects the
antenna loops 40, 41 electrically conductively to each other. One of the two bridges 46 is in this
case arranged in the region of the tip or front 35 of the frame 11 and routed over the upper face
36 of the frame 11, and the other of the two bridges 46 is positioned in the region of the rear
face of the frame 11 lying opposite the front 35 and likewise routed over the upper face 36 of the
frame 11. The second bridge 46 is in this case also formed by two bridging conductors 67, 68
which are connected electrically conductively to each other, in the region of the separating plane
38, via a solder point 64 arranged in a depression 66 or via another connection element.
[0070] In further variants (not shown) according to the invention for the hearing aid 100, the
two antenna loops 40, 41 are formed asymmetrically in relation to each other. The asymmetric
form of the two antenna loops 40, 41 is preferably chosen when a symmetrical form of the
antenna loops 40, 41 would lead to greater electromagnetic interference between the antenna 10
and the other electrical or electronic components in or on the frame 11. The asymmetry between
the two antenna loops 40 and 41 is preferably small in this case. The 40, 41 are made as
symmetrical as possible particularly in order to avoid said interference.

                                                  14
[0071] The invention will be particularly clear from the illustrative embodiments described
above. However, it is not limited to these illustrative embodiments. Instead, many other
embodiments of the invention may be derived from the claims and from the above description.
