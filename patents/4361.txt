 TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0001]     The present invention relates to spectacles and,
more particularly to a manner of manufacture    and assembly
 of spectacles.
BACKGROUND
 [0002]    The sourcing and purchase of a pair of spectacles
which, in effect become part of a person's appearance is
often a daunting task. Apart from the expense of
prescription lenses,   frames are also a major expense for
some people.
 [0003]    Moreover, once a decision on a frame is made and
the lenses ground to the required optical properties and
shaped to  suit the selected frame, a wearer is committed to
that frame and the appearance it lends to the wearer, and
it is not possible, until new frames are purchased to
change that appearance.
 [0004]    It is an object of the present invention to
address or at least ameliorate some of the above
disadvantages or provide a useful alternative.
Notes
[0005]     The term "comprising"  (and grammatical variations
thereof) is used in this specification in the inclusive
sense of "having" or "including", and not in the exclusive
sense of "consisting only of".

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
 [00046]   With reference to figs 1 and 2,  there is
illustrated an interchangeable spectacle frame structure
system 110 whereby a user can have assembled or assemble
themselves without the need for tools a pair of spectacles
111 of the type seen in figure 2.
 [00047]   The system 110 is based around a front spectacle
frame 112 of a specified, consistent shape profile to which
can be interchangeably attached side arms 113.
[00048]    The basis of the system is that the front
spectacle frame   112 will be available in only a limited
number of sizes intended to cater for head sizes
corresponding to children through to adults. For a given
user having a given head size, their choice will be to
select side arms of their choice to go with the front
spectacle frame 112 of their choice. In relation to the
front spectacle frame   112 the choice will be related to the
composition and therefore appearance of the actual frame
component 112A but not to the shape of the frame. For the

                            - 10
side arms 113,  there will also be a choice of lengths of
the side arms, but, again, the basic shape will not change.
 [00049]  As will be discussed further in this application,
it is expected that a user will have the choice of a
selection of front spectacle frames 112  and side arms 113
that have been pre-manufactured. In some contexts, the user
will also have the additional choice of selecting a
material from which the front spectacle  frame 112 and/or
the side arms 113 are to be manufactured and the components
will be manufactured in situ using an on-site plastics
injection machine which will have appropriate dies premade
ready to manufacture the limited size range of components
forming the system 110.
 [00050]  Broadly the system 110 provides a universal style
of spectacle frame which will be available in a limited,
predetermined number of different sizes and which will
allow interchange-ability of arms both between any given
size frame and, indeed, between frames of different  sizes
from the predetermined number of different sizes.
[00051]   In a particular preferred form, the number of
different sizes available for the front spectacle frame 112
will be in the range 3 to 7 and more preferably 5.
[000521   An additional feature of this arrangement is  that
the interchange-ability allows users not only choice at the
time of initial construction and purchase, but also
subsequently, should they wish to trade or swap parts with
other users.
[00053]   Figure 3 is an exploded view of the spectacles of
figure 2 showing detail of at least one manner of effecting
interchangeability of the components of the system of

                              - 11
figure 1.   In a particular form the lens 114 may be user
releasably retained in a channel 115 as illustrated in the
inset of figure 3. In a further particular form there may
be a ledge portion 116 adjacent the channel     115 constructed
so that if the ledge portion is urged away from the lens
114 the channel 115 is deformed so as to facilitate the
release of the lens 114    from the channel  115-preferably
just by the use of the    fingers of a user.
First Preferred Embodiment
 [00054]   In a first preferred embodiment of the invention
now with reference to Figures 1, 2,    3 generally but
particularly figs 7 and 8, the lens supporting portion 40
of the spectacle frames is provided at each outer end 42
with one half of a conventional hinge structure comprising
at least two hinge lobes 44 provided with through holes 46
designed to accept a hinge pin.
[00055]    In this embodiment, the leading end of each side
arm is likewise provided with half of a conventional hinge
structure again comprising lobes    48 which can mesh with the
lobes 44 of the hinge structure on the lens supporting
portion 40.
[00056]    In this second embodiment, the securing of the
side arm 41 to the lens supporting portion is again by
means of a U-shaped clip 50.    In this instance also, a first
leg 52 of the clip is in the form of a cylindrical shaft,
but in this case the   shaft is designed for insertion
through the through holes 46 of the lobes of both halves of
the hinge structures on the side arms and the lens
supporting portion, thereby pivotally connecting the side
arm to the lens supporting portion.

                             -  12
 [00057]   The second leg 54 of the U-shaped clip in this
 embodiment is also of generally rectangular section and is
designed to   slide into a channel 56 provided in the outer
 surface of the side arm, in similar manner to that
 described for the first embodiment above. A preferred
 arrangement of the hinge elements and the location of the
clip 50 is   shown in Figure 7.
 [00058]   It  is an object of the invention to provide
spectacle frames at point of sale outlets while people
wait. It is a further object of the invention that
different combinations of side arms and lens supporting
potions of spectacles according to a wearer's preferences
can be readily provided. Moreover, a wearer may choose to
purchase several different styles or colours of side arms
which the wearer may, without the need of tools,
interchange at will.
 [00059]   According to a further aspect of the invention,
point-of-sale outlets are provided with small injection
moulding machines adapted to accept a range of tooling for
different sizes and shapes of both lens supporting portions
and side arms. As well, these machines are capable of
injection moulding a range of plastics and composite
materials. Thus a wearer is provided with the option of
selecting a variety of configurations of spectacle frames
appearances and materials, and be provided with his or her
selections "on the spot".   In one form the plastics may
comprise the minor portion of the composition with the
major portion being an alternative non-plastics materials
such as,  for example, a cellulosic material   (thereby
imparting a "woody" appearance to the frame and/or side arm
as the case may be).

                              - 13
 Second Preferred Embodiment
 [000601    With reference to Figure 4, in a second preferred
 embodiment of the spectacle frames 10 according to the
present invention, the frames conventionally comprise a
 lens supporting portion 12 and a pair of side arms     (part of
 only one of which is   shown) which are enabled to pivot
between a wearable position and a folded position as well
 known in the art.
 [00061]   In the spectacle frames of this embodiment
however, the side arms are detachable and interchangeable.
Although this is also the case in conventional spectacle
constructions that the side arms can be detachable, the
removal  (or assembly) of the   side arms  can normally only be
achieved by tools and is generally beyond the average
wearer. Furthermore the    conventional spectacle
constructions do not have side arms which are
interchangeable in the sense contemplated in the present
application. The present application and in this embodiment
there is only a relatively small    set of side arm shapes to
select from. The composition of the side arms available to
the user may vary markedly as discussed elsewhere based on
the ability to select construction material in accordance
with embodiments of this    invention.
[00062]    As shown in Figure 4, the lens supporting portion
12 of the spectacle frames of the invention are provided
with side arm attachment elements 16 which are pivotally
connected to the lens supporting portion 12.     These side arm
attachment elements   16 pivot about a hinge pin or screw 18
in the conventional way. Each side arm attachment     element
16 is provided with a socket    18 adapted to receive the

                             - 14
 leading end 20 of a side arm 14,   and is further provided
 with a cylindrical socket or through hole 22, the axis of
 which is preferably parallel to that of the hinge pin or
 screw 18.
 [00063]   The leading end of the side arms are   shaped to
 enable the leading end to be slidingly inserted into the
 socket of the side arm supporting element 16. As well, the
 leading end of the side arm is provided with a channel 24
 in the outer surface of the side arm, and transverse to the
long axis of the side arm. The channel 22    is positioned on
the leading end such that when the side arm has been slid
into the socket of the side arm attachment element 16,     the
separation between the channel 24    and the cylindrical
socket or through hole 22 of the side arm attachment
element are spaced apart to suit a securing clip 26.
 [00064]   The securing clip 26 comprises a U-shaped clip
provided with a first leg 28 is in the form of a
cylindrical shaft sized to be inserted into the cylindrical
socket or through hole 22  of the side arm attachment
element 16 as a close sliding fit.
 [00065]   The second leg 30 of the clip 26 is in the    form
of a generally rectangular section bar, sized so as to
slide into the channel 24  provided at the leading end of
the side arm.
[00066]    To assemble a side arm to the lens   supporting
portion of the spectacles of the invention therefore, the
leading end of the side arm is   firstly slid into the socket
at the end of the side arm attachment element, and first
and second legs of the U-shaped clip are then respectively
inserted into the cylindrical socket or through hole of the
side arm attachment element and the channel at the leading

                             - 15
 end of the side arm. By this means the side arm is secured
 to the side arm attachment element. It will be noted that
 the assembly requires no tools for the operation.
 [00067]    The reverse, that is disassembly, may also be
 accomplished without tools.  The clip may be pushed up and
 removed from its location in the cylindrical socket or
 through hole and the channel, and the leading end of the
 side arm slid out of the socket in the side arm attachment
 element.
Third Preferred Embodiment
 [00068]   With reference to  figure 9, there is illustrated
an exploded view of a spectacle frames system provided with
hinge elements linking the side arms of the frames to the
lens supporting portion of the frame utilising an
alternative connection arrangement.
 [00069]   In this instance, a pin 60 having enlarged
portions  61,  62 is sized so as to be insertable into the
holes 46 of the lobes on the frame whereby the enlarged
portions 61,   62 are located between the lobes so as to
assist in retaining the pin 60 in the lobes and forming the
hinge.
[00070]    The sizing is such that a user may use a thumb
and forefinger to push the pin into the lobes and may
equally use thumb and forefinger to extract the pin 60    from
the lobes should they wish to change the   side arms at any
time.
[00071]    Again, the arrangement is such that specialised
tools are not required to effect the side arm change.

                              - 16
 System
 [00072]    With reference to figure 10,  the previously
 described spectacle frames system can be used as part of a
 substantially on-site and on-demand fully assembled
 spectacle frames and lens system 210.
 [00073]   With reference to figure 10,   the components of
 the spectacle frames according to a limited set of
 components thereof 211 as previously described can be
produced by an extrusion process 213.    In some instances,
plastics material may be derived from recycled plastics
materials. The selection of components 211 may be displayed
at a point of sale environment 212.
 [00074]   In some instances, the extrusion process 213 may
also be carried out at the point of sale environment
thereby including the extrusion process in the point of
sale environment 212A.
 [00075]   In use, a user enters the point of sale
environment 212 and has their inter-pupil distance    (IPD)
measured by an IPD measuring device 214 which may be a
simple mechanical device or can be an electronic purpose
built device. The reading of the IPD is fed into a lens
grinder 215.
 [00076]   Also  fed into the lens grinder is the desired
prescription for that user. The desired prescription may be
obtained by a prescription reader 216 which simply reads
the existing prescription of an existing pair of spectacles
of the user or the prescription may be derived by an
optometrist taking readings on-site according to current
best practice methodology. The lens grinder then, on-site,
produces lenses ground to the prescription and with the

                             - 17
 inter-pupil distance set appropriately for the frame 217
based on the frame measurements also having been fed to the
 lens grinder. As it will be appreciated, the frame
measurements will comprise only a limited subset
typically 3 (large, medium and small).
 [00077]    This arrangement allows a fully assembled
spectacles frame with lenses inserted with the correct
prescription tailored to the user who has selected the
spectacle frames components and also with the IPD of the
lenses correctly located in the frame to match with the
user's actual IPD as measured by measuring device 214.
 [00078]   The end result is that a user may enter a point
of sale with either no prescription glasses or with a set
of prescription glasses whose prescription the user may
which to substantially replicate in a new frame and with
IPD correctly set for the frame that they leave the point
of sale with.
[00079]    By virtue of the limited set of components from
which to choose, this aim can be achieved with the user
often experiencing an enhanced visual experience as
