                                           Background of the Invention
             Members of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important mediators of cell
growth, differentiation and survival. The receptor family includes four distinct members including
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB 1, or HERI), HER2 (ErbB2 or p185n."), HER3
(ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2). Members of the receptor family have been implicated in
various types of human malignancy.
             A recombinant humanized version of the murine anti-HER2 antibody 4D5 (huMAb4D5-8,

rhuMAb HER2, Trastuzumab or HERCEPTIN®; U.S. Patent No. 5,821,337) is clinically active in
patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti
cancer therapy (Baselga et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 14:737-744 (1996)).
             Trastuzumab received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration September
25, 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the
HER2 protein. At present, Trastuzumab is approved for use as a single agent or in combination with
chemotherapy or hormone therapy in the metastatic setting, and as single agent or in combination
with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment for patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.
Trastuzumab-based therapy is now the recommended treatment for patients with HER2-positive
early-stage breast cancer who do not have contraindications for its use (Herceptin* prescribing
information; NCCN Guidelines, version 2.2011). Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel (or paclitaxel) is a
registered standard of care in the first-line metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treatment setting (Slamon
et al. N Engl J Med. 2001;344(11):783-792.; Marty et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23(19):4265-4274).
             While the administration of Trastuzumab has led to excellent results in the treatment of breast
cancer, recent data from a clinical trial of lapatinib appear to suggest that even with administration of
Trastuzumab, HER2 plays an active role in tumor biology (Geyer et al., NEnglJMed 2006;
355:2733-2743).
             Patients treated with the HER2 antibody Trastuzumab are selected for therapy based on
HER2 expression. See, for example, W099/31140 (Patonet al.), US2003/0170234A1 (Hellmann,
S.), and US2003/0147884 (Paton et al.); as well as WOO 1/89566, US2002/0064785, and
US2003/0134344 (Mass et al.). See, also, US Patent No. 6,573,043, US Patent No. 6,905,830, and
US2003/0152987, Cohen et al., concerning immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) for detecting HER2 overexpression and amplification.          Thus, the optimal
management of metastatic breast cancer now takes into account not only a patient's general condition,
medical history, and receptor status, but also the HER2 status.
             Pertuzumab (also known as recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody 2C4 (rhuMAb
2C4); Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco) represents the first in a new class of agents known as
HER dimerization inhibitors (HDI) and functions to inhibit the ability of HER2 to form active
heterodimers or homodimers with other HER receptors (such as EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3 and
HER4). See, for example, Harari and Yarden Oncogene 19:6102-14 (2000); Yarden and Sliwkowski.
Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2:127-37 (2001); Sliwkowski Nat Struct Biol 10:158-9 (2003); Cho et al.
Nature 421:756-60 (2003); and Malik et al. Pro Am Soc CancerRes 44:176-7 (2003).
             Pertuzumab blockade of the formation of HER2-HER3 heterodimers in tumor cells has been
demonstrated to inhibit critical cell signaling, which results in reduced tumor proliferation and
survival (Agus et al. Cancer Cell 2:127-37 (2002)).

             Pertuzumab has undergone testing as a single agent in the clinic with a phase la trial in
patients with advanced cancers and phase II trials in patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer as
well as lung and prostate cancer. In a Phase I study, patients with incurable, locally advanced,
recurrent or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard therapy were treated
with Pertuzumab given intravenously every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab was generally well tolerated.
Tumor regression was achieved in 3 of 20 patients evaluable for response. Two patients had
confirmed partial responses. Stable disease lasting for more than 2.5 months was observed in 6 of 21
patients (Agus et al. Pro Am Soc Clin Oncol 22:192 (2003)). At doses of 2.0-15 mg/kg, the
pharmacokinetics of Pertuzumab was linear, and mean clearance ranged from 2.69 to 3.74 mL/day/kg
and the mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 15.3 to 27.6 days. Antibodies to Pertuzumab
were not detected (Allison et al. Pro Am Soc Clin Oncol 22:197 (2003)).
             US 2006/0034842 describes methods for treating ErbB-expressing cancer with anti-ErbB2
antibody combinations. US 2008/0102069 describes the use of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in the
treatment of HER2-positive metastatic cancer, such as breast cancer. Baselga et al., J Clin Oncol,
2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part I, Col. 25, No. 18S (June 20 Supplement), 2007:1004
report the treatment of patients with pre-treated HER2-positivebreast cancer, which has progressed
during treatment with Trastuzumab, with a combination of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab. Portera et
al., J Clin Oncol, 2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part I. Vol. 25, No. 18S (June 20
Supplement), 2007:1028 evaluated the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab combination
therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, who had progressive disease on Trastuzumab-based
therapy. The authors concluded that further evaluation of the efficacy of combination treatment was
required to define the overall risk and benefit of this treatment regimen.
             Pertuzumab has been evaluated in Phase II studies in combination with Trastuzumab in
patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have previously received Trastuzumab for
metastatic disease. One study, conducted by the National cancer Institute (NCI), enrolled 11 patients
with previously treated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Two out of the 11 patients exhibited
a partial response (PR) (Baselga et al., J Clin Oncol 2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings;
25:18S (June 20 Supplement): 1004. The results of a Phase II neoadjuvant study evaluating the effect
of a novel combination regimen of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (Docetaxel) in
women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, presented at the CTRC-AACR San Antonio
Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), December 8-12, 2010, showed that the two HER2 antibodies
plus Docetaxel given in the neoadjuvant setting prior to surgery significantly improved the rate of
complete tumor disappearance (pathological complete response rate, pCR, of 45.8 percent) in the
breast by more than half compared to Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel (pCR of 29. 0 percent), p=O.0 14.

                                             Summary of the Invention
             In a first aspect, the invention concerns a method for extending progression free survival in a
HER2-positive breast cancer patient population by 6 months or more comprising administering
Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab and chemotherapy (e.g. taxane, such as Docetaxel) to the patients in the
population. Optionally the method results in an objective response rate of 80% or more in the patients
in the population. The the breast cancer is optionally metastatic or locally recurrent, unresectable
breast cancer, or de novo Stage IV disease. In one embodiment, the patients in the population: have
not received previous treatment or have relapsed after adjuvant therapy, have a left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) of >50% at baseline, and/or have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1. Optionally, the HER2-positive breast cancer is defined as
immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification ratio
>2.0. Optionally, the method reduces the risk of death by about 34% or more relative to a patient
treated with Trastuzumab and the chemotherapy.
             In another aspect, the invention concerns a method of combining two HER2 antibodies to
treat HER2-positive cancer without increasing cardiac toxicity in a HER2-positive cancer patient
population, comprising administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and chemotherapy to the patients in
the population. Optionally, cardiac toxicity in the patient population is monitored for incidence of
symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or congestive heart failure (CHF), or for
decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The HER2-positive cancer is optionally, breast
cancer, for example metastatic or locally recurrent, unresectable breast cancer, or de novo Stage IV
disease.
             In another aspect, the invention concerns an article of manufacture comprising a vial with
Pertuzumab therein and a package insert, wherein the package insert provides the safety data in Table

10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             Optionally, the package insert further provides the Overall Survival (OS) efficacy data in
Example 9 or Table 14.
             In another aspect, the invention concerns a method of treating early-stage HER2-positive
breast cancer comprising administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and chemotherapy to a patient
with the breast cancer, wherein the chemotherapy comprises anthracycline-based chemotherapy (for
example, 5-FU, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC)), or carboplatin-based chemotherapy (for
example, Docetaxel and Carboplatin). Optionally, Pertuzumab is administered concurrently with the
anthracycline-based chemotherapy or the carboplatin-based chemotherapy. In one embodiment of
this method, Pertuzumab administration does not increase cardiac toxicity relative to the treatment
without Pertuzumab. Such treatment of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer optionally comprises
neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
             The invention further concerns a method of treating HER2-positive cancer in a patient
comprising co-administering a mixture of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab from the same intravenous
bag to the patient. Such method optionally further comprises administering chemotherapy to the
patient.
             In a related aspect, the invention provides an intravenous (IV) bag containing a stable mixture
of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab suitable for administration to a cancer patient. The mixture is
optionally in saline solution; e.g. comprising about 0.9% NaCl or about 0.45% NaCl. The IV bag is
optionally a 250mL 0.9% saline polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride infusion bag. In one embodiment,
the IV bag which contains a mixture of about 420mg or of about 840mg of Pertuzumab and from
about 200mg to about 1000mg of Trastuzumab. In one embodiment, the mixture is stable for up to 24
hours at 5'C or 30'C. Stability of the mixture can be evaluated by one or more assays selected from:
color, appearance and clarity (CAC), concentration and turbidity analysis, particulate analysis, size
exclusion chromatography (SEC), ion-exchange chromatography (IEC), capillary zone
electrophoresis (CZE), image capillary isoelectric focusing (iCIEF), or potency assay.
             The present invention provides a new treatment regimen for gastric cancer. In particular, the
present invention concerns the treatment of HER2-positivegastric cancer in human subjects with a

             1. Definitions
             In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context
requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or variations
such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the
stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments
of the invention.
             The term "chemotherapy" as used herein refers to treatment comprising the administration of
a chemotherapy, as defined hereinbelow.
             "Survival" refers to the patient remaining alive, and includes overall survival as well as
progression free survival.
             "Overall survival" or "OS" refers to the patient remaining alive for a defined period of time,
                                                                12
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

such as 1 year, 5 years, etc from the time of diagnosis or treatment. For the purposes of the clinical
trial described in the example, overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of
randomization of patient population to the date of death from any cause.
             "Progression free survival" or "PFS" refers to the patient remaining alive, without the cancer
progressing or getting worse. For the purpose of the clinical trial described in the example,
progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization of study population to the
first documented progressive disease, or unmanageable toxicity, or death from any cause, whichever
occurs first. Disease progression can be documented by any clinically accepted methods, such as, for
example, radiographical progressive disease, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) (Therasse et al., JNatI Ca Inst 2000; 92(3):205-216), carcinomatous meningitis
diagnosed by cytologic evaluation of cerebral spinal fluid, and/or medical photography to monitor
chest wall recurrences of subcutaneous lesions.
             By "extending survival" is meant increasing overall or progression free survival in a patient
treated in accordance with the present invention relative to an untreated patient and/or relative to a
patient treated with one or more approved anti-tumor agents, but not receiving treatment in
accordance with the present invention. In a particular example, "extending survival" means extending
progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) of cancer patients receiving the
combination therapy of the present invention (e.g. treatment with a combination of Pertuzumab,
Trastuzumab and a chemotherapy) relative to patients treated with Trastuzumab and the
chemotherapy only. In another particular example, "extending survival" means extending
progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) of cancer patients receiving the
combination therapy of the present invention (e.g. treatment with a combination of Pertuzumab,
Trastuzumab and a chemotherapy) relative to patients treated with Pertuzumab and the chemotherapy
only.
             An "objective response" refers to a measurable response, including complete response (CR)
or partial response (PR).
             By "complete response" or "CR" is intended the disappearance of all signs of cancer in
response to treatment. This does not always mean the cancer has been cured.
             "Partial response" or "PR" refers to a decrease in the size of one or more tumors or lesions, or
in the extent of cancer in the body, in response to treatment.
             A "HER receptor" is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the HER receptor
family and includes EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 receptors. The HER receptor will generally
comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an HER ligand and/or dimerize with another HER
receptor molecule; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be
                                                        13
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

phosphorylated. The HER receptor may be a "native sequence" HER receptor or an "amino acid
sequence variant" thereof Preferably the HER receptor is native sequence human HER receptor.
             The expressions "ErbB2" and "HER2" are used interchangeably herein and refer to human
HER2 protein described, for example, in Semba et al., PNAS (USA) 82:6497-6501 (1985) and
Yamamoto et al. Nature 319:230-234 (1986) (Genebank accession number X03363). The term
"erbB2" refers to the gene encoding human ErbB2 and "neu" refers to the gene encoding rat p1 8 5 "".
Preferred HER2 is native sequence human HER2.
             Herein, "HER2 extracellular domain" or "HER2 ECD" refers to a domain of HER2 that is
outside of a cell, either anchored to a cell membrane, or in circulation, including fragments thereof.
The amino acid sequence of HER2 is shown in Figure 1. In one embodiment, the extracellular
domain of HER2 may comprise four domains: "Domain I" (amino acid residues from about 1-195;
SEQ ID NO:1), "Domain II" (amino acid residues from about 196-319; SEQ ID NO:2), "Domain III"
(amino acid residues from about 320-488: SEQ ID NO:3), and "Domain IV" (amino acid residues
from about 489-630; SEQ ID NO:4) (residue numbering without signal peptide). See Garrett et al.
Mol. Cell.. 11: 495-505 (2003), Cho et al. Nature 421: 756-760 (2003), Franklin et al. Cancer Cell
5:317-328 (2004), and Plowman et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90:1746-1750 (1993), as well as Fig. 6
herein.
             "HER3"or "ErbB3" herein refer to the receptor as disclosed, for example, in US Pat. Nos.
5,183,884 and 5,480,968 as well as Kraus et al. PNAS (USA) 86:9193-9197 (1989).
             A "low HER3" cancer is one which expresses HER3 at a level less then the median level for
HER3 expression in the cancer type. In one embodiment, the low HER3 cancer is epithelial ovarian,
peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. HER3 DNA, protein, and/or mRNA level in the cancer can be
evaluated to determine whether the cancer is a low HER3 cancer. See, for example, US Patent No.
7,981,418 for additional information about low HER3 cancer. Optionally, a HER3 mRNA expression
assay is performed in order to determine that the cancer is a low HER3 cancer. In one embodiment,
HER3 mRNA level in the cancer is evaluated, e.g. using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), such as
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Optionally, the cancer expresses HER3 at a
concentration ratio equal or lower than about 2.81 as assessed qRT-PCR, e.g. using a a COBAS
z480@ instrument.
             A "HER dimer" herein is a noncovalently associated dimer comprising at least two HER
receptors. Such complexes may form when a cell expressing two or more HER receptors is exposed
to an HER ligand and can be isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as
described in Sliwkowski et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269(20):14661-14665 (1994), for example. Other
proteins, such as a cytokine receptor subunit (e.g. gp 130) may be associated with the dimer.
Preferably, the HER dimer comprises HER2.

             A "HER heterodimer" herein is a noncovalently associated heterodimer comprising at least
two different HER receptors, such as EGFR-HER2, HER2-HER3 or HER2-HER4 heterodimers.
             A "HER antibody" is an antibody that binds to a HER receptor. Optionally, the HER
antibody further interferes with HER activation or function. Preferably, the HER antibody binds to
the HER2 receptor. HER2 antibodies of interest herein are Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab.
             "HER activation" refers to activation, or phosphorylation, of any one or more HER receptors.
Generally, HER activation results in signal transduction (e.g. that caused by an intracellular kinase
domain of a HER receptor phosphorylating tyrosine residues in the HER receptor or a substrate
polypeptide). HER activation may be mediated by HER ligand binding to a HER dimer comprising
the HER receptor of interest. HER ligand binding to a HER dimer may activate a kinase domain of
one or more of the HER receptors in the dimer and thereby results in phosphorylation of tyrosine
residues in one or more of the HER receptors and/or phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in
additional substrate polypeptides(s), such as Akt or MAPK intracellular kinases.
             "Phosphorylation" refers to the addition of one or more phosphate group(s) to a protein, such
as a HER receptor, or substrate thereof.
             An antibody which "inhibits HER dimerization" is an antibody which inhibits, or interferes
with, formation of a HER dimer. Preferably, such an antibody binds to HER2 at the heterodimeric
binding site thereof. The most preferred dimerization inhibiting antibody herein is Pertuzumab or
MAb 2C4. Other examples of antibodies which inhibit HER dimerization include antibodies which
bind to EGFR and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors (for example
EGFR monoclonal antibody 806, MAb 806, which binds to activated or "untethered" EGFR; see
Johns et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279(29):30375-30384 (2004)); antibodies which bind to HER3 and inhibit
dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors; and antibodies which bind to HER4 and
inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors.
             A "HER2 dimerization inhibitor" is an agent that inhibits formation of a dimer or heterodimer
comprising HER2.
             A "heterodimeric binding site" on HER2, refers to a region in the extracellular domain of
HER2 that contacts, or interfaces with, a region in the extracellular domain of EGFR, HER3 or HER4
upon formation of a dimer therewith. The region is found in Domain II of HER2 (SEQ ID NO: 15).
Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004).
             A HER2 antibody that "binds to a heterodimeric binding site" of HER2, binds to residues in
Domain II (SEQ ID NO: 2) and optionally also binds to residues in other of the domains of the HER2
extracellular domain, such as domains I and III, SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3), and can sterically hinder, at
least to some extent, formation of a HER2-EGFR, HER2-HER3, or HER2-HER4 heterodimer.

deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (ID Code IS78), illustrating an exemplary antibody that
binds to the heterodimeric binding site of HER2.
             An antibody that "binds to domain II" of HER2 binds to residues in domain II (SEQ ID NO:
2) and optionally residues in other domain(s) of HER2, such as domains I and III (SEQ ID NOs: 1
and 3, respectively). Preferably the antibody that binds to domain II binds to the junction between
domains I, II and III of HER2.
             For the purposes herein, "Pertuzumab" and "rhuMAb 2C4", which are used interchangeably,
refer to an antibody comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID
NOs: 7 and 8, respectively. Where Pertuzumab is an intact antibody, it preferably comprises an IgGI
antibody; in one embodiment comprising the light chain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO: 11 or
 15, and heavy chain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO: 12 or 16. The antibody is optionally
produced by recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The terms "Pertuzumab" and
"rhuMAb 2C4" herein cover biosimilar versions of the drug with the United States Adopted Name
(USAN) or International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Pertuzumab.
             For the purposes herein, "Trastuzumab" and rhuMAb4D5", which are used interchangeably,
refer to an antibody comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences from
within SEQ ID Nos: 13 and 14, respectively. Where Trastuzumab is an intact antibody, it preferably
comprises an IgGI antibody; in one embodiment comprising the light chain amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 13 and the heavy chain amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14. The antibody is
optionally produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The terms "Trastuzumab" and
"rhuMAb4D5" herein cover biosimilar versions of the drug with the United States Adopted Name
(USAN) or International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Trastuzumab.
             The term "antibody" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal
antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies), and antibody
fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.
             "Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that
contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized
antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable
region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species
(donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity,
affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human
immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized
antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor
antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the
humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable
                                                       16
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non
human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin
sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details,
see Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and
Presta, Curr.Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992). Humanized HER2 antibodies specifically include
Trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN@) as described in Table 3 of U.S. Patent 5,821,337 expressly
incorporated herein by reference and as defined herein; and humanized 2C4 antibodies such as
Pertuzumab as described and defined herein.
             An "intact antibody" herein is one which comprises two antigen binding regions, and an Fc
region. Preferably, the intact antibody has a functional Fc region.
             "Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably comprising the
antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, and Fv
fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies
formed from antibody fragment(s).
             "Native antibodies" are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons,
composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is
linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies
among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has
regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain
(VH)    followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end
(VL) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the
first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the
variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface
between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.
             The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an
antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises
amino acid residues from a "complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (e.g. residues 24-34
(LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (HI), 50-65 (H2) and
95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins of
Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.
(1991)) and/or those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (e.g. residues 26-32 (L 1), 50-52 (L2) and
91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (HI), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the
heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)).         "Framework
Region" or "FR" residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region
                                                        17
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

residues as herein defined.
             The term "Fc region" herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin
heavy chain, including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries
of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region
is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the
carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering
system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example, during production or purification of the
antibody, or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody.
Accordingly, a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447
residues removed, antibody populations with no K447 residues removed, and antibody populations
having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.
             Unless indicated otherwise, herein the numbering of the residues in an immunoglobulin heavy
chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteinsofImmunological Interest, 5th
Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991), expressly incorporated
herein by reference. The "EU index as in Kabat" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgGI
EU antibody.
             A "functional Fc region" possesses an "effector function" of a native sequence Fc region.
Exemplary "effector functions" include Cl q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor
binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of
cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the
Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be
assessed using various assays as herein disclosed, for example.
             A "native sequence Fc region" comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid
sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native
sequence human IgGI Fc region (non-A and A allotypes); native sequence human IgG2 Fc region;
native sequence human IgG3 Fc region; and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as
naturally occurring variants thereof.
             A "variant Fc region" comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native
sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, preferably one or more amino
acid substitution(s). Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution
compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about
one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid
substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant
Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% homology with a native sequence Fc
region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90%
                                                       18
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

homology therewith, more preferably at least about 95% homology therewith.
             Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact
antibodies can be assigned to different "classes". There are five major classes of intact antibodies:
IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into Asubclasses~
(isotypes), e.g., IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that
correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called a, 6, F, y, and [, respectively. The subunit
structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well
known.
             A "naked antibody" is an antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous molecule, such as
a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.
             An "affinity matured" antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more
hypervariable regions thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen,
compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Preferred affinity matured
antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured
antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. Bio/Technology 10:779-783
(1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR
and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. ProcNat. Acad. Sci, USA 91:3809-3813
(1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995);
Jackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al, J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896
(1992).
             A "deamidated" antibody is one in which one or more asparagine residues thereof has been
derivitized, e.g. to an aspartic acid, a succinimide, or an iso-aspartic acid.
             The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in
mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.
             "Gastric cancer" specifically includes metastatic or locally advanced non-resectable gastric
cancer, including, without limitation, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or
gastroesophageal junction with inoperable (non-resectable) locally advanced or metastatic disease, not
amenable to curative therapy, and post-operatively recurrent advanced gastric cancer, such as
adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction, when the intent of the surgery was to
cure the disease.
             An "advanced" cancer is one which has spread outside the site or organ of origin, either by
local invasion or metastasis. Accordingly, the term "advanced" cancer includes both locally advanced
and metastatic disease.
             A "refractory" cancer is one which progresses even though an anti-tumor agent, such as a
chemotherapy, is being administered to the cancer patient. An example of a refractory cancer is one
                                                       19
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

which is platinum refractory.
             A "recurrent" cancer is one which has regrown, either at the initial site or at a distant site,
after a response to initial therapy, such as surgery.
             A "locally recurrent" cancer is cancer that returns after treatment in the same place as a
previously treated cancer.
             A "non-resectable" or "unresectable" cancer is not able to be removed (resected) by surgery.
             "Early-stage breast cancer" herein refers to breast cancer that has not spread beyond the breast
or the axillary lymph nodes. Such cancer is generally treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.
             "Neoadjuvant therapy" refers to systemic therapy given prior to surgery.
              "Adjuvant therapy" refers to systemic therapy given after surgery.
             "Metastatic" cancer refers to cancer which has spread from one part of the body (e.g. the breast)
to another part of the body.
             Herein, a "patient" or "subject" is a human patient. The patient may be a "cancer patient," i.e.
one who is suffering or at risk for suffering from one or more symptoms of cancer, in particular
gastric or breast cancer.
             A "patient population" refers to a group of cancer patients. Such populations can be used to
demonstrate statistically significant efficacy and/or safety of a drug, such as Pertuzumab.
             A "relapsed" patient is one who has signs or symptoms of cancer after remission. Optionally,
the patient has relapsed after adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy.
             A cancer or biological sample which "displays HER expression, amplification, or activation"
is one which, in a diagnostic test, expresses (including overexpresses) a HER receptor, has amplified
HER gene, and/or otherwise demonstrates activation or phosphorylation of a HER receptor.
             A cancer or biological sample which "displays HER activation" is one which, in a diagnostic
test, demonstrates activation or phosphorylation of a HER receptor. Such activation can be
determined directly (e.g. by measuring HER phosphorylation by ELISA) or indirectly (e.g. by gene
expression profiling or by detecting HER heterodimers, as described herein).
             A cancer cell with "HER receptor overexpression or amplification" is one which has
significantly higher levels of a HER receptor protein or gene compared to a noncancerous cell of the
same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased
transcription or translation. HER receptor overexpression or amplification may be determined in a
diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the HER protein present on the
surface of a cell (e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC). Alternatively, or additionally, one
may measure levels of HER-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g. via in situ hybridization (ISH),
including fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see W098/45479 published October, 1998) and
chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH; see, e.g. Tanner et al., Am. J. Pathol. 157(5): 1467-1472
                                                        20
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

(2000); Bella et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 26: (May 20 supply; abstr 22147) (2008)), southern blotting, or
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). One
may also study HER receptor overexpression or amplification by measuring shed antigen (e.g., HER
extracellular domain) in a biological fluid such as serum (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,933,294 issued
June 12, 1990; W091/05264 published April 18, 1991; U.S. Patent 5,401,638 issued March 28, 1995;
and Sias et al. J. Immunol. Methods 132: 73-80 (1990)). Aside from the above assays, various in vivo
assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one may expose cells within the body of
the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g. a radioactive
isotope, and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated, e.g. by external scanning
for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.
             A "HER2-positive" cancer comprises cancer cells which have higher than normal levels of
HER2. Examples of HER2-positive cancer include HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive
gastric cancer. Optionally, HER2-positive cancer has an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 2+ or
3+ and/or an in situ hybridization (ISH) amplification ratio >2.0.
             Herein, an "anti-tumor agent" refers to a drug used to treat cancer. Non-limiting examples of
anti-tumor agents herein include chemotherapy agents, HER dimerization inhibitors, HER antibodies,
antibodies directed against tumor associated antigens, anti-hormonal compounds, cytokines, EGFR
targeted drugs, anti-angiogenic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, growth inhibitory agents and
antibodies, cytotoxic agents, antibodies that induce apoptosis, COX inhibitors, farnesyl transferase
inhibitors, antibodies that binds oncofetal protein CA 125, HER2 vaccines, Raf or ras inhibitors,
liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, taxene, dual tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TLK286, EMD-7200,
Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, erlotinib, and bevacizumab.
             The "epitope 2C4" is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody
2C4 binds. In order to screen for antibodies which bind essentially to the 2C4 epitope, a routine
cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Preferably the antibody blocks
2C4's binding to HER2 by about 50% or more. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to
assess whether the antibody binds essentially to the 2C4 epitope of HER2. Epitope 2C4 comprises
residues from Domain II (SEQ ID NO: 2) in the extracellular domain of HER2. 2C4 and Pertuzumab
binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 at the junction of domains I, II and III (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2,
and 3, respectively). Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004).
             The "epitope 4D5" is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody
4D5 (ATCC CRL 10463) and Trastuzumab bind. This epitope is close to the transmembrane domain
of HER2, and within Domain IV of HER2 (SEQ ID NO: 4). To screen for antibodies which bind
essentially to the 4D5 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A
                                                        21
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be
performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds
essentially to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 (e.g. any one or more residues in the region from about
residue 529 to about residue 625, inclusive of the HER2 ECD, residue numbering including signal
peptide).
             "Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures.
Those in need of treatment include those already with cancer as well as those in which cancer is to be
prevented. Hence, the patient to be treated herein may have been diagnosed as having cancer or may
be predisposed or susceptible to cancer.
             The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat cancer in the
patient. The effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor
size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral
organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some
extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the
cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be
cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. The effective amount may extend progression free survival (e.g. as
measured by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors, RECIST, or CA-125 changes), result in
an objective response (including a partial response, PR, or complete response, CR), increase overall
survival time, and/or improve one or more symptoms of cancer (e.g. as assessed by FOSI).
             The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the
function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive

             By "chemotherapy-resistant" cancer is meant that the cancer patient has progressed while
receiving a chemotherapy regimen (i.e. the patient is "chemotherapy refractory"), or the patient has
progressed within 12 months (for instance, within 6 months) after completing a chemotherapy
regimen.
             The term "platin" is used herein to refer to platinum based chemotherapy, including, without
limitation, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin.
             The term "fluoropyrimidine" is used herein to refer to an antimetabolite chemotherapy,
including, without limitation, capecitabine, floxuridine, and fluorouracil (5-FU).
             A "fixed " or "flat" dose of a therapeutic agent herein refers to a dose that is administered to a
human patient without regard for the weight (WT) or body surface area (BSA) of the patient. The
fixed or flat dose is therefore not provided as a mg/kg dose or a mg/m2 dose, but rather as an absolute
amount of the therapeutic agent.
             A "loading" dose herein generally comprises an initial dose of a therapeutic agent
administered to a patient, and is followed by one or more maintenance dose(s) thereof. Generally, a
single loading dose is administered, but multiple loading doses are contemplated herein. Usually, the
amount of loading dose(s) administered exceeds the amount of the maintenance dose(s) administered
and/or the loading dose(s) are administered more frequently than the maintenance dose(s), so as to
achieve the desired steady-state concentration of the therapeutic agent earlier than can be achieved
with the maintenance dose(s).
             A "maintenance" dose herein refers to one or more doses of a therapeutic agent administered
to the patient over a treatment period. Usually, the maintenance doses are administered at spaced
                                                         25
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

treatment intervals, such as approximately every week, approximately every 2 weeks, approximately
every 3 weeks, or approximately every 4 weeks, preferably every 3 weeks.
             "Infusion" or "infusing" refers to the introduction of a drug-containing solution into the body
through a vein for therapeutic purposes. Generally, this is achieved via an intravenous (IV) bag.
             An "intravenous bag" or "IV bag" is a bag that can hold a solution which can be administered
via the vein of a patient. In one embodiment, the solution is a saline solution (e.g. about 0.9% or
about 0.45% NaCl). Optionally, the IV bag is formed from polyolefin or polyvinal chloride.
             By "co-administering" is meant intravenously administering two (or more) drugs during the
same administration, rather than sequential infusions of the two or more drugs. Generally, this will
involve combining the two (or more) drugs into the same IV bag prior to co-administration thereof.
             "Cardiac toxicity" refers to any toxic side effect resulting from administration of a drug or
drug combination. Cardiac toxicity can be evaluated based on any one or more of: incidence of
symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or congestive heart failure (CHF), or
decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
             The phrase "without increasing cardiac toxicity" for a drug combination including
Pertuzumab refers to an incidence of cardiac toxicity that is equal or less than that observed in
patients treated with drugs other than Pertuzumab in the drug combination (e.g. equal or less than that
resulting from administration of Trastuzumab and the chemotherapy, e.g. Docetaxel).
             A "vial" is a container suitable for holding a liquid or lyophilized preparation. In one
embodiment, the vial is a single-use vial, e.g. a 20-cc single-use vial with a stopper.
             A "package insert" is a leaflet that, by order of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or
other Regulatory Authority, must be placed inside the package of every prescription drug. The leaflet
generally includes the trademark for the drug, its generic name, and its mechanism of action; states its
indications, contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse effects, and dosage forms; and includes
instructions for the recommended dose, time, and route of administration.
             The expression "safety data" concerns the data obtained in a controlled clinical trial showing
the prevalence and severity of adverse events to guide the user regarding the safety of the drug,
including guidance on how to monitor and prevent adverse reactions to the drug. Table 3 and Table 4
herein provide safety data for Pertuzumab. The safety data comprises any one or more (e.g. two,
three, four or more) of the most common adverse events (AEs) or adverse reactions (ADRs) in Tables
3 and 4. For example, the safety data comprises information about neutropenia, febrile neutropenia,
diarrhea and/or cardiac toxicity as disclosed herein.
             "Efficacy data' refers to the data obtained in controlled clinical trial showing that a drug
effectively treats a disease, such as cancer. Efficacy data for Pertuzumab is provided in the examples
herein. As to HER2-positive metastatic or locally recurrent, unresectable breast cancer, efficacy data
                                                         26
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

for Pertuzumab is found in Table 2, Table 5, Figure 8 and Figure 10 herein. The safety data comprises
any one or more (e.g. two, three, four or more) of the primary endpoint (progression free survival,
PFS, by IRF) and/or secondary enpoints (overall survival (OS); progression free survival (PFS) by
investigator; objective response rate (ORR), including complete response (CR), partial response (PR),
stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), and/or duration of response) in Table 2, Table 5,
Figure 8 and Figure 10. For example, the efficacy data comprises information about progression free
survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) as disclosed herein.
             By "stable mixture" when referring to a mixture of two or more drugs, such as Pertuzumab
and Trastuzumab" means that each of the drugs in the mixture essentially retains its physical and
chemical stability in the mixture as evaluated by one or more analytical assays. Exemplary analytical
assays for this purpose include: color, appearance and clarity (CAC), concentration and turbidity
analysis, particulate analysis, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), ion-exchange chromatography
(IEC), capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), image capillary isoelectric focusing (iCIEF), and potency
assay. In one embodiment, mixture has been shown to be stable for up to 24 hours at 50 C or 30'C.
             A drug that is administered "concurrently" witth one or more other drugs is administered
during the same treatment cycle, on the same day of treatment as the one or more other drugs, and,
optionally, at the same time as the one or more other drugs. For instance, for cancer therapies given
every 3-weeks, the concurrently administered drugs are each administered on day-I of a 3-week
cycle.
             11.           Antibody and Chemotherapy Compositions
             The HER2 antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be, e.g., a soluble form of the
extracellular domain of a HER2 receptor or a portion thereof, containing the desired epitope.
Alternatively, cells expressing HER2 at their cell surface (e.g. NIH-3T3 cells transformed to
overexpress HER2; or a carcinoma cell line such as SK-BR-3 cells, see Stancovski et al. PNAS (USA)
88:8691-8695 (1991)) can be used to generate antibodies. Other forms of HER2 receptor useful for
generating antibodies will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
             Various methods for making monoclonal antibodies herein are available in the art. For
example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by
Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567).
             The anti-HER2 antibodies used in accordance with the present invention, Trastuzumab and
Pertuzumab, are commercially available.
                            (i) Humanized antibodies
             Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably, a
humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is
                                                       27
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which
are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed
following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986);
Riechmann et al., Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by
substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody.
Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567)
wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the
corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically
human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are
substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.
             The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the
humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-fit"
method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library
of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the
rodent is then accepted as the human framework region (FR) for the humanized antibody (Sims et al.,
J. Immunol., 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 (1987)). Another method uses a
particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a
particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different
humanized antibodies (Carter et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al., J.
Immunol., 151:2623 (1993)).
             It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the
antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred
method, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and
various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and
humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are
familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display
probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin
sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the
functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the
ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected
and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic,
such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region
residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.
             US Patent No. 6,949,245 describes production of exemplary humanized HER2 antibodies
which bind HER2 and block ligand activation of a HER receptor.

             Humanized HER2 antibodies specifically include Trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN@) as described
in Table 3 of U.S. Patent 5,821,337 expressly incorporated herein by reference and as defined herein;
and humanized 2C4 antibodies such as Pertuzumab as described and defined herein.
             The humanized antibodies herein may, for example, comprise nonhuman hypervariable
region residues incorporated into a human variable heavy domain and may further comprise a
framework region (FR) substitution at a position selected from the group consisting of 69H, 71 H and
73H utilizing the variable domain numbering system set forth in Kabat et al., Sequences ofProteins of
Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD
(1991). In one embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises FR substitutions at two or all of
positions 69H, 71H and 73H.
             An exemplary humanized antibody of interest herein comprises variable heavy domain
complementarity determining residues GFTFTDYTMX (SEQ ID NO: 17), where X is preferably D or
S; DVNPNSGGSIYNQRFKG (SEQ ID NO:18); and/or NLGPSFYFDY (SEQ ID NO:19), optionally
comprising amino acid modifications of those CDR residues, e.g. where the modifications essentially
maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example, an antibody variant for use in the methods
of the present invention may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid
substitutions in the above variable heavy CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared
by affinity maturation, e.g., as described below.
             The humanized antibody may comprise variable light domain complementarity determining
residues KASQDVSIGVA (SEQ ID NO:20); SASYX1 X 2 X 3, where X' is preferably R or L, X 2 is
preferably Y or E, and X 3 is preferably T or S (SEQ ID NO:21); and/or QQYYIYPYT (SEQ ID
NO:22), e.g. in addition to those variable heavy domain CDR residues in the preceding paragraph.
Such humanized antibodies optionally comprise amino acid modifications of the above CDR residues,
e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example,
the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid
substitutions in the above variable light CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by
affinity maturation, e.g., as described below.
             The present application also contemplates affinity matured antibodies which bind HER2. The
parent antibody may be a human antibody or a humanized antibody, e.g., one comprising the variable
light and/or variable heavy sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 7 and 8, respectively (i.e. comprising the VL
and/or VH of Pertuzumab).          An affinity matured variant of Pertuzumab preferably binds to HER2
receptor with an affinity superior to that of murine 2C4 or Pertuzumab (e.g. from about two or about
four fold, to about 100 fold or about 1000 fold improved affinity, e.g. as assessed using a HER2
extracellular domain (ECD) ELISA) . Exemplary variable heavy CDR residues for substitution
include H28, H30, H34, H35, H64, H96, H99, or combinations of two or more (e.g. two, three, four,
                                                       29

five, six, or seven of these residues). Examples of variable light CDR residues for alteration include
L28, L50, L53, L56, L91, L92, L93, L94, L96, L97 or combinations of two or more (e.g. two to three,
four, five or up to about ten of these residues).
             Humanization of murine 4D5 antibody to generate humanized variants thereof, including
Trastuzumab, is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,337, 6,054,297, 6,407,213, 6,639,055, 6,719,971,
and 6,800,738, as well as Carter et al. PNAS (USA), 89:4285-4289 (1992). HuMAb4D5-8
(Trastuzumab) bound HER2 antigen 3-fold more tightly than the mouse 4D5 antibody, and had
secondary immune function (ADCC) which allowed for directed cytotoxic activity of the humanized
antibody in the presence of human effector cells. HuMAb4D5-8 comprised variable light (VL) CDR
residues incorporated in a             VL K subgroup I consensus framework, and variable heavy (VH) CDR
residues incorporated into a VH subgroup III consensus framework. The antibody further comprised
framework region (FR) substitutions as positions: 71, 73, 78, and 93 of the          VH  (Kabat numbering of
FR residues; and a FR substitution at position 66 of the VL (Kabat numbering of FR residues).
Trastuzumab comprises non-A allotype human y 1 Fc region.
             Various forms of the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody are contemplated. For
example, the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an antibody fragment.
Alternatively, the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an intact antibody, such as
an intact IgGI antibody.
                             (ii) Pertuzumab compositions
             In one embodiment of a HER2 antibody composition, the composition comprises a mixture of
a main species Pertuzumab antibody and one or more variants thereof The preferred embodiment
herein of a Pertuzumab main species antibody is one comprising the variable light and variable heavy
amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 7 and 8, and most preferably comprising a light chain amino
acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 11, and a heavy chain amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 12
(including deamidated and/or oxidized variants of those sequences). In one embodiment, the
composition comprises a mixture of the main species Pertuzumab antibody and an amino acid
sequence variant thereof comprising an amino-terminal leader extension. Preferably, the amino
terminal leader extension is on a light chain of the antibody variant (e.g. on one or two light chains of
the antibody variant). The main species HER2 antibody or the antibody variant may be an full length
antibody or antibody fragment (e.g. Fab of F(ab=)2 fragments), but preferably both are full length
antibodies. The antibody variant herein may comprise an amino-terminal leader extension on any one
or more of the heavy or light chains thereof. Preferably, the amino-terminal leader extension is on
one or two light chains of the antibody. The amino-terminal leader extension preferably comprises or
consists of VHS-. Presence of the amino-terminal leader extension in the composition can be
detected by various analytical techniques including, but not limited to, N-terminal sequence analysis,
                                                             30
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

assay for charge heterogeneity (for instance, cation exchange chromatography or capillary zone
electrophoresis), mass spectrometry, etc. The amount of the antibody variant in the composition
generally ranges from an amount that constitutes the detection limit of any assay (preferably N
terminal sequence analysis) used to detect the variant to an amount less than the amount of the main
species antibody. Generally, about 20% or less (e.g. from about 1% to about 15%, for instance from
5% to about 15%) of the antibody molecules in the composition comprise an amino-terminal leader
extension. Such percentage amounts are preferably determined using quantitative N-terminal
sequence analysis or cation exchange analysis (preferably using a high-resolution, weak cation
exchange column, such as a PROPAC WCX-10TM cation exchange column). Aside from the amino
terminal leader extension variant, further amino acid sequence alterations of the main species
antibody and/or variant are contemplated, including but not limited to an antibody comprising a C
terminal lysine residue on one or both heavy chains thereof, a deamidated antibody variant, etc.
             Moreover, the main species antibody or variant may further comprise glycosylation
variations, non-limiting examples of which include antibody comprising a GI or G2 oligosaccharide
structure attached to the Fc region thereof, antibody comprising a carbohydrate moiety attached to a
light chain thereof (e.g. one or two carbohydrate moieties, such as glucose or galactose, attached to
one or two light chains of the antibody, for instance attached to one or more lysine residues), antibody
comprising one or two non-glycosylated heavy chains, or antibody comprising a sialidated
oligosaccharide attached to one or two heavy chains thereof etc.
             The composition may be recovered from a genetically engineered cell line, e.g. a Chinese
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line expressing the HER2 antibody, or may be prepared by peptide
synthesis.
             For more information regarding exemplary Pertuzumab compositions, see US Patent Nos.
7,560,111 and 7,879,325 as well as US 2009/0202546A1.
                            (iii) Trastuzumab compositions
             The Trastuzumab composition generally comprises a mixture of a main species antibody
(comprising light and heavy chain sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 13 and 14, respectively), and variant
forms thereof, in particular acidic variants (including deamidated variants). Preferably, the amount of
such acidic variants in the composition is less than about 25%, or less than about 20%, or less than
about 15%. See, U.S. Pat. No. 6,339,142. See, also, Harris et al., J. Chromatography,B 752:233-245
(2001) concerning forms of Trastuzumab resolvable by cation-exchange chromatography, including
Peak A (Asn30 deamidated to Asp in both light chains); Peak B (Asn55 deamidated to isoAsp in one
heavy chain); Peak 1 (Asn30 deamidated to Asp in one light chain); Peak 2 (Asn30 deamidated to
Asp in one light chain, and Asp 102 isomerized to isoAsp in one heavy chain); Peak 3 (main peak
form, or main species antibody); Peak 4 (Asp 102 isomerized to isoAsp in one heavy chain); and Peak
                                                           31

C (Asp 102 succinimide (Asu) in one heavy chain). Such variant forms and compositions are included
in the invention herein.
                            (iv)   5-FU and Cisplatin
          There is no single, standard, globally accepted chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced gastric
cancer, but 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus cisplatin is widely used for this indication. In Phase II studies
in patients with no prior chemotherapy, 5-FU + cisplatin produced response rates of approximately
40% and median overall survival of 7-10.6 months (Lacave AJ, Baron FJ, Anton LM, et al. Ann
Oncol 1991;2:751-754; Rougier P, Ducreux M, Mahjoubi M, et al. Eur J Cancer 1994;30A:1263
 1269; Vanhoefer U, Wagner T, Lutz M, et al. Eur J Cancer200 1;37 Suppl 6: abstract S27.)
                            (v)    Capecitabine
             Capecitabine has been extensively tested in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Phase II
efficacy results for capecitabine monotherapy show response rates of 19% and 26% and an overall
survival of 8.1 and 10.0 months in studies by Koizumi et al 2003 (Koizumi W, Kurihara M, Sasai T,
et al. Cancer 1993;72:658-62; Sakamoto J, Chin K, Kondo K, et al. Anti-Cancer Drugs
2006;17:2331-6. For capecitabine in combination with platinum, there are a number of studies
showing response rates ranging from 28% to 65%, time to progression from 5.8 to 9 months, and
overall survival from 10.1 to 12 months (Kang Y, Kang WK, Shin DB, et al. J Clin Oncology 2006;24

111.     Selecting Patients for Therapy
             Detection of HER2 can be used to select patients for treatment in accordance with the present
invention. Several FDA-approved commercial assays are available to identify HER2-positive cancer
patients. These methods include HERCEPTEST* (Dako) and PATHWAY® HER2
(immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays) and PathVysion" and HER2 FISH pharmDxTM (FISH assays).
Users should refer to the package inserts of specific assay kits for information on the validation and
performance of each assay.
             For example, HER2 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC, e.g. using the HERCEPTEST®
(Dako). Paraffin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay
and accorded a HER2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows:
             Score 0 no staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of tumor
cells.
             Score 1+ a faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10% of the
tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.
                                                       32
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             Score 2+ a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of
the tumor cells.
             Score 3+ a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of
the tumor cells.
             Those tumors with 0 or 1+ scores for HER2 overexpression assessment may be characterized
as HER2-negative, whereas those tumors with 2+ or 3+ scores may be characterized as HER2
positive.
             Tumors overexpressing HER2 may be rated by immunohistochemical scores corresponding to
the number of copies of HER2 molecules expressed per cell, and can been determined biochemically:
             0 = 0-10,000 copies/cell,
              1+ = at least about 200,000 copies/cell,
             2+ = at least about 500,000 copies/cell,
             3+ = at least about 2,000,000 copies/cell.
             Overexpression of HER2 at the 3+ level, which leads to ligand-independent activation of the
tyrosine kinase (Hudziak et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:7159-7163 (1987)), occurs in
approximately 30% of breast cancers, and in these patients, relapse-free survival and overall survival
are diminished (Slamon et al., Science, 244:707-712 (1989); Slamon et al., Science, 235:177-182
(1987)).
             The presence of HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification are highly correlated,
therefore, alternatively, or additionally, the use of in situ hybridization (ISH), e.g. fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH), assays to detect gene amplification may also be employed for selection of
patients appropriate for treatment in accordance with the present invention. FISH assays such as the
INFORMTM (sold by Ventana, Arizona) or PathVysion* (Vysis, Illinois) may be carried out on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent (if any) of HER2
amplification in the tumor.
             Most commonly, HER2-positive status is confirmed using archival paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue, using any of the foregoing methods.
             Preferably, HER2-positive patients having a 2+ or 3+ IHC score or who are FISH or ISH
positive are selected for treatment in accordance with the present invention.
             See also US Patent No. 7,981,418 and Example 11 for alternative assays for screening
patients for therapy with Pertuzumab.
IV. Pharmaceutical Formulations
             Therapeutic formulations of the HER2 antibodies used in accordance with the present
invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with
optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical
                                                        33
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), generally in the form of lyophilized formulations or
aqueous solutions. Antibody crystals are also contemplated (see US Pat Appln 2002/0136719).
Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and
concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids;
antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as
octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride,
benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl
paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less
than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins;
hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine,
asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates
including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose,
mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn
protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN T M , PLURONICSTM or polyethylene
glycol (PEG). Lyophilized antibody formulations are described in WO 97/04801, expressly
incorporated herein by reference.
             Lyophilized antibody formulations are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,267,958, 6,685,940 and
6,821,515, expressly incorporated herein by reference. The preferred HERCEPTIN® (Trastuzumab)
formulation is a sterile, white to pale yellow preservative-free lyophilized powder for intravenous (IV)
administration, comprising 440 mg Trastuzumab, 400 mg a,a.-trehalose dehydrate, 9.9 mg L
histidine-HCl, 6.4 mg L-histidine, and 1.8 mg polysorbate 20, USP. Reconsitution of 20 mL of
bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), containing 1.1% benzyl alcohol as a preservative, yields a
multi-dose solution containing 21 mg/mL Trastuzumab, at pH of approximately 6.0. For further
details, see the Trastuzumab prescribing information.
             The preferred Pertuzumab formulation for therapeutic use comprises 30mg/mL Pertuzumab in
20mM histidine acetate, 120mM sucrose, 0.02% polysorbate 20, at pH 6.0. An alternate Pertuzumab
formulation comprises 25 mg/mL Pertuzumab, 10 mM histidine-HCl buffer, 240 mM sucrose, 0.02%
polysorbate 20, pH 6.0.
             The formulation of the placebo used in the clinical trials described in the Examples is
equivalent to Pertuzumab, without the active agent.
             The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the
particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not
adversely affect each other. Various drugs which can be combined with the HER dimerization
inhibitor are described in the Method Section below. Such molecules are suitably present in
combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily
accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.
V. Treatment Methods
             In a first aspect of a treatment method herein, a method for extending progression free
survival (PFS) in a HER2-positive breast cancer patient population by 6 months or more is provided
which comprises administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab and chemotherapy (e.g. taxane such as
Docetaxel) to the patients in the population. Optionally, the patient population includes a suitable
number of patients (e.g. 200 or more, 300 or more or 400 or more patients) so that a statistically
significant extension of PFS in the population can be evaluated.
             The phase III CLEOPATRA clinical data in Example 3 below show that median PFS
assessed by investigators was 12.4 months with placebo plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel and 18.5
months with Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel, thus the improvement in median PFS was
6 months or more (e.g. 6.1 months) relative to patients not receiving Pertuzumab (i.e. patients only
receiving Trastuzumab and Docetaxel).
             In an additional or alternative embodiment, a method of obtaining an objective response rate
of 80% or more in a HER2-positive breast cancer patient population is provided which comprises
administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab and chemotherapy (e.g. taxane, such as Docetaxel) to the
patients in the population.
             In a related aspect, a method of combining two HER2 antibodies to treat HER2-positive
cancer without increasing cardiac toxicity in a HER2-positive cancer patient population is provided
which comprises administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and chemotherapy to the patients in the
population. Optionally, the patient population includes a suitable number of patients (e.g. 200 or
more, 300 or more or 400 or more patients) so that a statistically significant assessment of lack of
cardiac toxicity resulting from the combination can be made. The phase III CLEOPATRA clinical
data in Example 3 below show that combining Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab does not exacerbate
cardiac toxicity. Cardiac toxicity can be monitored for incidence of symptomatic left ventricular
systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or congestive heart failure (CHF), or decrease in left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), e.g. as disclosed in Example 3 below.
             Optionally, the breast cancer is metastatic or locally recurrent, unresectable breast cancer, or
de novo Stage IV disease, is defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ and/or fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) amplification ratio >2.0.
             Optionally, the patients in the population have not received previous treatment or have
relapsed after adjuvant therapy, have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >50% at baseline,
and/or have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.

10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             In an alternative embodiment, the invention concerns a method of treating early-stage HER2
positive breast cancer comprising administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and chemotherapy to a
patient with the breast cancer, wherein the chemotherapy comprises anthracycline-based
chemotherapy, or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. This aspect of the invention is supported by the
clinical data in Example 5. In one embodiment, the chemotherapy comprises anthracycline-based
chemotherapy, e.g. comprising 5-FU, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). In an alternative
embodiment, the chemotherapy comprises carboplatin-based chemotherapy, e.g. comprising taxane
(e.g. Docetaxel), Carboplatin in addition to HERCEPTIN@/Trastuzumab (e.g. TCH regimen). In one
embodiment, Pertuzumab is administered concurrently with the anthracycline-based chemotherapy or
with the carboplatin-based chemotherapy, e.g. wherein the Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab and
chemotherapy are administered in 3-week cycles with Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab and the
chemotherapy being administered on day-I of each cycle. The data in the examples herein
demonstrates that Pertuzumab administration does not increase cardiac toxicity relative to the
treatment without Pertuzumab (i.e relative to Trastuzumab with anthrycline-based chemotherapy (e.g.
FEC) and no Pertuzumab; or relative to Trastuzumab with carboplatin-based chemotherapy and no
Pertuzumab (i.e. TCH). The early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer therapy contemplated herein
includes neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy.
             The invention herein also concerns a method of treating HER2-positive cancer in a patient
comprising co-administering a mixture of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab from the same intravenous
bag to the patient. This embodiment is applicable to treatment of any HER2-positive cancer,
including HER2-positive breast cancer, HER2-positive gastric cancer, HER2-positive metastatic or
locally recurrent, unresectable breast cancer, or de novo Stage IV disease, early-stage HER2-positive
breast cancer, etc. Optionally, this method further comprises administering chemotherapy to the
patient.
             In yet another embodiment, the treatment methods of the present invention comprise, consist
essentially of, or consist of the administration of Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab and a chemotherapy, such
as a platin (e.g. cisplatin) and/or a fluoropurimidine (e.g. capecitabine and/or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)) to
treat HER2-positive gastric cancer.
             In particular, the treatment methods of the present invention comprise, consist essentially of,
or consist of the administration of Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and a chemotherapy, such as a platin
and/or a fluoropurimidine, e.g. cisplatin and/or capecitabine and/or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), to a human
patient with metastatic gastric cancer, non-resectable locally advanced gastric cancer, or post
operatively recurrent gastric cancer. In certain embodiments, the gastric cancer is not amenable to
curative therapy.

10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             In an alternative embodiment, a method of treating HER2-positive breast cancer in a patient is
provided comprising administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab and vinorelbine to the patient. The
breast cancer according to this embodiment is optionally metastatic or locally advanced. Optionally,
the patient has not previously received systemic non-hormonal anticancer therapy in the metastatic
setting.
             In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating HER2-positive breast cancer in
a patient comprising administering Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and aromatase inhibitor (e.g.
anastrazole or letrozole) to the patient. According to this embodiment, the breast cancer is advanced
breast cancer, including hormone receptor-positive breast cancer such as estrogen receptor (ER)
positive and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive breast cancer. Optionally, the patient has not
previously received systemic nonhormonal anticancer therapy in the metastatic setting. This
treatment method optionally further comprises administering induction chemotherapy (e.g.
comprising taxane) to the patient.
             Therapy in accordance with the present invention extends progression-free survival (PFS)
and/or overall survival (OS) of the patient treated.
             The antibodies and chemotherapeutic treatments are administered to a human patient in
accord with known methods. Specific administration schedules and formulations are described in the
examples herein.
             According to one embodiment, Pertuzumab is administered at a dose that produces a steady
state Cmi of             20 ptg/mL in 90% of patients receiving Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab.
             According to one particular embodiment of the invention, a Pertuzumab of approximately
840mg (loading dose) is administered, followed by one or more doses of approximately 420mg
(maintenance dose(s)) of the antibody. The maintenance doses are preferably administered about
every 3 weeks, for a total of at least two doses, until clinical progressive disease, or unmanageable
toxicity, preferably up to about 6, or 7, or 8, or 9, or 10, or 11, or 12, or 13, or 14, or 15, or 16, or 17
or more doses. Longer treatment periods, including more treatment cycles, are also contemplated.
             According to another particular embodiment, Pertuzumab is administered at a dose of 840 mg
for all treatment cycles.
             Trastuzumab typically is administered as an intravenous loading dose of about 8 mg/kg,
followed by the administration of 6 mg/kg doses in subsequent cycles. Trastuzumab is typically
administered every 3 weeks until clinical progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity, preferably up
to about 17 or more doses.
             In a particular embodiment, Trastuzumab is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion on
Day 1 of each treatment cycle until investigator-assessed disease progression or unmanageable
toxicity, at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg for Cycle 1 and a dose of 6 mg/kg for subsequent cycles.
                                                            37
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             In another particular embodiment, Pertuzumab is administered as an IV infusion on Day 1 of
each cycle, for a total of six cycles or until investigator assessed disease progression or unmanageable
toxicity, whichever occurs first, either at a loading dose of 840 mg for Cycle 1 and a dose of 420 mg
for the subsequent cycles, or a loading dose of 840 mg for Cycle 1 and a dose of 840 mg for the
subsequent cycles.
             For treating gastric cancer, Cisplatin 80 mg/m2 is typically administered as an IV infusion on
Day 1 of each cycle, for a total of at least six cycles.
             For treating gastric cancer, Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 is typically administered orally twice
daily, from the evening of Day 1 to the morning of Day 15 of each cycle, for a total of at least six
cycles. Capecitabine administration may be prolonged at the discretion of the attending clinician after
careful risk-benefit assessment for individual patients.
             Dosages and schedules for chemotherapy used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer are
disclosed in the examples below, but other dosages and schedules are known and contemplated
according to the invention herein.
VI.          Articles of Manufacture
             One embodiment of an article of manufacture herein comprises an intravenous (IV) bag
containing a stable mixture of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab suitable for administration to a cancer
patient. Optionally, the mixture is in saline solution; for example comprising about 0.9% NaCl or
about 0.45% NaCl. An exemplary IV bag is a polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride infusion bag, e.g. a

Phase Ila Study Evaluatin2 Pertuzumab in Combination with Trastuzumab and Chemotherapy
                                   in Patients with HER2-Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer
             Despite a sharp worldwide decline in incidence and a reduction in mortality during the second
half of the twentieth century, gastric cancer remains the world's second leading cause of cancer
mortality, after lung cancer (Parkin, D. Oncogene 23:6329-40 (2004)). The incidence of gastric
cancer varies widely according to geographic region (Kelley et al. J Clin Epidemiol 56:1-9 (2003);
Plummer et al. Epidemiology of gastric cancer. In: Butlet et al., editors. Mechanisms of
carcinogenesis: contribution of molecular epidemiology. Lyon: IARC Scientific Publications No 157,
IARC (2004)). In Japan, Korea, China, and certain countries in Central and South America, the
incidence is 20 to 95 cases per 100,000 men. In contrast, in the United States, India, and Thailand,
the incidence is 4 to 8 cases per 100,000 men. The incidence in Western Europe ranges from 37 cases
per 100,000 men in parts of Italy to 12 per 100,000 men in France. The incidence in women follows a
similar geographic pattern but is about 50% lower than that in men. There are clear epidemiological
differences between cancer localized to the gastric cardia (gastroesophageal junction) and that
localized to the rest of the stomach. Cancer of the cardia accounts for 39% of gastric cancer cases in
white men in the United States but only 4% of gastric cancers in men in Japan. For reasons that are
not clear, cancer of the gastric cardia and lower esophagus has increased rapidly in developed
countries since the 1970s.
                                                              39

             To date, the only potentially curative treatment for gastric cancer is surgery. Survival rates
for gastric cancer improved significantly in Japan in recent years as a result of earlier detection and
better surgical techniques (Inoue et al. PostgradMedJ81:419-24(2005)). However, in Western
Europe and North America, gastric cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage when resection is no
longer possible. Consequently, the overall 5-year survival in these populations does not exceed 25%
(Ajani, J. The Oncologist 10 Suppl 3:49-58 (2005); Catalano et al. Clin Rev Oncol/Hematol 54: 209
41 (2005)).
             Regardless of their geographic region, patients with unresectable disease due to locally
advanced growth or metastatic spread have a poor prognosis, with overall 5-year survival within the
range of 5%-15% (Cunningham et al., Annals of Oncology 16 Suppl 1:i22-3(2005)). For patients
with unresectable disease at diagnosis and for patients with recurrent disease after surgery, the main
therapeutic option is chemotherapy (National Comprehensive Cancer Network. NCCN clinical
practice guidelines in oncology. Gastric cancer. Version 1. National Comprehensive Cancer Network,
(2006)). Chemotherapy given with palliative intent has been shown to be superior to best supportive
care in patients with advanced gastric cancer (Wagner et al. J Clin Oncol 24:2903-9 (2006)).
             Study B018255 (ToGA) was a randomized, open-label, multicenter, international,
comparative Phase III trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab in
combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy in patients
with inoperable, locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic HER2-positive adenocarcinoma of
the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. The primary objective of the study was to compare overall
survival for patients treated with Trastuzumab combined with fluoropyrimidine (5-FU or
capecitabine) plus cisplatin. The results from Study B018255 demonstrated a significant clinical
benefit when Trastuzumab was used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with gastric
cancer. Overall survival, the primary endpoint, was significantly improved in the Trastuzumab plus
chemotherapy arm compared with the chemotherapy alone arm (p = 0.0045, log-rank test;
hazard ratio, 0.74). The median survival time was 13.8 months in the Trastuzumab plus
chemotherapy arm and 11.1 months in the chemotherapy alone arm, and the risk of death was
decreased by 26% for patients in the Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm. All other secondary
endpoints demonstrated clinical significance with similar hazard and odds ratios. (See, e.g. Bang et
al., Lancet 28; 376(9742):687-97 (2010)).
             As a result of this study, Trastuzumab is now indicated, including the EU and United States,
in combination with cisplatin plus capecitabine or 5-FU, for the treatment of patients with HER2
positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior
treatment for metastatic disease.
             At present, there is no single, standard, globally accepted chemotherapeutic regimen for
                                                         40

advanced gastric cancer. Despite the success of the ToGA trial, there is a great need for providing
new and effective treatment options for this serious condition. In particular, there is a need for novel
therapeutic approaches that aim to avoid treatment-related morbidity and/or to increase survival in
gastric cancer patients. Accordingly, this example is a randomized, multicenter, open-label study
evaluating two different doses of Pertuzumab in patients with HER2-positive adenocarcinoma of the
stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to two treatment arms.
Patients in Arm A receive a Pertuzumab loading dose of 840 mg for Cycle 1 and a dose of 420 mg for
Cycles 2-6, and patients in Arm B receive Pertuzumab 840 mg for all six cycles. Patients in both
treatment arms receive Trastuzumab, cisplatin, and capecitabine. Study schema are in Figure 6. The
length of the study is approximately 24 months (4 months for recruitment and 20 months of follow-up
after last patient recruited). The end of study will be when progressive disease has occurred in all
patients, or all patients have withdrawn or discontinued from the study, whichever is earlier.
             Target population

             Investigator-assessed tumor response will be used to summarize best overall response at the
end of Cycles 3 and 6 for each treatment arm, defined as patients with a complete or partial response
as determined by RECIST.
                           Safety
             Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory test
results, and changes in vital signs.
                           Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
             Minimum (trough) serum concentration (Cmin) for Pertuzumab at Day 43 will be assessed. In
addition, PK parameters such as CL, Vss, AUC, and half-life will be estimated. The evaluation of PK
parameters from data collected up to Day 43 will enable modeling and simulation for an estimated
dose that predicts a steady-state trough of 20 pg/mL in 90% of patients.
             Statistical Analyses
                           PharmacokineticAnalyses
             Individual and mean serum Pertuzumab concentration-time data will be tabulated and plotted
by dose level. The serum pharmacokinetics of Pertuzumab will be summarized by estimating total
exposure (area under the curve (AUC)), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), minimum serum
concentration (Cmin), time to steady-state       Cmax and Cmin, total serum clearance, volume of distribution,
and elimination half-life (t%). Estimates for these parameters will be tabulated and summarized by
descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). Depending on the
observed Pertuzumab serum concentration-time data, a population PK approach may be used to
estimate the dose that will achieve the PK target concentrations.
             Observed Cmax and Cmin for Trastuzumab will be tabulated and summarized by descriptive
statistics for each specified PK sampling timepoint. For all PK analyses, actual times of sample
collection (rather than scheduled) will be used.
             PK parameters (AUC, Cmax, t%) of Pertuzumab will be calculated using non-compartmental
methods, and the systemic clearance will be derived from the plasma concentrations via standard
methods.

             All randomized patients who receive at least one dose of study medication will be included in
the intent-to-treat population (patients will be assigned to treatment groups as randomized for analysis
purposes).
                            Safety Population

                            Sample Size
             The purpose of this study is to assess Cmi for Pertuzumab at Day 43 in patients receiving two
different Pertuzumab dose regimens. These data will then be analyzed using a population PK model
to identify a dose of Pertuzumab that will achieve a PK target steady-state trough concentration of>
20 ptg/mL in approximately 90% of the advanced gastric cancer patients. Analyses using the
assumption that Pertuzumab behaves similarly to Trastuzumab in advanced gastric cancer suggest that
with sample size of 15 patients per arm (total of 30 patients in this study), the dose to achieve the
desired target concentration can be estimated with an acceptable degree of precision (coefficient of
variation < 15%).
             Clinical Results

             Diarrhea was the most common event occurring in 90% of subjects and was typically Grade 1
and 2 with onset in Cycle 1; no patient discontinued therapy because of diarrhea.
             Grade > 3 adverse events (AEs) (>13%) included diarrhea, stomatitis, fatigue/asthenia,
decreased appetite, hyponatremia, anemia, and neutopenia. With the exception of neutropenia and
hyponatremia (higher in Arm A) and decreased appetite (higher in Arm B), incidence of these events
was similar in the standard and high-dose Pertuzumab arms.
             Asymptomatic change in ejection fraction (EF), neutropenic fever, rash, and drug
hypersensitivity reaction were not associated with the higher dose of Pertuzumab.

             Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 60% of patients, and incidence was not associated
with high-dose Pertuzumab.
             Although more patients withdrew from treatment in Arm B, it is not clear that this was due to
a higher Pertuzumab dose because events peading to treatment discontinuation were not uniform.

             -      Pertuzumab trough concentrations are lower in GC compared to MBC.
                    *      Between cycle concentrations (i.e. day 7, 14) are in-line with expected MBC
                            concentrations as clearance is linear at these higher concentrations.
                    *      Trough levels with the 840/420 mg dose are about 37% lower compared to the
                            CLEOPATRA trial (Example 3), likely due to non-linear clearance at lower
                            concentrations (incomplete receptor saturation).
             -      840/840 mg dose in GC provdes trough concentrations similar to 840/420 mg dose in
                    MBC.
             -      Covariates have no impact on PK.
                    Conclusions
             Based on Pertuzumab PK in GC, 840/840 mg dose will be used for the treatment of gastric
cancer. This dose is expected to maintain trough levels above the target of >20 pag/nL in 90% of
patients, and provides similar trough levels as those observed in MBC.

            Results of a Phase III, Randomized, Double-Bind, Placebo-Controlled Registration Trial
 to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Placebo + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel versus Pertuzumab
   + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel in Patients with Previously Untreated HER2-Positive Metastatic
                                       Breast Cancer (CLEOPATRA)
            A protocol for evaluating Pertuzumab in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is found at
http://clinicaltrials.2ov/ct2/show/NCT00567190 and in US 2009/0137387 as well as
WO2009/154651.
            This example concerns the clinical data obtained in the randomized, double-blind, placebo
controlled Phase III trial in patients with HER2-positive MBC, who had not received chemotherapy or
biologic therapy for their metastatic disease. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo plus
Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel or Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel. The primary endpoint
was progression-free survival (PFS), based on tumor assessments. PFS was defined as the time from
randomization to the first documented radiographic progressive disease (PD) according to response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 (Therasse et al. JNatl CancerInst 92:205-16
(2000)) or death from any cause, if within 18 weeks of the patient's last tumor assessment. Secondary
endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate
(ORR), and safety.
            Patients: Eligible patients had centrally confirmed HER2-positive (defined as
immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification ratio
>2.0) (Carlson et al. JNatl Compr Canc Netw 4 Suppl 3:S1-22 (2006)), locally recurrent,
unresectable, or metastatic breast cancer, or de novo Stage IV disease. Patients were aged     18 years,
had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of >50% at baseline (determined by echocardiogram or
multiple gated acquisition), and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG
PS) of 0 or 1. Patients may have received one hormonal treatment for MBC prior to randomization, or
neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic breast cancer therapy including Trastuzumab and/or taxanes,
provided that they experienced a disease-free interval of >12 months between completion of
neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and diagnosis of metastatic disease. Exclusion criteria included
therapy for MBC (other than described above); central nervous system metastases; history of
exposure to a cumulative dose of doxorubicin >360 mg/m2 or its equivalent; history of LVEF decline
to <50% during or after prior Trastuzumab therapy; current uncontrolled hypertension; history of
impaired cardiac function; impaired bone marrow, renal, or liver function; current known infection
with HIV, HBV, or HCV; pregnancy; lactation; and refusal to use non-hormonal contraception.
            Procedures: Patients received a loading dose of 8 mg/kg Trastuzumab, followed by a
maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical PD, or
unmanageable toxicity. Docetaxel was administered every 3 weeks at a starting dose of 75 mg/m2 ,
                                                       49

escalating to 100 mg/m2 if tolerated. Per protocol, the investigator could reduce the dose by 25% to 55
mg/m2 or 75 mg/m2 (if the patient had been dose escalated) in order to manage tolerability. It was
recommended that patients received at least 6 cycles of Docetaxel. Pertuzumab or placebo was given
at a fixed loading dose of 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks until investigator-assessed
radiographic or clinical PD, or unmanageable toxicity. In the case of chemotherapy discontinuation
due to cumulative toxicity, antibody therapy was continued until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or
withdrawal of consent. All drugs were administered intravenously.
             Assessments: PFS was evaluated by standard RECIST-accepted methodology every 9 weeks
by each center and by the IRF until IRF-assessed PD. Assessments of LVEF were performed at
baseline, every 9 weeks during the treatment period, at treatment discontinuation, every 6 months in
the first year after treatment discontinuation, then annually for up to 3 years in the follow-up period.
Laboratory parameters and ECOG status were assessed at every cycle. Adverse events (AEs) were
monitored continuously and graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 3.0. All cardiac events and
serious adverse events (SAEs) that were ongoing at the time of treatment discontinuation were
followed until resolution or stabilization up to 1 year after the final dose. Cardiac events and
treatment-related SAEs with onset post-treatment

placebo plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel (HR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.75; p <0.0001) (Figure 8).
The median PFS-IVRF was prolonged by 6.1 months from 12.4 months with placebo plus
Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel to 18.5 months with Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel. The
PFS benefit of Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel treatment was observed across all
predefined subgroups (Figure 9).
             Assessment of PFS by investigators closely matched PFS-IRF. Median PFS assessed by
investigators was 12.4 months with placebo plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel and 18.5 months with
Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel (HR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.78; p <0.0001).
             Key secondary efficacy endpoints: The interim analysis of OS took place when 43% of
events (n = 165) that are planned for final OS analysis had occurred. More deaths occurred in the
placebo plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm (n = 96; 23.6%) than in the Pertuzumab plus
Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm (n = 69; 17.2%) (Figure 10). The HR (0.64; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88; p
= 0.0053) for OS did not meet the O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundary of the Lan-DeMets a
spending function for this interim analysis of survival (HR <0.603, p <0.0012), and therefore, was not
statistically significant. However, the data showed a strong trend suggestive of a survival benefit in
favor of Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel. At the time of data cut-off, patients in both
treatments arms had been followed for OS for a median of 19.3 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate).
The ORR was 69.3% and 80.2% in the placebo plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm and
Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm, respectively The difference in response rates
between treatment arms was 10.8% (95% CI 4.2 to 17.5; p = 0.0011) (Table 2).

with median time on treatment estimated to be 11.8 and 18.1 months for placebo plus Trastuzumab
plus Docetaxel and for Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel, respectively. Dose reductions
were not permitted for placebo, Pertuzumab, or Trastuzumab. Patients received a median of eight

plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm received Docetaxel dose escalation to 100 mg/m2 at any cycle
compared with 48 (11.8%) patients in the Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm. The
median Docetaxel dose intensity was 24.8 mg/m2 /week in the placebo plus Trastuzumab plus
Docetaxel arm and 24.6 mg/m2 /week in the Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm.

             The incidence of the following grade >3 AEs was >2% higher with Pertuzumab plus
Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel: neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhea (Table 3). The incidence
of grade >3 febrile neutropenia in patients from Asia was 12% in the placebo plus Trastuzumab plus
Docetaxel arm and 26% in the Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm; in all other
geographical regions the incidence was <10% in both arms.
             LVSD (all grades) was reported more frequently in the placebo plus Trastuzumab plus
Docetaxel arm compared with the Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm (8.3% and 4.4%,
respectively). Grade >3 LVSD was reported in 2.8% of patients receiving placebo plus Trastuzumab
plus Docetaxel and in 1.2% of patients receiving Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel.
Among patients with a post-baseline LVEF assessment, LVEF declines of >10 percentage points from
baseline to <50% at any stage during treatment were reported in 6.6% and 3.8% of patients in the
placebo plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm and Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel arm,
respectively.
             In the safety population, the majority of deaths in both treatment arms were attributed to PD
(81 (20.4%) in the placebo arm, 57 (14.0%) in the Pertuzumab arm). Deaths due to causes other than
PD were generally balanced and a similar number of patients died due to AEs (10 (2.5%) in the
placebo arm, 8 (2.0%) in the Pertuzumab arm), with infections being the most common cause of death
due to an AE.
                                                  DISCUSSION
             These data show that the combination of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies Pertuzumab
and Trastuzumab with Docetaxel prolongs PFS in patients with HER2-positive MBC in the first-line
setting. Treatment with Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel exceeded expectations by
resulting in a statistically significant reduction in PFS risk (HR = 0.62) and an improvement in
median PFS of 6.1 months.
             The combination was well tolerated and Pertuzumab did not increase rates of symptomatic or
asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. Before the data herein, it was expected that treatment with two
HER2 antibodies would exacerbate cardiac toxicity. However, these data show this was not the case
based on the tests herein for evaluating cardiac toxicity: incidence of symptomatic left ventricular
systolic dysfunction (LVSD) including congestive heart failure (CHF), decrease in left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF).
             Pertuzumab-related AEs, including skin rash, mucosal inflammation, and dry skin, were
mostly mild. There was an increased rate of grade >3 diarrhea and febrile neutropenia with
Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel treatment. The control arm in CLEOPATRA had a
similar PFS to previous randomized studies that showed that the combination of Trastuzumab and
                                                        54
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

Docetaxel in HER2-positive MBC had a median PFS of 11.7 months Marty et al. J Clin Oncol
23:4265-74 (2005).
             Without being bound by any one theory, these data indicate that targeting HER2-positive
tumors with two anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies with complementary mechanisms of action results
in a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 and highlight the clinical importance of preventing the
ligand-dependent formation HER2 dimers to optimally silence HER2 signaling. This study has
shown that combined HER2 blockade with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab improves the outcome of
patients with advanced HER2-positive disease in the first-line setting. These data are significant in
that they support the first approved use of a HER2 dimerization inhibitor for therapy of HER2
positive cancer patients.

1            INDICATIONS AND USAGE
             Pertuzumab is indicated for use in combination with Trastuzumab and docetaxel for the
treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti
HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.
2            DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
             2.1 Recommended Doses and Schedules
             The initial dose of Pertuzumab is 840 mg administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion,
followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a dose of 420 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over
30 to 60 minutes. When administered with Pertuzumab, the recommended initial dose of Trastuzumab
is 8 mg/kg administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion, followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a
dose of 6 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 90 minutes. When administered
with Pertuzumab, the recommended initial dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 administered as an
intravenous infusion. The dose may be escalated to 100 mg/m2 administered every 3 weeks if the
initial dose is well tolerated.
             2.2 Dose Modification
             For delayed or missed doses, if the time between two sequential infusions is less than
6 weeks, the 420 mg dose of Pertuzumab should be administered. Do not wait until the next planned
dose. If the time between two sequential infusions is 6 weeks or more, the initial dose of 840 mg
Pertuzumab should be re-administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion followed every 3 weeks
thereafter by a dose of 420 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 to 60 minutes. The
infusion rate of Pertuzumab may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an
infusion-associated reaction. The infusion should be discontinued immediately if the patient
experiences a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
             Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (L VEF):
             Withhold Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab dosing for at least 3 weeks for either:
      *      a drop in LVEF to less than 40% or
      *      LVEF of 40% to 45% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below pretreatment values [see
             Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
                                                       56
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             Pertuzumab may be resumed if the LVEF has recovered to greater than 45% or to
      40% to 45% associated with less than a 10% absolute decrease below pretreatment values.
             If after a repeat assessment within approximately 3 weeks, the LVEF has not improved, or
      has declined further, discontinuation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab should be strongly
      considered, unless the benefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks [see
      Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Pertuzumab should be withheld or discontinued if Trastuzumab
      treatment is withheld or discontinued. If docetaxel is discontinued, treatment with Pertuzumab
      and Trastuzumab may continue. Dose reductions are not recommended for Pertuzumab. For
      docetaxel dose modifications, see docetaxel prescribing information.
             2.3 Preparation for Administration
             Administer as an intravenous infusion only. Do not administer as an intravenous push or
bolus. Do not mix Pertuzumab with other drugs.
Preparation: Prepare the solution for infusion, using aseptic technique, as follows:
             *      Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration
                    prior to administration.
             *      Withdraw the appropriate volume of Pertuzumab solution from the vial(s).
             *      Dilute into a 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride PVC or non-PVC polyolefin infusion bag.
             *      Mix diluted solution by gentle inversion. Do not shake.
             *      Administer immediately once prepared.
             *      If the diluted infusion solution is not used immediately, it can be stored at 2oC to 8oC for
                    up to 24 hours.
             *      Dilute with 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection only. Do not use dextrose (5%) solution.

5            Warnings and Precautions
             5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
             Pertuzumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Treatment of
pregnant cynomolgus monkeys with Pertuzumab resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney
development, and embryo-fetal death. If Pertuzumab is administered during pregnancy, or if the
patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential
hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Verify pregnancy status prior to the
initiation of Pertuzumab. Advise patients of the risks of embryo-fetal death and birth defects and the
need for contraception during and after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider
immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant. If Pertuzumab is administered during pregnancy
or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Pertuzumab, immediately report exposure to the
Genentech Adverse Event Line at 1-888-835-2555. Encourage women who may be exposed during
pregnancy to enroll in the MotHER Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see Patient
CounselingInformation (17)]. Monitor patients who become pregnant during Pertuzumab therapy for
oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational
age and consistent with community standards of care. The efficacy of intravenous hydration in the
management of oligohydramnios due to Pertuzumab exposure is not known.
             5.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction
             Decreases in LVEF have been reported with drugs that block HER2 activity, including
Pertuzumab. In the randomized trial, Pertuzumab in combination with Trastuzumab and docetaxel
was not associated with increases in the incidence of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(LVSD) or decreases in LVEF compared with placebo in combination with Trastuzumab and
docetaxel [see ClinicalStudies (14.1)]. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 4.4% of patients in
the Pertuzumab-treated group and 8.3% of patients in the placebo-treated group. Symptomatic left
ventricular systolic dysfunction (congestive heart failure) occurred in 1.0% of patients in the
Pertuzumab-treated group and 1.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group [see Adverse Reactions
(6.1)]. Patients who have received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest area may be
at higher risk of decreased LVEF. Pertuzumab has not been studied in patients with a pretreatment
LVEF value of< 50%, a prior history of CHF, decreases in LVEF to < 50% during prior Trastuzumab
therapy, or conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension,
recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a cumulative prior
anthracycline exposure to > 360 mg/n 2 of doxorubicin or its equivalent. Assess LVEF prior to
initiation of Pertuzumab and at regular intervals (e.g., every three months) during treatment to ensure
                                                    58
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

that LVEF is within the institution's normal limits. If LVEF is < 40%, or is 40% to 45% with a 10%
or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab and
repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks. Discontinue Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab if
the LVEF has not improved or has declined further, unless the benefits for the individual patient
outweigh the risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
             5.3 Infusion-Associated Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis
             Pertuzumab has been associated with infusion and hypersensitivity reactions [see Adverse
Reactions (6.1)]. An infusion reaction was defined in the randomized trial as any event described as
hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, acute infusion reaction or cytokine release syndrome
occurring during an infusion or on the same day as the infusion. The initial dose of Pertuzumab was
given the day before Trastuzumab and docetaxel to allow for the examination of Pertuzumab
associated reactions. On the first day, when only Pertuzumab was administered, the overall frequency
of infusion reactions was 13.0% in the Pertuzumab-treated group and 9.8% in the placebo-treated
group. Less than I% were grade 3 or 4. The most common infusion reactions (> 1.0%) were pyrexia,
chills, fatigue, headache, asthenia, hypersensitivity, and vomiting. During the second cycle when all
drugs were administered on the same day, the most common infusion reactions in the Pertuzumab
treated group (> 1.0%) were fatigue, dysgeusia, hypersensitivity, myalgia, and vomiting. In the
randomized trial, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 10.8% in the
Pertuzumab-treated group and 9.10% in the placebo-treated group. The incidence of Grade 3 - 4
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 2% in the Pertuzumab-treated group and 2.5% in the
placebo-treated group according to National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (NCI - CTCAE) (version 3). Overall, 4 patients in Pertuzumab-treated group and
2 patients in the placebo-treated group experienced anaphylaxis. Observe patients closely for
60 minutes after the first infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions of Pertuzumab. If a
significant infusion-associated reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion and administer
appropriate medical therapies. Monitor patients carefully until complete resolution of signs and
symptoms. Consider permanent discontinuation in patients with severe infusion reactions [see
Dosage andAdministration (2.2)].
             5.4          HER2 Testin2
             Detection of HER2 protein overexpression is necessary for selection of patients appropriate
for Pertuzumab therapy because these are the only patients studied and for whom benefit has been
shown [see Indications and Usage (1) and ClinicalStudies (14)]. In the randomized trial, patients
                                                     59
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

with breast cancer were required to have evidence of HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC by
Dako HERCEPTEST® or FISH amplification ratio              2.0 by Dako HER2 FISH PHARMDXTM test kit.
Only limited data were available for patients whose breast cancer was positive by FISH, but did not
demonstrate protein overexpression by IHC. Assessment of HER2 status should be performed by
laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the specific technology being utilized. Improper assay
performance, including use of sub-optimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents,
deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay
validation, can lead to unreliable results.
6            Adverse Reactions
The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:
      *      Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1)]
      *      Left Ventricular Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions(5.2)]
      *      Infusion-Associated Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and
             Precautions(5.3)]
             6.1            Clinical Trials Experience
             Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates
observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of
another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In clinical trials, Pertuzumab
has been evaluated in more than 1400 patients with various malignancies and treatment with
Pertuzumab was predominantly in combination with other anti-neoplastic agents.
             The adverse reactions described in Table 4 were identified in 804 patients with HER2
positive metastatic breast cancer treated in the randomized trial. Patients were randomized to receive
either Pertuzumab in combination with Trastuzumab and docetaxel or placebo in combination with
Trastuzumab and docetaxel. The median duration of study treatment was 18.1 months for patients in
the Pertuzumab-treated group and 11.8 months for patients in the placebo-treated group. No dose
adjustment was permitted for Pertuzumab or Trastuzumab. The rates of adverse events resulting in
permanent discontinuation of all study therapy were 6.10%for patients in the Pertuzumab-treated
group and 5.3% for patients in the placebo-treated group. Adverse events led to discontinuation of
docetaxel alone in 23.6% of patients in the Pertuzumab-treated group and 23.2% of patients in the
placebo-treated group. Table 4 reports the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients
in the Pertuzumab-treated group. The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) seen with Pertuzumab
                                                       60
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

in combination with Trastuzumab and docetaxel were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue,
rash, and peripheral neuropathy.
            The most common NCI - CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 - 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, asthenia, and
fatigue. An increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed for Asian patients in both
treatment arms compared with patients of other races and from other geographic regions. Among
Asian patients, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the Pertuzumab-treated group (26%)
compared with the placebo-treated group (12%).

             The following clinically relevant adverse reactions were reported in < 10% of patients in
the Pertuzumab-treated group:
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Paronychia (7.1% in the Pertuzumab-treated group vs.
3.5% in the placebo-treated group); Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Pleural
effusion (5.2% in the Pertuzumab-treated group vs. 5.8% in the placebo-treated group); Cardiac
disorders: Left ventricular dysfunction (4.4% in the Pertuzumab-treated group vs. 8.3% in the
placebo-treated group) including symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (CHF) (1.0% in
the Pertuzumab-treated group vs. 1.8% in the placebo-treated group); Immune system disorders:
Hypersensitivity (10.1% in the Pertuzumab-treated group vs. 8.6% in placebo-treated group).
             Adverse Reactions Reported in Patients Receiving Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab after
Discontinuation of Docetaxel
             In the randomized trial, adverse reactions were reported less frequently after discontinuation
of docetaxel treatment. All adverse reactions in the Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab treatment group
occurred in < 10% of patients with the exception of diarrhea (19.1 %), upper respiratory tract infection
(12.8%), rash (11.7%), headache (11.4%), and fatigue (11.1%).
             6.2 Immunogenicity
             As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for an immune response to Pertuzumab.
Patients in the randomized trial were tested at multiple time-points for antibodies to Pertuzumab.
                                                           62
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

Approximately 2.8% (11/386) of patients in the Pertuzumab-treated group and 6.2% (23/372) of
patients in the placebo-treated group tested positive for anti-Pertuzumab antibodies. Of these
34 patients, none experienced anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions that were clearly related to the
anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA). The presence of Pertuzumab in patient serum at the levels
expected at the time of ATA sampling can interfere with the ability of this assay to detect anti
Pertuzumab antibodies. In addition, the assay may be detecting antibodies to Trastuzumab. As a
result, data may not accurately reflect the true incidence of anti-Pertuzumab antibody development.
Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods used.
Additionally, the observed incidence of a positive result in a test method may be influenced by several
factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, drug interference, concomitant
medication, and the underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies
to Pertuzumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.
7     Drug Interactions
      No drug-drug interactions were observed between Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab, or between
Pertuzumab and docetaxel.

             8.1            Pregnancy
             Pregnancy Category D
             Risk Summary
             There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Pertuzumab in pregnant women. Based
on findings in animal studies, Pertuzumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant
woman. The effects of Pertuzumab are likely to be present during all trimesters of pregnancy.
Pertuzumab administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys resulted in oligohydranmios, delayed
fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal deaths at clinically relevant exposures of 2.5 to 20-fold
greater than the recommended human dose, based on C.m. If Pertuzumab is administered during
pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Pertuzumab, the patient should be
apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. If Pertuzumab is administered during pregnancy or if a
patient becomes pregnant while receiving Pertuzumab, immediately report exposure to the Genentech
Adverse Event Line at 1-888-835-2555. Encourage women who may be exposed during pregnancy to
enroll in the MotHER Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see Patient Counseling
Information (17)].

10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             Animal Data
             Reproductive toxicology studies have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Pregnant
monkeys were treated on Gestational Day (GD)19 with loading doses of 30 to 150 mg/kg
Pertuzumab, followed by bi-weekly doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg. These dose levels resulted in clinically
relevant exposures of 2.5 to 20-fold greater than the recommended human dose, based on Cmax.
Intravenous administration of Pertuzumab from GD 19 through GD50 (period of organogenesis) was
embryotoxic, with dose-dependent increases in embryo-fetal death between GD25 to GD70. The
incidences of embryo-fetal loss were 33, 50, and 85% for dams treated with bi-weekly Pertuzumab
doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, respectively (2.5 to 20-fold greater than the recommended human
dose, based on            Cmax).   At Caesarean section on GD 100, oligohydranmios, decreased relative lung and
kidney weights and microscopic evidence of renal hypoplasia consistent with delayed renal
development were identified in all Pertuzumab dose groups. Pertuzumab exposure was reported in
offspring from all treated groups, at levels of 29% to 40% of maternal serum levels at GD100.
             8.3 Nursing Mothers
             It is not known whether Pertuzumab is excreted in human milk, but human IgG is excreted in
human milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious
adverse reactions in nursing infants from Pertuzumab, a decision should be made whether to
discontinue nursing, or discontinue drug, taking into account the elimination half-life of Pertuzumab
and the importance of the drug to the mother [See Warnings and Precautions(5.1), Clinical
Pharmacology (12.3)].
             8.4 Pediatric Use
             The safety and effectiveness of Pertuzumab have not been established in pediatric patients.
             8.5 Geriatric Use
      Of 402 patients who received Pertuzumab in the randomized trial, 60 patients (15%) were
> 65 years of age and 5 patients (1%) were > 75 years of age. No overall differences in efficacy and
safety of Pertuzumab were observed between these patients and younger patients. Based on a
population pharmacokinetic analysis, no significant difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics
of Pertuzumab between patients < 65 years (n=306) and patients > 65 years (n=175).
                                                             64

             8.6           Females of Reproductive Potential
             Pertuzumab can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Counsel
patients regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Advise females of reproductive potential to
use effective contraception while receiving Pertuzumab and for 6 months following the last dose of
Pertuzumab. If Pertuzumab is administered during pregnancy or if a patient becomes pregnant while
receiving Pertuzumab, immediately report exposure to the Genentech Adverse Event Line at
 1-888-835-2555. Encourage women who may be exposed during pregnancy to enroll in the MotHER
Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see Patient CounselingInformation (17)].
             8.7           Renal Impairment
             Dose adjustments of Pertuzumab are not needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance
[CLcr] 60 to 90 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr 30 to 60 mL/min) renal impairment. No dose adjustment
can be recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min) because
of the limited pharmacokinetic data available [see ClinicalPharmacology(12.3)].
             8.8           Hepatic Impairment
             No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the
pharmacokinetics of Pertuzumab.
10 OVERDOSAGE
No drug overdoses have been reported with Pertuzumab to date.
11 Description
      Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular
dimerization domain (Subdomain II) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein
(HER2). Pertuzumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese
Hamster Ovary) culture containing the antibiotic, gentamicin. Gentamicin is not detectable in the
final product. Pertuzumab has an approximate molecular weight of 148 kDa. Pertuzumab is a sterile,
clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale brown liquid for intravenous infusion. Each single use
                                                         65

vial contains 420 mg of Pertuzumab at a concentration of 30 mg/mL in 20 mM L-histidine acetate
(pH 6.0), 120 mM sucrose and 0.02% polysorbate 20.
12 Clinical Pharmacology
             12.1 Mechanism of Action
             Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (Subdomain II) of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2) and, thereby, blocks ligand-dependent
heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER family members, including EGFR, HER3 and HER4.
As a result, Pertuzumab inhibits ligand-initiated intracellular signaling through two major signal
pathways, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (P13K). Inhibition
of these signaling pathways can result in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively. In addition,
Pertuzumab mediates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). While Pertuzumab
alone inhibited the proliferation of human tumor cells, the combination of Pertuzumab and
Trastuzumab significantly augmented anti-tumor activity in HER2-overexpressing xenograft models.
             12.2           Pharmacokinetics
             Pertuzumab demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics at a dose range of 2 - 25 mg/kg. Based on
a population PK analysis that included 481 patients, the median clearance (CL) of Pertuzumab was
0.24 L/day and the median half-life was 18 days. With an initial dose of 840 mg followed by a
maintenance dose of 420 mg every three weeks thereafter, the steady-state concentration of
Pertuzumab was reached after the first maintenance dose. The population PK analysis suggested no
PK differences based on age, gender, and ethnicity (Japanese vs. non-Japanese). Baseline serum
albumin level and lean body weight as covariates only exerted a minor influence on PK parameters.
Therefore, no dose adjustments based on body weight or baseline albumin level are needed. No drug
drug interactions were observed between Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab, or between Pertuzumab and
docetaxel in a sub-study of 37 patients in the randomized trial. No dedicated renal impairment trial for
Pertuzumab has been conducted. Based on the results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis,
Pertuzumab exposure in patients with mild (CLcr 60 to 90 mL/min, n=200) and moderate renal
impairment (CLcr 30 to 60 mE/min, n=71) were similar to those in patients with normal renal
function (CLcr greater than 90 mE/min, n=200). No relationship between CLcr and Pertuzumab
exposure was observed over the range of observed CLcr (27 to 244 m/min).
                                                      66
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             12.3           Cardiac Electrophysiology
             The effect of Pertuzumab with an initial dose of 840 mg followed by a maintenance dose of
420 mg every three weeks on QTc interval was evaluated in a subgroup of 20 patients with HER2
positive breast cancer in the randomized trial. No large changes in the mean QT interval (i.e., greater
than 20 ms) from placebo based on Fridericia correction method were detected in the trial. A small
increase in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) cannot be excluded because of the limitations
of the trial design.
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
             13.1           Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
             Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential
of Pertuzumab. Studies have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic potential of Pertuzumab.
No specific fertility studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the effect of Pertuzumab. No
adverse effects on male and female reproductive organs were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies
of up to six months duration in cynomolgus monkeys.
14 Clinical Studies
             14.1 Metastatic Breast Cancer
             The randomized trial was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 808 patients
with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2
overexpression defined as 3+ IHC or FISH amplification ratio           2.0 determined at a central
laboratory. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo plus Trastuzumab and docetaxel or
Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab and docetaxel. Randomization was stratified by prior treatment (prior
or no prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy) and geographic region
(Europe, North America, South America, and Asia). Patients with prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant
therapy were required to have a disease-free interval of greater than 12 months before trial enrollment.
Pertuzumab was given intravenously at an initial dose of 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks
thereafter. Trastuzumab was given intravenously at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg
every 3 weeks thereafter. Patients were treated with Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab until progression
of disease, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity. Docetaxel was given as an initial dose of
75 mg/in 2 by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for at least 6 cycles. The docetaxel dose could be
escalated to 100 mg/m 2 at the investigator's discretion if the initial dose was well tolerated.
                                                          67
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             At the time of the primary analysis, the mean number of cycles of study treatment
administered was 16.2 in the placebo-treated group and 19.9 in the Pertuzumab-treated group.
             The primary endpoint of the randomized trial was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed
by an independent review facility (IRF). PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization
to the date of disease progression or death (from any cause) if the death occurred within 18 weeks of
the last tumor assessment. Additional endpoints included overall survival (OS), PFS (investigator
assessed), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response.
             Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms.
The median age was 54 (range 22 to 89 years), 59% were White, 32% were Asian, and 4% were
Black. All were women with the exception of 2 patients. Seventeen percent of patients were enrolled
in North America, 14% in South America, 3 8% in Europe, and 310%in Asia. Tumor prognostic
characteristics, including hormone receptor status (positive 48%, negative 50%), presence of visceral
disease (78%) and non-visceral disease only (22%) were similar in the study arms. Approximately
half of the patients received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy
(placebo 47%, Pertuzumab 46%). Among patients with hormone receptor positive tumors, 45%
received prior adjuvant hormonal therapy and I1% received hormonal therapy for metastatic disease.
Eleven percent of patients received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant Trastuzumab.
             The randomized trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in IRF-assessed
PFS in the Pertuzumab-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group [hazard ratio (HR)         =
0.62 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.75), p < 0.0001] and an increase in median PFS of 6.1 months (median PFS of
 18.5 months in the Pertuzumab-treated group vs. 12.4 months in the placebo-treated group) (see
Figure 8). The results for investigator-assessed PFS were comparable to those observed for IRF
assessed PFS. Consistent results were observed across several patient subgroups including age (< 65
or > 65 years), race, geographic region, prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy or
chemotherapy (yes or no), and prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant Trastuzumab (yes or no). In the subgroup
of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (n=408), the hazard ratio was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.42,
0.72). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (n=388), the hazard ratio
was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.95). In the subgroup of patients with disease limited to non-visceral
metastasis (n=178), the hazard ratio was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.52).
             At the time of the PFS analysis, 165 patients had died. More deaths occurred in the placebo
treated group (23.6%) compared with the Pertuzumab-treated group (17.2%). At the interim OS
analysis, the results were not mature and did not meet the pre-specified stopping boundary for
statistical significance. See Table 5 and Figure 10.

   17           Patient Counseling Information
                Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that Pertuzumab exposure can
  result in fetal harm, including embryo-fetal death or birth defects [see Warnings and Precautions
   (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations(8.1)]
                Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving
  Pertuzumab and for 6 months following the last dose of Pertuzumab [see Warnings and Precautions
   (5.1) and Use in Special Populations (8.6)]
                                                            69
   10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             Advise nursing mothers treated with Pertuzumab to discontinue nursing or discontinue
Pertuzumab, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Use in Specific
Populations(8.3)].
             Encourage women who are exposed to Pertuzumab during pregnancy to enroll in the

                                    Early-Sta2e Breast Cancer Therapy with Pertuzumab
             Anthracyclines (generally used in combination with 5-FU and cyclophosphamide) have a
central role in the management of breast cancer. Romond et al. NEJM 353(16): 1673-1684 (2005),
and Poole et al. NEJM 355 (18): 1851-1852 (2006).
             Taxanes are also integral in standard regimens for the treatment of breast cancer, used in
combination with anthracyclines in a regimen known as TAC (Martin et al. NEJM 352 (22): 2302
2313 (2005)) or in sequence with anthracyclines in a regimen known as AC->T (Romond et al.,
supra; Joensuu et al. NEJM 354 (8): 809-820 (2006)).
             Carboplatin is both an active and well tolerated chemotherapy agent and there are studies in
breast cancer which show clear efficacy in combination with a taxane and Trastuzumab in a regimen
known as TCH (Slamon et al. BCIRG 006. SABS (2007); Robert et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 24: 2786-2792
(2006)). However, in metastatic breast cancer, there are negative data (Forbes et al. BCIRG 007 Proc.
Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol. Abstract No. LBA516 (2006)).
             A previous neoadjuvant study with Pertuzumab (NeoSphere) evaluated it in combination with
Docetaxel and Trastuzumab (Gianni et al. Cancer Research 70 (24) (Suppl. 2) (December 2010)), but
not in combination with anthracycline-based or carboplatin-based chemotherapy.

Primary Objective
             The primary objective was evaluated when all patients had received six cycles of neoadjuvant
treatment, had their surgery and all necessary samples taken or were withdrawn from the study
whichever is earlier.
Secondary Objectives
             To make a preliminary assessment of the activity associated with each regimen as indicated by
the complete pathological response rate.
             To evaluate the safety profiles         of each treatment regimen, including pre-operative
(neoadjuvant) and post-operative (adjuvant) treatment.
             To investigate the overall survival, the time to clinical response, time-to-response, disease free
survival and progression free survival for each treatment arm.
             To investigate the biomarkers that may be associated with primary and secondary efficacy
endpoints in accordance with each treatment arm.
             To investigate the rate of breast conservative surgery for all patients with T2-3 tumors for whom
mastectomy was planned at diagnosis.
             An overall assessment of the risk and benefit of each regimen will be made.
Overview of Study Desi2n
             This was a Phase II open-label, randomized, multi-center trial to evaluate the tolerability and
activity associated with Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab when used in addition to anthracycline-based or
carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive
breast cancer which was early stage and >2cm in diameter or locally advanced or inflammatory (see
Figure 11).

             Six cycles of active chemotherapy were administered. However, if it was considered that
patients required further therapy post surgery, it was suggested that those patients who had received
FEC->T were given CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) and that those patients
who had received TCH, but who are deemed to require further chemotherapy received FEC (5
fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide).
             After the completion of surgery (and after the completion of post-operative chemotherapy if
required), patients received radiotherapy as per local clinical standard and those patients whose tumors
were estrogen-receptor positive received hormone manipulation as per local clinical standard.
             In summary, all patients received at least 6 cycles of active chemotherapy and the two
antibodies, Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab plus surgery and radiotherapy (as per local standard) plus any
hormone manipulation indicated (as per local standard) and continued to receive Trastuzumab to one
year in total.
             Patients whose neoadjuvant study treatment was discontinued prior to surgery were managed
as per local practice. Approximately 28 days after the last dose of study medication, patients were asked
to perform a final safety assessment (called Final Visit).
Study Population
Overview

Excluded Therapies
The following therapies are excluded during the treatment period of the study:
Anti-cancer therapies other than those administered in this study, including cytotoxic chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, (except for adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer after completion of
      chemotherapy or additional adjuvant chemotherapy immediately post-surgery, if deemed
      necessary) immunotherapy, and biological anti-cancer therapy.
Any targeted therapy.
Treatment with steroids except for thyroid hormone replacement therapy and short term
      corticosteroid, in order to treat or prevent allergic or infusion reactions.

                                                       CONCLUSIONS
      -      Results from this study indicate a low incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic LVSD
             across all arms
                    -       Concurrent administration of Pertuzumab plus Trastuzumab with epirubicin resulted
                            in similar cardiac tolerability compared with sequential administration or the
                            anthracycline-free regimen
      -      Neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia and diarrhea were most frequently reported
             adverse events (grade >3) across all arms
      -      Regardless of chemotherapy chosen, the combination of Pertuzumab with Trastuzumab in the
             neoadjuvant setting resulted in high pathological complete response (pCR) rates (57 to 66%)
      -      TRYPHAENA supports the use of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab plus anthracyline-based or
             carboplatin-based chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings of early-stage breast
             cancer.
                                                          EXAMPLE 6
                                   Co-Administration of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab
             In the phase III clinical trials above Pertuzumab was administered by intravenous (IV)
infusion in saline IV bags to patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer followed by
Trastuzumab and the chemotherapeutic agent Docetaxel also using saline IV infusions. The IV
infusion process for Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab takes approximately 60 to 90 minutes each with a
30 to 60 minute patient observation period after each drug. Due to this treatment regimen per patient,
a visit can take up to 7.5 hours total. As medical payments for both drugs and drug administration
services have been under scrutiny in the recent past, there has been emphasis on business practices to
shorten time and to increase medical resource utilization in clinical and hospital settings. Increased
efficiency of patient care, compliance and treatment is expected by shortening the time patients spend
in the clinic for each cycle of treatment.
             As part of the phase III Pertuzumab clinical trials, Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab are
administered through intravenous (IV) infusion to patients sequentially, i.e. one drug after the other.
While Pertuzumab is given as a flat dose (420mg for maintenance, 840mg for loading), Trastuzumab
is weight based (6mg/kg for maintenance doses). To increase convenience and minimize the in-clinic
time for the patients, the feasibility of co-administering Pertuzumab with Trastuzumab in a single
250mL 0.9% saline polyolefin (PO) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) IV infusion bag was assessed. The
individual monoclonal antibodies have been demonstrated to be stable in infusion bags (PO and/or
PVC) over 24 hours at 5'C and 30'C. In this study, the compatibility and stability of Pertuzumab
(420mg and 840mg) mixed with either 420mg Trastuzumab (6mg/kg dose for a 70kg patient) or
                                                               79

720mg (6mg/kg for a 120kg patient) in IV bags for up to 24 hours at 50 C or 30 0 C was evaluated. The
controls (i.e. Pertuzumab alone in an IV bag, Trastuzumab alone in an IV bag) and the monoclonal
antibody (mAb) mixture samples were assessed using the existing Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab
analytical methods, which include color, appearance and clarity (CAC), concentration and turbidity
by UV-spec scan, particulate analysis by HIAC-Royco, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and
ion-exchange chromatography (IEC). Additionally, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), image
capillary isoelectric focusing (iCIEF), and potency (the Pertuzumab anti-proliferation assay only) was
utilized to measure the admixtures containing 1:1 of Pertuzumab:Trastuzumab and their respective
controls (420mg Pertuzumab only and 420mg Trastuzumab only) only as a representative case.
             Results showed no observable differences by the above assays in the Pertuzumab/
Trastuzumab mixtures between the time zero (TO) control and the sample stored up to 24 hours at
either 50 C or 30 0 C. The physicochemical assays as listed above were able to detect both molecules as
well as the minor variants in the drug mixture, though some overlaps of monoclonal antibody species
were seen in the chromatograms. Furthermore, the drug mixture tested by the Pertuzumab specific
inhibition of cell proliferation assay showed comparable potency before and after storage. The results
from this study showed the Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab admixtures are physically and chemically
stable in an IV infusion bag for up to 24 hours at 50 C or 30 0 C and can be used for clinical
administration if necessary.
   Dose 1: 840mg Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture (420mg Pertuzumab and 420mg
   Trastuzumab)
             Sample Preparation: All procedures were performed aseptically under a laminar flow hood.
PO IV infusion bag samples with three types of drug combinations were prepared for this study: 1)
420mg Pertuzumab/ 420mg Trastuzumab mixture, 2) 420mg Pertuzumab alone, and 3) 420mg
Trastuzumab alone. The Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab alone samples served as controls.
             Trastuzumab was reconstituted with 20mL of bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI) and
left on lab bench for approximately 15 minutes prior to use. To prepare the Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab
sample dose, l4mL of Pertuzumab (420mg) was diluted directly into the IV infusion bag that
contained a nominal 250mL (± 25mL overage) 0.9% saline solution, without removing an equal
amount of saline, followed by 20mL of the reconstituted Trastuzumab (420mg) using an 18 gauge
needle at room temperature. The total concentration of the two proteins combined in the 250mL IV
bag was expected to be approximately 3mg/mL. Similarly, the Pertuzumab (420mg) alone IV bag was
prepared with 14mL of the 30mg/mL drug product directly diluted into an IV infusion bag. The final
expected concentration was approximately 1mg/mL. The Trastuzumab (420mg) alone IV infusion bag
was also prepared in the same manner except 20mL of the 21 mg/mL drug product was added into the
bag. The final expected concentration was approximately 1mg/mL.

             The PO IV bags were manually mixed thoroughly by a gentle back and forth rocking motion
several times to ensure homogeneity. After mixing, 1OmL of sample was removed with a syringe
from each bag and stored in sterile 15cc falcon tubes to be used as the diluted sample control at time
zero (TO). The IV bags were then stored covered in foil at 30'C for 24 hours (T24). Immediately after
storage, the remainder of the sample was removed with a syringe from each bag and placed into
sterile 250 mL PETG containers. The TO and T24 samples were held for up to 24 hours at 5'C or
immediately analyzed by CAC, UV-spec scan (concentration and turbidity), SEC, IEC, CZE, iCIEF,
HIAC-Royco, as well as potency. The product quality of the samples was tested by the Pertuzumab
and Trastuzumab product specific SEC and IEC methods, while only the Pertuzumab specific potency
method was performed. The other assays utilized were non-product specific methods. All assays
were qualified for the intended testing in their respective molecules and used without further method
optimization.
Dose 11: 1560mg Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture (840mg Pertuzumab and 720mg
Trastuzumab)
             Sample preparation: The upper range of the mAb co-administration dose was examined
(1560mg total mixture: 840mg Pertuzumab and 720mg Trastuzumab) in PO and PVC IV infusion bag
samples. In the event that an increase in protein aggregation is observed, the propensity of the
formation of high molecular weight species (HMWS) would more likely occur at the upper dose of
1560mg total mAb rather than the mixture containing 840mg. To mitigate the risk during in-use
conditions at the high dose range, both PO and PVC IV infusion bags were studied to ensure no
interactions were seen.
             Three types of drug combinations (mixture, 840mg Pertuzumab alone, and 720mg
Trastuzumab alone) were prepared and handled similar to the dose I study. The Pertuzumab/
Trastuzumab mixture contained 28mL of Pertuzumab (840mg) diluted directly into either PO or PVC
IV infusion bags followed by 34mL of the reconstituted Trastuzumab (720mg) using an 18 gauge
needle at room temperature. The total concentration of the two mAbs combined in a single 250mL IV
bag was expected to be approximately 5mg/mL. For the controls, Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab alone
IV infusion bag samples were prepared and handled similar to the dose I study, except 28mL of
30mg/mL Pertuzumab and 34mL of 21mg/mL Trastuzumab was directly diluted into each PO or PVC
IV infusion bag. The final expected concentration was approximately 3mg/mL for the Pertuzumab
(840mg) and Trastuzumab (720mg) alone samples. The bags were stored uncovered at either 50 C or
30'C for up to 24 hours. The TO and T24 samples were analyzed immediately or held for up to 24 to
48 hours at 50 C by CAC, UV-spec scan (concentration and turbidity), SEC, IEC, and HIAC-Royco.

Assays
All samples were held at 5'C or immediately analyzed. Typically, samples were analyzed within 24 to
48 hours of preparation and storage. The following assays were conducted to ascertain product quality
and short term stability of Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, and Trastuzumab
alone samples diluted into saline IV infusion bags. Since several assays, i.e. SEC, IEC, CZE, iCIEF,
and potency, were not optimized for quantitative assessment of the mAb mixtures, only
chromatographic or electropherographic overlays of these samples and their individual controls before
and after storage at 5'C or 30'C are shown here. For consistency, no values, e.g. percent peak area,
were calculated for all three sample types from the liquid chromatography and electrophorectic assays
that were performed.
Color, Appearance, and Clarity (CAC)
      The color, appearance, and clarity of the samples were determined by visual inspection under a
white fluorescence light with black and white background at room temperature. A 3cc glass vial was
                                                             82
103416851 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

filled with 1 mL of each sample for CAC testing. A negative control (purified water) with the
corresponding sample volume was used for comparison.
UV- Vis Spectrophotometer Scan for Concentration Measurements
The concentration was determined by measurement of the UV-absorbance on an HP8453
spectrophotometer via volumetric sample preparation. The instrument was blanked with 0.9% saline.
Absorbance at Amax(278nm or 279nm) and 320nm in a quartz cuvette with 1-cm path length were
measured for each sample. The absorbance at 320nm is used to correct for background light scattering
in solution. The concentration determination was calculated by using the absorptivity of 1.50 (mg/nL)
  1 1
         for both Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab molecules.
          Protein Concentration (mg/mL) =       '"ax A    x Dilution Factor x

Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC: Pertuzumab specific and Trastuzumab specific)
             Each sample was injected into a TOSOHAAS@ column G3000 SWXL, 7.8 X 300mm at
ambient temperature on an AGILENT 1100@ HPLC. The eluted peaks were monitored at 280nm.
Chromatographic integrations were analyzed by the CHROMELEON@ software. The autosampler
temperature was held at 2-8'C throughout the run and mobile phases used were 0.2M potassium
phosphate, 0.25mM potassium chloride, pH 6.2 and 100mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8 for
Pertuzumab-assay and Trastuzumab-assay, respectively. The recommended injection load as
specified by the test procedure was 200 pg with an injection volume of 20 pL. The diluted 420mg
sample was injected at a load less than the recommended amount due to the low concentration of the
protein after dilution in the IV bags. The maximum injection volume of the HPLC sample loop was
 100 ptL, which limits the volume that is able to be injected at one time. As a result, the injection
volumes were modified to 100 ptL at 160 ptg protein for the Pertuzumab alone and Trastuzumab alone
samples (420 mg dose group) and 73 ptL at 200 ptg protein for the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture
(840 mg dose group). Modification in the injection volumes have been utilized in previous IV bag
studies and are necessary when handling low concentration samples.
      Ion-exchange Chromatography (IEC)
             The analysis of carboxypeptidase B (CpB)- digested Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab for charge
heterogeneity was employed by IEC for each sample. For the Pertuzumab specific IEC, samples were
either tested with regular IEC ("Pertuzumab-regular IEC") or a modified "fast" version of IEC
("Pertuzumab-IEC-fast") for high throughput, method for the purpose of these experiments. The IEC
assays utilized the a DIONEX@ WCX weak cation exchange column equilibrated with solvent A
(20ml MES, ImM Na 2EDTA pH 6.00) and solvent B (250mMl sodium chloride in solvent A)
monitored at 280nm for Pertuzumab-regular IEC and Pertuzumab-IEC-fast, whereas solvent A
                                                       83
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

(1OmM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) and solvent B (1OOmMV                     sodium chloride in Solvent A) monitored
at 214nm was used for Trastuzumab on an AGILENT 1100@ HPLC. The peaks were eluted at a flow
rate of 0.8 mL/min with an increasing gradient of 18%-100% solvent B over 35 minutes and 90
minutes for Pertuzumab-regular-IEC and Pertuzumab-IEC- fast, respectively, and 15%-100% solvent
B over 55 minutes for Trastuzumab-IEC. Column temperatures were maintained at either 34'C or
42 C and ambient for Pertuzumab-regular-IEC or Pertuzumab-fast-IEC and Trastuzumab-IEC,
respectively, while the auto sampler temperature was held at 2-8 C throughout the run.
HIAC-ROYCOTM light obscuration for sub-visible particles
             Particulate counts in the diluted drug product were carried out using the HIAC-ROYCOTM
Liquid Particulate Counting System model 9703. Average cumulative numbers of particles at >10ptm
and >25ptm per milliliter were tabulated in each sample using PHARMSPEC v2.0TM. The test
procedure was modified for a small- volume method, utilizing either four ImL readings or four
0.4mL readings per a test session while discarding the first reading of each sample. The HIAC
ROYCOTM samples were degassed under vacuum for approximately 10-15 minutes each. The size
below 1Opm was not collected for this sample set.
UV- Vis Spectrophotometer Scan for Turbidity Measurements
             The optical density of the samples from the IV bag (1mg/mL or 3mg/mL) was measured in a
quartz cuvette with a 1-cm path length on a HP8453 spectrophotometer. The sample readings were
blanked against purified water. The absorbance measurements were recorded at 340nm, 345nm,
350nm, 355nm, and 360nm and the turbidity was expressed as an average of these wavelengths.
Capillary Zone Electrophoresis, CZE
             CZE was performed using a PROTEOMELAB PA800TM capillary electrophoresis system
(Beckman Coulter) with neutral-coated capillary (50 tm x 50 cm). The buffer consisted of 40 mM 8
amino caproic acid/acetic acid, pH 4.5, 0.2% hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Samples
were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL in water and injected into the capillary at 1 psi for 10 seconds. Separation
was performed using a voltage of 30 kV for 15 minutes, and the species were detected by UV at 214
nm.
CE-SDS-LIF, reduced and non-reduced
             Each sample was derivatized with 5 carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester, a
fluorescent dye. After removing the free dye through gel filtration (using NAP-5 colunms), non
reduced samples were prepared by adding 40 mM iodoacetamide and heated at 70'C for 5 minutes.
For the analysis of the reduced samples, the derivatized samples were mixed with SDS to a final
concentration of              1%   (v/v) and 10 mL of a solution containing 1 M DTT, and heated at 70'C for 20
minutes. The prepared samples were analyzed on a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab PA800 system
                                                                84
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

using a 50 mm I.D. 31.2 cm fused silica capillary maintained at 20'C throughout the analysis.
Samples were introduced into the capillary by electrokinetic injection at 10 kV for 40 seconds. The
separation was conducted at a constant voltage of 15 kV in the reversed polarity (negative to positive)
mode using CE-SDS running buffer as the sieving medium. An argon ion laser operating at 488 nm
was used for fluorescence excitation with the resulting emission signal monitored at 560 nm.
iCIEF
      The distribution of charge variants of the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone,
and Trastuzumab alone was assessed by iCIEF using an iCE28OTM analyzer (Convergent Bioscience)
with a fluorocarbon coated capillary cartridge (100 tm x 5 cm). The ampholyte solution consisted of
a mixture of 0.35% methyl cellulose (MC), 0.47% Pharmalyte 3-10 carrier ampholytes, 2.66%
Pharmalyte 8-10.5 carrier ampholytes, and 0.20% pl markers 7.05 and 9.77 in purified water. The
anolyte was 80 mM phosphoric acid, and the catholyte was 100 mM sodium hydroxide, both in 0.10%
methylcellulose. Samples were diluted in purified water and CpB was added to each diluted sample
at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100 followed by incubation at 37'C for 20 minutes. The CpB
treated samples were mixed with the ampholyte solution and then focused by introducing a potential
of 1500 V for one minute, followed by a potential of 3000 V for 10 minutes. An image of the focused
Pertuzumab charge variants was obtained by passing 280 nm ultraviolet light through the capillary
and into the lens of a charge coupled device digital camera. This image was then analyzed to
determine the distribution of the various charge variants.
Anti-Proliferation Potency Assay
            This test procedure is based on the ability of Pertuzumab to inhibit the proliferation of MDA
MB 175 VII human breast carcinoma cells. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture
microtiter plates and incubated overnight at 37 'C under 5% CO 2 to allow cell attachment. The
following day, the culture medium was removed and serial dilutions of each standard, controls, and
sample(s) were added to the plates. The plates were then incubated for fours days at 37 'C under 5%
CO 2 and the relative number of viable cells was quantified indirectly using a redox dye,
ALAMARBLUE@ according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was assayed in triplicate
and the changes in color as measured by fluorescence were directly proportional to the number living
cells in the culture. The absorbance of each well was then measured on a fluorescence 96-well plate
reader. The results, expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU), were plotted against the antibody
concentration. No quantitative measurements were made, or possible, since there was no
Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture reference available. Therefore, the results are comparisons of the
dose response curves only.

            After storage, the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, and Trastuzumab
alone samples appeared as a clear and colorless liquid with no visible particles as observed by CAC.
The concentration and turbidity measurements showed no measureable changes in any of the three
sample types after 24 hours at 30'C. Particulate analysis by HIAC Royco detected no more than 6
particles greater than or equal to 10pm size and no particles greater than 25 pm size for
Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, or Trastuzumab alone samples post storage.
These results are comparable to the 0.9% saline only solution. The lack of visible precipitation or
particulates indicates that the admixture and the controls are sufficiently stable upon dilution in the
0.9% saline IV infusion bags. The Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture diluted in saline were run on
SEC, both Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab specific methods, and showed comparable peak profiles
between TO and T24 (Figures 15 and 16). No increases were observed in the high molecular weight
                                                                                 86

species (HMWS) and low molecular weight species (LMWS). Similarly, no changes were observed in
the main peak in any sample. The main peak and the peak area of the HMWS and LMWS overlay and
cannot be distinguished in the Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab mixture due the size similarity between
Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab (molecular weight approximately 150kD). Furthermore, comparison of
TO and T24 for both the Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab alone sample showed no observable changes in
peak area or profile as detected by the two SEC methods listed above.
            Two product specific methods for Pertuzumab or Trastuzumab IEC was utilized to analyze the
Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture (Figures 17 and 18). In the cation-exchange chromatography
assays, each molecule typically contain three distinct areas that are eluted based on relative charge,
with the early eluting acidic variants, followed by the main peak, and lastly the late eluting basic
variants. In the Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab alone chromatograms, the profile exhibiting the acidic
variants, main peak, and the basic variants was observed and deemed comparable between the starting
material and post storage at 30'C. These results are also consistent with prior studies conducted in
saline IV infusion bags for the either Pertuzumab or Trastuzumab alone. For the Pertuzumab/
Trastuzumab mixture chromatogram, the Pertuzumab peaks elute first followed by the Trastuzumab
peaks. Due to the nature of cation-exchange separation and the net charge difference between
Pertuzumab (-pl 8.7) and Trastuzumab (-pl 8.9), two main peaks, or major charged species, are
observed in the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture. In contrast, the SEC assay separates based on the
hydrodynamic size of the molecule and show only one main peak due to the size similarity between
Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab. The charged regions of each molecule appear to overlap with each
other in the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture. Specifically, the Pertuzumab basic variants expected
to elute at approximately 32 minutes and at 35 minutes appear to overlap with the main peak of
Trastuzumab (Figures 17 and 18). Furthermore, the acidic variants of Trastuzumab expected to elute
before the Trastuzumab main peak co-elute with the Pertuzumab basic variants and main peak.
Despite the overlapping peak regions, the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture exhibited comparable
chromatographic peak profiles before and after storage in IV saline bags for 24 hours at 30'C.
            The Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, and Trastuzumab alone samples
were also assayed on CE-SDS LIF under non-reduced conditions after storage for 24 hours at 30'C.
The Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture showed consistent peak profiles with no observable changes
after storage compared to the starting material (Figures 19 and 20). A very slight baseline level
variation attributed to noise is also observed and does not impact peak area. Similar to SEC, the non
reduced Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture showed only one superimposed monomer constituting both
the Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab main species. The Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab alone samples
showed no changes at TO compared to T24. However, individual molecular attributes, e.g. fragment
                                                     87
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

peak level and species, between Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, and
Trastuzumab alone was observed as expected.
            Two major peaks known as the light chain (LC) and heavy chain (HC) are detected at 17 and
21.5 minutes, respectively, when Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, and
Trastuzumab alone was run on CE-SDS LIF reduced with DTT (Figure 20). No increase in
fragmentation or concomitant decrease in the LC and HC was seen post storage at 30 0 C for the
Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab mixture. Furthermore, no detectable peak profile differences were noticed
in the Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab alone samples post storage.
      The charge separation assays CZE and iCIEF show comparable peak profiles for the Pertuzumab/
Trastuzumab mixture after storage at 30 0C (Figures 21 and 22). The Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab
alone when compared to their respective TO also showed consistent peak profiles with no changes
after storage. Furthermore, the presence of various minor species was also observed, although no new
peaks were detected upon dilution in the IV bag saline solution. As seen in the charge based IEC
assay, two main peaks flanked by smaller overlapping peaks can be detected and was attributed to the
difference in the molecular pl.
       The potency results based on comparison of the dose response curve showed no impact on the
potency of the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture stored at 30 0 C for 24 hours compared to its
corresponding TO dose response curve (Figure 23). The Trastuzumab alone showed little activity in
the Pertuzumab potency assay. The Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture dose response curve compared
to the dose response curve of Pertuzumab or Trastuzumab alone showed that lower doses of the
Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture were needed to inhibit the growth of cells as compared to
Pertuzumab alone, suggesting there may be an additive or synergistic effect on the inhibition of cell
proliferation for the mixture.
Dose 11: 1560mg total Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture (840mg Pertuzumab and 720mg
Trastuzumab)
      In addition to the dose I study at 840mg total mAb, a higher dose of 1560mg mixture (840mg
Pertuzumab and 720mg Trastuzumab), and their individual drug product controls (840mg Pertuzumab
alone and 720mg Trastuzumab alone) was selected to investigate the impact of diluting these three
mAb types in PO or PVC IV infusion bags at 50C or 30 0 C for up to 24 hours. The product quality of
these IV infusion bags before and after storage was assessed by CAC, UV-spec scan (concentration
and turbidity), and HIAC- ROYCOTM are summarized in Table 13 and SEC and IEC are shown in
Figures 24-27.

      Two PO or PVC IV infusion bags each were prepared for the Pertuzumab/Trastuzumab mixture

hours. No visible particulate matter was observed and there was no significant change in the turbidity
post storage. For the Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, and Trastuzumab alone,
the HIAC-Royco showed comparable particle values before and after storage, with zero to 10
particles increase per milliliter at >10 [m and zero particle increase per milliliter at >25 [m for both
PO and PVC IV infusion bags stored at either 5'C or 30'C. Similarly, the Pertuzumab and
Trastuzumab alone samples also exhibited no significant particle differences before and after storage
in PO or PVC IV infusion bags. For all three sample types, the UV-spec scan showed no changes
beyond normal assay variability in protein concentration, indicating the absence of protein adsorption
or precipitation in the IV infusion bags between TO and T24 hours at 5'C or 30'C storage.
      The Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab mixture, Pertuzumab alone, and Trastuzumab alone samples were
analyzed using Pertuzumab or Trastuzumab specific SEC and IEC methods to assess their physical
and chemical stability, respectively, as previously described. For the Pertuzumab/ Trastuzumab
mixture, no changes in SEC were observed in the chromatographic profiles between the TO and the
T24 hour samples at 5'C or 3 0 'C in either PO or PVC IV infusion bags (Figures 24 and 25), similar
to the 840mg mixture dose I results. In addition, no increase or decrease in the high molecular weight
species (HMWS), main peak, and low molecular weight species (LMWS) was observed, which
indicates a stable dosing solution at the upper ranges of protein content in 0.9% saline. Likewise,
Pertuzumab alone and Trastuzumab alone samples also showed no changes after storage in the IV
infusion bags.
      IEC analysis, using both the Pertuzumab or Trastuzumab specific methods, of the Pertuzumab/
Trastuzumab mixture was used to assess chemical stability and showed comparable charge variant
peak profiles with no observed changes relative to the initial time point after exposure to 5'C or 3 0 'C
in the PO or PVC IV infusion bags (Figures 26 and 27). Although a significant overlap of the charge
variant species of the two mAbs were observed, these peaks species were not impacted from the
increase in the mAb content of the IV infusion bag. Pertuzumab alone or Trastuzumab alone samples
in PO or PVC IV infusion bags showed no changes before and after exposure to 5'C or 30 'C. These
results are consistent with the 840mg dose I study.
                                             CONCLUSION
      All physicochemical assays indicate no significant changes in the mixtures (up to 840mg
Pertuzumab and 720mg Trastuzumab for a 1560mg total dose) or in the individual Pertuzumab (up to
840mg) and Trastuzumab (up to 720mg) IV infusion bags (PO or PVC) for TO to T24 hours at 5'C or
30'C. Furthermore, the potency of the mixture (up to 840mg) and the individual mAbs before and
after storage were comparable. No differences were observed in the IV bags that contained the
admixture of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab when compared to the individual mAb components in IV

bags over the course of this study. The current study also demonstrates that many of the assays used
to measure the individual mAbs were sufficient to qualitatively characterize the admixture.

*     Pertuzumab given in combination with Trastuzumab and vinorelbine (Arm A)
*     Trastuzumab and vinorelbine (control arm Arm B)
Arm A will consist of two cohorts as follows:
            Cohort 1: (first 95 patients): Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab administered sequentially in
separate infusion bags, followed by vinorelbine. Patients will receive Pertuzumab followed by
Trastuzumab sequentially in separate infusion bags, followed by vinorelbine.
Pertuzumab (IV infusion)
             Administered on Day 1 of the first treatment cycle as a loading dose of 840 mg, followed by
420 mg on Day 1 of each subsequent 3 weekly cycle.
             Initial infusions of Pertuzumab will be administered over 90 (+ 10) minutes and patients
observed for at least 30 minutes from the end of infusion for infusion-related symptoms such as fever,
chills etc. Interruption or slowing of the infusion may reduce such symptoms. If the infusion is well
tolerated, subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 (± 10) minutes with patients observed
for a further 30 minutes.
Trastuzumab (IV infusion)
             Day 1 of the first treatment cycle as a loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg on Day
 1 of each subsequent 3 weekly cycle; to be administered in line with product labeling.
Vinorelbine (IV infusion after Trastuzumab)
             Day 1 and Day 8 of the first treatment cycle at a dose of 25 mg/m 2 followed by 30-35 mg/m2
on Day 1 and Day 8 of each subsequent 3 weekly cycle; to be administered in line with product
labeling.

             Cohort 2: The second 95 patients will receive Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab administered
together in a single infusion bag from Cycle 2 onwards, followed by vinorelbine.
Cycle 1 dosing
For the first cycle of treatment, Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab will be administered in separate
infusion bags as described for Cohort 1.
Vinorelbine will be administered after Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab as described for Cohort 1.
Subsequent cycle dosing
If administration of all three drugs was well tolerated in Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of each subsequent 3
weekly treatment cycle, Pertuzumab 420 mg and Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg will be given together in a

                                                   EXAMPLE 9
                         Pertuzumab for lmprovin2 Overall Survival (OS) in Cancer Patients
             Background: In the CLEOPATRA study in Example 3 above, 808 patients with HER2
positive first-line (IL) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were randomized to treatment with
Placebo+Trastuzumab+ Docetaxel (Pla+T+ D) or Pertuzumab+Trastuzumab+Docetaxel (P+T+D).
The primary endpoint of independently reviewed progression-free survival was significantly
improved with P+T+D vs Pla+T+D (hazard ratio (HR)=0.62; P<0.0001; medians, 18.5 vs 12.4 mths)
(Example 3 above). This example includes a second interim overall survival (OS) analysis after
longer follow-up.
             Methods: This interim overall survival (OS) analysis was performed applying the Lan
DeMets a-spending function with the O'Brien-Fleming (OBF) stopping boundary to maintain the
overall Type I error at 5%. Based on the number of OS events observed, the OBF boundary for
statistical significance at this analysis was P<0.0 138. The log-rank test, stratified by prior treatment
status and geographic region, was used to compare OS between arms in the intention-to-treat
population. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate the median OS in both arms; a stratified
Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate HR and 95% CIs. Subgroup analyses of OS were
performed for the stratification factors and other key baseline characteristics.
             Results: At the time of this analysis, median follow-up was 30 months and 267 deaths (69%
of planned events for the final analysis) had occurred. The results showed a statistically significant
improvement in OS in favor of P+T+D (HR=0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.84;
P=0.0008). This HR represents a 34% reduction in the risk of death. The analysis achieved statistical
significance and is therefore considered the confirmatory OS analysis. The median OS was 37.6 mths
in the Pla arm and has not yet been reached in the P arm. The treatment effect was generally
consistent in predefined subgroups based on baseline variables and stratification factors, including:
prior (neo)adjuvant therapy (HR=0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94); no prior (neo)adjuvant therapy (HR=0.66;
95% CI, 0.47-0.93); prior (neo)adjuvant T (HR=0.68; 95% CI, 0.30-1.55); hormone receptor-negative
disease (HR=0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.79); and hormone receptor-positive disease (HR=0.73; 95% CI,
0.50-1.06). Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS rates show survival benefit with P+T+D at 1, 2, and 3 yrs.

             The majority of pts received anti-cancer therapy after discontinuation of study treatment (64%
Pla arm, 56% P arm). Subsequent therapy with HER2-directed agents (T, lapatinib, T emtansine) was
balanced between arms. Causes of death remained unchanged from the first interim OS analysis, with
the most common cause being progressive disease. Adverse events leading to death were rare and
balanced between arms.
             Conclusions: Treatment of patients with HER2-positive IL MBC with P+T+D compared
with Pla+T+D was associated with an improvement in OS, which was both statistically significant
and clinically meaningful. These results show that combined HER2 blockade and chemotherapy using
the P+T+D regimen can be considered a standard of care for patients with HER2-positive MBC in the

  Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab with a Taxane as First-Line Therapy for Patients with HER2
                                   Positive Advanced Breast Cancer (PERUSE)
             Background: Pertuzumab (P), a humanized monoclonal antibody, inhibits signaling
downstream of HER2 by binding to the dimerization domain of the receptor and preventing
heterodimerization with other HER family members. The epitope recognized by P is distinct from that
bound by Trastuzumab (H) and so their complementary mechanisms of action result in a more
comprehensive HER2 blockade. Data from the phase III trial CLEOPATRA showed significantly
improved PFS in patients (pts) receiving P + H + docetaxel compared with H + docetaxel + placebo
as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (BC).
             Trial design: This is a phase IlIb, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in pts with
HER2-positive metastatic or locally recurrent BC who have not been treated with systemic
nonhormonal anticancer therapy for metastatic cancer. Pts will receive, P: 840 mg initial dose, 420
mg q3w IV; H: 8 mg/kg initial dose, 6 mg/kg q3w IV; taxane: docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel
according to local guidelines. Treatment will be administered until disease progression or
                                                        101
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

unacceptable toxicity. A planned protocol amendment will allow hormone receptor-positive pts to
receive endocrine therapy alongside P+H after completion of taxane therapy, in line with clinical
practice.
             Eligibility criteria: At baseline, pts must have an LVEF of >50%, an ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2,
a disease-free interval of >6 months, and must not have received prior anti-HER2 agents for the
treatment of metastatic BC. Prior H and/or lapatinib in the (neo)adjuvant setting is permitted,
providing there was no disease progression during treatment. Pts must not have experienced other
malignancies within the last 5 yrs other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma.
There must be no clinical or radiographic evidence of CNS metastases or clinically significant
cardiovascular disease.
             Specific aims: As H was not widely available in the (neo)adjuvant setting prior to
CLEOPATRA recruitment, a relatively low proportion of pts in CLEOPATRA had previously
received H. PERUSE will assess the safety and tolerability of P+H + choice of taxane as first-line
therapy for pts with HER2-positive metastatic or locally advanced BC in a pt population likely to
have experienced wider exposure to prior H therapy.
             Statistical methods: The primary endpoints of the PERUSE study are safety and tolerability.
Secondary endpoints include PFS, OS, ORR, CBR, duration of response, time to response and QoL.
The final analysis will be performed when 1500 pts have been followed up for at least 12 months after
the last pt receives last study treatment unless they have been lost to follow-up, withdrawn consent, or
died, or if the study is prematurely terminated by the sponsor. Safety analyses are planned after
enrollment of -350, 700, and 1000 pts. Additionally, a data and safety monitoring board will review
safety data after -50 pts have been enrolled and then every 6 months.
             It is anticipated that the Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab with a taxane will be effective as
first-line therapy for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer according to the protocol in
this example.

             Pertuzumab in Combination with Chemotherapy in Low HER3 Ovarian Cancer
             Epithelial ovarian cancer, along with primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinoma, is the
fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in Europe (Bray et al. Int. J. Cancer 113:977-90
(2005)). Ovarian cancer is often not diagnosed until it has progressed to an advanced stage, at which
point the standard treatment is surgical resection followed by chemotherapy. Although the addition of
taxanes to platinum-based chemotherapy has resulted in approximately 80% of patients achieving
complete response (CR), the disease recurs in most patients, and more than 50% of patients diagnosed
with epithelial ovarian cancer eventually die from their disease (Du Bois et al. Cancer 115:1234-1244
(2009)). Following failure of platinum-based chemotherapy, there are few therapeutic options.
                                                        102
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

Patients with platinum-sensitive disease (disease recurrence occurs more than 6 months after last
cycle of platinum-based chemotherapy) are often retreated with platinum-based therapy and have a
progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 9-10; however, for patients with primary platinum
resistant disease, the prognosis is considerably worse. For these patients, re-treatment with platinum
based therapy or surgery is not reasonable, instead, patients with platinum-resistant are often treated
with single-agent chemotherapy such as topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD),
paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
             Objective response rates for patients with platinum-resistant disease ranges between 10-20%
while median progression free survival (PFS) ranges between 3.5-4 months. Platinum-resistant
disease is not curable; the goals of treatment for these patients include palliation of symptoms,
prolonged survival and improvements in quality of life (QoL). Overall, results from major clinical
trials conducted over the last 20 years show that the median PFS for patients with advanced disease
ranges between 16-23 months while median overall survival (OS) ranges between 31-65 months.
             The majority of ovarian cancer cell lines and many ovarian cancer biopsy samples express all
members of the HER family of receptors (Campiglio et al. J. Cell Biochem 73:522-32 (1999)). EGFR
and HER2 have been studied the most extensively, and multiple agents targeting the receptor or
associated intracellular tyrosine kinases have been tested.
             In a recent study, quantitative HER2 protein analyses demonstrated that malignant ovarian
tumors have significantly higher levels of HER2 compared with benign ovarian tumors and normal
ovaries. Furthermore, a correlation between HER2 and HER3 protein levels has been seen (Steffensen
et al. Int J Oncol. 33:195-204 (2008)). Studies in cell culture systems have shown that heregulin
activated HER3-HER2 heterodimers elicit the strongest proliferative and transformation responses of
any possible receptor combination (Pinkas-Kramarski et al. EMBO J. 15:2452-67 (1996); Riese et al.
Mol Cell Biol 15:5770-6 (1995). Erratum in: Mol Cell Biol 16:735 (1996)). The potency of these
biologic responses is likely the result of the dual and efficient activation of the MAP kinase and P13
kinase pathways. Furthermore, HER3 is the most potent activator of the P13 kinase/AKT pathway
(Olayioye et al. EMBO J 19:3159-67 (2000)). Studies in HER2-amplified breast cancer cell lines
show that HER3 but not EGFR was critical for HER2 signaling, and that HER3 inhibited growth in
three-dimensional culture and induced rapid tumor regression of in vivo xenografts (Lee-Hoeflich et
al. CancerRes 68:5878-87 (2008)).
             Additionally, HER3 expression has been implicated as a possible risk factor in ovarian cancer
(Tanner et al. J Clin Oncol 24:4317-23 (2006)).
             In a Phase 11 multicenter trial (TOC2689g) in patients with advanced ovarian
cancer that recurred after treatment with or were refractory to platinum-based chemotherapy, patients
who were enrolled in Cohort 1 (n=6 1) received a loading dose of 840 mg Pertuzumab, followed by
                                                        103
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

420 mg Pertuzumab on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle, and patients in Cohort 2 (n=62) received 1050
mg Pertuzumab on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Similar outcomes were observed in both cohorts in
terms of overall response rate and median PFS. Eight patients (4 in each cohort) had evidence of
stable disease (SD) lasting at least 6 months. Median PFS and OS were 6.6 weeks and 52.7 weeks,
respectively, for the overall population.
             The results of this study led to two randomized Phase II trials in platinum-sensitive and
platinum-resistant populations. In Study TOC3258g, the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine +
Pertuzumab versus gemcitabine + placebo were evaluated in patients with advanced ovarian, primary
peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that was resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy (Amler et al. J
Clin Oncol 26:5552 (2008)). The study allowed patients to cross over to receive Pertuzumab at the
time of disease progression. There was a median PFS of 2.6 months in the gemcitabine + placebo arm
and 2.9 months in the gemcitabine + Pertuzumab arm. Median OS was similar between the treatment
arms. Of the most common adverse events (AEs), those increased (by at least 6 patients) in the
Pertuzumab-treated cohort included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, dyspepsia, stomatitis,
headache, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, rash, and Grade 3-4 neutropenia.
             In Study BO1793 1, 149 patients with ovarian cancer who experienced a recurrence 6 months
after a platinum-based therapy were randomized to receive a combination of paclitaxel and
carboplatin or gemcitabine with or without Pertuzumab. After 6 treatment cycles, chemotherapy was
discontinued, and patients in the chemotherapy + Pertuzumab arm continued to receive Pertuzumab
alone for up to 11 additional cycles (total of 17 cycles of Pertuzumab). There were no significant
differences in the PFS or OS for the overall group. Median PFS was 34.1 weeks for the chemotherapy
+ Pertuzumab group versus 31.3 for the chemotherapy alone group; however, an exploratory subset
analyses of HER3 mRNA expression with a treatment-free interval of 6-12 months indicated a trend
toward clinical benefit in patients who express high levels of HER3 mRNA (Kaye et al. J Clin Oncol
26:5520 (2008)).
             Archival tissue samples from patients enrolled in both randomized Phase II studies were
examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for mRNA
expression levels of the HER receptors EGFR, HER2, HER3, and two HER ligands: amphiregulin
and betacellulin.
             Only tumor HER3 mRNA expression was associated with a significant difference in PFS. For
patients who achieved a clinical response, PRs were observed in 9 patients on the gemcitabine +
Pertuzumab arm and 3 on the gemcitabine + placebo arm. Six of the gemcitabine + Pertuzumab
patients with PRs had tumor HER3 mRNA levels lower than the median level. In contrast, no patients
in the gemcitabine + placebo arm whose tumor HER3 mRNA levels were lower than the median level
of the study population experienced a PR. An additional 6 patients achieved PRs, and all of these
                                                       104
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

patients had tumor HER3 mRNA levels at or above the median level of the study population. Of these
patients, 3 received gemcitabine + Pertuzumab and 3 received gemcitabine + placebo, suggesting no
effect of Pertuzumab in this population.
             Patients with low HER3 mRNA expression (lower than the median level of the study
population) demonstrated a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.32 in contrast to 1.68 for patients with HER3
mRNA expression greater than or equal to the median level; i.e. the effect of adding Pertuzumab
trended in the opposite direction. No significant benefit was detected in OS for patients with low
HER3 mRNA expression; however, a trend toward greater OS was observed in patients receiving
Pertuzumab. The OS for patients expressing high HER3 mRNA expression demonstrated an HR of
 1.59.
             To assess the prognostic value, HER3 mRNA expression was correlated with PFS and OS for
patients in the gemcitabine + placebo arm. Median PFS was 1.4 months for patients with low HER3
mRNA expression (n = 35), comparedwith 5.5 months for patients with high HER3 mRNA
expression (n = 24). Similarly, median OS for patients with low HER3 mRNA expression was 8.4
months, compared with 18.2 months for patients with high HER3 mRNA expression.
             In Study BO 17931, in patients with low HER3 mRNA expression (lower than the median
level of this study population), no treatment effect was seen. However, in an exploratory analysis of
patients with a treatment-free interval of 6-12 months, there was a trend toward benefit for the
combination of chemotherapy with Pertuzumab in terms of PFS.
Overview of this Study
             This is a multicenter trial with two parts; a non-randomized safety run-in Part 1 and a
randomized, double-blind Part 2.
             Part 1 will be performed to assess safety and tolerability of Pertuzumab in a new
combination with two chemotherapeutic agents (topotecan or paclitaxel). Part 2 of the trial is a
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two-arm, multicenter, prospective trial of Pertuzumab
in combination with chemotherapy (topotecan, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine). Patients will receive trial
medication until disease progression as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) version 1.1, disease progression according to the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG)
criteria of CA-125 assessable disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. PFS
will be assessed in Part 1 of the trial, but due to small number of patients and PFS events per cohort,
results will be descriptive only. The trial design for Part 1 of the study is provided in Figure 30.
             In Part 2 of the trial, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either:
- Arm A: Pertuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (topotecan, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine), or
- Arm B: Pertuzumab-placebo plus chemotherapy (topotecan, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine).
                                                          105
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             The allocation of study medication will be double-blind with respect to whether the patient
receives Pertuzumab or Pertuzumab-placebo. The chemotherapy agent allocated will be at the
discretion of the investigator.
             Stratification factors for Part 2 of the trial will be:
      -      Selected chemotherapy cohort (topotecan vs. paclitaxel vs. gemcitabine).
      -      Previous anti-angiogenic therapy (yes vs. no). If a patient has previously participated in a
             blinded trial with an anti-angiogenic agent, the patient will be enrolled in the same stratum
             with patients known to have previously received an anti-angiogenic agent.
      -      Treatment-free interval (TFI) since platinum therapy (strictly less than 3 months vs. 3 to 6
             months inclusive, prior to first study treatment).
      The trial design for Part 2 of the study is provided in Figure 31.
Primary Objectives of the Study:
             Part 1: The primary objective for Part 1 of this study is to determine the safety and
tolerability of Pertuzumab in combination with either topotecan or paclitaxel.
             Part 2: The primary objective for Part 2 of this study is to determine if Pertuzumab plus
chemotherapy is superior to placebo plus chemotherapy as measured by PFS.
Secondary Objectives of the Study:
             Part 1: The secondary objective for Part 1 of this study is to evaluate descriptively the PFS of
Pertuzumab in combination with either topotecan or paclitaxel.
             Part 2: The secondary objectives for Part 2 of this study are to determine if
Pertuzumab plus chemotherapy is superior to placebo plus chemotherapy with respect to:
             -OS.
             - Objective response rate.
             - Biological progression-free interval (PFIBIO).
             - Safety and tolerability.
             - QoL.
Efficacy Outcome Measures
             The following efficacy outcome measures will be measured in Part 1 of the trial:
             -PFS, which is defined as the time from randomization into Part 1 of the trial, until disease
progression per RECIST version 1.1 or according to GCIG criteria in CA- 125 assessable disease or
death from any cause, whichever occurs first.
                                                           106
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

             The efficacy outcome measures for Part 2 of the trial are as follows:
             - PFS, which is defined as the time from randomization into Part 2 of the trial, until disease
progression per RECIST version 1.1 or according to GCIG criteria in CA- 125 assessable disease or
death from any cause, whichever occurs first.
             - OS, defined as the time from randomization into Part 2 of the trial until death from any
cause.
             - Objective response rate (ORR), which will be based on RECIST version 1.1 and assessed by
the best (confirmed) overall response (BOR); defined as the best response recorded from the start of
the treatment in Part 2 of the trial until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD, the
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started in Part 2 of the trial). Patients need to
have two consecutive assessments of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to be a
responder. PR or CR has to be confirmed by 2 consecutive tumor evaluations spaced at least 4 weeks
apart. Only patients with measurable disease at baseline will be included in the analysis of objective
response.
             - Patients who have a response as per RECIST version 1.1 and using the 50% response
criteria for CA-125 are defined as responders, whereas patients who only have response as defined per
RECIST are defined as RECIST responders. Patients who do not have a response as per RECIST, but
have a response defined using the 50% response criteria for CA-125 are defined as CA-125
responders.
             - PFIBIo, defined on the basis of a progressive serial elevation of serum CA- 125 (assessed
according to the CGIG criteria) as the time from the date of randomization into Part 2 of the trial to
first documented increase in CA-125 levels to: two times the upper limit of normal (for patients with
normal pretreatment CA- 125 or elevated pretreatment CA- 125 and initial normalization on
treatment), or two times the nadir value (for patients with elevated baseline CA-125 that did not
normalize on-treatment).
Safety Outcome Measures
             In Part 1 of the study safety and tolerability will be assessed after all patients have received 3
cycles of treatment.
             In addition, safety outcome measures for this study will be assessed in both Parts 1 and 2 of
the study, and are as follows:
             - Incidence, nature, and severity of all AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs with NCI
CTCAE version 4.0 Grades >3, and AEs that caused premature withdrawal from study medication.
             - Premature withdrawal from the study and study treatment.

Pertuzumab Dosage and Administration
             Pertuzumab and Pertuzumab-placebo will be administered as an intravenous infusion on Day
1 of the first treatment cycle as a loading dose of 840, followed by 420 mg on Day 1 of each
subsequent 3-weekly cycle. The initial infusion of Pertuzumab/Pertuzumab-placebo will be
administered over 60 minutes followed by a 60-minute observational period in a seated position if the
infusion is well tolerated, subsequent infusions may be given over 30 minutes, followed by a 30
minute observational period, after which the chemotherapy agent will be administered. Pre
medication should be implemented according to local practices and the chosen chemotherapy.

10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

Topotecan Dosage and Administration
             Topotecan should be administered 1.25 mg/m2 as a 30-minute intravenous infusion daily on
Days 1-5 every 3 weeks, as per the directions in the summary of product characteristics.
Paclitaxel Dosage and Administration
             Paclitaxel should be administered 80 mg/m2 as a 1-hour i.v. infusion on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22.
Pharmacists should follow the summary of product characteristics for information regarding the
preparation and administration of the 80 mg/m2 dose.
Gemcitabine Dosage and Administration
             Gemcitabine (Part 2 of the study only) should be administered 1000 mg/m2 as a 30-minute
intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks as per the directions described in the summary of
product characteristics.
HER3 mRNA Expression
             Patients will be asked to specifically consent to the collection and testing of primary tumor
tissue samples to assess HER3 mRNA level, including mRNA and protein levels of other HER family
receptors e.g. HER2, before they provide consent to participate in the trial. Only patients who have
tumors expressing low levels of HER3 mRNA will be eligible to participate in the trial.
             During the initial screening for HER3 mRNA levels, other receptors of the
HER family (e.g. EGFR, HER2, or HER4) will be assessed at the mRNA level and/or protein level in
parallel to the HER3 assessment, in order to obtain a more complete picture of the status of HER
family receptors by mRNA level.
             The cut-off defined for study eligibility is defined as a concentration ratio of <2.81 as
assessed by qRT-PCR on a COBAS z480@ instrument using the "COBAS@ HER2 & HER3 (qRT
PCR) mRNA expression assay" provided by Roche Molecular Diagnostics. The rationale for cut off
definition is based on a cut off modeling in previous studies as well as on a transformation function
that had to be introduced since the assay was switched to a new instrument; the COBAS z480@. It is
anticipated that 40-50% of screened patients will have HER3 mRNA levels below the cutoff of 2.81
and that 30% of patients expressing low levels of HER3 mRNA will be ineligible for enrollment
owing to other inclusion/exclusion criteria.
             Submission of a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimen of the primary tumor
from the original surgery will be required for all patients prior to screening; cytology specimens are
not acceptable replacements. Patients will be assessed for HER3 mRNA expression level, as well as
mRNA expression and protein expression levels of other HER family receptors by the use of a qRT
                                                         109
10341685_1 (GHMatters) P96260.AU.2

PCR assay and IHC. Such assessment of HER receptor mRNA/protein expression will occur after
obtaining the patient's informed consent at any time after the primary surgery and prior to screening.
             It is anticipated that Pertuzumab in combination with topotecan or paclitaxel will be safe and
effective in patients with epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
             In addition, it is anticipated that Pertuzumab plus chemotherapy (topotecan, paclitaxel, or
gemcitabine) will be superior to placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with epithelial ovarian,
