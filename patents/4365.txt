CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     The present application is a divisional application from Australian
Patent Application No. 2015243112, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated
herein by reference. This application also claims priority from United States
Provisional Application Number 62/065,996, filed on October 20, 2014, the
entirety of which is hereby fully incorporated by reference herein.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]     The cervical cerclage procedure is often indicated for expecting female
patients that have an incompetent cervix, or a cervix that is incapable of
remaining closed during pregnancy, prior to the onset of labor. The cerclage
procedure most often involves the physician vaginally suturing the patient's
cervical tissue closed, or to the neighboring portions of the cervical tissue to
prevent fluid or other communication through the cervix and into or out of the
uterus prior to the onset of labor. There are several common types of vaginal
cerclage stitches, such as the McDonald stitch and the Shirdokar stitch. While
these types of cerclage stitches are well known in the art, they are often difficult
to perform due to the number of instruments needed to both prepare and
compress the cervical tissue to close the cervix prior to the cervical stitching, as
well the needles needed to perform the cerclage stitch itself. The patient's vagina
includes a relatively small space for all of these tools and therefore the cerclage
procedure is overly complicated and time consuming.
[0003]     A reference herein to a patent document or any other matter identified
as prior art, is not to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter
was known or that the information it contains was part of the common general
knowledge as at the priority date of any of the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS AND THE PRESENTLY
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0035]     Turning now to FIGs. 1-17, a cerclage assistance device 10 is provided.
The device 10 includes a catheter 20 that extends from a proximal end portion 24
to a distal end portion 22. An inflatable balloon 30, similar to a Foley balloon, is
provided at the distal end portion 22. A first lumen 27 is disposed along the
length of the catheter 20 to allow for selective inflation of the balloon 30 from the
proximal end portion 24 of the catheter 20. The proximal end portion 24 of the
catheter may receive a syringe through a luer lock fitting 38 or similar structure
that is disposed in fluid communication with the first lumen 27 to allow for
selective inflation and deflation of the balloon 30. The catheter 20 may
additionally include a second lumen 21 along its length between the proximal and
distal end portions 24, 22 to allow a stylet 40 to slidingly pass therethrough. The
distal end portion 22 of the catheter 20 includes a hollow portion 21 a that
communicates with the second lumen 21.
                                           -4-

[0036]     The catheter 20 is releasably engaged with a grasper 60 at the distal
end portion 22 of the catheter 20. The grasper 60 may include a proximal portion
62 from which a finger 63 extends. The finger 63 selectively mates with a
corresponding finger 43 of the stylet 40, discussed in detail below, to connect the
grasper 60 to the stylet 40 and ultimately to the catheter 20.
[0037]     The grasper 60 may include an arcuate member 61 that is fixed to the
proximal portion 62, and the arcuate member 61 may include first and second
legs (or arms) 61a , 61 b that extend from the proximal portion 62 to establish a
generally U shaped profile, while in other embodiments, the legs may extend to
establish a V shaped profile, or in still other embodiments, the legs may extend at
generally right angles from the proximal portion 62 to establish an open rectangle
profile.
[0038]     Generally, the legs 61 a, 61 b are constructed with a shape and size
such that the legs are adapted to wrap around a significant portion of a female
patient's (either human or mammal) cervical tissue when the device 10 is
positioned such that the grasper 60 is disposed within or abutting the posterior
fornix 1104 of the patient's cervix (shown in FIG. 13). In some embodiments, the
first and second legs 61 a, 61 b are constructed to wrap around a significant
portion of a patient's cervical tissue when the balloon 30 is inflated, which
compresses the cervical tissue together due to the size of the inflated balloon,
within the limited space available within the patient's vagina 1106.
[0039]      In some embodiments, the inner surface of the first and second legs
61 a, 61 b (i.e. the surface that engages the cervical tissue when positioned within
the patient) include a plurality of ridges 65 that extend inwardly from the legs,
which are each configured to engage the cervical tissue, and locally compress
the tissue engaging the ridges 65 to assist with maintaining the position of the
grasper 60 with respect to the cervical tissue before the physician has locked the
grasper 60 in place, as discussed above. The plurality of ridges 65 may be
disposed at consistent spaces along the length of each of the first and second
legs 61 a, 61 b (such as at every half centimeter or another clinically effective
spacing). In other embodiments, the plurality of ridges 65 may only be positioned
on one of the two legs 61 a, 61 b.
                                           -5-

[0040]     In some embodiments, an end of the arcuate member 61, and in some
embodiments, an end portion of the second leg 61 b may support a flexible
member 80 that extends therefrom. A proximal end portion 84 of the flexible
member 80 is retained by the grasper 60 (and specifically the proximal end
portion of the second leg 61 b) and the flexible member 80 includes an opposite
distal end portion 82 that extends to a tip 83. The flexible member 80 may be an
elongate string, cord, rope, tape (such as mersliene band), or thread. The
flexible member 80 may be made of any flexible material that is safe for medical
use for a long term engagement with cervical tissue and disposition within a
patient's vagina. Some materials that may be used are silicone, urethanes, or
relatively soft thermoplastics, mersilene, cotton, suture material, or various known
flexible materials.
[0041]     In some embodiments, the flexible member 80 may be a discrete
component from the grasper 60 with a proximal end portion 84 that is fixed to the
grasper 60, while in other embodiments, a portion of the flexible member 80 may
extend through at least a portion of the grasper 60 (such as within a cavity
formed by one or both of the first and second legs 61 a, 61 b) and be fixed to the
grasper 60. In some embodiments, the ridges 65, upon the grasper 60
(discussed above) may be provided by the plurality of retaining elements 90
disposed along the flexible member 80 (discussed below) along the portion of the
grasper 60 that engages the patient's cervical tissue.
[0042]     In some embodiments, the flexible member 80 may be cylindrical, while
in other embodiments, the flexible member may be a tape or a geometry with a
generally oval or rectangular orientation. In embodiments where the flexible
member is not cylindrical, the flexible member 80 may be configured such that
the relatively wider portion contacts the cervical tissue to increase the surface
area of engagement between the flexible member 80 and the cervical tissue.
[0043]     The flexible member 80 may include a plurality of retention members 90
disposed along the length thereof, starting with a proximal end portion 84, that
extends from the second leg 61 b of the grasper 60, and disposed along the
length of the flexible member 80 to a distal end portion 82 toward its tip 83. In
some embodiments, the tip 83 may be formed as a retention member 90, while in
                                         -6-

other embodiments, the first retention member 90 may be disposed proximally of
the tip 83 to allow the tip 83 to be easily threaded through the receiving aperture
68a of the receiving structure 68, discussed below.
[0044]     The retentions members 90 are best shown in FIGs. 6 and 7. In some
embodiments, each retention member 90 may be formed with the same size and
geometry, and may be evenly spaced along the length of the flexible member 80.
In other embodiments, the retention members 90 may be formed with different
geometries along the length of the flexible member 80, such as, for example, with
slightly increasing geometric profiles (such as increasing diameters) along the
length of the flexible member 80 from the distal end portion 82 toward the
proximal end portion 84. Increasing sized retention members 90 may be desired
toward the proximal end portion 84 because the compression of the patient's
cervix increases as the flexible member 80 is further pulled through the receiving
structure 68 located on an end portion of the first leg 61 a of the grasper, and the
cervical tissue when compressed places greater tension upon the flexible
member 80, therefore necessitating a stronger (i.e. more surface area)
connection between the locking portion 94 of the retention member 90 and the
receiving structure 68 (preventing the flexible member 80 from being drawn
proximally through the receiving structure 68 and therefore maintaining the
cervical tissue bunched together as clinically desired).
[0045]     As shown in FIGs. 6a and 7, each retention member 90 may include a
tapered face 92 that faces toward the distal tip 83 of the flexible member 80
(when the flexible member 80 is generally straight) and an opposite locking
surface 94 (that faces toward the proximal end portion 84 when the flexible
member 80 is generally straight) that forms a perpendicular face, or a receding
geometry (discussed below). The tapered face 92 is configured to gradually
increase the diameter of the retention member 90 along its length. In some
embodiments, the tapered face 92 may be geometrically conical, or in other
embodiments generally conical (as shown in FIG. 6A, i.e. with an arcuate cross
sectional curve but with a radius that increases along the length of the tapered
face 92).    In some embodiments, the tapered face 92 may form an obtuse angle
a with the longitudinal axis L of the flexible member 80 (when in a straight
                                          -7-

configuration) that forms an angle within the range of about 135 to about 160
degrees, inclusive of the angles within this range, such as e.g. 140, 145, 150,
155, 160 degrees. In embodiments where the tapered face 92 is generally
conical, portions of the tapered face 92 may form different angles within this
range.
[0046]      The locking surface 94 may be a surface that is perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the flexible member 80 (when in a straight configuration). In
other embodiments, as shown in FIG. 6b, the locking surface 94 may form an
acute angle A with respect to the longitudinal axis.
[0047]      As mentioned above, the grasper 60 may include an arcuate member
61 that may include a first leg 61 a and a corresponding second leg 61 b, with the
proximal portion 62 therebetween at a connecting portion. The first leg 61a may
support a receiving structure 68 at an end portion 66 thereof. The receiving
structure 68 may be configured to ratchetingly receive the flexible member 80
therewith. In an exemplary embodiment, the receiving structure may initially
receive the distal tip 83 of the flexible member 80 and then ratchetingly allow
additional portions of the flexible member 80 to be further pulled through in a first
direction Z (FIG. 7). The receiving structure 68 may be configured to resist the
flexible member 80 from being pulled in the second opposite direction Y, due to
engagement with the locking surface 94 of the retention member 90 engaging the
receiving structure 68.
[0048]      As best shown in FIGs. 7a-7c, the receiving structure 68 may include
an aperture 68a and a deformable portion 69, which may be disposed in registry
with the aperture 68a. The deformable portion may be two or more arms 69a that
are fixed to the distal end portion of the first leg 61a in a cantilevered fashion, and
may be disposed at an angle with respect to the axis 1001 of the hole. As
depicted in FIG. 7b, the arms 69a may be deflected or rotated radially outward in
the direction X (i.e. toward a more linear orientation with respect to the outer
surface of the leg 61 a) to increase the size of the aperture 68a at the outer exit
of the first leg 61 a when the arms 69a are engaged by the tapered face 92 of a
retention member 90, and with further linear movement of the flexible member
and the retention member 90 in the direction Z, the arms 69a are urged further
                                           -8-

radially outward until the retention member 90 has a clear path to be pulled from
the receiving structure 68.
[0049]      As shown in FIG. 7c, the arms 69a may return to their normal position
after the retaining portion 90 extends past the tips of the arms 69a. The tips of
the arms 69a may be disposed to form an aperture 69aa that is smaller than the
size of the locking surface 94. The arms 69a are configured such that if the
retention member 90 engages the arms 69a in the direction Y, the arms 69a do
not expand to allow the retaining portion 90 to extend therethrough. The arms
69a may be either rigid in compression such that the arms generally retain their
orientation pre-impact, or in embodiments, the arms 69a may flex or buckle in
such a manner to reduce the size of the aperture 69aa formed therebetween,
thereby preventing the retaining portion 90 from extending therepast in the
direction Y.
[0050]      In other embodiments, the deformable portion 69 may be a flexible
hollow conical member 69z (FIGs. 3a, 3b, 9), which extends outward from the
first leg 61 a in registry with the aperture 68a, and includes an outer aperture 69c
that is smaller than the diameter of the aperture 68a. In some embodiments the
outer aperture 69c may be just larger than the size of the flexible member 80 and
formed with a similar shape as the flexible member 80, but with a diameter/size
that is smaller than the diameter/size of the locking surface 94 of the retention
member 90. This type of deformable portion 69 may be formed from a
stretchable yet resilient material that may expand outwardly to allow the retention
member 90 to extend therethrough in direction Z (and specifically as stretched by
the gradually increasing size of the tapered face 92), but not be urged to expand
when the locking surface 94 approaches the deformable portion 69 in the
direction Y.
[0051]      As depicted in FIG. 17, an alternate flexible member 180 may extend
from the grasper 60, and specifically from the second leg 61 b of the grasper. The
flexible member 180 may include a plurality of retention members 190 disposed
therealong, such as at equal spacing along the length of the flexible member 180
or at varied spacing along the length of the flexible member 180. The flexible
member 180 may include a rectangular or oval cross-section with the larger
                                            -9-

dimensioned side normally forming an engaging surface that is configured to
contact and close the cervical tissue disposed in conjunction with the grasper 60.
The opposite side of the flexible member 180 (i.e. the other side with the larger
dimension) supports the plurality of retention members 190. Similar to the
retention members 90 discussed above, each of the retention members 190 may
extend outward from the flexible member 180 and may include a tapered face
192 that faces toward the distal tip 183 of the flexible member 180 (when the
flexible member 180 is generally straight) and an opposite locking surface 194
(that faces toward the proximal end portion 184 when the flexible member 180 is
generally straight) that forms a perpendicular face, or a receding geometry
(discussed below).
[0052]     As shown in FIG. 17, the retention members 190 may have a general
triangular cross-section, or may be modified from a geometric triangular cross
section in embodiments where the tapered face 192 is arcuate (but with a
generally increasing height along its length) and be formed with a profile that
includes surfaces at the angle a (as depicted in FIG. 6a with respect to the
retention member 90) and/or where the locking surface 194 is formed with an
orientation with an acute angle similar to the acute angle A shown in FIG. 6A with
respect to the retention member 90. The tapered face 192 is configured to
gradually increase the height of the retention member 90 along its length.
[0053]     The locking surface 194 may be a surface that is perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the flexible member 180 (when in a straight configuration). In
other embodiments, the locking surface 194 may form an acute angle A with
respect to the longitudinal axis (similar to the angle formed by the locking surface
94 depicted in FIG. 6A).
[0054]      In embodiments where the retention member 190 and flexible member
180 are provided, the grasper 60 may have a receiving portion 68 that
corresponds to slidingly and ratchetingly receive the distal tip 183 and then with
further sliding of the flexible member 180 in the direction Z, the one and more of
the plurality of retention members 190 are slidingly and ratchetingly received
through the receiving portion 68 in the direction Z, but prevents motion of the
flexible member 180 in the direction Y. The receiving portion 68 may be
                                         -10-

constructed with arms (similar to the arms 69a), a cone (FIG. 3b, 68z), or other
structures to slidingly and ratchetingly receive the retention members 190, and
one of ordinary skill in the art will comprehend suitable designs for the receiving
portion 68 to work with the retention members 190 with a thorough review of this
specification.
[0055]     As discussed above, the catheter 20 may include a stylet 40 slidably
disposed within a lumen 21. The stylet 40 extends to a distal end portion 42 that
includes a finger 43 to a proximal end portion that includes an operator 44, which
extends outside of the proximal end portion 24 of the catheter 20. The stylet 40
is slidable within the catheter 20 between a retracted position (FIG. 2) where the
finger 43 is disposed within the lumen 21 and does not extend distally out of the
catheter 20, and an extended position (FIG. 3) where the finger 43 extends
distally out of the lumen 21. The operator 44 may be directly mounted to the
stylet 40 such that movement of the operator 44 causes sliding motion of the
stylet 40 (and therefore the finger 43) in the same direction.
[0056]     As best shown in FIGs. 8 and 9, the finger 43 of the stylet 40 is
configured to matingly receive a corresponding finger 63 that extends from a
proximal portion 62 of the grasper 60. The fingers 43 and 63 may be sized and
shaped to engage each other and to prevent linear motion of the grasper linearly
away from the stylet 40. In some embodiments, each finger 43, 63 includes a
ledge 43a, 63a, respectively, and an inclined portion 43b, 63b, respectively, that
extends from the ledge. The inclined portions of each finger 43, 63 may be
formed from the same (or very similar) angle such that the two inclined portions
mate together. In some embodiments, the inclined portions 43b, 63b may each
form an acute angle with respect to the length of the respective finger, while in
other embodiments, the inclined portions 43b, 63b may each be formed with a
substantially perpendicular surface to the length of the finger. Each finger also
may include a void 43d, 63d that is the size and shape of the ledge of the
opposite finger such that the combined fingers form a compact configuration,
which in some embodiments may be a cylindrical configuration with a diameter
just smaller than the hollow portion 21 a of the lumen 21 at the distal end portion
22 of the catheter 20, which provides space for the mated fingers 43, 63 to be slid
                                         - 11 -

into the hollow portion 21 a, such as by withdrawing the operator 44 of the stylet
40 proximally from the proximal end portion 24 of the catheter 20. As can be
understood, when the engaged fingers 43, 63 are disposed within the hollow
portion 21 a, the grasper 60 is fixed to the catheter 20. When the engaged fingers
43, 63 are slid distally out of the hollow portion 21 a, the engaged fingers 43, 63
can be disengaged by relative lateral motion of one finger with respect to the
other finger.
[0057]     A balloon 30 may be disposed upon the distal end portion 22 of the
catheter 20 and may be selectively inflated and deflated by the operator, such as
a through a luer lock or similar fitting 38, which is fluidly connected with the
balloon through a lumen 27. The balloon 30 may be a conforming or non
confirming balloon.
[0058]     In some embodiments shown schematically in FIGs. 16a-1 6d, a first
portion 31 of the balloon 30 may extend for a first portion of the circumference of
the catheter, such as an arc length y, and is configured to inflate away from the
nominal diameter of the catheter 20 at a distance greater than the a second
portion 32 of the balloon 30 is configured to inflate (FIGs. 16c, 16d), or in other
embodiments, the balloon 30 may only extend along the arc length y of the
circumference of the catheter 20 (FIGs. 16a, 16b). The balloon 30 may be
provided with a more stretchable or resilient material around the first portion 31,
than the stretchability or resilience of the material in the opposite second portion
32 (when provided). This difference in stretchability or resilience may be due to a
thicker material forming the second portion of the balloon 32 than the first portion
31, or differing materials, with different stretchabilities or resilience characteristics
forming the different portions of the balloon 30, or with other structures. In other
embodiments, the first and second portions 31, 32 may be different balloons and
may be inflated separately (which may be through different lumens).
[0059]     In some embodiments the first portion 31 of the balloon 30 (or the entire
balloon 30 when defined around less than the entire circumference of the
catheter 30) may extend for a range of about 90 degrees (or %) of the total
circumference of the catheter 20. Alternatively other ranges may be appropriate,
such as 45 degrees of circumference, 135 degrees, 180 degrees, or any clinically
                                          -12-

suitable range (such a range to allow the balloon 30 to compress the cervical
tissue prior to compressing with the flexible member 80, and to minimize the
movement of the catheter within the vagina that might occur if the balloon also
inflates to the same extent (or at all) in directions away from the cervical tissue),
such as e.g. 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 150 degrees, 160 degrees, and 180
degrees, including all specific circumferences within this range. In other
embodiments, a balloon 30 that is inflatable to generally the same radial distance
around the entire circumference of the balloon may be provided.
[0060]     Turning now to FIGs. 13-15, the device 10 is depicted within a patient's
vagina 1106 with the proximal portion 62 of the grasper 60 proximate to or within
the posterior fornix 1104 of a patient's cervix 1102. In FIG. 13, the grasper 60 is
properly positioned, and the first leg 61 a is around the patient's cervix 1102, and
the second leg 61 b (not visible with the view of FIG. 13) is wrapped around the
opposite side of the patient's cervix 1102. As shown in FIG. 14, the balloon 30
may be inflated which compresses the cervical tissue 1102 together to prevent
any communication from the vagina 1106 to the uterus 1100.
[0061]     With the balloon 30 (as discussed above) inflated, the distal tip 83 of
the flexible member 80 is threaded through the aperture 69 upon the receiving
structure 68 in the distal end portion of the first leg 61 b and the flexible member
80 is pulled through the aperture 68a until the cervical tissue therebetween is
suitably compressed. When the flexible member 80 is sufficiently pulled through
the aperture 68a to establish the correct compression of the cervical tissue, the
flexible member 80 may be released, and the position of the flexible member 80
is maintained due to the interaction between the receiving structure, and
specifically the arms 69a, or similar structure, and the locking portion 94, which
prevents the retaining portion 90 next to the receiving structure 68 from extending
through the arms 69a and into the aperture 68a in the direction Y.
[0062]      Upon properly tightening the flexible member 80, the balloon 30 may be
deflated. Next, the grasper 60 may be released from the catheter 20. While
holding the catheter 20 still, the operator 44 of the stylet 40 may be urged distally,
which pushes both the finger 43 upon the distal end portion 42 of the stylet 40, as
well as the grasper 60 (based upon the engagement of the finger 63 extending
                                          -13-

from the proximal portion 62 of the grasper 60) distally out of the hollow portion
21 a of the catheter 20 and distally away from the catheter 20. Upon sliding
motion out of the hollow portion 21 a, the engaged fingers 43, 63 may be
disengaged by laterally sliding one of the finger away from the other finger. Once
the fingers are laterally slid apart, the stylet 40 is released from the grasper 60,
and the catheter 20 (including the stylet 40) may be removed from the patient,
with the grasper 60 remaining within the patient, as shown in FIG. 15.
[0063]     With the catheter 20 removed from the patient, the physician may
complete the cervical stitch procedure as clinically indicated, and as
schematically depicted in FIG. 15 as element 700. After the cervical stitch
procedure, or at another clinically appropriate time under the determination of the
physician, the grasper 60 may be removed from the patient after the flexible
member 80 is cut, thereby releasing the compression within the cervical tissue.
