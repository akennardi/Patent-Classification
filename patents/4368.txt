ABSTRACT - Radio to wearable device based warning system
Step Three Pty Ltd
The disclosed wearable device based warning system uses emergency or
alert      data     to     warn local           users       of potential          threats      in   their
immediate area, including but not limited to bush fires, wild fires,
tsunamis, mass shootings, avalanches and earthquakes.                                       To complete
this we have three key elements comprising the invention as a whole:
Al. A cloud based data service                         that   tracks      emergency or alert          data
and then filters the feed by location. When an emergency or alert is
detected it signals the relevant radio base station at that specific
location.
A2.   A radio        base station            or network of radio              base stations         which
will exist at each location where a threat is present. These consist
of internet          connectivity,             a simple operating              system and a radio
transmitter.           Once these have received an alert from the cloud based
data     service        they       broadcast          over radio         to  the      local    area     the
existence of an emergency or alert in the area.
A3. A wristband or personal device consisting but not limited to
an alert        system and radio             receiver.        The radio      receiver       only reacts
to the pre-programmed signal from the radio base station. Once this
signal is retrieved it triggers an alert made up but not limited to
- audio, visual and vibration signals. This informs the user that an
emergency or alert is in their immediate vicinity.

Description - Radio to wearable device based warning system
Step Three Pty Ltd
In the situation of heightened threats it is currently difficult to
have an effective                warning system over a wide local                        area.     This
wearable device based warning system uses emergency or alert data to
warn local users of potential threats in their local area, including
but not limited to bush fires, wild fires, tsunamis, mass shootings,
avalanches and earthquakes.                           This invention       notifies        users    the
instant an emergency or alert is in their immediate vicinity. Once a
warning is retrieved via radio to the wristband it triggers an alert
made up but not limited to - audio, visual and vibration signals.
To complete this we have three key elements comprising the invention
as a whole:
Al. A cloud based data service                        that tracks     emergency or alert           data
and then filters the feed by location. When an emergency or alert is
detected it signals the relevant radio base station at that specific
location.
A2.  A radio        base station            or network of radio           base stations           which
will exist at each location where a threat is present. These consist
of internet         connectivity,             a simple operating           system and a radio
transmitter.          Once these have received an alert from the cloud based
data     service       they       broadcast          over radio      to  the       local     area   the
existence of an emergency in the area.
A3. A wristband or personal device consisting but not limited to
an alert        system and radio            receiver.      The radio     receiver        only reacts
to the pre-programmed signal from the radio base station. Once this
signal is retrieved it triggers an alert made up but not limited to
- audio, visual and vibration signals. This informs the user that an
emergency or alert is in their immediate vicinity.

Claims - Radio to wearable device based warning system
Step Three Pty Ltd
The claims defining the invention are as follows:
1. A cloud based data service          that     tracks   emergency or alert    data
and then filters the feed by location. When an emergency or alert is
detected it signals the relevant radio base station at that specific
location.
2.  A radio    base station      or network of radio         base stations     that
communicates to all nearby wristbands or other device as claimed in
claim 3 that an emergency is in the vicinity. This consists of but
is not limited    to  internet    connectivity,        a simple operating system
and a radio transmitter.
3. A wristband or other        personal device comprising but not limited
to a radio receiver and an alert system - comprising but not limited
to a audio, visual and vibration signal. This informs the user that
an emergency or alert is in their immediate vicinity.
4.  The communication system as a whole across                  those   claimed in
claims 1, 2 and 3 that allows users to be alerted that an emergency
is in their vicinity with a communication to the end user via radio.
