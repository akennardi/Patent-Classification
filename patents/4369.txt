   ABSTRACT
   An apparatus (100) for cultivating plants such as tuberous root vegetables
   comprises a tower (1) with a number of compartments (2a - 2d) arranged around
   a shaft (3). Each compartment houses a number of trays (4) stacked vertically in
 5 a nested arrangement. The trays are stacked at an inclined orientation and each
   tray a number of chambers for cultivating plant cuttings therein.      Each tray
   comprises first and second tray portions (9, 10) which arranged in an opposed
   relationship to define the chambers.        The plant cuttings are placed in the
   chambers and, as the plants grow, the two tray portions move apart to
10 accommodate the growing plant.       Once the plants are fully grown, they are
   harvested by lowering the trays out of the tower and removing the plants from the
   chambers.     This is particularly suited to soilless cultivation, and has the
   advantage of enabling the plants to be grown with an increased yield per unit
   area compared to conventional methods of plant cultivation.

                             PLANTS USING THE APPARATUS
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to an apparatus for the cultivation of plants,
 5 particularly in a soilless environment, and more particularly the growing of tuberous
   plants such as sweet potatoes. The present invention also relates to a method of
   cultivating plants using the apparatus of the present invention.
   BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
   Sweet potato is a plant with tuberous roots and trailing stems or vines. The tubers
10 have high food value and are a popular vegetable to eat.
   Conventionally, sweet potatoes are grown from cuttings cultivated in soils. A plant
   cutting is a piece of a plant that is used in horticulture for vegetative (asexual)
   propagation. In cultivating sweet potatoes, the tuberous root of the sweet potato
   is used and is placed in a suitable medium. The medium may be a soil that is
15 loamy and well drained with a pH of between 5.8 and 7.0.
   It is also known to grow sweet potatoes in soilless environments i.e. hydroponically
   or aeroponically.
   The present invention seeks to improve on the current approaches to increasing
   crop yields or at the very least seeks to provide an alternative thereto.

   Description of the Preferred Embodiments
15 The apparatus 100 of the present invention is provided to grow plants such as
   sweet potatoes and the embodiment described herein will be described in
   relation to the cultivating of sweet potatoes, although the apparatus could be
   used to cultivate other plants. The apparatus is preferably used for soilless
   cultivation, although soil could also be used. Sweet potatoes are grown from
20 cuttings comprising the tuberous roots of the plant which will hereinafter be
   referred to as a "tuber".
   The apparatus 100 comprises a support structure in the form of a tower 1. The
   tower 1 comprises a number of compartments 2a - 2d arranged around a central
   support member in the form of a shaft 3. Each compartment 2a - 2d houses a
25 number of trays 4 stacked vertically in a nested arrangement.
   In the embodiment described herein, the shaft 3 has a square cross-section with
   four faces 7a - 7d.

                                             10
   Mounted on each face 7a - 7d, and running lengthways along the shaft 3, are L
   shaped wall portions 5a - 5d, each extending laterally of the shaft 3. The L-shaped
   wall portions 5a - 5d define the compartments 2a - 2d. The free edge of each wall
   portion 5a - 5d has a lip 6a - 6d extending along its length to assist in retaining the
 5 trays 4 in place within the compartments 2a - 2d as will be described in further
   detail below.
   The compartments 2a - 2d are thus arranged at right angles to each other around
   the shaft 3.
   A water draining system in the form of a gutter 8 extends around the lower section
10 of wall portions 5a - 5d and is connected to a down pipe 25 which directs water to
   a central water collection point (not shown). To assist in directing water into the
   water draining system, the gutter 8 can be angled into the down pipe 25. The water
   draining system collects water run-off from the plant irrigation process and also
   collects rainwater.   Figure 3 illustrates this schematically. For clarity, Figure 3
15 shows only a part of the water draining system, which would extend all the way
   around the bottom of the tower 1.
   The shaft 3 can be hollow or solid. The shaft 3 is secured into the ground by any
   suitable means.
   In alternative embodiment, the central support member may comprise a circular
20 post (not shown) running internally of the shaft 3 so that the shaft 3 can rotate
   around the circular post. In this embodiment, the shaft 3 is in the form of a sleeve
   that can freely rotate around the circular post, with the post being secured into the
   ground instead of the shaft 3.
   The compartments 2a - 2d are configured to house the trays 4 in a nested
25 arrangement.

                                             11
   Each tray 4 comprises a first tray portion 9 and a second tray portion 10. Each tray
   portion 9, 10 comprises a base portion 13 having a plurality of contiguous V-shaped
   grooves 11.
   In use, the two tray portions 9, 10 are arranged in an opposing relationship so that
 5 opposing grooves 11 define a plurality of chambers 12 of square or diamond
   shaped cross-section. This is illustrated in Figure 11.
   The grooves 11 could have other cross-sectional profiles.          For example, the
   grooves 11 could have a three-sided cross-sectional profile, with a flat bottom and
   angled side-walls which, when the two tray portions 9, 10 are arranged in an
10 opposing relationship, the opposing grooves 11 define a chamber 12 with a
   hexagonal or honeycomb-shaped cross-section. Having grooves with inclined side
   walls prevents the trays 4 from sticking or locking together when the trays are
   stacked with the tubers therein. This can stop the trays 4 from sliding out of the
   compartments when the plants are ready for harvesting as will be discussed below.
15 The first and second tray portions 9, 10 are not fixed together but are able to move
   apart from each other to accommodate the growing tubers - see the double
   headed arrow in Figure 11. In this way, the first and second tray portions 9, 10
   are configured for movement between a first position in which they are in an
   engaged orientation, to a second position in which they are in a non-engaged
20 orientation in which the first and second tray portions 10, 11 are separated.
   This provides an increase in the volume of each chamber 12 to accommodate
   the plant as it grows.
   The first and second tray portions 9, 10 include wall portions 14 extending
   laterally from, and along the width of, the base portion 13 and which close off
25 the grooves 11.      When the first and second tray portions 9, 10 are in the
   opposed relationship, the wall portions 14 for each groove 11 define a retaining
   face 16 for each chamber 12. The wall portions 14 may include a plurality of
   arrays of apertures 15 provided therein such that each chamber 12 has an

                                             12
   array of apertures 15 in the retaining face 16. This allows water to escape after
   irrigation.
   In this embodiment, for each tray 4, one tray portion 10 will have an array of
   apertures 15 in the wall portions 14, while the other tray will not - see, for example,
 5 Figure 5.
   The first or second tray portions 9, 10 also include a side walls 17 to close of the
   edges of the tray portions 9, 10.
   In use, the trays 4 are arranged so as to be laterally offset with respect to an
   adjacent tray 4 so that, when the adjacent trays 4 are stacked together, the
10 grooves of one tray fit into grooves of the other tray 4 so as to provide the
   nested arrangement. The trays 4 therefore rest one on top of another in a stack
   19 of trays 4 without significant gaps between the trays 4, thereby optimising
   the space with the compartment 2a - 2d.
   The weight of the trays and their contents, along with any additional,
15 superimposed weight keeps the trays 4 in the stacked arrangement.
   Prior to mounting within the tower 1, each tray is filled sweet potato tubers 24.
   The tubers 24 are arranged within each groove 11 of one of the tray portions
   9, and the second tray portion 10 is then placed in opposing relationship so
   that the tubers 24 are each contained in a chamber 12.
20 Figure 8 illustrates the tubers 24 in the grooves 11, with the double-headed
   arrows indicating how the two tray portions 9, 10 can move apart as the tubers
   24 grow.
   A cover 22 is placed over the open end of each chamber 12. The cover 22
   also has slots 23 provide therein to allow the tubers 24 to be irrigated with
25 nutrient filled water as required, and to enable the vines to grow out. It also
   protects against vermin getting in to the tray 4.            The cover 22 can be

                                                13
   dimensioned so that it extends up to the outer surface of the base portions 13,
   rather than being recessed internally of the open ends of the chambers 12.
   Once filled with tubers 24 and the covers 22 put in place, the trays 4 are inserted
   into each compartment 2a - 2d, from the bottom of the tower 1, one tray 4 at a
 5 time. As discussed above, the trays 4 are oriented so that they are mounted at an
   angle, and in a nested, or tessellated arrangement. The lip 6a - 6d of each wall
   portion 5a - 5d serves to guide and retain the trays 4 in their respective
   compartment 2a - 2d as they are inserted.
   The trays 4 are housed at an angle between 200 and 700 subtended to the
10 vertical i.e. to the longitudinal axis of the shaft 3. In a preferred embodiment
   the angle is between 300 and 600, and even more preferably at an angle 450.
   The trays 4 are angled such that the retaining face 16 for each chamber 12 is
   located towards the shaft 3 and the covered end of the chambers 12 facing
   upwards in a direction away from the shaft 3. In this orientation, water used for
15 irrigating the tubers 24 flows through the slots 23 in the cover 22 onto the tuber
   24 and downwards, exiting the chamber 12 via the array of apertures 15 in the
   retaining face 16 and into the water draining system.
   Once the required number of trays 4 have been inserted into a compartment 2a
   2d, a retaining member 18 is provided at the base of each stack 19 of nested trays
20 4. The retaining member 18 is removable from the compartment 2a - 2d so that it
   can be removed while the trays 4 are being inserted and can then be removed
   when the trays 2a - 2d are to be removed.
   Figure 3 illustrates a retaining member 18. For clarity, Figure 3 shows only one
   retaining member 18, although retaining members would be provide in each
25 compartment 2a - 2b.
   To optimise the yield of sweet potatoes, all compartments are stacked with trays
   4, although, it is not necessary to fill all compartments 2a - 2d.

                                              14
   The retaining member 18 is in the form of a plate 20 mounted on a biasing member
   21 in the form of a compression spring, or other suitable biasing member 21. The
   biasing force of the biasing member 21 is selected to provide an upward force to
   the stack 19 of trays 4 to retaining them within the compartment 2a - 2d. As the
 5 tubers 24 grow, the volume of the chamber 12 expands so moving the tray portions
   9, 10 apart as shown by the arrows in Figures 4, 5 and 8.
   Furthermore, as the tubers 24 grow the weight of the stack 19 of trays 4 provides
   a downward force onto the biasing member 21 which causes the plate 20 to move
   downwards. The retaining member 18 can be calibrated to provide an indication
10 that the tubers 24 are ready for harvesting i.e. that they are reached the correct
   weight.
   To take the trays 4 out, the retaining member 18 is removed and the trays 4 will fall
   down under gravity and can be removed from the tower.
   In another embodiment, each tray 4 can be provided with an indicator (not shown)
15 to show which trays 4 are expanding at a faster rate than the others.
   A weight (not shown) can be placed on top of each stack 19 of trays 4. The use of
   the weight prevents the upper tray from becoming dislodged from the stack 19, for
   example, as a result of wind gusts. This additional weight, combined with the
   inherent weight of the trays and the plants therein, serves to keep the trays stacked
20 within the compartments 2a - 2d. The weight can be a weight of 50kg, which is
   sufficient to hold the upper tray in place in winds with a speed of up to 100 km per
   hour.
   The tray portions 9, 10 are moulded in piece of food grade high density
   polyethylene (HDPE).
25 The tower 1 is made from HDPE and is made in modular units that can then be
   stacked to form the tower 1. For a 5m high tower 1, five 1m high units are made
   and stacked. The wall portions 5a - 5d can be solid or made of a honeycomb

                                             15
   structure which makes it lighter and saves on manufacturing costs.             Such
   structures can also be stronger, thereby supporting a greater weight of tubers. The
   height of the tower 1 will be determined by the environment in which the plants are
   cultivated, and will depend upon the temperature and amount of sunlight. The
 5 higher the tower 1, the more efficient the harvest and yield.
   As would be apparent, various alterations and equivalent forms may be provided
   without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. This includes
   modifications within the scope of the appended claims along with all modifications,
   alternative constructions and equivalents.
10 In the present specification, the presence of particular features does not preclude
   the existence of further features. The words "comprising", "including" and "having"
   are to be construed in an inclusive rather than an exclusive sense.
