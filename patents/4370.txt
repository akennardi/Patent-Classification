                                ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
A self-centering end cap (14) for a bottom rail (20) of an architectural structure covering (10).
The end cap (14) may include a contoured top surface (38) that is configured to contact a
head rail (16) of the architectural structure covering (10) to deflect the end cap (14) and hence
the bottom rail (20) and covering (18) of the architectural structure covering (10) toward a
horizontally centered position, thus enabling the covering (18) and the bottom rail (20) to be
fully retracted to a docked position within the head rail (16) without impediment.

        SELF-CENTERING END CAPS FOR ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURE COVERINGS
                        CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]      This application claims priority to pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application
Serial No. 62/432,235, filed December 9, 2016, titled "Self-Centering End Caps for
Architectural Structure Coverings", the entirety of which application is incorporated by
reference herein.
                                   FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0002]      The present disclosure relates generally to the field of architectural structure
coverings, and relates more particularly to end caps with contoured surfaces that promote
self-centering of a bottom rail of an architectural structure covering.
                                         BACKGROUND
[0003]      Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0004]      Architectural structure coverings may selectively cover a window, a doorway, a
skylight, a hallway, a portion of a wall, etc.      Generally speaking, horizontal architectural
structure coverings may include a covering that can be vertically extendable and retractable
(e.g., able to be lowered or raised, respectively, in a vertical direction) relative to a
horizontally-oriented head rail between a deployed or extended position, and a docked or
retracted position for obscuring and exposing an underlying architectural structure such as a
wall or an opening (such as, for example, a window). The architectural structure covering
may further include a rigid bottom rail attached to a lower edge of the covering. The bottom
rail may be utilized to add weight along the bottom edge of the covering to encourage the
                                                 1

covering to drop by gravity during deployment. The head rail and the bottom rail may both
include end caps affixed to the longitudinal ends thereof for providing the rails with a
visually pleasing, aesthetic finish.
[0005]      Commonly, a width of the head rail of the architectural structure covering,
measured from an inwardly-facing surface of an end cap on one end of the head rail to an
inwardly-facing surface of an end cap on an opposing end of the head rail, may be greater
than a width of the bottom rail of the architectural structure covering, measured from an
outwardly-facing surface of an end cap on one end of the bottom rail to an outwardly-facing
surface of an end cap on an opposing end of the bottom rail. Thus, when the covering is
retracted to its retracted, docked position, the ends caps of the bottom rail may pass between
the end caps of the head rail and the bottom rail may be hidden behind the head rail in an
aesthetically pleasing manner.
[0006]      When a covering is being retracted to its retracted, docked position, it is not
uncommon for the covering to become "skewed" as a result of one side of the covering being
retracted more quickly than the other side of the covering, due to uneven rolling of the
covering, or due to the head rail being mounted in a non-level window or on a non-level wall.
This may cause the covering to be displaced horizontally such that the bottom rail is
horizontally misaligned or off-center relative to the head rail. Thus, instead of the ends caps
of the bottom rail passing between the end caps of the head rail during retraction, one of the
end caps of the bottom rail may collide with a respective end cap on the head rail, thereby
preventing the covering and the bottom rail from being fully retracted to the retracted, docked
position.
[0007]      It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present improvements
may be useful.
                                                 2

                                           SUMMARY
[0008]      This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified
form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not
intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it
intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.
[0009]      Disclosed herein is an improved end cap for an architectural structure covering.
The architectural structure covering may include a head rail, a bottom rail, and a covering
extending between the head rail and the bottom rail. The end cap is configured to fit on
either end of the bottom rail and may include: an outer surface; an inner surface; a side
surface disposed between the outer and inner surfaces and including an upper portion; and a
self-centering feature for contacting the head rail of the architectural structure covering
during retraction of the covering to center the bottom rail (e.g., horizontally) within the head
rail. The self-centering feature may be integrally formed with the upper portion of the end
cap.   The self-centering feature may include a contoured flange extending from the upper
portion of the end cap. The contoured flange may include a contoured top surface that slopes
inwardly away from the outer surface of the end cap. The contoured flange may include a
contoured top surface that slopes outwardly away from the covering.
[0010]      The present disclosure is also directed to a self-centering architectural structure
covering. The architectural structure covering may include a head rail assembly having first
and second head rail ends; first and second head rail end caps operatively associated with the
first and second head rail ends, respectively; a bottom rail having first and second bottom rail
ends; first and second self-centering end caps operatively associated with the first and second
bottom rail ends, respectively; and a covering extending between the head rail assembly and
the bottom rail, the covering being selectively movable between an extended, deployed
                                                3

position and a retracted, docked position. In use, when the covering and the bottom rail are
being selectively moved from the extended, deployed position to the retracted, docked
position, in an unskewed configuration, the first and second end caps pass between the first
and second head rail end caps. While, when the covering and the bottom rail are being
selectively moved from the extended, deployed position to the retracted, docked position, in a
skewed configuration, one of the first and second end caps contacts one of the first and
second head rail end caps to center the covering and the bottom rail with respect to the head
rail assembly, such as horizontally.
[0011]      The first and second self-centering end caps may include an outer surface; an
inner surface; a side surface disposed between the outer and inner surfaces, the side surface
including an upper portion; and a self-centering feature configured to contact the first and
second head rail end caps, respectively, during retraction of the covering and the bottom rail
to center (e.g., horizontally) the bottom rail within the head rail assembly when in the
retracted, docked position.      The self-centering feature may include a contoured flange
extending from the upper portion of the first and second end caps. The contoured flange may
include a contoured top surface that slopes inwardly away from the outer surface of the end
caps. The contoured flange may include a contoured top surface that slopes outwardly away
from the covering. The first and second self-centering end caps may be coupled to the first
and second bottom rail ends, respectively.       The first and second end caps may include
retention members extending from an inner surface thereof, the retention members being
insertable into the first and second ends of the bottom rail. Alternatively, the first and second
self-centering end caps may be integrally formed with the first and second bottom rail ends,
respectively.
                                                4

[0012]      The head rail assembly may include a roller tube, the covering being selectively
windable about the roller tube as the covering is selectively moved between the extended,
deployed position and the retracted, docked position. In the retracted, docked position, the
bottom rail may be retracted into the head rail assembly.
[0013]      The present disclosure is also directed to a method for self-centering an
architectural structure covering. The method may include the steps of selectively moving a
covering of the architectural structure covering from an extended, deployed position to a
retracted, docked position, when the covering and the bottom rail are in an unskewed
configuration such that a bottom rail of the architectural structure covering is substantially
parallel to a head rail of the architectural structure covering; passing the bottom rail between
the head rail; and when the covering and the bottom rail are in a skewed configuration such
that a bottom rail of the architectural structure covering is skewed with respect to the head
rail, contacting one of a first end cap and a second end cap associated with the bottom rail
with one of a first end cap and a second end cap associated with the head rail to center (e.g.,
horizontally) the covering and the bottom rail with respect to the head rail.
[0014]      In the skewed configuration, one of the end caps associated with the bottom rail
may become vertically aligned with one of the end caps associated with the head rail. Further
movement of the covering from the extended, deployed position to the retracted, docked
position may cause one of the first end cap and the second end cap associated with the bottom
rail to contact one of the first end cap and the second end cap associated with the head rail to
displace the end cap and the bottom rail, such as by aligning the bottom rail horizontally
toward a horizontal center C of the covering. The end caps associated with the bottom rail
may include a contoured top surface that contacts a lower surface of the end cap associated
with the head rail so that continued vertical movement of the bottom rail causes the contoured
                                                  5

top surface of the end cap to deflect the bottom rail toward the horizontal center C of the
covering. In addition, as the contoured top surface of the end caps contact the lower surface
of the end cap associated with the head rail, continued vertical movement of the bottom rail
may also cause the contoured top surface of the end cap to deflect the bottom rail and thus
align the bottom rail in the front (e.g., toward the room) to back (e.g., toward the wall)
direction.
[0015]      One embodiment provides an end cap for an architectural structure covering
having a head rail, a bottom rail and a covering extending between the head rail and the
bottom rail, the end cap comprising:
            an outer surface;
            an inner surface;
            a side surface disposed between the outer and inner surfaces, the side surface
including an upper portion; and
            a self-centering feature including a flange extending from the upper portion of the
side surface, the flange being configured to contact the head rail of the architectural structure
covering during retraction of the covering to horizontally center the bottom rail within the
head rail.
[0016]      One embodiment provides a self-centering architectural covering comprising:
            a head rail assembly having first and second head rail ends;
            first and second head rail end caps operatively associated with the first and second
head rail ends, respectively;
            a bottom rail having first and second bottom rail ends;
            first and second self-centering end caps operatively associated with the first and
second bottom rail ends, respectively;
                                                6

            a covering extending between the head rail assembly and the bottom rail, the
covering being selectively movable between an extended position and a docked position;
            wherein, when the covering and the bottom rail are being selectively moved from
the extended position to the docked position, in an unskewed configuration, the first and
second end caps pass between the first and second head rail end caps; and
            wherein, when the covering and the bottom rail are being selectively moved from
the extended position to the docked position, in a skewed configuration, one of the first and
second end caps contacts one of the first and second head rail end caps to horizontally center
the covering and the bottom rail with respect to the head rail assembly.
[0017]      One embodiment provides a method for self-centering an architectural structure
covering comprising:
            selectively moving a covering of the architectural structure covering from an
extended position to a docked position;
            when the covering and the bottom rail are in an unskewed configuration such that
a bottom rail of the architectural structure covering is substantially parallel to a head rail of
the architectural structure covering, passing the bottom rail between the head rail; and
            when the covering and the bottom rail are in a skewed configuration such that a
bottom rail of the architectural structure covering is skewed with respect to the head rail,
contacting one of a first end cap and a second end cap associated with the bottom rail with
one of a first end cap and a second end cap associated with the head rail to horizontally center
the covering and the bottom rail with respect to the head rail.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0030]      Embodiments of self-centering end caps for architectural structure coverings in
accordance with the present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the present
disclosure are presented. The end caps of the present disclosure may, however, be embodied
in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set
forth herein.   Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will convey
certain exemplary aspects of the end caps to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, like
numbers refer to like elements throughout unless otherwise noted.
[0031]      As will be described in greater detail below, the end caps of the present disclosure
may be configured to center a bottom rail of an architectural structure covering relative to a
head rail of the architectural structure covering, such as centering the bottom rail
horizontally, so that the bottom rail can be fully retracted to a retracted, docked position and
hidden behind or within the head rail even if a covering of the architectural structure covering
becomes skewed during retraction thereof. In addition, the end caps of the present disclosure
                                                9

may be configured to center the bottom rail of the architectural structure covering relative to
the head rail of the architectural structure covering in the front (e.g., toward the room) to back
(e.g., toward the wall) direction.
[0032]      Referring to FIG. 1, a front view of an architectural structure covering 10
equipped with self-centering end caps 12, 14 (hereinafter "the end caps 12,                14") in
accordance with an illustrative, non-limiting embodiment of the present disclosure is shown.
For the sake of convenience and clarity, terms such as "front," "rear," "top," "bottom," "up,"
"down," "vertical," and "horizontal" may be used herein to describe the relative placement
and orientation of various components and portions of the architectural structure covering 10
and the end caps 12, 14, each with respect to the geometry and orientation of the architectural
structure covering 10 and the end caps 12, 14 as they appear in FIG. 1. Said terminology
will include the words specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof, and words of similar
import.
[0033]      The architectural structure covering 10 may include a head rail 16, a covering 18,
and a bottom rail 20. The head rail 16 may be configured to be mounted to a wall or other
structure above a window, doorway, skylight, hallway, or other portion of a wall in a
conventional manner that will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art. The head
rail 16 may include end caps 22, 24 (hereinafter "the head rail end caps 22, 24) disposed on
opposing longitudinal ends thereof         The head rail end caps 22, 24 may be removably
fastened to, or integrally formed with, the head rail 16, and may be provided for imparting a
visually pleasing, aesthetic finish to the head rail 16.
[0034]      As will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the covering 18
of the architectural structure covering 10 may be suspended from the head rail 16 and may be
configured to be vertically extended and retracted relative to the head rail 16 between an
                                                 10

extended, deployed position (shown in FIG. 1), wherein the covering 18 may partially or
entirely cover a window, a doorway, a skylight, a hallway, a portion of a wall, etc., and a
retracted, docked position (shown in FIG. 4), wherein the covering 18 and the bottom rail 20
may be retracted into, and substantially hidden within, the head rail 16 (e.g., behind a fascia
26 of the head rail 16).    The covering 18 depicted in the figures may be constructed of a
fabric material of a conventional type that will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the
art. However, as will become apparent below, the end caps 22, 24 of the present disclosure
may be implemented in conjunction with any type of covering 18, constructed from any type
of material. For example, the covering 18 may be constructed from a plastic material, a vinyl
material, a wood material, a metal material, etc. Furthermore, the covering 18 may be any
type of covering, for example, a pleated shade, a Roman style shade, a Venetian blind, a
roller shade, a stackable style, a cellular style, slats, hurricane shutters, etc. According to the
illustrative embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the covering 18 is a rollable style fabric. In
addition, the end caps 22, 24 of the present disclosure may be implemented in conjunction
with a manually-actuated or motorized architectural structure covering that is amendable to
having a bottom rail affixed to a lower edge thereof
[0035]       The bottom rail 20 may be a rigid, elongate member that is affixed to a bottom
edge of the covering 18. Generally speaking, the bottom rail 20 provides a user a convenient
location or "touchpoint" at which the user may engage the covering 18, for example, to pull
up or down on the bottom rail to raise or lower the covering, respectively. Depending on the
operating system used, the bottom rail 20 may also be provided to add weight to the lower
edge of the covering 18 to encourage the covering 18 to drop by gravity from the head rail 16
during deployment. The end caps 12, 14 may be disposed on opposing longitudinal ends of
the bottom rail 20. In some embodiments, the end caps 12, 14 may be integral portions of the
bottom rail 20 (e.g., formed as part of the bottom rail 20 during manufacture thereof). In
                                                  11

other embodiments, the end caps 12, 14 may be affixed to the ends of the bottom rail 20 using
mechanical fastening means. For example, referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the end caps 12,
14 may include respective retention members 28, 30 extending from respective inner surfaces
32, 34 thereof The retention members 28, 30 may be configured to be inserted into hollow
ends of the bottom rail 20 and held therein via friction fit, snap fit, etc. between the retention
members 28, 30 and an interior surface of the bottom rail 20.           The embodiments of the
present disclosure are not limited in this regard, and it is contemplated that the end caps 12,
14 may be engaged to the bottom rail 20 in any conventional manner known in the art.
[0036]      Referring now to FIG. 3A, a detail front view illustrating the end cap 14 and
surrounding structure of the architectural structure covering 10 is shown. The end cap 14 is
substantially identical to, but a mirror image of, the end cap 12 shown in FIG. 1. Thus, for
the sake of convenience and clarity, only the end cap 14 will be described in detail below. It
will be understood, however, that the following description shall also apply to the end cap 12,
with references to horizontal orientation being reversed with respect thereto.
[0037]      Referring to FIGS. 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A and 3B, the end cap 14 may include an inner
surface 34, a side surface 35, and an outer surface 40. The side surface 35 may be disposed
between the outer surface 40 and the inner surface 34. The side surface 35 may include an
upper portion 37 (i.e., an upper portion 37 of the end cap 14 when the end cap 14 is
operatively installed on the bottom rail 20 as illustrated in FIG. 3A).           In addition, as
previously mentioned, the end cap 14 may include a retention member 30 extending from the
inner surface 34 thereof for engaging the bottom rail 20 or otherwise retaining the end cap 14
in engagement with the bottom rail 20. The end cap 14 may also include a self-centering
feature 36 extending from (e.g., integral with) the upper portion 37 thereof            The self
centering feature 36 of the end cap 14 may be in the form of a flange extending from the
                                               12

upper portion 37 of the end cap 14. The flange or self-centering feature 36 may include an
angled or contoured top surface 38 that slopes inwards away from an outer surface 40 of the
end cap 14. In addition, referring to FIG. 3B, the flange or self-centering feature 36 of the
end cap 14 may extend outwards (e.g., towards the room) away from the covering 18. The
top surface 38 may be flat or curved, or may include both a flat portion and a curved portion.
The top surface 38 may also be substantially smooth to prevent the end cap 14 from catching
or grabbing anything during retraction.     In addition, the smooth top surface may end in a
rounded nose. That is, in use, the initial contact point between the endcap 14 and the head
rail end cap 24 preferably occurs with the top surface 38 of the self-centering feature 36. As
such, the top surface 38 of the self-centering feature 36 preferably is substantially smooth to
prevent the endcap 14 from getting caught on anything.
[0038]      In the illustrative embodiment, the contoured top surface 38 of the end cap 14 may
reside in-front-of the covering 18 (e.g., towards the room) and thus visible to the end user,
however it is also contemplated that the contoured top surface 38 may extend in the opposite
direction (for example, towards the window and away from the interior room).
[0039]      Referring to FIGS. 2D and 2E, in designing the endcap 14, the larger the distance
X from the tip of the flange 41 (e.g., region at which end cap 14 first contacts the head rail
end cap 24 or other element to commence centering the bottom rail 20) to the outer surface
40 of the end cap 14, the greater the amount of skew of the covering 18 that can be handled.
However, this should be balanced with aesthetics consideration. (e.g., the greater the distance
X from the tip 41 of the self-centering flange 36 to the outer surface 40, the more visible the
self-centering feature 36 becomes to the end user). For example, a comparison of FIG. 2D
and FIG. 2E illustrates the different aesthetics associated with the self-centering flange 36 as
the distance X is varied.      FIG. 2D illustrates a distance X of approximately 0.21 inches.
                                                13

FIG. 2E illustrates a distance X of approximately 0.55 inches.        In use, providing a larger
distance X enables the self-centering flange 36 to handle an increased amount of skew in the
covering 18, however as the distance X increases, the height of the self-centering flange 36
increases at a greater rate. Increasing the height of the self-centering flange 36 generally has

[0040]      While the flange or self-centering feature 36 has been illustrated and described as
being part of the end cap 14 associated with the bottom rail 20, it is also contemplated that
the flange or self-centering feature 36 can be located on the head rail end cap 24. In this
embodiment, the flange or self-centering feature 36 may extend downwards (e.g., away from
the head rail 16) and outwards (e.g., towards the room) to contact and guide the endcap of the
bottom rail 20.
[0041]      The purpose and functionality of the self-centering feature 36 will be described in
detail below.
[0042]      During normal operation of the architectural structure covering 10, the covering
18 and the bottom rail 20 may be retracted from the extended, deployed position shown in
FIG. 1 to the retracted, docked position shown in FIG. 4. While being retracted, the bottom
rail 20 may maintain a substantially parallel orientation relative to the head rail 16, and the
end caps 12, 14 may pass between (i.e., inside of) the head rail end caps 22, 24 without
contacting or colliding therewith before arriving at the retracted, docked position within the
head rail 16. In some instances, however, the covering 18 may become "skewed" as a result
of one side of the covering 18 being retracted more quickly than the other side, due to uneven
                                               14

rolling of the covering (e.g., fabric covering), or due to the head rail being mounted in a non
level window or on a non-level wall, as shown in FIG. 5. Such skewing may cause the
bottom rail 20 to be horizontally displaced away from a horizontal center C of the
architectural structure covering 10. For example, as shown in FIG. 5, the bottom rail 20 has
been displaced to the right as a result of the right side of the covering 18 being retracted more
quickly than the left side of the covering 18.         Resultantly, the end cap 14 has become
vertically aligned with the head rail end cap 24.        Thus, when the covering 18 is further
retracted as shown in FIG. 6, the end cap 14 may contact or collide with the head rail end cap
24, instead of bypassing the head rail end cap 24 as occurs during normal, unskewed
retraction of the covering 18.
[0043]      In architectural structure coverings having conventional bottom rail end caps (i.e.,
without the self-centering feature 36 of the present disclosure), the collision depicted in FIG.
6 may impede further retraction of the covering 18, preventing the covering 18 and the
bottom rail 20 from being stowed in a fully retracted, docked position (FIG. 4) and leaving
the covering 18 and the bottom rail 20 in an unsightly, skewed disposition. However, due to
the self-centering feature 36 of the present disclosure, vertical engagement between the end
cap 14 and the head rail end cap 24 may result in automatic horizontal displacement of the
end cap 14 and the bottom rail 20 toward the horizontal center C of the architectural structure
covering 10. Particularly, as the covering 18 and the bottom rail 20 are further retracted as
indicated by the vertical arrow V in FIG. 6B, the contoured top surface 38 of the end cap 14
may engage a lower surface of the head rail 24 and, through such engagement and continued
vertical movement of the end cap 14, the contoured top surface 38 may deflect the end cap 14
and the bottom rail 20 toward the horizontal center C of the architectural structure covering
10 as indicated by the horizontal arrow H in FIG. 6B. Thus, the end cap 14 may slide against
and around the inside edge of the head rail end cap 24, whereby the end cap 14 may bypass
                                                 15

the head rail end cap 24 as occurs during normal, unskewed retraction of the covering 18, and
the covering 18 and the bottom rail 20 may continue to be retracted to the retracted, docked
position without restriction. In addition, the end caps 12, 14 may be configured to center the
bottom rail 20 of the architectural structure covering 10 relative to the head rail 20 of the
architectural structure covering in the front (e.g., toward the room) to back (e.g., toward the
wall) direction. That is, contact of the contoured top surface 38 of the end cap 14 and the
lower surface of the head rail 24 may also deflect the end cap 14 and the bottom rail 20 to
center the bottom rail 20 relative to the head rail 20 in the front (e.g., toward the room) to
back (e.g., toward the wall) direction.
