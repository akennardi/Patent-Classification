ABSTRACT
A current digital dental model is received that includes a representation of the set of physical
teeth for the patient with the current dental appliance attached to the physical teeth or oral
cavity. The current digital dental model is a direct digital scan of the set of physical teeth and
the current dental appliance. The physical teeth are at a position in treatment when all or a part
of the current dental appliance is desired to be removed from one or more of the set of physical
teeth and it is desired to use a subsequent appliance. The current digital dental model is created
based a new digital dental model that includes the representation of the set of physical teeth
without including the current dental appliance.

       A METHOD AND A SYSTEM USABLE IN CREATING A SUBSEQUENT DENTAL
                                              APPLIANCE
   BACKGROUND
   [0001] . Frequently a patient will wear some type of dental appliance, such as a
   retainer, positioner, or splint, after their orthodontic braces have been removed in order
   to prevent the positions of the patient's teeth from deviating from the accomplished
   teeth arrangement. A set of braces is one example of what shall be referred to herein
   as a "current dental appliance." A dental appliance that is worn after removal of the
   current dental appliance shall be referred to herein as a "subsequent dental appliance."
   Retainers are an example of a subsequent dental appliance. Alternatively, patients in
   orthodontic braces may wish to discontinue wearing the bonded braces during
   treatment, and finish the remainder of their treatment with additional dental appliances
   such as a clear removable plastic aligner. In the event that the treatment consists of a
   combination of braces followed by removable aligners, a transition between the braces
   and aligners without having to manufacture a temporary holding retainer (to minimize
   tooth movement after the braces are removed) between the two phases of treatment is
   desired.
    [0002] To manufacture the subsequent dental appliance, physical impressions may be
   taken with the current dental appliance still affixed to the patient's teeth in order to
    minimize the amount of undesirable tooth movement which may occur between the
    time after the removal of the current dental appliance and the time that the subsequent
    dental appliance is delivered. By leaving the current dental appliance on for the
    impressions, it is hoped that the subsequent dental appliance can be manufactured
    while the teeth are held in place with the current dental appliance and delivered
    immediately after the current dental appliances are removed. However, the
    impressions that are taken with the current dental appliance affixed on the patient can
    be difficult--not only for the clinician, but also for the patient--because of the undercuts
    present in the current dental appliance which lock in the impression material as it sets.
    This is not only uncomfortable and messy for the patient, but can also lead to
    impression distortion if, for example, excessive force is required to free the locked
    impression from the teeth when the current dental appliances are still present. As a
     result of any distortion in the impression, the subsequent dental appliances may not fit
    well on the patient's teeth when they are delivered. Even after the impression is taken,
     a technician will have to spend considerable effort manually cleaning up any model

                                                 2
   made from the impression and manually removing all parts of the current appliance
   and any distortion and other defects arising from taking the impression. These are just
   a few examples of why physical impressions are undesirable.
   [0003] More often, the treating professional waits until the current dental appliance is
   removed before taking an impression. This eliminates some of the difficulties in taking
   the impression with the current appliance, but results in a need for a temporary retainer
   or no retainer for the period in which it takes to make a subsequent dental appliance.
   The later risks teeth movement before the subsequent dental appliance can be applied
   to the teeth. In either case, it also necessitates another appointment with the treating
   professional to fit and apply the subsequent appliance.

   DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   [0016] According to one embodiment, a current digital dental model, such as a digital
   image, is made of the patient's physical teeth with one or more current dental
   appliances attached to the physical teeth normally just before the current dental
   appliance is to be removed and replaced with a subsequent dental appliance. If the
   subsequent appliance is an end-of-treatment retainer, the teeth are usually at or near a
   desired arrangement of the teeth. If the subsequent appliance is a middle-of-treatment
   appliance, the teeth are at a treatment arrangement that is between the initial
   arrangement and the desired arrangement.
   [0017] Various types of direct or indirect scanning or imaging (such as an intraoral
   scan, CBCT, or various types of scan of physical models or impressions including laser
   and computed tomography) can be used for creating the current digital dental model.
   According to a preferred embodiment, the current digital dental model is a direct digital
   scan of the set of physical teeth with the current dental appliance attached to one or
   more of the physical teeth. Various embodiments may also be used with a current
   dental appliance that is attached to the patient's oral cavity, such as to the patient's
    bone beneath the gingiva.
    [0018] Examples of a current dental appliance include any dental appliance suitable
    for attachment to one or more of the patient's teeth and a dental appliance suitable for
    attachment to the patient's bone beneath the gingival, among others. More
    specifically, the current dental appliance may consist of one or more items and may be
    all or a portion of a set of braces (which may include bonded brackets, buttons,
    cemented bands, or a combination thereof), a temporary anchorage device (TAD) that
    is attached to the patient's oral cavity, or a dental attachment that is suitable for use
    with a removable plastic positioning dental appliance (also referred to herein as an
    "aligner"), a dental appliance suitable for attachment to bone under the gingiva of the
    patient, a sleep apnea appliance, a splint, a bridge, an implant, an orthodontic band, a
    fixed lingual retainer, a set of lingual braces or any item that has been fixedly attached
    to any portion of the oral cavity, as examples. Examples of types of TADs are a mini
     screw, a mini plate, a ball type, a bracket type and a hook type. The current dental
     appliance may be positioned on either the facial/buccal surface, the lingual surface of
    the patient's physical teeth, the gingiva, or a combination thereof.

WO 2014/037778                                                                     PCT/IB2013/001832
                                                  6
   [0019] A new digital dental model of the aligned teeth (either fully or partially) can be
   created based on a model of the current teeth with the current dental appliance present
   or from a previous model of the unaligned teeth without the current dental appliance
   present. For example, the new digital dental model may be created by removing the
   current dental appliance from the current digital dental model or by moving digital teeth
   of an earlier time point (of the same patient) without the dental appliance present into
   the same positions as the teeth in the current digital dental model (with the dental
   appliance present), among other things as described herein. According to one
   embodiment, the creation of the new digital dental model is computer automated. The
   creation of the new digital dental model can be fully automated or substantially
   automated.
   [0020] A new digital dental model can be used to manufacture a subsequent dental
   appliance prior to removing the current dental appliance from the patient's physical
   teeth. Examples of a subsequent dental appliance are a retainer, an (active) aligner,
   an expander, a splint or bite guard, or a positioner. The retainer may be a Hawley, an
   Essix-type, a bonded wire, any vacuum-formed type stent, a spring-retainer, a clear
   splint, or a combination thereof. At least one example of a splint is an orthognathic
   surgery splint, among others.
    [0021] According to one embodiment, the current digital dental model and the new
   digital dental model includes a portion of the patient's gingiva. For example, the
    current digital dental model and the new digital dental model may include at least the
    portion of the patient's gingiva that would be covered over by or adjacent to a
    subsequent dental appliance.
    [0022] According to one embodiment, the current digital dental model and a new digital
    dental model may include digital teeth that represent all of a patient's physical teeth
    clinically present (i.e. unerupted and/or impacted teeth not included) whether natural or
    prosthetic (e.g., dental crown or bridge pontic). For the sake of simplicity however,
    many of the figures depict a subset of the patient's physical teeth.
     [0023] Figure 1a illustrates a patient's set of physical teeth 100 with respective
     physical teeth 100a-100d and gingiva 102. Figure 1b-1d, 1f and 1g illustrate examples
     of dental appliances 112, 122, 132, 152, 162 attached to the patient's set of physical

WO 2014/037778                                                                   PCT/IB2013/001832
                                                 7
  teeth 100, according to various embodiments. For the sake of simplicity, Figures 1a-g
   depicts a subset of the patient's physical teeth.
   [0024] Example 110 depicts the patient's set of physical teeth 100 with a set of
   orthodontic braces 112 attached. The set of braces 112 may include one or more
   brackets, archwires, etc. Example 120 depicts the patient's set of physical teeth 100
  with dental attachments 122 that are suitable for use with a removable plastic
   positioning dental appliance, such as an aligner. Example 130 depicts an orthodontic
   band attached to the patient's set of physical teeth 100. Example 140 depicts spaces
   142, 146 on the side of the tooth and a space 144 at the back of the tooth after the
   removal of the orthodontic band 132 has been removed. Example 150 depicts a fixed
   lingual retainer 152. Example 160 depicts lingual braces.
   [0025] The dental brackets and dental attachments as depicted in Figures 1b, 1c, 1d,
   1f, 1g are considered some examples of and shall be referred to a "current dental
   appliance" since the dental appliances 112, 122, 132, 132, 152, 162 are currently
   attached to the patient's physical teeth 100. The dental attachments 122 may be
   aligner attachments for use with an aligner.
   [0026] The patient's set of physical teeth 100 are at or close to a desired teeth
   arrangement, according to one embodiment. A desired teeth arrangement, according
   to one embodiment, is the final teeth arrangement that is accomplished as a result of
   orthodontic treatment. According to one embodiment, the patient's physical teeth 100
   may be at the desired teeth arrangement as a result of an orthodontic treatment.
   According to another embodiment, the patient's physical teeth 100 are close to, but not
   exactly at the desired teeth arrangement. For example, due to the current dental
   appliance 112, a feature such as a cemented orthodontic band 132 (Figure 1d) may
   take up a small space in between two physical teeth adjacent to each other. A space
    142, 146 (Figure le) between the adjacent physical teeth can also be referred to as an
   "interproximal space." When the bands are removed, the interproximal space that
    existed because of the bands will close. Various embodiments are also well-suited for
    physical teeth that are close to the desired teeth arrangement, but not exactly at the
    desired teeth arrangement. Another example is that a treating professional may want
    to start creating a subsequent appliance before the teeth have moved all the way to the
    desired tooth arrangement.

WO 2014/037778                                                                   PCT/IB2013/001832
                                                 8
   [0027] Although many embodiments are described in the context of a set of braces
   112, the current dental appliance may be any type of dental appliance that can be
   attached to one or more of the patient's physical teeth 100 or to the patient's tissues
   within the oral cavity. The current dental appliance may be any type of dental
   appliance that is suitable for use with a removable plastic positioning dental appliance.
   [0028] Figures 2a-c illustrate a technique for creating a new digital dental model,
   according to one embodiment. Figure 2a depicts segmented digital teeth 200 of the
   patient, Figure 2b depicts a current digital dental model 210, and Figure 2c depicts a
   new digital dental model 220. The current digital dental model 210 is a representation
   of the patient's set of physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) and the dental appliance 112
   (Figure 1b) that is currently attached to the patient's physical teeth 100.
   [0029] According to one embodiment, a digital scan of the patient's physical teeth 100
   is taken without any dental appliance being on the patient's physical teeth 100. The
   digital scan can be processed to create segmented digital teeth 200 of the patient.
   Each 200a-200d of the segmented digital teeth 200 represents a different one 100a
   100d (Figure 1a) of the patient's physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a). Each of the
   segmented digital teeth 200, according to one embodiment, has one or more axes of
   their own and three dimensional (3D) coordinates so that each of the segmented digital
   teeth can be freely positioned in 3D space. For example, 3D coordinates alone or 3D
   coordinates in combination with one or more axes can be used for positioning each of
   the segmented digital teeth 200 based on the positions of each individual digital tooth
    210a-210d, 220a-220a associated with either the current digital dental model 210 or a
    new digital dental model 220, as will be described in more detail in the context of
    Figure 16.
    [0030] Each of the segmented digital teeth 200a-200d can be superimposed on the
    corresponding digital teeth 210a-210d associated with the current digital dental model
    210. The surfaces shared in common (i.e. not covered by the dental appliance) can be
    used as references and the basis for the superimposition. A new location for the
    segmented digital teeth 200a-200d can then be assigned to each individual tooth,
    based on the position of the equivalent tooth in the new digital dental model 220 (the
    new digital dental model 220 can be segmented or unsegmented or partially

WO 2014/037778                                                                    PCT/IB2013/001832
                                                  9
   segmented). The non-superimposed portion includes any portion of the current digital
   dental model 210 that is not part of the original digital dental model as represented by
   the segmented digital teeth 200. For example, the non-superimposed portion can
   include the current dental appliance 112 and any cement that is used for attaching the
   current dental appliance 112 to the patient's physical teeth 100 (Figure ib). The non
   superimposed portion may also include changes to the gingival contours (due to
   inflammation for example). The new digital dental model 220 can be created either by
   removing the non superimposed portion of the current digital dental model 210 or by
   creating the new digital dental model 220 based on the superimposed portion without
   the non superimposed portion.
   (0031] Figures 3a-3c illustrates a technique for creating a new digital dental model,
   according to one embodiment. Figure 3a depicts a representation 300 of the current
   dental appliance, Figure 3b the current digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b), and Figure
   3c depicts a new digital dental model 320. The representation of the current dental
   appliance 300 may be an image that was taken of the same physical dental appliance.
   For example, a digital image of the dental appliance 112 (Figure 1b) may have been
   taken when the dental appliance 112 was not applied to the patient's physical teeth
    100 (Figure 1a). The representation of the current dental appliance 300 or portion
   300a, 300b may be an image obtained, for example, from a library of dental appliances
   of different types. The obtained image may be an image of a different physical dental
   appliance that is the same type or a similar type of as the current dental appliance 112
    (Figure 1b). For example, the obtained image may be an image of a different physical
   dental appliance that is the same make or model, or a combination thereof, as the
    current dental appliance 112 (Figure 1b).
    [0032] A representation of all 300 or a portion 300a, 300b of the current dental
    appliance 112 (Figure 1b) may be superimposed. Examples of a portion 300a, 300b of
    the current dental appliance 112 (Figure 1b) are a bracket, a wire, a band, a tube, a
    cleat, a button, a ligature wire, a hook, an aligner attachment, and an O-ring.
    [0033] The representation of the current dental appliance 300 can be superimposed on
    the current digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b). The portion of the current digital
    dental model 210 that is superimposed by the representation of the current dental
    appliance 300 or by the portion 300a, 300b can be determined. The new digital dental

   model 320 can be created, for example, by removing the superimposed portion from
   the current digital dental model 210 or by creating the new digital dental model 320
   based on the non superimposed portion without the superimposed portion.
   [0034] According to one embodiment, the new digital dental model 320 may include
   representations of excess cement or offsets to the surfaces of the physical teeth due to
   the cement, or a combination thereof. Therefore, a subsequent dental appliance that is
   created based on the new digital dental model 320 will fit the patient's physical teeth
   100 (Figure 1a) but may be slightly larger than a subsequent dental appliance created,
   for example, using a new digital dental model 220 (Figure 2b). Various embodiments
   can be used to remove the representations of the excess cement. For example, at
   least various embodiments described in the context of Figures 5a-5c may be used to
   remove the representations of the excess cement.
    [0035] Figures 4a-4c illustrate a technique for creating a new digital dental model,
   according to one embodiment. Figure 4a depicts a bracket base 400, a digital tooth
   210b that is a part of a current digital dental model 210, and a representation 420b that
    is a part of a new digital dental model 420. The bracket base 400 is associated with a
    current dental appliance 112 (Figure 1b) for the patient or is associated with a dental
    appliance that is a similar type or the same type as the current dental appliance 112
    (Figure 1b). The underneath surface 402 of the bracket base 400 has a contour 404
    that approximates the contour 450 of the digital tooth 210b's portion 440.
     [0036] As depicted in Figure 4b, a bracket base 400 is attached to a portion 440 of a
    digital tooth 210b with cement 430. According to one embodiment, the contour 450 of
    the portion 440 of the digital tooth 210b associated with the current digital dental model
     210 (Figure 2b) is estimated based on the contour 404 of the underneath surface 402
     of the bracket base 400.
     [0037] Various embodiments are well-suited for approximating the contour 450 of a
     portion 440 a digital tooth portion 440 based on other portions, as discussed herein, of
     a dental appliance besides a bracket base, as discussed herein. For example, if a
     portion of a digital tooth is beneath a bonded lingual wire, various embodiments are
     well-suited for using a contour underneath the bonded lingual wire to estimate the
     contour of a portion of digital tooth that would be beneath that wire.

    [0038] Referring to Figure 4c, according to one embodiment, the new digital tooth
    420b of the new digital dental model 420 may include representations of excess
    cement 430 or offsets to the surfaces of the physical teeth due to the cement 430, or a
    combination thereof. For example, cement 430 may appear to be part of the digital
    tooth 210b. Therefore, a subsequent dental appliance that would be created based on
    the new digital dental model 420 (Figure 4c) would fit the patient's physical teeth 100
    (Figure Ia) but may be slightly larger than a subsequent dental appliance created, for
    example, using a new digital dental model 220 (Figure 2b). Therefore it is desirable to
    remove such representations of excess cement and or offsets. Various embodiments
    can be used to remove the representations of the excess cement 430. For example, at
    least various embodiments described in the context of Figures 5a-5c may be used to
    remove the representations of the excess cement 430.
    [0039] Figures 5a-5c illustrate a technique for creating a new digital dental model,
    according to one embodiment. Figure 5a depicts digital teeth 500a-500d that are each
    similar to respective digital teeth 21 Oa-21 Od (Figure 2b) associated with a current
    digital dental model 210. A similar digital tooth 500a-500d may be obtained by
    averaging a plurality of digital teeth from a library of digital teeth, for example. A similar
    digital tooth 500a-500d may be an image of another physical tooth associated with the
     patient. For example, because of midplane symmetry of most individuals, a patient's
    two front teeth 100b, 100c (Figure 1a) are approximate mirror images of each other. A
     digital image of one of a patient's front teeth 100b can be created based on a mirror
     image of a digital image of the patient's contralateral front tooth 100c. Physical teeth
     100a and 100d (Figure 1a) are also examples of teeth that may be similar to each
     other. For example, a mirror image of physical tooth 100a could be superimposed on
     digital tooth 210d or a mirror image of physical tooth 100d could be superimposed on
     digital tooth 210a. The similar digital teeth 500 may be images of physical teeth from
      another person besides the patient. For example, the other person may be selected
      based on similar demographics as the patient. Examples of demographics used in
      determining if digital teeth are similar to each other include sex, age, ethnicity, size of
      teeth, such as small, medium, or large, and shape of the teeth, such as bulbous or flat,
      square or tapered.

WO 2014/037778                                                                      PCT/IB2013/001832

  [0040] A similar digital tooth 500a-500d may be resized based on the size of a digital
  tooth 210a-210d (Figure 2b) in the current digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b). For
  example, the similar digital tooth 500a-500d may be resized to match or approximately
  match one of the digital teeth 210a-210d in the current digital dental model 210.
  According to one embodiment, the similar digital tooth 500a-500d is resized to be
  slightly larger than the digital tooth 21 Oa-21 Od that it will superimpose to ensure that
  the subsequent dental appliance fits the patient's physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a).
   [0041] A similar digital tooth 500a-500d, according to one embodiment, has its own
  three dimensional (3D) coordinates, as discussed herein, so that a similar digital tooth
  500a-500d can be positioned, for example, based on the position of a corresponding
  digital tooth 210a-210d (Figure 2b) associated with either the current digital dental
   model 210 or the new digital dental model 520.
   [0042] Each of the similar digital teeth 500a-500d can be superimposed on
   corresponding digital teeth 210a-210d (Figure 2b) associated with the current digital
   dental model 210. The 3D coordinates associated with each of the similar digital teeth
   500a-500d can be reset as a part of the superimposing. The non superimposed
   portion can then be determined. For example, the non-superimposed portion includes
   the current dental appliance 112 (Figure 1b). The new digital dental model 520 can be
   created by removing the non-superimposed portion of the current digital dental model
   210 (Figure 2b) or by creating the new digital dental model 520 based on the
   superimposed portion without the non superimposed portion.
   [0043] Figures 6a-c illustrate a technique for creating a new digital dental model,
   according to one embodiment. An area or a subset 630 of a digital tooth 21 Ob (Figure
   2b) in the current digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b) may be beneath a portion of the
   current dental appliance 112 (Figure 1b). Examples of a portion of the current dental
   appliance are a bracket, a wire, a tube, a cleat, a button, a ligature wire, a hook, a
    band, an aligner attachment, and an O-ring. According to one embodiment, a
   corresponding area or subset 610 of a similar digital tooth 600, as described herein,
    can be used to estimate a contour of the hidden area or subset 630 of a digital tooth
    210b in the current digital dental model 210. The estimation can be used for creating a
    contour in a corresponding area of the subset 640 for a digital tooth 620b of the new
    digital dental model 620.

WO 2014/037778                                                                       PCT/IB2013/001832

   [0044] According to one embodiment, the physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) may be close
   but not at the desired teeth arrangement when the current digital dental model 210
   (Figures 2a-6c) is created. For example, the current dental appliance may have a
   feature, such as an orthodontic band 132 (Figure 1d) that prevents complete closure of
   an interproximal space between adjacent physical teeth. In another example, the
   patient may be unavailable when their teeth 100 (Figure 1a) are at the desired teeth
   arrangement, for example, due to travel plans. The current digital dental model 210
   (Figure 2b) may be created before the patient leaves on their trip so that a subsequent
   dental appliance, such as a retainer, will be available upon their return, at which time,
   the one or more of the current appliances would be removed.
   [0045] Therefore, according to one embodiment, to create a current digital dental
   model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) when the patient's physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) are close
    but not at the desired teeth arrangement, positions of one or more digital teeth in the
    new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) may be adjusted to the desired teeth
    arrangement. Information pertaining to one or more dimensions of the feature or
    descriptions of the feature can be used to determine how to adjust the positions of the
    one or more digital teeth in the new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c). For
    example, in the case of an orthodontic band 132 (Figure 1d), the width of the
    orthodontic band (either as a known dimension or a measurement derived from the
    scan) can be used to adjust the positions of the digital teeth to reflect that the
    interproximal space which had been maintained physically by the band will lessen
    when the band is removed. A subsequent dental appliance that is manufactured based
    on a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) adjusted to the desired teeth
    arrangement can be used to move the physical teeth to the desired teeth arrangement.
    An individual digital tooth's 3D coordinates can be adjusted as a part of adjusting
    positions, as discussed herein, meaning, for example, that the individually segmented
    digital teeth may be digitally repositioned within the arch.
     [0046] Figure 7 illustrates changes in a patient's gingiva, according to one
     embodiment. Figure 7 depicts one of the patient's teeth 700 and corresponding
     gingiva 710. Frequently after a current dental appliance, such as a set of braces, the
     patient's gingiva 710 can be swollen or inflamed. With time and appropriate hygiene,
     the puffiness of the patient's gingiva 710 tends to reduce, causing the gingival contours

WO 2014/037778                                                                     PCT/IB2013/001832
                                                14
   to decrease. For example, as depicted in Figure 7, the patient's gingiva 710 is at the
   baseline at tO (pre-treatment), becomes inflamed and is the most enlarged at time ti,
   and then less enlarged at time t2 as the inflammation reduces, and is near or back to
   normal at time t3.
   [0047] According to one embodiment, a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c
   6c) includes the portion of the patient's gingiva that is in proximity of the subsequent
   dental appliance or that would be covered by a subsequent dental appliance, or a
   combination thereof. According to one embodiment, a series of new digital dental
   models can be created, for example, that takes into account the changes in the
   patient's gingival contour 730. For example, a new digital dental model may be
   created that accommodates the patient's gingiva 710 at time t1, a second new digital
   dental model may be created that accommodates the patient's gingiva 710 at time t2,
   and a third new digital dental model may be created that accommodates the patient's
   gingiva 710 at time t3. Further, as depicted in Figure 7, the gingival contour 730
   increases as indicated by 720, for example, from time tO to t1. Various embodiments
    are also well-suited for swollen gingiva 710 due to a portion of a current dental
    appliance 112 (Figure 1b) being placed near the patient's gingiva.
    [0048] According to one embodiment, one or more changes in the patient's gingiva is
    simulated, as will be described in more detail in the context of Figures 17-19.
    According to another embodiment, the patient's gingival contour prior to treatment is
    used to estimate one or more changes in the patient's gingiva. For example, a digital
    dental model taken at time tO (Figure 7) of the patient's teeth and gingiva that was
    created prior to changes in the patient's gingiva or prior to application of a dental
    appliance may be used. Any type of imaging or scanning as discussed herein may be
    used for obtaining the digital dental model. Further, the current digital dental model
    may include a representation of the patient's gingiva contour when the patient's
    physical teeth are at a treatment position or at or close to the desired teeth
    arrangement. The prior digital dental model and the current digital dental model can be
     used to estimate the changes in the patient's gingival contour over time. For example,
    a linear or an exponential curve, among others, could be used to estimate the patient's
     expected gingival changes. According to one embodiment, the patient's gingival
     contour is modeled so that the subsequent dental appliance adapts well and does not
     leave any exposed edges that might irritate the tongue or surrounding soft tissue while

WO 2014/037778                                                                         PCT/IB2013/001832
                                                   15
   at the same time providing an appliance that is not too tight, which might irritate the
   tissue underneath from the pressure exerted by the appliance. According to one
   embodiment, the patient's gingiva is selectively modeled. For example assuming for
   the sake of illustration that a first portion of the patient's gingival at time t3 is swollen
   and a second portion of the patient's gingiva at time t3 has experienced recession or
   shrinkage. In this case, a first gingival modeling technique can be used on the first
   portion of the patient's gingiva and a second gingival modeling technique can be used
   on the second portion of the patient's gingiva. For example, the changes that will occur
   in the patient's gingiva after removal of the current dental appliance can be tracked
   using simulation or non-simulation embodiments on the first portion while the patient's
   pre-treatment gingival contour taken at time tO can be used for the second portion
   without or with minimal use of simulation or non-simulation embodiments.
   [0049] Figures 8a and 8b depict examples of temporary anchorage devices (TAD) 800
   attached to the patient's oral cavity, according to various embodiments. Figure 8a
    depicts TADs 800 located on the labial (or facial) side of the oral cavity 81 0a and
    Figure 8b depicts a TAD with buttons 820 bonded to teeth located on the lingual side of
    the oral cavity 810b. A temporary anchorage device 800 is an example of a current
    dental appliance that could be a part of a current digital dental model 210 (Figures 2b
    6b) and that various embodiments are well-suited for creating a new digital dental
    model that excludes the temporary anchorage device 800. Examples of portions of the
    oral cavity 810 that may be a part of a current digital dental model and a new digital
    dental model for the purposes of various embodiments is any portion of the oral cavity
    810 that a subsequent dental appliance, such as a retainer, may overlap. The alveolar
    bone under the gingiva is an example of a portion of the patient's oral cavity 810.
    Other examples of anchorage devices are a bonescrew and a plate. A TAD 800 may
    have a ball, a bracket or a hook, among other things, on the end that is exposed to the
    oral cavity for the purpose of attaching, for example, a wire, elastic, or a ligature,
     among other things.
     [0050] Various embodiments are also well-suited for changes in the gingiva that result
     from a TAD or other types of devices that cause changes to the gingiva. For example,
     a portion of a TAD will typically be embedded in the gingiva into the bone beneath,
     which can cause a portion of the gingiva to swell. Various embodiments, such as a
     simulation, not requiring a simulation, and using the patient's original gingiva contour

WO 2014/037778                                                                      PCT/IB2013/001832

   (depicted at time tO in Figure 7), as described herein, are well-suited for calculating,
   estimating, determining the changes in the patient's gingiva due to a dental appliance
   that is attached to the oral cavity.
   [0051] As discussed herein, for the sake of simplicity, many embodiments were
   described in the context of a current digital dental model 210 that is a representation
   that included a set of braces. However, as discussed herein, embodiments are well
   suited for removing a current dental appliance 122 (Figure 1b) that is suited-for use
   with a removable plastic positioning dental appliance, such as an aligner. For
   example, various embodiments are well suited for a current digital dental model that
   includes a representation of the set of physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) for the patient
   with the current dental appliance 122 attached to the physical teeth 100. According to
   one embodiment, the geometry of the current dental appliance 122 in combination with
   the geometry of the physical teeth 100, for example as represented by segmented
   digital teeth 200, can be superimposed on a current digital dental model to determine
   portions to be kept or removed as a part of creating a new digital dental model using
   various embodiments discussed herein. Further, embodiments are well suited for
   using different embodiments for different teeth. For example, if a physical tooth, which
   does not have a current dental appliance 122 attached, has been altered due to
   esthetics or removal of heavy contacts for occlusion adjustment, among other things, a
    digital tooth from the current digital dental model that corresponds to that physical tooth
    can be superimposed back onto itself. In another example, if a physical tooth has a
    current dental appliance 122 attached to it, a digital image of that physical tooth taken
    prior to application of the current dental appliance 122 can be superimposed.
    [0052] According to one embodiment, the creation of a new digital dental model 220
    620 (Figures 2c-6c) is computer automated. For example, one or more computer
    processors may be used for creating the new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c
    6c). According to one embodiment, the creation is entirely automatic without human
    intervention or without requiring human intervention. According to another
    embodiment, the creation is substantially automatic with some human intervention for
    clean up and double checking. According to one embodiment, the system is not
    merely a computer graphics system that a human uses to manually remove digital
    portions using a digital eraser or to copy digital portions of the current digital dental
    model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) as a part of creating the new digital dental model 220-620

WO 2014/037778                                                                      PCT/IB2013/001832
                                                 17
   (Figures 2c-6c). The phrase "computer automated" shall be used to refer to entirely
   automatic or substantially automatic. One example of substantially automatic is where
   a user can select a point, such as any voxel or 3D triangle, of a depicted orthodontic
   bracket of a current digital dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) and the system can detect
   the remaining portions connected to the selected region which can include, for
   example, the bracket or the bracket and the cement. In this case, the user may only
   identify and select one point for up to 32 digital teeth on a current digital dental model
   210 (Figures 2b-6b).
   [0053] According to various embodiments, a current digital dental model 210 (Figures
   2b-6b) and the new digital dental models 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) are three
   dimensional models. According to various embodiments, a new digital dental model
   220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) can be used to manufacture a subsequent dental appliance
   prior to removing the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820
   (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) from the patient's physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a).
   For example, the new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) may be used to
   manufacture a subsequent dental appliance, such as a retainer, a splint or a positioner,
   among others, as discussed herein. A new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c
   6c) can be segmented or unsegmented or partially segmented, among other things.
    [0054] According to one embodiment, a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c
   6c) does not include or does not require the inclusion of any digital roots corresponding
   to any of the patient's physical teeth 100a-100d (Figure Ia). According to one
    embodiment, a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) does not include or
    does not require the inclusion of any digital crowns. According to one embodiment, the
    current teeth arrangement of the digital teeth 21 Oa-21 Od (Figure 2b) of the current
    digital dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) is a current planned teeth arrangement that
    did not occur out of error or out of deviations but occurred due to the planned
    treatment. Therefore, according to various embodiments, neither a current digital
    dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) nor a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c
    6c) is used or is required to be used as a part of causing the patient's physical teeth
     100a-1 00d (Figure 1a) to be positioned at a teeth arrangement that preceded the
    current planned teeth arrangement associated with the current digital dental model 210
     (Figures 2b-6b).

   [0055] Figure 9 is a block diagram of a system for creating a subsequent dental
   appliance prior to removal of a current dental appliance from a set of physical teeth for
   a patient, according to one embodiment. The blocks that represent features in Figure 9
   can be arranged differently than as illustrated, and can implement additional or fewer
   features than what are described herein. Further, the features represented by the
   blocks in Figure 9 can be combined in various ways. The system 900 can be
   implemented using hardware, hardware and software, hardware and firmware, or a
   combination thereof.
   [0056] The system 900 includes a current-digital-dental-model-receiving-component
   910 and a new-digital-dental-model-creation-component 920. The new-digital-dental
   model can either be segmented, partially segmented or unsegmented. The current
   digital-dental-model-receiving-component 910 is suitable for receiving a current digital
   dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) that includes a representation of the set of physical
   teeth 100 (Figure 1a) for the patient with the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132,
   152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, if, 1g, 8a, 8b) attached to the physical teeth
    100 or oral cavity 810a, 810b (Figures 8a, 8b) where the physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a)
   are at a position in treatment when all or a part of the current dental appliance 112,
    122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 is desired to be removed from one or more of the set of
    physical teeth 100 and it is desired to use a subsequent appliance. Alternatively, the
    received current digital dental model 210 includes the representation of the set of
    physical teeth 100 for the patient with the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152,
    162, 800, 820 attached to the physical teeth 100 that are at or close to a desired teeth
    arrangement. According to one embodiment, the received current digital dental model
    210 (Figure 2b-6b) is a direct digital scan of the set of physical teeth 100 and the
    current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820.
    [0057] The new-digital-dental-model-creation-component 920 is suitable for computer
    automated creation of a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) that includes
    the representation of the set of physical teeth 100 without including the current dental
    appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) where

   [0058] The new-digital-dental-model-creation-component 920 may be further suitable
   for superimposing a segmented digital tooth 200a-200d (Figure 2a) of the patient on
   corresponding individual digital tooth 21 Oa-21 0d (Figure 2b) associated with the current
   digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b) where the segmented digital tooth 200a-200d was
   obtained from a digital dental model taken of the set of physical teeth 100 of the patient
   without the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, Ic,
    1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) attached. The new-digital-dental-model-creation-component 920
   may be further suitable for superimposing a second representation of all 300 (Figure
   3a) or a portion 300a, 300b (Figure 3a) of the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132,

    122 (Figure 1b) associated with the first representation 210, wherein the second
    representation 300, 300a, 300b (Figure 3a) of the current dental appliance is obtained
   from a source selected from a group consisting of a library of dental appliances and an
    image of the current dental appliance when not applied to the set of physical teeth.
   The new-digital-dental-model-creation-component 920 may be further suitable for
    estimating a contour 450 of a subset 440 of a digital tooth 21 Ob included in the current
    digital dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) where the estimating is based on a contour
    404 of the underneath surface 402 of a bracket base 400. The new-digital-dental
    model-creation-component 920 may be further suitable for creating a similar digital
    tooth 600 based on an average of a plurality of physical teeth and determining a
    contour of a portion 630 of the digital tooth 21 Gb of the current digital dental model 210
     (Figures 2b-6b) based on a corresponding portion 610 the similar digital tooth 600.
     [0059] According to one embodiment, the new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures
     2c-6c) is an intermediate digital dental model and the new-digital-dental-model
     creation-component 920 is further suitable for creating one of a series of intermediate
     digital dental models (also referred to herein as "a series of new digital dental models").
     The series of intermediate digital dental models may approximate a series of changes
     in gingival contour 730 (Figure 7) of the patient, as discussed herein. The changes in
     the gingival contour 730 of the patient can be determined or estimated based on a
     simulation, as discussed herein. The changes in the gingival contour 730 of the patient
     can be determined or estimated based on an original gingival contour of the patient
     without requiring simulation, as discussed herein. The changes in the gingival contour

    [0061] Figure 10 depicts a flow chart 1000 of a method of creating a subsequent
    dental appliance prior to removal of a current dental appliance from a set of physical
   teeth for a patient, according to one embodiment. A current dental appliance 112, 122,
    132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, Ic, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) is attached to a patient's set
    of physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) or oral cavity 81 Oa, 81 Ob (Figures 8a, 8b). A current
    digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b) can be created using various types of scanning or
    imaging. For example, an intraoral scan of the patient's physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a)
    or of the patient's physical teeth 100 and oral cavity 81 Oa, 81Ob (Figures 8a, 8b) with
    the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162 (Figure 1b, 1c, 1d, If, Ig)
    attached can be used to create a current digital dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b).
    According to one embodiment, the current digital dental model is a direct digital scan of
    the set of physical teeth and the current dental appliance
     [0062] At 1010, the method begins. At 1020, a current digital dental model 210
     (Figures 1b-6b) is received that includes a representation of the set of physical teeth
     100 (Figure 1a) for the patient with the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152,
     162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) attached to the physical teeth 100
     (Figure 1a) or oral cavity 81 Oa, 81 Ob (Figures 8a, 8b), where the physical teeth 100 are
     at a position in treatment when all or a part of the current dental appliance 112, 122,
     132, 152, 162, 800, 820 is desired to be removed from one or more of the set of
     physical teeth 100 and it is desired to use a subsequent appliance. According to
     another embodiment, the received current digital dental model 210 includes the
     representation of the set of physical teeth 100 for the patient with the current dental
     appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 attached to the physical teeth 100 that are
     at or close to a desired teeth arrangement.

   [0063] The current dental appliance may be any dental appliance that can be attached
   to one or more of the patient's physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) or to the patient's oral
   cavity 810, 81Ob (Figures 8a, 8b).
   [0064] At 1030, a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) that includes the
   representation of the set of physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) without including the current
   dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, Ig, 8a, 8b)
   is created based on the current digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b). Various
   embodiments can be used for creating a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c
   6c), which shall be described in the context of Figures 11-15, among others.
    [0065] Referring to Figures 2a-2c and 11, at 1120 each 200a-200d of segmented
    digital teeth 200 of the patient is superimposed on corresponding digital teeth 21 Oa
    21 Od associated with the current digital dental model 210. The segmented digital teeth
    200a-200d are derived from the set of physical teeth 100 without any dental appliance
    112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) applied to the set
    of physical teeth 100. At 1130, a non-superimposed portion of the current digital dental
    model 210 is determined based on the superimposing 1120. At 1140, the new digital
    dental model 220 is created by removing the non-superimposed portion of the current
    digital dental model 210 that was determined at 1130.
    [0066] Referring to Figures 3a-3c and 12, at 1220 a second representation 300, 300a,
    300b of all or a portion of the current dental appliance is superimposed on the current
    dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, if, ig, 8a, 8b)
    associated with the first representation 210, where the first representation 210 is the
     current digital dental model 210. At 1230, a superimposed portion of the first
     representation 210 (Figure 3b) is determined based on the superimposing at 1220.
    The new digital dental model 320 (Figure 3c) is created at 1240 by removing the
     superimposed portion, associated with 300, 300a, 300b (Figure 3a), of the first
     representation 210 that was determined at 1230.
     [0067] Referring to Figures 4a-4c and 13, at 1320, a contour 450 of a portion 440 of a
     digital tooth 210b associated with the current digital dental model 210 is estimated
     based on a contour 404 of the underneath surface 402 of a bracket base 400
     associated with the current dental appliance 112. At 1330, the current dental appliance

    112 is removed from the representation 210, for example, as described in the context
   of Figures 3a-c and 12.
   [0068] Referring to Figures 5a-5c and 14, at 1420 a second digital tooth 500b is
   superimposed onto a first digital tooth 210b of the current digital dental model 210,
   wherein the first digital tooth 210b and the second digital tooth 500b are similar. In a
   first example, the second digital tooth 500b that is superimposed on the first digital
   tooth 210b can be an average of a plurality of digital teeth that are not derived from the
    physical teeth 100 of the patient. In a second example, the first and second digital
   teeth 21 Gb, 500b may represent different physical teeth of the patient. In a third
    example, the second digital tooth 500b may represent a physical tooth of a person that
    is not the patient. The size of the second digital tooth 500b may be scaled based on
    the size of the first digital tooth 21 Ob that it is suited to superimpose. For example, the
    second digital tooth 500b may be sized to match or slightly exceed the first digital tooth
    210b's size. At 1430, the new digital dental model 520 is created by removing a non
    superimposed portion of the representation.
    [0069] Referring to Figures 6a-6c and 15, at 1520, the current dental appliance 112,
    122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures Ib, 1c, Id, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) is digitally removed
    from the representation 210. At 1530, an area 630 of a first digital tooth 210b beneath
    a virtual portion of the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820
    (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) is determined, where the first digital tooth 210b is
    associated with the current digital dental model 210 and the virtual portion is
    associated with the current dental appliance 1112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820
     (Figures Ib, 1c, Id, 1f, Ig, 8a, 8b). Examples of the virtual portion are a bracket, a
     wire, button, a cleat, a tube, a hook, a band, a ligature wire, an aligner attachment and
     an O-ring.
     [0070] The following is an example of combining various embodiments to create a new
     digital dental model. The current dental appliance 300 can be removed from the
     representation 210, as illustrated Figures 3a-3c, for example. An area 440 of a first
     digital tooth 210b beneath a virtual portion 400 of the current dental appliance 112,
     122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures Ib, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) can be determined,
     where the first digital tooth 21Gb is associated with the current digital dental model 210
     and the virtual portion 400 is associated with the current dental appliance 112, 122,

   Figures 4a-4c, for example. An area 610 of a second digital tooth 600 that is similar to
   the first digital tooth 21 Ob is received and a contour of the first digital tooth's area 630
   is reconstructed based on the second digital tooth 600's area 610, as illustrated in
   Figures 6a-6c, for example.
   [0071] The following is another example of combining various embodiments to create
   a new digital dental model. A segmented digital tooth 200a-200d of the patient can be
   superimposed on a first digital tooth 210a associated with the current digital dental
    model 210 as illustrated in Figures 2a-2c. A second representation 300, 300a, 300b of
    all or a portion of the current dental appliance can be superimposed on the current
    dental appliance associated with the current digital dental model 210 as discussed in
    the context of Figures 3a-3c. A contour of a portion of a second digital tooth 21 Ob of
    the current digital dental model 210 can be estimated based on a contour 404 of the
    underneath surface 402 of a portion 400 of the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132,
    152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) as illustrated in Figure 4b. All or
    a portion 610 of a similar digital tooth 500c, 600 can be superimposed on a third digital
    tooth 21 Oc of the current digital dental model 210 as discussed in the context of
    Figures Sa, 5b and 6a. According to one embodiment, the first digital tooth 210a, the
    second digital tooth 210b and the third digital tooth 210c correspond to different ones
    of the patient's physical teeth 100a-100c.
    [0072] Various embodiments for creating a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures
    2c-6c) are also well-suited for including the gingiva 710 (Figure 7) in a new digital
    dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) or changes to the gingiva 710, as indicated by
    720 (Figure 7), in a series of new digital dental models 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) as
     discussed herein. Various embodiments are well-suited for changes in the gingiva due
     to a TAD 800 (Figures 8a, 8b), or any other type of dental appliance that may cause
     the gingival to change, as discussed herein.
     [0073] According to one embodiment, the physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) are close but
     not at the desired teeth arrangement when the current digital dental model 210
     (Figures 2b-6b) is created. Therefore, according to one embodiment, when the current
     digital dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) is created when the patient's physical teeth
     100 are close but not at the desired teeth arrangement, positions of one or more digital

   teeth in the new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) are adjusted to the
   desired teeth arrangement. According to one embodiment, there may be an
   interproximal space between two physical teeth 100 due to a feature of the current
   dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800 (Figures 1b, 1c, Id, If, 1g, 8a, 8b), such
   as an orthodontic band 132 (Figure 1d). Information pertaining to one or more
   dimensions of the feature or descriptions of the feature can be used to determine how
   to adjust the positions of the one or more digital teeth in the new digital dental model
   220-620 (Figures 2c-6c). A subsequent dental appliance that is manufactured based
   on a new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) adjusted to the desired teeth
   arrangement can be used to move the physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) to the desired
   teeth arrangement. A digital tooth's 3D coordinates can be used as a part of adjusting
   positions, as discussed herein. According to one embodiment, the current digital
   dental model 210 (Figures 2b-6b) and the new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures
   2c-6c) include digital teeth that each correspond to one of the patient's physical teeth
   100a-100b (Figure 1a).
   [0074] At 1040, digital data suitable for use in manufacturing the subsequent dental
   appliance is provided based on electronic data included in the new digital dental model
   220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) prior to removal of the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132,
    152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, 1g, 8a, 8b) from the set of physical teeth
    100 or the oral cavity 81 0a, 81 Ob (Figures 1a, 8a, 8b). Examples of a subsequent
   dental appliance are a retainer, an (active) aligner, a splint, an expander, or a
    positioner. The retainer may be a Hawley, an Essix-type retainer, a bonded wire, a
    vacuum-formed stent, spring-retainer type, a clear splint type, or a combination thereof.
    In the event that treatment is a combination between braces and removable aligners,
    the subsequent device may be a clear removable aligner or series of aligners similar to
    a 'retainer, but designed to continue with orthodontic movement of the teeth. At least
    one example of a splint is an orthognathic surgery splint, among others. According to
    one embodiment, 1040 is optional.
    [0075] At 1050, the method ends. The receiving at 1020 and the creating at 1030 are
    performed by one or more computer processors, according to one embodiment.
    Although specific operations are disclosed in flowchart 1000, such operations are
    exemplary. That is, embodiments of the present invention are well-suited to performing
    various other operations or variations of the operations recited in flowchart 1000. It is

   appreciated that the operations in flowchart 1000 may be performed in an order
   different than presented, and that not all of the operations in flowchart 1000 may be
   performed.
   [0076] According to one embodiment, a subsequent dental appliance can be
   manufactured based on the provided digital data, such as electronic data included in
   the new digital dental model, prior to removal of all or part of the current dental
   appliance from the set of physical teeth. For example, the electronic data included in
   the new digital dental model can be used to fabricate a mold using a rapid-prototyping
   machine or milling machine and forming the subsequent dental appliance over the
   mold.
   [0077] Figure 16 depicts a digital tooth 1600 that represents one of the patient's set of
   physical teeth that may be moved from one position of treatment to another position of
   treatment, according to one embodiment. According to one embodiment, the digital
   tooth 1600 represents a segmented or partially segmented digital tooth, that has one or
    more axes and three dimensional (3D) coordinates so that the digital tooth 1600 can be
   freely positioned in 3D space. For example, the 3D coordinates x, y, and z alone or 3D
    coordinates x, y, and z in combination with one or more axes 1604, 1606, 1608 can be
    used for positioning the digital tooth 1600.
    [0078] As a frame of reference describing how a digital tooth 1600 may be moved, an
    arbitrary centerline (CL) may be drawn through the digital tooth 1600. With reference
    to this centerline (CL), a tooth 1600 may be moved in orthogonal directions
    represented by axes 1604, 1606, and 1608 (where 1604 is the centerline). The
    centerline may be rotated about the axis 1608 (root angulation) and the axis 1604
    (torque) as indicated by arrows 1610 and 1612, respectively. Additionally, the tooth
     1600 may be rotated about the centerline, as represented by an arrow 1612. Thus, all
    possible free-form motions of the tooth 1600 can be performed.
     [00791 Figures 17-19 illustrate a technique for identifying the gingival margin that
     defines the boundary between tooth and gum in the patient's dentition and simulating
     changes in the gingiva, according to one embodiment. This technique involves the
     creation of a series of horizontal 2D-planes 1780, or slices, that intersect the dentition
     model roughly perpendicular to the occlusal plane. The cross-sectional surface 1782

   of the dentition model in each of these planes 1780 includes cusps 1784, 1786 that
   represent the gingival margin. The computer identifies the gingival margin by applying
   one or more of the cusp detection techniques described above.
   [0080] One technique is very similar to the neighborhood filtered cusp detection
   technique described above, in that voxel neighbrhoods 1788, 1790 are defined on one
   of the 2D-planes to focus the computer's search for cusps on adjacent 2D plane. Upon
   detecting a pair of cusps 1784, 1786 on one 2D plane, the computer defines one or
   more neighborhoods 1788, 1790 to include predetermined number of voxels
   surrounding the pair. The computer projects the neighborhoods onto an adjacent 2D
   plane by identifying the voxels on the adjacent plane that correspond to the voxel in the
   neighborhoods 1788, 1790 on the original plane. The computer then identifies the pair
   of black voxels that lie closest together in the two neighborhoods on the adjacent
   plane, labeling these voxels as lying in the cusp. The computer repeats this process
   for all remaining planes.
   [0081] Many of these automated segmentation techniques are even more useful and
   efficient when used in conjunction with human-assisted techniques. For example,
   techniques that rely on the identification of the interproximal or gingival margins
   function more quickly and effectively when a human user first highlights the
   interproximal or gingival cusps in a graphical representation of the dentition model.
   One technique for receiving this type of information from the user is by displaying a 2D
    or 3D representation and allowing the user to highlight individual voxels in the display.
   Another technique allows the user to scroll through a series of 2D cross-sectional
    slices, identifying those voxels that represent key features such as interproximal or
    gingival cusps. Some of these techniques rely on user interface tools such as cursors
    and bounding-box markers.
    [0082] In many instances, the computer creates proposals for segmenting the dentition
    model and then allows the user to select the best alternative. For example, one
    version of the arch curve fitting technique requires the computer to create a candidate
    catenary or spline curve, which the user allowed to modify by manipulating the
    mathematical control parameters. One technique involves displaying several surfaces
    that are candidates cutting surfaces and allowing the user to select the appropriate
    surfaces.

   [0083] According to one embodiment, a tangible computer readable storage medium
   having computer-executable instructions stored thereon for causing a computer system
   to perform a method of creating a subsequent dental appliance prior to removal of a
   current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 1f, Ig, 8b)
   from a set of physical teeth 100 (Figure Ia) for a patient is provided. According to one
   embodiment, the tangible computer readable storage medium provides for receiving
   1020 a current digital dental model 210 (Figure 2b-6b) that includes a representation of
   the set of physical teeth 100 (Figure 1a) for the patient with the current dental
   appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, ic, Id, 1f, ig, 8a, 8b)
   attached to the physical teeth 100 or oral cavity 81 0a, 81 Ob (Figures 8a, 8b), where the
   current digital dental model 210 is a direct digital scan of the set of physical teeth 100
   and the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 and wherein the
   physical teeth 100 are at a position in treatment when all or a part of the current dental
   appliance 112, 122, 132, 152, 162, 800, 820 is desired to be removed from one or
   more of the set of physical teeth 100 and it is desired to use a subsequent appliance.
   [0084] According to one embodiment, the creating 1030 (Figure 10) is computer
   automated. According to one embodiment, the new digital dental model 220-620
   (Figures 2c-6c) includes electronic data suitable for manufacturing of the subsequent
   dental appliance prior to removal of the current dental appliance 112, 122, 132, 152,
    162, 800, 820 (Figures 1b, 1c, Id, if, Ig, 8a, 8b) from the set of physical teeth 100
    (Figure 1a) or oral cavity 810a, 810b (Figures 8a, 8b).
    [0085] A new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c), according to various
    embodiments, provides for more quickly, more cheaply making subsequent dental
    appliances that fit the patient's physical teeth and gingiva better. A new digital dental
    model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c), according to various embodiments, provides for
    increased patient compliance (due to improved appliance comfort when worn, for
    example) and reduced chance of relapse as a result. A new digital dental model 220
    620 (Figures 2c-6c), according to various embodiments, significantly reduces the
    chance of relapse because the subsequent digital appliance is made from the new
    digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) while the current dental appliance is still
    attached to the patient's physical teeth. Further, the subsequent digital appliance can
     be applied immediately upon removal of the current dental appliance. Further, a new

WO 2014/037778                                                                    PCT/IB2013/001832
                                               28
   digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c) can be created without using physical
   impressions or without requiring the use of physical impressions and associated
   processes such as blocking out the teeth with wax, for example, prior to taking the
   impression. A new digital dental model 220-620 (Figures 2c-6c), according to various
   embodiments, reduces the number of patient appointments and/or additional
   appliances needed, or a combination thereof in comparison to methods involving
   physical impressions, since the appliance removal and subsequent appliance delivery
   can be combined into one appointment. Furthermore, a new digital dental model 220
   620 (Figures 2c-6c) is not subject to the distortions that can occur while making a
   manual impression, so the risk of remaking the appliance and the additional time and
   effort associated due to poor subsequent appliance fit is reduced. The teeth are less
   likely to undergo a period of time without orthodontic restraint, as would be the case if
   the braces were removed and a period of time allowed to lapse before the retainer is
   delivered. A transitional dental appliance to prevent movement during this interim
   period becomes no longer needed, since the doctor can smoothly transition between
   braces and the subsequent dental appliance.

   subject matter has been described in a language specific to structural features and/or
   methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the
