   [0003]      The present disclosure relates generally to computer user interfaces, and more
   specifically to manipulating user interface objects using a rotatable input mechanism.
                                               BACKGROUND
30 [0004]      Advanced personal electronic devices can have small form factors. Use of such
   personal electronic devices involves manipulation of user interface objects on display screens
   which also have small form factors that complement the design of the personal electronic
   devices.

       WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
   [0005]      Exemplary manipulations that users can perform on personal electronic devices
   include navigating a hierarchy, selecting a user interface object, adjusting the position, zoom,
   and rotation of user interface objects, or otherwise manipulating user interface objects.
   Exemplary user interface objects include documents, digital images, video, text, icons, and
 5 maps.
                                           BRIEF SUMMARY
   [0006]      Some techniques for manipulating user interface objects using reduced-size touch
   sensitive displays, however, are generally cumbersome and inefficient. For example, it may
   be difficult for the user to precisely scroll a document object to a scroll position within a
 0 range of potential scroll positions that properly aligns the desired content with the viewable
   display. For another example, it may be difficult for the user to precisely change the
   magnification of an image object to a desired zoom size within a range of potential zoom
   size. For another example, it may be difficult to for the user select a particular user interface
   object. Existing techniques require more time than necessary when the user attempts to
 5 perform tasks, wasting user time and device energy. This latter consideration is particularly
   important in battery-operated devices. Thus, existing methods for manipulating user
   interface objects on reduced-size touch-sensitive displays can be inefficient and provide less
   precision than is preferable.
   [0007]      Accordingly, there is a need for electronic devices with faster, more efficient, and
 0 more precise methods and interfaces for manipulating user interface objects. Such methods
   and interfaces optionally complement or replace conventional methods for manipulating user
   interface objects. Such methods and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and
   produce a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices,
   such methods and interfaces conserve power and increase the time between battery charges.
25 [0008]      The above deficiencies and other problems associated with user interfaces for
   computing devices for manipulating user interface objects are reduced or eliminated by the
   disclosed devices. In some embodiments, the device is a desktop computer. In some
   embodiments, the device is portable (e.g., a notebook computer, tablet computer, or handheld
   device). In some embodiments, the device has a touchpad. In some embodiments, the device
30 is user-wearable. In some embodiments, the device has a touch-sensitive display (also known
   as a "touch screen" or "touch screen display"). In some embodiments, the device has a
   display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the device has a rotatable input
   mechanism. In some embodiments, the device has a graphical user interface (GUI), one or
   more processors, memory and one or more modules, programs or sets of instructions stored in
                                                     2

   1001980116
   the memory for performing multiple functions. In some embodiments, the user interacts with the
   GUI primarily through rotation of the rotatable input mechanism and gestures on the touch
   sensitive surface. Executable instructions for performing these functions may be included in a
   computer readable storage medium or other computer program product configured for execution
 5 by one or more processors.

    scope of the present disclosure but is instead provided as a description of exemplary
    embodiments.
    [0049]      There is a need for electronic devices that provide efficient and precise access to
    manipulate user interface objects. For example, ease of use for scrolling a document,
  5 zooming an image, rotating an image, and selecting an option from among a plurality of
    options contribute to the efficiency of manipulating user interface objects. Such techniques
    can reduce the cognitive burden on a user who manipulates user interface objects, thereby
    enhancing productivity. Further, such techniques can reduce processor and battery power
    otherwise wasted on redundant user inputs.
  0 [0050]      Below, FIGS. 1A-IB, 2, 3, 4A-4B, and 5A-5D provide a description of exemplary

    various elements, these elements should not be limited by the terms. These terms are only
    used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first touch could be termed a
    second touch, and, similarly, a second touch could be termed a first touch, without departing
 '0 from the scope of the various described embodiments. The first touch and the second touch
    are both touches, but they are not the same touch.
    [0052]      The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments
    herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be
    limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended
25  claims, the singular forms "a", "an," and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as
    well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term
    "and/or" as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one
    or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms "includes,"
    "including," "comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the
30  presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do
    not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps,
    operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
    [0053]      The term "if' may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in response to
    determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase

    an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo management
    application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing
25  application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player application.
    [0057]        The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least one
    common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more
    functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on the
    device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
30  respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch
    sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user
    interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
    [0058]        Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
    sensitive displays. FIG. 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device 100
                                                       9

       WO 2015/034969                                                            PCT/US2014/053961
    with touch-sensitive displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive
    display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is sometimes known
    as or called a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 includes memory 102 (which
    optionally includes one or more computer readable storage mediums), memory controller
  5  122, one or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF circuitry 108,
    audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0) subsystem 106, other
    input or control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100 optionally includes one or
    more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or more intensity sensors 165
    for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface such as
  0 touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100 optionally includes one or
    more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on device 100 (e.g.,
    generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system
     112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These components optionally
    communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines 103.
  5 [0059]       As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a
    touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a
    finger contact) on the touch sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of values
    that includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of distinct
    values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured)
 '0 using various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one
    or more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally,
    used to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some
    implementations, force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a
    weighted average) to determine an estimated force of a contact. Using the intensity of a
25  contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user access to additional device functionality
    that may otherwise not be accessible by the user on a reduced-size device with limited real
    estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch-sensitive display) and/or receiving user
    input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch-sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical
    control such as a knob or a button).
30  [0060]       As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to physical
    displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement
    of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component
    (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of
    the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in
                                                     10

        WO 2015/034969                                                             PCT/US2014/053961
    situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a
    user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile
    output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile
    sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the
  5 component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch
    sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up
    click" of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as
    an "down click" or "up click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button
    associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the
  0 user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is,
    optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface,
    even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
    interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of
    the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of
  5 users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory
    perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"), unless otherwise
    stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a
    component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or
    average) user.
 '0 [0061]       It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
    multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer components than
    shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different
    configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components shown in FIG. 1A
    are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software,
25  including one or more signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits.
    [0062]       Memory 102 may include one or more computer readable storage mediums. The
    computer readable storage mediums may be tangible and non-transitory. Memory 102 may
    include high-speed random access memory and may also include non-volatile memory, such
    as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile
30  solid-state memory devices. Memory controller 122 may control access to memory 102 by
    other components of device 100.
    [0063]       Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of the
    device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute various
    software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform various
                                                       11

    functions for device 100 and to process data. In some embodiments, peripherals interface
     118, CPU 120, and memory controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip, such as
    chip 104. In some other embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
    [0064]      RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
  5 electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
    signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices
    via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally includes well-known circuitry
    for performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF
    transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal
  0 processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth.
    RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates with networks, such as the Internet, also referred
    to as the World Wide Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular
    telephone network, a wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network
    (MAN), and other devices by wireless communication. The wireless communication
  5 optionally uses any of a plurality of communications standards, protocols and technologies,
    including but not limited to Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced
    Data GSM Environment (EDGE), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed
    uplink packet access (HSUPA), Evolution, Data-Only (EV-DO), HSPA, HSPA+, Dual-Cell

30  [0065]      Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio interface
    between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from peripherals
    interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the electrical
    signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible sound
    waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone 113
                                                    12

    from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and
    transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio data may be
    retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals
    interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g.,
  5 212, FIG. 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry 110 and
    removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a headset with
    both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a microphone).
    [0066]       I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as touch
    screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. 1/0 subsystem
  0  106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158, intensity sensor
    controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161 and one or more input controllers 160 for other
    input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical
    signals from/to other input or control devices 116. The other input control devices 116
    optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider
  5 switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input
    controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard,
    infrared port, USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons (e.g.,
    208, FIG. 2) optionally include an up/down button for volume control of speaker 111 and/or
    microphone 113. The one or more buttons optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, FIG.
 '0 2).
    [0067]       A quick press of the push button may disengage a lock of touch screen 112 or
    begin a process that uses gestures on the touch screen to unlock the device, as described in
    U.S. Patent Application 11/322,549, "Unlocking a Device by Performing Gestures on an
    Unlock Image," filed December 23, 2005, U.S. Pat. No. 7,657,849, which is hereby
25  incorporated by reference in its entirety. A longer press of the push button (e.g., 206) may
    turn power to device 100 on or off. The user may be able to customize a functionality of one
    or more of the buttons. Touch screen 112 is used to implement virtual or soft buttons and one
    or more soft keyboards.
    [0068]       Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output interface
30  between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals
    from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual
    output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively
    termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output may correspond
    to user-interface objects.

    [0069]      Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors that
    accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and
    display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
    memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen
  5  112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or
    more soft keys, icons, web-pages or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
    exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
    corresponds to a finger of the user.
    [0070]      Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD (light
  0 emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology, although
    other display technologies may be used in other embodiments. Touch screen 112 and display
    controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using any of a
    plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but not
    limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as
  5 other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact
    with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing
    technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@ and iPod Touch@ from Apple Inc. of
    Cupertino, California.
    [0071]      A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be
 '0 analogous to the multi-touch sensitive touchpads described in the following U.S. Patents:
    6,323,846 (Westerman et al.), 6,570,557 (Westerman et al.), and/or 6,677,932 (Westerman),
    and/or U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0015024A1, each of which is hereby incorporated by
    reference in its entirety. However, touch screen 112 displays visual output from device 100,
    whereas touch sensitive touchpads do not provide visual output.
25  [0072]      A touch-sensitive display in some embodiments of touch screen 112 may be as

    [0073]       Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
    embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user
    may make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a
    stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work
  0 primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based
    input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments,
    the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or
    command for performing the actions desired by the user.
    [0074]       In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include a
  5 touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some
    embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
    screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is
    separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the
    touch screen.
 '0 [0075]       Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various components.
    Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more power sources
    (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure detection circuit,
    a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting diode (LED))
    and any other components associated with the generation, management and distribution of
25  power in portable devices.

    Optical sensor 164 may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide
    semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164 receives light from the
30  environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the light to data representing
    an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a camera module), optical
    sensor 164 may capture still images or video. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is
    located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on the front of the
    device, so that the touch screen display may be used as a viewfinder for still and/or video

    image acquisition. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the front of the
    device so that the user's image may be obtained for videoconferencing while the user views
    the other video conference participants on the touch screen display. In some embodiments,
    the position of optical sensor 164 can be changed by the user (e.g., by rotating the lens and
  5 the sensor in the device housing) so that a single optical sensor 164 may be used along with
    the touch screen display for both video conferencing and still and/or video image acquisition.
    [0077]      Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165.
    FIG. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159 in 1/0
    subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more piezoresistive
  0 strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric force sensors,
    optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g.,
    sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch-sensitive surface).
    Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information
    or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least
  5 one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface
    (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact
    intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 which
    is located on the front of device 100.
    [0078]      Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166. FIGS. 1A and
 '0  lB show proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, proximity
    sensor 166 may be coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. Proximity sensor
     166 may perform as described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 11/241,839, "Proximity

    WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
  5 components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
    management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
    between various hardware and software components.
    [0083]      Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices over
    one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for handling
  0 data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g., Universal
    Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or
    indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the
    external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or
    compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod @ (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
  5 [0084]      Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112 (in
    conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or
    physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components for
    performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact
    has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact
 '0 determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch
    sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the
    contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion
    module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement
    of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes
25  determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a
    change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are,
    optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous
    contacts (e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion
    module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
30  [0085]      In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more
    intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to
    determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments at least a subset of
    the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the
    intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical
                                                     18

    actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device 100). For
    example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of
    a large range of predefined thresholds values without changing the trackpad or touch screen
    display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations a user of the device is provided
  5 with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by
    adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds
    at once with a system-level click "intensity" parameter).
    [0086]      Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different
    gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions,
  0 timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by
    detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes
    detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event at the same
    position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of
    an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
  5 includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging
    events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event.
    [0087]      Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for rendering
    and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including components for
    changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast or other visual
 '0 property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term "graphics" includes any
    object that can be displayed to a user, including without limitation text, web pages, icons
    (such as user-interface objects including soft keys), digital images, videos, animations and the
    like.
    [0088]      In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics to
25  be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code. Graphics module 132
    receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along
    with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic property data, and then generates screen
    image data to output to display controller 156.
    [0089]      Haptic feedback module 133 includes various software components for generating
30  instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile outputs at one or more
    locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with device 100.
    [0090]      Text input module 134, which may be a component of graphics module 132,
    provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts 137, e-mail
     140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).

    of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons, dials, and
    the like) on device 100 may be reduced.

    [00113]      The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a touch
    screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In some
    embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home,
    or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In such embodiments, a
  5 "menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other embodiments, the menu
    button is a physical push button or other physical input control device instead of a touchpad.
    [00114]      FIG. lB is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event handling
    in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (in FIG. 1A) or
    370 (FIG. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a respective
  0 application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155, 380-390).
    [00115]      Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application 136-1
    and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event information.
    Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174. In some
    embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which indicates the
  5 current application view(s) displayed on touch sensitive display 112 when the application is
    active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is used by event
    sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently active, and application internal
    state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191 to which to deliver
    event information.
 '0 [00116]      In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
    information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
    resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed
    or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go
    back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions
25  taken by the user.
    [00117]      Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
    Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
    sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits
    information it receives from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
30  accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information that
    peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from touch
    sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
    [00118]      In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
    interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
                                                    25

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event
    information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
    predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
    [00119]      In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination
  5 module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
    [00120]      Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for determining
    where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch sensitive display
     112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a
    user can see on the display.
  0 [00121]      Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
    views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
    information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
    respective application) in which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels
    within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest level
  5 view in which a touch is detected may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are
    recognized as proper inputs may be determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the
    initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
    [00122]      Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events of a
    touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit
 '0 view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy
    which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level
    view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (i.e., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub
    events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view
    determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch
25  or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
    [00123]      Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
    views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
    embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
    view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments, active event
30  recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical
    location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively
    involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other embodiments,
    even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular
    view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
                                                    26

        WO 2015/034969                                                        PCT/US2014/053961
    [00124]     Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
    recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
    determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
    event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In some
  5 embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
    which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module 182.
    [00125]     In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
    Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments, event
    sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such
  0 as contact/motion module 130.
    [00126]     In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
     190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
    touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
    application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
  5 Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In
    other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such
    as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1
    inherits methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190
    includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event
 '0 data 179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater
     176, object updater 177 or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192.
    Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 includes one or more respective event
    handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater
     177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
25  [00127]     A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
     179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information. Event
    recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
    embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event
    delivery instructions 188 (which may include sub-event delivery instructions).
30  [00128]     Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The event
    information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
    movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
    information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
    touch the event information may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some
                                                    27

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g.,
    from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event
    information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called
    device attitude) of the device.
  5 [00129]      Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or sub
    event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
    determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
    comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
    events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187
  0 2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event (187) include, for example,
    touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one
    example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
    tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
    predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
  5 (touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch
    end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
    dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on
    the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
    sensitive display 112, and lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
 '0 also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
    [00130]      In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event for a
    respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs a hit
    test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in
    an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive
25  display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event comparator 184
    performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with
    the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler
     190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler 190
    should be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event handler associated
30  with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
    [00131]      In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event (187) also includes
    delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
    whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's
    event type.
                                                    28

        WO 2015/034969                                                         PCT/US2014/053961
    [00132]      When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub-events
    do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event recognizer 180
    enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards
    subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers,
  5 if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub-events of an
    ongoing touch-based gesture.
    [00133]      In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata 183
    with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system
    should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
  0 embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
    how event recognizers may interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some
    embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
    whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
    [00134]      In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event handler
  5  190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
    recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
    information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
    is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
    embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
 '0 event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
    [00135]      In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event delivery
    instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event
    handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
    handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
25  handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
    event information and perform a predetermined process.
    [00136]      In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
    application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
    contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
30  embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For
    example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
    user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
    prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
    sensitive display.

   [00137]       In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data updater
    176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater 176,
   object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective
   application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are included in two or
 5 more software modules.
   [00138]       It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling of
   user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to operate
   multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all of which are initiated on touch screens.
   For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single
 0 or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on
   touch-pads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye
   movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs
   corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
   [00139]       FIG. 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen 112 in
 5 accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more
   graphics within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described
   below, a user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the
   graphics, for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one
   or more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of
 0 one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
   some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
   (from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a finger (from
   right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with device 100.
   In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select
25 the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon optionally
   does not select the corresponding application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a
   tap.
   [00140]       Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or
   menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
30 application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively, in
   some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on
   touch screen 112.
   [00141]       In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204, push
   button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
                                                     30

    button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210, head set jack 212, and
    docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn the power
    on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for
    a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the
  5 button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate
    an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal input for
    activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100 also,
    optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
    contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating
  0 tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
    [00142]      FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a display and
    a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300 need not be
    portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a
    tablet computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational device (such
  5 as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial
    controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 310, one or
    more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more
    communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320
    optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls
 '0 communications between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0)
    interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. 1/0 interface
    330 also optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and
    touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g.,
    similar to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to FIG. 1A), sensors
25  359 (e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors
    similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to FIG. 1A).
    Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR
    RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non
    volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
30  devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 370
    optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310. In some
    embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous to the
    programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction
    device 100 (FIG. 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores

    additional programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable
    multifunction device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing
    module 380, presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module
    386, disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
  5 portable multifunction device 100 (FIG. 1A) optionally does not store these modules.
    [00143]     Each of the above identified elements in FIG. 3 may be stored in one or more of
    the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified modules
    corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above
    identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
  0 separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these
    modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some
    embodiments, memory 370 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
    above. Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional modules and data structures not
    described above.
  5 [00144]     Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") that may
    be implemented on portable multifunction device 100.

    [00146]     It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in FIG. 4A are merely exemplary.
    For example, icons 422 for video and music player module 152 are labeled "Music" or
    "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application icons. In some
 '0 embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an application
    corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label for a
    particular application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to the
    particular application icon.
    [00147]     FIG. 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300, FIG.
25  3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, FIG. 3) that is separate
    from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also, optionally, includes
    one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357) for detecting intensity
    of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile output generators 359
    for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
30  [00148]     Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to
    inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch sensitive surface and the display are
    combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that
    is separate from the display, as shown in FIG. 4B. In some embodiments the touch sensitive
    surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in FIG. 4B) that corresponds to a
                                                     33

        WO 2015/034969                                                            PCT/US2014/053961
    primary axis (e.g., 453 in FIG. 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these
    embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in FIG. 4B) with the touch
    sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g.,
    in FIG. 4B, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs
  5 (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch
    sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in FIG. 4B) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface
    on the display (e.g., 450 in FIG. 4B) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive
    surface is separate from the display. It should be understood that similar methods are,
    optionally, used for other user interfaces described herein.
  0 [00149]      Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with reference to
    finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it should be
    understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are replaced with
    input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input). For example, a
    swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed
  5 by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the
    contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while
    the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the
    contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple user inputs are
    simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple computer mice are, optionally,
 '0 used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are, optionally, used simultaneously.
    [00150]      FIG. 5A illustrates exemplary personal electronic device 500. Device 500
    includes body 502. In some embodiments, device 500 has touch-sensitive display screen 504.
    Alternatively, or in addition to touchscreen 504, device 500 has a display and a touch
    sensitive surface. In some embodiments, touchscreen 504 (or the touch-sensitive surface)
25  may have one or more intensity sensors for detecting intensity of contacts (e.g. touches) being
    applied. The one or more intensity sensors of touchscreen 504 (or the touch-sensitive
    surface) can provide output data that represents the intensity of touches. The user interface of
    device 500 can respond to touches based on their intensity, meaning that touches of different
    intensities can invoke different user interface operations on device 500.
30  [00151]      In some embodiments, regardless of whether touchscreen 504 (or the touch
    sensitive surface) has the above-described intensity sensors, device 500 can optionally
    communicate with a stylus having a pressure-sensitive tip that detects and provides data
    regarding the intensity of the stylus's touch on device 500, particularly touchscreen 504.

    [00153]     In some embodiments, device 500 has one or more input mechanisms 506 and
    508. Input mechanisms 506 and 508, if included, can be physical. Examples of physical
  0 input mechanisms include push buttons and rotatable mechanisms. In some embodiments,
    device 500 has one or more attachment mechanisms. Such attachment mechanisms, if
    included, can permit attachment of device 500 with, for example, hats, eyewear, earrings,
    necklaces, shirts, jackets, bracelets, watch straps, chains, trousers, belts, shoes, purses,
    backpacks, and so forth. These attachment mechanisms may permit device 500 to be worn
  5 by a user.
    [00154]     FIG. 5B depicts exemplary personal electronic device 500. Device 500 has bus
    512 that operatively couples 1/0 section 514 with one or more computer processors 516 and
    memory 518. 1/0 section 514 can be connected to display 504, which can have touch
    sensitive component 522 and, optionally, touch-intensity sensitive component 524. In
 '0 addition, 1/0 section 514 can be connected with communication unit 530 for receiving
    application and operating system data, using Wi-Fi, BluetoothTM, near field communication
    ("NFC"), cellular and/or other wireless communication techniques. Device 500 can include
    input mechanisms 506 and/or 508. Input mechanism 506 may be a rotatable input device, for
    example. Input mechanism 508 may be a button, in some examples.
25  [00155]     Input mechanism 508 may be a microphone, in some examples. Computing
    device 500 can include various sensors, such as GPS sensor 532, accelerometer 534,
    directional sensor 540 (e.g., compass), gyroscope 536, motion sensor 538, and/or a
    combination thereof, all of which can be operatively connected to 1/0 section 514.
    [00156]     Memory 518 of computing device 500 can be a non-transitory computer readable
30  storage medium, for storing computer-executable instructions, which, when executed by one
    or more computer processors 516, for example, can cause the computer processors to perform
    the techniques described above, including the processes of FIGS. 7, 9A, 9B, 11, 13K, 22, 31,
    39, and 46. The computer-executable instructions can also be stored and/or transported

    an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system,
    processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the
    instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. For purposes
    of this document, a "non-transitory computer readable storage medium" can be any medium
  5 that can tangibly contain or store computer-executable instructions for use by or in
    connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The non-transitory
    computer readable storage medium can include, but is not limited to, magnetic, optical,
    and/or semiconductor storages. Examples of such storage include magnetic disks, optical
    discs based on CD, DVD, or Blu-ray technologies, as well as persistent solid-state memory
  0 such as flash, solid-state drives, and the like. Computing device 500 is not limited to the
    components and configuration of FIG. 5B, but can include other or additional components in
    multiple configurations.
    [00157]     FIG. 5C illustrates exemplary personal electronic device 550. In the illustrated
    example, device 550 is a watch that generally includes body 552 and strap 554 for affixing
  5 device 550 to the body of a user. That is, device 550 is wearable. Body 552 can designed to
    couple with straps 554. Device 550 can have touch-sensitive display screen (hereafter
    touchscreen) 556 and crown 558. Device 550 can also have buttons 560, 562, and 564.
    [00158]     Conventionally, the term 'crown,' in the context of a watch, refers to the cap atop
    a stem for winding the watch. In the context of a personal electronic device, the crown can
 '0 be a physical component of the electronic device, rather than a virtual crown on a touch
    sensitive display. Crown 558 can be mechanical, meaning that it can be connected to a
    sensor for converting physical movement of the crown into electrical signals. Crown 558 can
    rotate in two directions of rotation (e.g., forward and backward). Crown 558 can also be
    pushed in towards the body of device 550 and/or be pulled away from device 550. Crown
25  558 can be touch-sensitive, for example, using capacitive touch technologies that can detect
    whether a user is touching the crown. Moreover, crown 558 can further be rocked in one or
    more directions or translated along a track along an edge or at least partially around a
    perimeter of body 552. In some examples, more than one crown 558 can be used. The visual
    appearance of crown 558 can, but need not, resemble crowns of conventional watches.
30  Buttons 560, 562, and 564, if included, can each be a physical or a touch-sensitive button.
    That is, the buttons may be, for example, physical buttons or capacitive buttons. Further,
    body 552, which can include a bezel, may have predetermined regions on the bezel that act as
    buttons.

       WO 2015/034969                                                            PCT/US2014/053961
   [00159]      Display 556 can include a display device, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD),
   light-emitting diode (LED) display, organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, or the like,
   positioned partially or fully behind or in front of a touch sensor panel implemented using any
   desired touch sensing technology, such as mutual-capacitance touch sensing, self-capacitance
 5 touch sensing, resistive touch sensing, projection scan touch sensing, or the like. Display 556
   can allow a user to perform various functions by touching over hovering near the touch
   sensor panel using one or more fingers or other object.
   [00160]      In some examples, device 550 can further include one or more pressure sensors
   (not shown) for detecting a force or pressure applied to the display. The force or pressure
 0 applied to display 556 can be used as an input to device 550 to perform any desired operation,
   such as making a selection, entering or exiting a menu, causing the display of additional
   options/actions, or the like. In some examples, different operations can be performed based
   on the amount of force or pressure being applied to display 556. The one or more pressure
   sensors can further be used to determine a position that the force is being applied to display
 5 556.
   [00161]      FIG. 5D illustrates a block diagram of some of the components of device 550. As
   shown, crown 558 can be coupled to encoder 572, which can be configured to monitor a
   physical state or change of state of crown 558 (e.g., the position of the crown), convert it to
   an electrical signal (e.g., convert it to an analog or digital signal representation of the position
 0 or change in position of crown 558), and provide the signal to processor 570. For instance, in
   some examples, encoder 572 can be configured to sense the absolute rotational position (e.g.,
   an angle between 0-360') of crown 558 and output an analog or digital representation of this
   position to processor 570. Alternatively, in other examples, encoder 572 can be configured to
   sense a change in rotational position (e.g., a change in rotational angle) of crown 558 over
25 some sampling period and to output an analog or digital representation of the sensed change
   to processor 570. In these examples, the crown position information can further indicate a
   direction of rotation of the crown (e.g., a positive value can correspond to one direction and a
   negative value can correspond to the other). In yet other examples, encoder 572 can be
   configured to detect a rotation of crown 558 in any desired manner (e.g., velocity,
30 acceleration, or the like) and can provide the crown rotational information to processor 570.
   In alternative examples, instead of providing information to processor 570, this information
   can be provided to other components of device 550. While the examples described herein
   refer to the use of rotational position of crown 558 to control scrolling, scaling, or an objects
   position, it should be appreciated that any other physical state of crown 558 can be used.

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    [00162]     In some examples, the physical state of the crown can control physical attributes
    of display 556. For example, if crown 558 is in a particular position (e.g., rotated forward),
    display 556 can have limited z-axis traversal ability. In other words, the physical state of the
    crown can represent physical modal functionality of display 556. In some examples, a
  5 temporal attribute of the physical state of crown 558 can be used as an input to device 550.
    For example, a fast change in physical state can be interpreted differently than a slow change
    in physical state.
    [00163]     Processor 570 can be further coupled to receive input signals from buttons 560,
    562, and 564, along with touch signals from touch-sensitive display 556. The buttons may
  0 be, for example, physical buttons or capacitive buttons. Further, body 552, which can include
    a bezel, may have predetermined regions on the bezel that act as buttons. Processor 570 can
    be configured to interpret these input signals and output appropriate display signals to cause
    an image to be produced by touch-sensitive display 556. While a single processor 570 is
    shown, it should be appreciated that any number of processors or other computational devices
  5 can be used to perform the general functions discussed above.
    [00164]     As used here, the term "affordance" refers to a user-interactive graphical user
    interface object that may be displayed on the display screen of device 100, 300, and/or 500
    (FIGS. 1, 3, and 5). For example, an image (e.g., icon), a button, and text (e.g., hyperlink)
    may each constitute an affordance.
 '0 [00165]     As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that indicates
    a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some implementations
    that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus selector," so that
    when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad 355
    in FIG. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in FIG. 4B) while the cursor is over a particular user
25  interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element), the
    particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some
    implementations that include a touch-screen display (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112
    in FIG. 1A or touch screen 112 in FIG. 4A) that enables direct interaction with user interface
    elements on the touch-screen display, a detected contact on the touch-screen acts as a "focus
30  selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the touch
    screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window,
    slider or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in
    accordance with the detected input. In some implementations focus is moved from one
    region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without corresponding
                                                     38

         WO 2015/034969                                                            PCT/US2014/053961
    movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch-screen display (e.g., by using a
    tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in these
    implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus between
    different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus
  5 selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch
    screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended
    interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user
    interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus
    selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact or a selection box) over a respective button while a press
  0 input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate
    that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
    elements shown on a display of the device).
    [00166]       As used in the specification and claims, the term "characteristic intensity" of a
    contact refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact.
  5 In some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The
    characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a
    set of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
     1, 2, 5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to
    detecting liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact,
 '0 prior to detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of the
    contact, and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A
    characteristic intensity of a contact is, optionally based on one or more of: a maximum value
    of the intensities of the contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average
    value of the intensities of the contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the
25  contact, a value at the half maximum of the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90 percent
    maximum of the intensities of the contact, or the like. In some embodiments, the duration of
    the contact is used in determining the characteristic intensity (e.g., when the characteristic
    intensity is an average of the intensity of the contact over time). In some embodiments, the
    characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one or more intensity thresholds to determine
30  whether an operation has been performed by a user. For example, the set of one or more
    intensity thresholds may include a first intensity threshold and a second intensity threshold.
    In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that does not exceed the first
    threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the
    first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity threshold results in a second
                                                      39

    operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the third threshold results
    in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between the characteristic intensity
    and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to perform one or more
    operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective option or forgo performing the respective
  5 operation) rather than being used to determine whether to perform a first operation or a
    second operation.
    [00167]      In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of
    determining a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface may receive a
    continuous swipe contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at
  0 which point the intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity
    of the contact at the end location may be based on only a portion of the continuous swipe
    contact, and not the entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end
    location). In some embodiments, a smoothing algorithm may be applied to the intensities of
    the swipe contact prior to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For
  5 example, the smoothing algorithm optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding
    average smoothing algorithm, a triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing
    algorithm, and/or an exponential smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these
    smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact
    for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity.
 '0 [00168]      The intensity of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface may be characterized
    relative to one or more intensity thresholds, such as a contact-detection intensity threshold, a
    light press intensity threshold, a deep press intensity threshold, and/or one or more other
    intensity thresholds. In some embodiments, the light press intensity threshold corresponds to
    an intensity at which the device will perform operations typically associated with clicking a
25  button of a physical mouse or a trackpad. In some embodiments, the deep press intensity
    threshold corresponds to an intensity at which the device will perform operations that are
    different from operations typically associated with clicking a button of a physical mouse or a
    trackpad. In some embodiments, when a contact is detected with a characteristic intensity
    below the light press intensity threshold (e.g., and above a nominal contact-detection
30  intensity threshold below which the contact is no longer detected), the device will move a
    focus selector in accordance with movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface
    without performing an operation associated with the light press intensity threshold or the
    deep press intensity threshold. Generally, unless otherwise stated, these intensity thresholds
    are consistent between different sets of user interface figures.

    [00169]      An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the
    light press intensity threshold to an intensity between the light press intensity threshold and
    the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as a "light press" input. An
    increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from an intensity below the deep press
  5 intensity threshold to an intensity above the deep press intensity threshold is sometimes
    referred to as a "deep press" input. An increase of characteristic intensity of the contact from
    an intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold to an intensity between the
    contact-detection intensity threshold and the light press intensity threshold is sometimes
    referred to as detecting the contact on the touch-surface. A decrease of characteristic
  0 intensity of the contact from an intensity above the contact-detection intensity threshold to an
    intensity below the contact-detection intensity threshold is sometimes referred to as detecting
    liftoff of the contact from the touch-surface. In some embodiments the contact-detection
    intensity threshold is zero. In some embodiments the contact-detection intensity threshold is
    greater than zero.
  5 [00170]      In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are performed in
    response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in response to
    detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a plurality of
    contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on detecting an
    increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press-input intensity
 '0 threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in response to
    detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity
    threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of the respective press input). In some embodiments, the
    press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input
    intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
25  intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
    subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the press-input threshold
    (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
    [00171]      In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid accidental
    inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a hysteresis intensity
30  threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity threshold (e.g., the
    hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press-input intensity
    threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90% or some reasonable proportion of
    the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some embodiments, the press input includes an
    increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press-input intensity threshold and a
                                                     41

        WO 2015/034969                                                            PCT/US2014/053961
    subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that
    corresponds to the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed
    in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below
    the hysteresis intensity threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
  5 Similarly, in some embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an
    increase in intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity
    threshold to an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a
    subsequent decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis
    intensity, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input
  0 (e.g., the increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact,
    depending on the circumstances).
    [00172]      For ease of explanation, the description of operations performed in response to a
    press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response to a gesture
    including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting either: an increase
  5 in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an increase in intensity of a
    contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold to an intensity above the
    press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the contact below the press-input
    intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the contact below the hysteresis intensity
    threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity threshold. Additionally, in examples
 '0 where an operation is described as being performed in response to detecting a decrease in
    intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity threshold, the operation is, optionally,
    performed in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact below a hysteresis
    intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower than, the press-input intensity threshold.
    [00173]      Attention is now directed towards embodiments of devices, user interfaces, and
25  associated processes that may be implemented on a multifunction device, such as devices
     100, 300, 500, and/or 550, to improve a user's experience in manipulating user interface
    objects.
    [00174]      FIGS. 6A-6F illustrate exemplary user interfaces for manipulating user interface
    objects using an electronic device, in accordance with some embodiments. In some
30  embodiments, the electronic device is device 500. The electronic device has a display (e.g.,
     112, 340, 504) and a rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506).
    [00175]      FIG. 6A illustrates a document 602, which is an example of a user interface
    object. Document 602 includes a title 604A, a paragraph of body text 606A, and an image
    608A. The electronic device is configured to allow a user to scroll through document 602,
                                                      42

        WO 2015/034969                                                            PCT/US2014/053961
    such that only a portion of the document 602 is visible on the display (e.g., 504) at a
    particular time. The scroll position of the document is a characteristic of the document. The
    value of the scroll position of the document changes as the document is scrolled.
    [00176]      The user interface figures described optionally include a series (e.g., 610) that
  5 shows the range of the characteristic of the object. These series are typically not part of the
    displayed user interface, but are provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In this
    example, the scroll position of the document can range from 0.0 to 1.0, as illustrated in the
    series 610 having a scroll position (e.g., the characteristic) ranging between 0.0 (e.g., 610A)
    to 1.0 (e.g., 610B).
  0 [00177]      In this example, the series 610 includes various subsets of the range of the series
    610, which modify how the object's characteristic is manipulated by a user. Subset 604B,
    subset 606B, and subset 608B are illustrated in FIG. 6A. As with the series, subsets
    illustrated in the figures are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are provided
    to aid in the interpretation of the figures. For example, the range of subset 606B is from
  5 606C (e.g., scroll position value of 0.42) to 606D (e.g., scroll position value of 0.56) on the
    series 610. The scrolling behavior of the document 602 varies when the value of the scroll
    position of the document 602 is within the range of the subset 606B, as compared to scrolling
    behavior just prior to entry into the range of subset 606B. In some embodiments, scrolling
    behavior of the document varies between a first behavior when the scroll position is within
 '0 the range of any of subsets 604B, 606B, and 608B, as compared to a second behavior when
    the scroll position is not within any of the subsets. In some embodiments, scrolling behavior
    is different for each of the subsets 604B, 606B, and 608B as compared to each other and as
    compared to scrolling behavior when outside any subset.
    [00178]      FIG. 6B illustrates a viewable display area 620, a rotatable input mechanism (e.g.,
25  506), and a scroll value indicator 622 of an electronic device (e.g., device 500). The
    viewable display area 620 encompasses an exemplary area identifying the displayed user
    interface. For example, display area 620 illustrates the portion of the document 602 that is
    displayed on the display when the document 602 is scrolled using the rotatable input
    mechanism 506. The scroll value indicator 622 helps in the interpretation of the figures by
30  illustrating the value of the scroll position of the document 602, as will be described in
    relation to FIGS. 6C-6E. The scroll value indicator 622 is typically not part of the displayed
    user interface.
    [00179]      FIG. 6C illustrates the viewable portion of document 602, as illustrated by display
    area 620. In FIG. 6C, the value of the scroll position of the document is illustrated by scroll
                                                      43

        WO 2015/034969                                                              PCT/US2014/053961
    value indicator 622 (e.g., scroll position value of 0.63). The device displays, on the display,
    the object (e.g., document 602) in accordance with a value (e.g., scroll position value of 0.63
    in FIG. 6C) of a characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object, the value being within a
    range of values of the characteristic (e.g., within the series 610 ranging from 0.0 to 1.0). In
  5 other examples, the characteristic of the object may be, for example, the zoom size (e.g.,
    magnification) of the object or the degree of rotation of the object.
    [00180]      The device receives a user input request, the user input request representing
    rotation of the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506). For example, the user rotates the
    rotatable input mechanism 506 in order to change the scroll position of the document 602.
  0 [00181]      The device determines whether the value (e.g., the scroll position value) of the
    characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object (e.g., 602) is within a predetermined subset
    (e.g., within the range of subset 606B) of the range of values (e.g., 610) of the characteristic.
    [00182]      In accordance with a determination that the value (e.g., scroll position value) of
    the characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object (e.g., 602) is not within the
  5 predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic, the device updates the value
    (e.g., scroll position value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object within the
    range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request and in accordance with a
    second function, as illustrated in FIGS. 6C-6D.
    [00183]      In accordance with a determination that the value (e.g., scroll position value) of
 '0 the characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object (e.g., 602) is within the predetermined
    subset (e.g., 606B) of the range of values of the characteristic, the device updates the value
    (e.g., scroll position value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object within the
    range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request and in accordance with a
    first function, as illustrated in FIG. 6E. The first function and the second function are
25  different functions.
    [00184]      Thus, as the user rotates the rotatable input mechanism, document 602 begins to
    scroll on the display. As illustrated in FIGS. 6C-6D, during certain portions of the scroll
    (e.g., while not within subsets 604B, 606B, and 606C), the scrolling occurs based on the
    second function. As illustrated in FIG. 6E, during other portions of the scroll (e.g., while
30  within subset 606B), the scrolling occurs based on the first function. For example, a
    particular rotation of the rotatable input mechanism can be used to scroll through the entire
    range between subsets 608B and 606B (e.g., starting at scroll position value 0.70 and
    scrolling from 0.70 to 0.56 based on the second function). However, the same particular
    rotation of the rotatable input mechanism may only scroll through a portion of the subset
                                                      44

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    608B (e.g., starting at scroll position value 0.56 and scrolling from 0.56 to 0.53 based on the
    first function). By reducing the amount that the document is scrolled while within a subset
    (e.g., 606B), the device provides higher resolution (and therefore more precision) for
    scrolling through those portions of the document; doing so may also encourage increased user
  5 dwell-time on certain portions of the document. In some embodiments, the subsets can be
    configured to align with particular aspects of the document, such as title 604A, paragraph of
    body text 606A, and image 608A, in order to more allow for more precise scrolling through
    those aspects of the document.
    [00185]      FIG. 6F illustrates manipulating the zoom of an object (e.g., an image 612). The
  0 image (e.g., 612) is displayed in accordance with a value (e.g., zoom size value) of a
    characteristic (e.g., zoom size) of the object, the value being within a range of values of the
    characteristic (e.g., along series 614). In this example, the subsets 612A, 612B, 612C may be
    used to speed up the change in the characteristic. Thus, as the user rotates the rotatable input
    mechanism, the image zooms according to different zoom size values. While the zoom size
  5 values are within subsets 612A, 612B, 612C, the progression along series 612 happens
    quickly (e.g., a slight turn of the rotatable input mechanism changes the zoom of the image
    significantly). While the zoom size values are not within subsets 612A, 612B, 612C, the
    progression along series 612 happens slowly (e.g., even a significant turn of the rotatable
    input mechanism only slight changes the zoom of the image). As a result, the device
 '0 provides higher resolution (and therefore more precision) for zooming through certain zoom
    size values.
    [00186]      When the image reaches the minimum (e.g., 0.0) zoom size, the image may shrink
    to less than the 0.0 level of zoom before returning to the 0.0 level of zoom. This
    rubberbanding effect provides an indication to the user that the minimum zoom limit has been
25  reached. Similarly, when the image reaches the maximum (e.g., 1.0) zoom size, the image
    may enlarge beyond the 1.0 level of zoom before returning to the 1.0 level of zoom. This
    rubberbanding effect provides an indication to the user that the maximum zoom limit has
    been reached.
    [00187]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating display of the object (e.g., 602,
30  612) in accordance with the updated value of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom
    size) of the object comprises animating the object to reflect the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object (e.g., animate the document scrolling or animate the object
    zooming).
                                                      45

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    [00188]      In accordance with some embodiments, the predetermined subset of the range of
    values (e.g., 606B) of the characteristic includes an intermediate value (e.g., 606E), the
    intermediate value being inclusively within the predetermined subset of the range of values of
    the characteristic (e.g., a value between and inclusive of the start value and the end value).
  5 The first function is based on the intermediate value (e.g., 606E) of the subset of the range of
    values. Thus, for example, the behavior of the characteristic (e.g., the scroll behavior or
    zoom behavior), changes based on distance to the intermediate value. In accordance with
    some embodiments, the intermediate value of the predetermined subset (e.g., 606B) of the
    range of values of the characteristic is the mid-range value.
  0 [00189]      In accordance with some embodiments, the first function is based on a difference
    between the value of the characteristic of the object and the intermediate value. Thus, as an
    example, the precision with which the document can be scrolled increases as the document is
    scrolled closer to the center of the predetermined subset and the precision with which the
    document can be scrolled decreases again as the document is scrolled away from the center of
  5 the predetermined subset. For example, while the document scroll position is further from
    the intermediate value, an incremental rotation of the rotatable input mechanism causes more
    scrolling than the same incremental rotation of the rotatable input mechanism, while the
    document scroll position is closer to the intermediate value.
    [00190]      In accordance with some embodiments, the updated value is based on an attribute
 '0 of the user input request. In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user
    input request is one or more of angular velocity of the rotatable input mechanism and angular
    acceleration of the rotatable input mechanism.
    [00191]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating the value (e.g., scroll position
    value or zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom size) of the object
25  (e.g., 602, 612) within the range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request
    and in accordance with the second function comprises: determining whether the value (e.g.,
    scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom size)
    of the object is within a second predetermined subset (e.g., 608B) of the range of values of
    the characteristic, wherein the predetermined subset (e.g., 606B) and the second
30  predetermined subset (e.g., 608B) are different. In accordance with a determination that the
    value (e.g., scroll position value or zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position,
    zoom size) of the object is within the second predetermined subset of the range of values of
    the characteristic, further updating the value of the characteristic of the object within the
    range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request and in accordance with a
                                                    46

    third function. The first function, the second function, and the third function are different
    functions. Thus, in one example, different predetermined subsets can cause varying
    behaviors. In another example, two or more predetermined subsets may overlap, and their
    effects combine for the overlapped range.
  5 [00192]      In accordance with some embodiments, the range of values of the characteristic is
    along a single dimension (e.g., the range is not a multi-dimension X-Y range). In accordance
    with some embodiments, the range of values of the characteristic is a linear series.
    [00193]      In accordance with some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that
    the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll
  0 position, zoom size) of the object (e.g., 602, 612) is within the predetermined subset (e.g.,
    606B, 612B) of the range of values of the characteristic, the device performs a haptic alert at
    the electronic device, such as a mechanical (e.g., tactile feedback) or audible (e.g., audio file
    playback) haptic alert.
    [00194]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is selected from the group
  5 consisting of a document and an image. Examples of a document include, but are not limited
    to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). In accordance with some embodiments,
 '0 the characteristic of the object is selected from the group consisting of scroll position (e.g.,
    how far up/down or left/right is the object scrolled), zoom size (e.g., how large/small is
    magnification of the document), and degree of rotation (e.g., how many radians is the object
    rotated). In accordance with some embodiments, the characteristic of the object is scroll
    position and the predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic is a range of
25  scroll positions. In accordance with some embodiments, the characteristic of the object is
    zoom size and the predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic is a range
    of zoom sizes.

    [00196]      Method 700 provides an intuitive way to manipulate user interface objects. The
    method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when using a device to manipulate a user
    interface object, such as scrolling, zooming, or rotating an object, thereby creating a more
    efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user
  5 to manipulate user interface objects more efficiently conserves power and increases the time
    between battery charges.
    [00197]      At block 702, an object (e.g., document 602) is displayed in accordance with a
    value (e.g., scroll position value of 0.63 in FIG. 6C) of a characteristic (e.g., scroll position)
    of the object (e.g., document 602), the value being within a range of values (e.g., range 0.0 to
  0  1.0 of series 610) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position).
    [00198]      At block 704, a user input request is received. The user input request represents
    rotation of the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506).
    [00199]      At block 706, it is determined whether the value (e.g., scroll position value or
    zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position or zoom size) of the object is
  5 within a predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic (e.g., within 604B,
    606B, or 608B).
    [00200]      At block 708, in accordance with a determination that the value (e.g., scroll
    position value or zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position or zoom size) of
    the object is within the predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic (e.g.,
 '0 indicator 622 is within subset 608D in FIGS. 6D-6E), the value (e.g., scroll position value or
    zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position or zoom size) of the object is
    updated within the range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request and in
    accordance with a first function.
    [00201]      At block 710, in accordance with a determination that the value (e.g., scroll
25  position value or zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position or zoom size) of
    the object (e.g., document 602) is not within the predetermined subset of the range of values
    of the characteristic (e.g., indicator 622 is not within any subsets, as in FIG. 6C), updating the
    value (e.g., scroll position value or zoom size value) of the characteristic of the object within
    the range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request and in accordance
30  with a second function, wherein the first function and the second function are different
    functions.
    [00202]      At block 712, display of the object (e.g., document 602) is updated in accordance
    with the updated value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., to reflect the scroll on the
    display).

    size) of the object comprises animating the object to reflect the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object (e.g., animate the document scrolling or animate the object
  5 zooming).
    [00204]      In accordance with some embodiments, the predetermined subset of the range of
    values (e.g., 606B) of the characteristic includes an intermediate value (e.g., 606E), the
    intermediate value being inclusively within the predetermined subset of the range of values of
    the characteristic (e.g., a value between and inclusive of the start value and the end value).
  0 The first function is based on the intermediate value (e.g., 606E) of the subset of the range of
    values. In accordance with some embodiments, the intermediate value of the predetermined
    subset (e.g., 606B) of the range of values of the characteristic is the mid-range value.
    [00205]      In accordance with some embodiments, the first function is based on a difference
    between the value of the characteristic of the object and the intermediate value. In
  5 accordance with some embodiments, the updated value is based on an attribute of the user
    input request. In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user input request
    is one or more of angular velocity of the rotatable input mechanism and angular acceleration
    of the rotatable input mechanism.
    [00206]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating the value (e.g., scroll position
 '0 value or zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom size) of the object
    (e.g., 602, 612) within the range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request
    and in accordance with the second function comprises: determining whether the value (e.g.,
    scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom size)
    of the object is within a second predetermined subset (e.g., 608B) of the range of values of
25  the characteristic, wherein the predetermined subset (e.g., 606B) and the second

    playback) haptic alert.
  0 [00209]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is selected from the group
    consisting of a document and an image. Examples of a document include, but are not limited
    to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
  5 events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). In accordance with some embodiments,
    the characteristic of the object is selected from the group consisting of scroll position (e.g.,
    how far up/down or left/right is the object scrolled), zoom size (e.g., how large/small is
    magnification of the document), and degree of rotation (e.g., how many radians is the object
    rotated). In accordance with some embodiments, the characteristic of the object is scroll
 '0 position and the predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic is a range of
    scroll positions. In accordance with some embodiments, the characteristic of the object is
    zoom size and the predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic is a range
    of zoom sizes.
    [00210]      In accordance with some embodiments, analysis of the object is not required to
25  specify the subsets. For example, the subsets may be associated with the object (e.g.,
    embedded in the document) prior to the object being accessed at the device. Such predefined
    subsets may be manually specified by the author of the object.

    612B, 612C) have the technical advantage of allowing coarse input to be translated to precise
30  control. Certain portions of documents (or certain zoom sizes, certain degrees of rotation)
    can be made easier or more difficult to move through or move away from, facilitating the
    process of directing the user's focus. Further, the subsets of a particular object may have
    different properties, such as different size of ranges. The subsets can be used to direct the
    "flow" through a document to allow for curation.

    [00214]      FIGS. 8A-8F illustrate exemplary user interfaces for manipulating user interface
    objects using an electronic device, in accordance with some embodiments. In some
  5 embodiments, the electronic device is device 500. The electronic device has a display (e.g.,
     112, 340, 504) and a rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506).
    [00215]      FIG. 8A illustrates a document 802, which is an example of a user interface
    object. Document 802 includes a title 804A, a paragraph of body text 806A, and an image
    808A. In some embodiments, the electronic device is configured to allow a user to scroll
 '0 through document 802, such that only a portion of the document 802 is visible on the display
    (e.g., 504) at a particular time. The scroll position of the document 802 is a characteristic of
    the document. The value of the scroll position of the document changes as the document is
    scrolled.
    [00216]      The user interface figures described optionally include a series (e.g., 810) that
25  shows the range of the characteristic of the object. These series are typically not part of the
    displayed user interface, but are provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In this
    example, the scroll position of the document can range from 0.0 to 1.0, as illustrated in the
    series 810 having a scroll position (e.g., the characteristic) ranging between 0.0 (e.g., 810A)
    to 1.0 (e.g., 810B).
30  [00217]      In this example, the series 810 includes various anchors within the range of the
    series 810, which modify how the object's characteristic is manipulated by a user. Anchor
    804B, anchor 806B, and anchor 808B are illustrated in FIG. 8A. As with the series, anchors
    illustrated in the figures are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are provided
    to aid in the interpretation of the figures. For example, the zone of anchor 806B is from 806E

    (e.g., scroll position value of 0.25) to 806D (e.g., scroll position value of 0.45) on the series
    810. When the value of the scroll position of the document 802 transitions into the range of
    the anchor 806B, the document 802 is scrolled to the intermediate value 806C of the anchor
    806D, as described in detail below.
  5 [00218]      FIG. 8B illustrates a viewable display area 820, a rotatable input mechanism (e.g.,
    506), and a scroll value indicator 822. The viewable display area 820 encompasses an
    exemplary area identifying the displayed user interface. For example, display area 820
    illustrates the portion of the document 802 that is displayed on the display when the
    document 802 is scrolled using the rotatable input mechanism 506. The scroll value indicator
  0 822 helps in the interpretation of the figures by illustrating the value of the scroll position of
    the document 802, as will be described in relation to FIGS. 8C-8E. The scroll value indicator
    822 is typically not part of the displayed user interface.
    [00219]      FIG. 8C illustrates the viewable portion of document 802, as illustrated by display
    area 820. In FIG. 8C, the value of the scroll position of the document is indicated by scroll
  5 value indicator 822 (e.g., 0.50). The device displays, on the display, the object (e.g.,
    document 802) in accordance with a value (e.g., 0.50 in FIG. 8C) of a characteristic (e.g.,
    scroll position) of the object, the value being within a range of values of the characteristic
    (e.g., within the series 810 ranging from 0.0 to 1.0). In other examples, the characteristic of
    the object may be, for example, the zoom size (e.g., magnification) of the object or the degree
 '0 of rotation of the object.
    [00220]      The device receives a user input request, the user input request representing
    rotation of the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506). For example, the user rotates the
    rotatable input mechanism 506 in order to change the scroll position of the document 802.
    [00221]      In response to receiving the user input request, the device determines whether the
25  user input request causes the value (e.g., scroll position value or zoom size value) of the
    characteristic (e.g., scroll level or zoom size) of the object to transition into range of a zone of
    an anchor (e.g., 806B). The anchor (e.g., 806B) has a start value (e.g., 806E), an intermediate
    value (e.g., 806C), and an end value (e.g., 806D) within the range of values of the
    characteristic. The zone of the anchor is between the start value (e.g., 806E) and the end
30  value (e.g., 806D) of the anchor 806B. The zone of the anchor is the range over which the
    anchor influences the object, such as by causing it to scroll to the intermediate value (e.g.,
    806C), as is detailed below.
    [00222]      In accordance with a determination that the user input request causes the value
    (e.g., scroll position value or zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position or
                                                     52

        WO 2015/034969                                                              PCT/US2014/053961
    zoom size) of the object (e.g., 802) to transition into range of the zone of the anchor, the
    device updates the value of the characteristic of the object based on the intermediate value
    (e.g., 808C) of the anchor. Thus, when the document is being scrolled and the scroll position
    value of the document enters into range of a particular anchor, the device sets the scroll
  5 position value of the document to the intermediate value of that particular anchor. The device
    also updates display of the object (e.g., 802) in accordance with the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object. Thus, the device displays the document scrolled to the
    intermediate value of that anchor.
    [00223]     This concept is illustrated in FIGS. 8C-8E. In FIG. 8C, the document 802 is not
  0 being scrolled. Once the device receives input at the rotatable input mechanism, the device
    begins scrolling the document in accordance with the input. In this example, the input
    indicates to scroll toward the top of the document 802. When the value of the characteristic
    transitions into range of anchor 806B, as illustrated in FIG. 8D, the device scrolls the
    document to the intermediate point 806C of the anchor 806D as illustrated in FIG. 8E.
  5 [00224]     As a result of the anchors, the device simplifies the alignment of contents of the
    document for the user. When a particular content reaches an anchor, the document
    automatically scrolls (sometimes referred to as "snapping") to the intermediate point of that
    anchor. For example, this allows various content in a document to be efficiently aligned with
    a particular location on the display, facilitate the user's ability to scroll to those particular
 '0 portions of the content.
    [00225]     FIG. 8F illustrates manipulating the zoom of an object (e.g., an image 812). The
    image (e.g., 812) is displayed in accordance with a value (e.g., zoom size value) of a
    characteristic (e.g., zoom size) of the object, the value being within a range of values of the
    characteristic (e.g., along series 814). In this example, the anchors 812A, 812B, and 812C
25  may be used to guide the change in the zoom characteristic. Thus, as the user rotates the
    rotatable input mechanism, the image zooms according to different zoom size values. When
    the zoom size value transitions into one of anchors 812A, 812B, and 812C, the device
    automatically changes the zoom of the image to the corresponding intermediate value of the
    anchor. As a result, the device facilitates access manipulating an object to particular zoom
30  size values. When the image reaches the minimum (e.g., 0.0) zoom size, the image may
    shrink to less than the 0.0 level of zoom before returning to the 0.0 level of zoom. This
    rubberbanding effect provides an indication to the user that the minimum zoom limit has been
    reached. Similarly, when the image reaches the maximum (e.g., 1.0) zoom size, the image
    may enlarge beyond the 1.0 level of zoom before returning to the 1.0 level of zoom. This
                                                      53

    rubberbanding effect provides an indication to the user that the maximum zoom limit has
    been reached.
    [00226]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating display of the object (e.g., 802,
    812) in accordance with the updated value of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom
  5 size) of the object comprises animating the object to reflect the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object (e.g., animate the document scrolling or animate the object
    zooming). That is, while the value of the characteristic is updated to the value of the
    intermediate value upon transitioning into the range of the anchor, the user interface may
    display the updating of scroll (or zoom) position graphically over a period of time via an
  0 animation of updating to the scroll (or zoom) position corresponding to the intermediate
    value. Doing so may reduce the abruptness of the updating.
    [00227]      In accordance with some embodiments (e.g., anchor 806), the intermediate value
    (e.g., 806C) is not equal to the start value (e.g. 806E) or the end value (e.g., 806D). In
    accordance with some embodiments (e.g., anchor 804), the intermediate value (e.g., 804C) is
  5 equal to the start value (e.g., 804C) or the end value.
    [00228]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating the value of the characteristic of
    the object based on the intermediate value of the anchor comprises updating the value of the
    characteristic of the object to be equal to the intermediate value of the anchor (e.g., the device
    sets the scroll or zoom value to the intermediate point).
 '0 [00229]      In accordance with some embodiments, the start value and the end value are
    different. In accordance with some embodiments, the intermediate value is not the average of
    the start value and the end value.
    [00230]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the user input
    request causes the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic
25  (e.g., scroll position, zoom size) of the object to transition into range of the zone of the
    anchor, the device initiates a duration (e.g., a time period) during which received user input
    requests to manipulate the characteristic of the object do not affect the displayed
    characteristic of the object. Thus, once the value of the characteristic of the object falls
    within the start value and the end value, further user input during a particular time period
30  does not affect the visual display of the object. This is helpful, for example, to give the user
    time to visually recognize that the object has moved or is moving to an intermediate value of
    an anchor.
    [00231]      In accordance with some embodiments, the duration is based on the rate of change
    of the value of the characteristic of the object when the value of the characteristic of the
                                                      54

    object transitions into range of the zone of the anchor. For example, if a document is being
    scrolled at a high scroll rate when it transitions into range of an anchor, the duration may be
    shorter than if the document was scrolled at a low scroll rate.
    [00232]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the user input
  5 request does not cause the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the
    characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom size) of the object to transition into range of the
    zone of the anchor (e.g., the scroll position/zoom size of the object is between two anchor
    zones) or into range of a zone of a second anchor (e.g., anchor 808B), the second anchor
    having a second start value, a second intermediate value, and a second end value, and the
  0 second anchor having a zone between the second start value and the second end value, the
    device updates the value of the characteristic of the object in accordance with the user input
    (e.g., the device scrolls the document to a stopping point not within the zone of any anchor).
    The device also updates display of the object in accordance with the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object (e.g., the device displays the document scrolled according to the
  5 stopping point). The device identifies a closest anchor, from among at least the anchor and
    the second anchor, based on the updated value of the characteristic of the object in
    accordance with the user input. Subsequently the device updates the value of the
    characteristic of the object based on the corresponding intermediate value of the identified
    closest anchor (e.g., set the scroll position value to the intermediate value of the closest
 '0 anchor, or set the zoom size value to the intermediate value of the closest anchor). The
    device also updates display of the object in accordance with the subsequently updated value
    of the characteristic of the object (e.g., display the document scrolled according to the
    intermediate value of the closest anchor or display the object zoomed according to the
    intermediate value of the closest anchor).
25  [00233]      In accordance with some embodiments, identifying the closest anchor comprises:
    calculating a difference between the updated value of the characteristic of the object in
    accordance with the user input request and the intermediate value of the anchor, and
    calculating a difference between the updated value of the characteristic of the object in
    accordance with the user input request and the intermediate value of the second anchor.
30  [00234]      In accordance with some embodiments, identifying the closest anchor comprises
    identifying the nearest of the start value and end value of the anchor and the second anchor.
    [00235]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the user input
    request causes the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic
    (e.g., scroll position, zoom size) of the object to transition into range of the zone of the

    [00236]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is a document and the
    characteristic of the object is scroll position. Examples of a document include, but are not
  5 limited to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). The device analyzes at least a portion of
    the document, wherein analyzing at least the portion of the document comprises identifying
  0 locations within the document.
    [00237]      In accordance with some embodiments, the locations within the document include
    one or more of: one or more page boundaries of at least the portion of the document, one or
    more paragraph boundaries of at least the portion of the document, and one or more keyword
    locations of at least the portion of the document. The device assigns anchors to some or all of
  5 the identified page boundaries, paragraph boundaries, and keyword locations of the
    document.
    [00238]      In accordance with some embodiments, the device accesses a first set of anchor
    points (e.g., anchor points indicate where anchors should go, such as at paragraphs and
    images), assigns respective anchors to the first set of anchor points, detects a change in value
 '0 of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the document has been scrolled). In response to
    detecting the change in the value of the characteristic of the object, the device accesses a
    second set of anchor points (e.g., the document has scrolled and more anchors are required)
    and assigns respective anchors to the second set of anchor points, wherein the first set of
    anchor points and the second set of anchor points are different.
25  [00239]      In accordance with some embodiments, the manipulation of the object is affected
    by both anchors and by subsets, as described above. The device determines whether the user
    input causes the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g.,
    scroll position, zoom size) of the object to transition into range of the zone of the anchor, the
    device determines whether the value of the characteristic of the object is also within a
30  predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic. In accordance with a
    determination that the value of the characteristic of the object is within the predetermined

    function, wherein the first function and the second function are different functions.
  5 [00240]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is a document or an image.
    Examples of a document include, but are not limited to: a message, a text message, a text
    message conversation, an email, a presentation, a spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a
    word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g.,
    list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar events, list of messages, list of files, list of
  0 folders). In accordance with some embodiments, the characteristic of the object is scroll
    position (e.g., how far up/down is the object scrolled), zoom size (e.g., how large/small is the
    document zoomed), and degree of rotation (e.g., how many radians is the object rotated).
    [00241]      FIG. 9A is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process for manipulating user
    interface objects in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, method 900
  5 may be performed at an electronic device with a display (e.g., 112, 340, 504) and a rotatable
    input mechanism (e.g., 506). Some operations in method 900 may be combined, the order of
    some operations may be changed, and some operations may be omitted. Exemplary devices
    that may perform method 900 include devices 100, 300, 500, and/or 550 (FIGS. 1A, 3, 5A,
    and 5C).
 '0 [00242]      Method 900 provides an intuitive way to manipulate user interface objects. The
    method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when using a device to manipulate a user
    interface object, such as scrolling, zooming, or rotating an object, thereby creating a more
    efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user
    to manipulate user interface objects more efficiently conserves power and increases the time
25  between battery charges.
    [00243]      At block 902, an object (e.g., document 802, image 812) is displayed in
    accordance with a value of a characteristic (e.g., scroll position in FIGS. 8C-8E, zoom size in
    FIGS. 8F) of the object, the value being within a range of values (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) of the
    characteristic.
30  [00244]      At block 904, a user input request is received, the user input request representing
    rotation of the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506).
    [00245]      At block 906, in response to receiving the user input request, it is determined
    whether the user input request causes the value (e.g., scroll position value or zoom size value)
    of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position or zoom size) of the object to transition into range of
                                                       57

    a zone of an anchor (e.g., anchor 806B, anchor 812B), the anchor having a start value (e.g., at
    806E), an intermediate value (e.g., at 806C), and an end value (e.g., at 806D) within the range
    of values of the characteristic, and the zone of the anchor being between the start value and
    the end value.
  5 [00246]      At block 908, in accordance with a determination that the user input request
    causes the value of the characteristic of the object to transition into range of the zone of the
    anchor (e.g., 822 enters the zone of anchor 806B, as illustrated in FIG. 8D), blocks 910 and
    912 are performed.
    [00247]      At block 910, the value of the characteristic of the object is updated based on the
  0 intermediate value of the anchor (e.g., the scroll position value is set equal to the intermediate
    value 806C).
    [00248]      At block 912, display of the object is updated in accordance with the updated
    value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the display of document 802 is updated to
    reflect the updated scroll position value, as illustrated in FIG. 8E)
  5 [00249]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating display of the object (e.g., 802,
    812) in accordance with the updated value of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom
    size) of the object comprises animating the object to reflect the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object (e.g., animate the document scrolling or animate the object
    zooming).
 '0 [00250]      In accordance with some embodiments (e.g., anchor 806), the intermediate value
    (e.g., 806C) is not equal to the start value (e.g. 806E) or the end value (e.g., 806D). In
    accordance with some embodiments (e.g., anchor 804), the intermediate value (e.g., 804C) is
    equal to the start value (e.g., 804C) or the end value.
    [00251]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating the value of the characteristic of
25  the object based on the intermediate value of the anchor comprises updating the value of the
    characteristic of the object to be equal to the intermediate value of the anchor (e.g., the device
    sets the scroll or zoom value to the intermediate point).
    [00252]      In accordance with some embodiments, the start value and the end value are
    different. In accordance with some embodiments, the intermediate value is not the average of
30  the start value and the end value.
    [00253]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the user input
    request causes the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic
    (e.g., scroll position, zoom size) of the object to transition into range of the zone of the
    anchor, the device initiates a duration (e.g., a time period) during which received user input

    requests to manipulate the characteristic of the object do not affect the displayed
    characteristic of the object.
    [00254]      In accordance with some embodiments, the duration is based on the rate of change
    of the value of the characteristic of the object when the value of the characteristic of the
  5 object transitions into range of the zone of the anchor.
    [00255]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the user input
    request does not cause the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the
    characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom size) of the object to transition into range of the
    zone of the anchor (e.g., the scroll position/zoom size of the object is between two anchor
  0 zones) or into range of a zone of a second anchor (e.g., anchor 808B), the second anchor
    having a second start value, a second intermediate value, and a second end value, and the
    second anchor having a zone between the second start value and the second end value, the
    device updates the value of the characteristic of the object in accordance with the user input
    (e.g., the device scrolls the document to a stopping point not within the zone of any anchor).
  5 The device also updates display of the object in accordance with the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object (e.g., the device displays the document scrolled according to the
    stopping point). The device identifies a closest anchor, from among at least the anchor and
    the second anchor, based on the updated value of the characteristic of the object in
    accordance with the user input. Subsequently the device updates the value of the
 '0 characteristic of the object based on the corresponding intermediate value of the identified
    closest anchor (e.g., set the scroll position value to the intermediate value of the closest
    anchor, or set the zoom size value to the intermediate value of the closest anchor). The
    device also updates display of the object in accordance with the subsequently updated value
    of the characteristic of the object (e.g., display the document scrolled according to the
25  intermediate value of the closest anchor or display the object zoomed according to the
    intermediate value of the closest anchor).
    [00256]      In accordance with some embodiments, identifying the closest anchor comprises:
    calculating a difference between the updated value of the characteristic of the object in
    accordance with the user input request and the intermediate value of the anchor, and
30  calculating a difference between the updated value of the characteristic of the object in
    accordance with the user input request and the intermediate value of the second anchor.

  5 audible (e.g., audio playback) haptic alert.
    [00259]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object (e.g., 802) is a document and
    the characteristic of the object is scroll position. Examples of a document include, but are not
    limited to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
  0 PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). The device analyzes at least a portion of
    the document, wherein analyzing at least the portion of the document comprises identifying
    locations within the document.
    [00260]      In accordance with some embodiments, the locations within the document include
  5 one or more of: one or more page boundaries of at least the portion of the document, one or
    more paragraph boundaries of at least the portion of the document, and one or more keyword
    locations of at least the portion of the document. The device assigns anchors to some or all of
    the identified page boundaries, paragraph boundaries, and keyword locations of the
    document.
 '0 [00261]      In accordance with some embodiments, the device accesses a first set of anchor
    points (e.g., anchor points indicate where anchors should go, such as at paragraphs and
    images), assigns respective anchors to the first set of anchor points, detects a change in value
    of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the document has been scrolled). In response to
    detecting the change in the value of the characteristic of the object, the device accesses a
25  second set of anchor points (e.g., the document has scrolled and more anchors are required)
    and assigns respective anchors to the second set of anchor points, wherein the first set of
    anchor points and the second set of anchor points are different.
    [00262]      In accordance with some embodiments, the manipulation of the object is affected
    by both anchors and by subsets, as described above. The device determines whether the user
30  input causes the value (e.g., scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g.,
    scroll position, zoom size) of the object to transition into range of the zone of the anchor, the
    device determines whether the value of the characteristic of the object is also within a
    predetermined subset of the range of values of the characteristic. In accordance with a
    determination that the value of the characteristic of the object is within the predetermined

    subset of the range of values of the characteristic, calculating the value of the characteristic of
    the object within the range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request and
    in accordance with a first function. In accordance with a determination that the value of the
    characteristic of the object is not within the predetermined subset of the range of values of the
  5 characteristic, calculating the value of the characteristic of the object within the range of
    values of the characteristic based on the user input request and in accordance with a second
    function, wherein the first function and the second function are different functions.
    [00263]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is a document or an image.
    Examples of a document include, but are not limited to: a message, a text message, a text
  0 message conversation, an email, a presentation, a spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a
    word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g.,
    list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar events, list of messages, list of files, list of
    folders). In accordance with some embodiments, the characteristic of the object is scroll
    position (e.g., how far up/down is the object scrolled), zoom size (e.g., how large/small is the
  5 document zoomed), and degree of rotation (e.g., how many radians is the object rotated).
    [00264]      In accordance with some embodiments, analysis of the object is not required to
    specify the anchors. For example, the anchors may be associated with the object (e.g.,
    embedded in the document) prior to the object being accessed at the device. Such predefined
    anchors may be manually specified by the author of the object.
 '0 [00265]      The anchors described in relation to FIGS. 8 and 9A (e.g., 804B, 806B, 808B,
    812A, 812B, 814C) have the technical advantage of allowing coarse input to be translated to
    precise control. Certain portions of documents (or certain zoom sizes, certain degrees of
    rotation) can be made easier or more difficult to move to, facilitating the process of directing
    the user's focus. Further, the anchors of a particular object may have different properties,
25  such as different size of ranges. The anchors can be used to direct the "flow" through a
    document to allow for curation.
    [00266]      Note that details of the processes described above with respect to method 900
    (FIG. 9A) are also applicable in an analogous manner to the methods described above and
    below. For example, method 900 may include one or more of the characteristics of the
30  various methods described above with reference to the processes in FIGS. 7, 9B, 11, 13K, 22,
    31, 39, and 46. For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
    [00267]      It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in FIG. 11
    have been described is exemplary and not intended to indicate that the described order is the
    only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in the art would

    certain operations. For brevity, these details are not repeated here. Additionally, it should be
    noted that aspects of the methods and processes described throughout this description may be
    incorporated with one another.
  5 [00268]      In a separate embodiment, FIGS. 8G-8H illustrate exemplary user interfaces for
    manipulating user interface objects using an electronic device. In some embodiments, the
    electronic device is device 500. The electronic device has a display (e.g., 112, 340, 504) and
    a rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506).
    [00269]      FIGS. 8G-8H illustrate a document 842, which is an example of a user interface
  0 object. In some embodiments, the electronic device is configured to allow a user to scroll
    through document 842, such that only a portion of the document 842 is visible on the display
    (e.g., 504) at a particular time. The scroll position of the document 842 is a characteristic of
    the document. The value of the scroll position of the document changes as the document is
    scrolled.
  5 [00270]      The user interface figures described optionally include a series (e.g., 850) that
    shows the range of the characteristic of the object. These series are typically not part of the
    displayed user interface, but are provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In this
    example, the scroll position of the document can range from 0.0 to 1.0.
    [00271]      In this example, the series 850 includes various anchors within the range of the
 '0 series 850, which modify how the object's characteristic is manipulated by a user. Anchor
    844B, anchor 846B are illustrated in FIG. 8G. As with the series, anchors illustrated in the
    figures are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are provided to aid in the
    interpretation of the figures. The zone of anchor 844B is from 844E (e.g., scroll position
    value of 0.30) to 844D (e.g. 0.50) on the series 850. The zone of anchor 846B is from 846E
25  (e.g., value of 0.60) to 846D (e.g., value of 0.95) on the series 850. When the value of the
    scroll position of the document 842 reaches a steady state (i.e., the document stops scrolling),
    the device scrolls the document 842 to the intermediate value of the nearest anchor, as
    described in detail below. This aligns the document 842 on the display (e.g., 504) for the
    user's ease of viewing.
30  [00272]      FIGS. 8G-8H also illustrate a viewable display area 860 and a scroll value
    indicator 862. The viewable display area 860 encompasses an exemplary area identifying the
    displayed user interface. For example, display area 860 illustrates the portion of the
    document 842 that is displayed on the display when the document 842 is scrolled using a
    rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506). The scroll value indicator 862 helps in the
                                                     62

    [00273]      FIG. 8G illustrates a viewable portion of document 842, as illustrated by display
    area 860. The device displays, on the display, the object (e.g., document 802) in accordance
  5 with a value of a characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object, the value being within a
    range of values of the characteristic (e.g., within the series 850 ranging from 0.0 to 1.0). In
    other examples, the characteristic of the object may be, for example, the zoom size (e.g.,
    magnification) of the object or the degree of rotation of the object.
    [00274]      The device receives a user input request, the user input request representing
  0 rotation of the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506). For example, the user rotates the
    rotatable input mechanism 506 in order to change the scroll position of the document 842.
    [00275]      In response to receiving the user input request, the device updates the value (e.g.,
    scroll position value, zoom size value) of the characteristic (e.g., scroll position, zoom size)
    of the object within the range of values of the characteristic based on the user input request,
  5 and the device updates the display of the object in accordance with the updated value of the
    characteristic of the object. In the example of FIGS. 8G-8H, the device has scrolled the
    document and the document has stopped scrolling. The value of the scroll position of the
    document is illustrated by scroll value indicator 862 (e.g., scroll position value of 0.53).
    Thus, when the device receives the user input, the device scrolls the document 842 to the
 '0 updated scroll position value (e.g., 0.53). In some examples, the document 842 reaches a
    steady state and stops scrolling once it reaches the updated scroll position value.
    [00276]      The device identifies a closest anchor to the updated value (e.g., 0.53) of the
    characteristic of the object (e.g., once the document stops scrolling), the closest anchor
    identified from among at least a first anchor (e.g., anchor 844B) having a corresponding
25  intermediate value (e.g., 844C) and a second anchor (e.g., anchor 846B) having a
    corresponding intermediate value (e.g., 846C).
    [00277]      Subsequently the device updates the value of the characteristic of the object based
    on the corresponding intermediate value of the identified closest anchor. The device also
    updates display of the object in accordance with the subsequently updated value of the
30  characteristic of the object. Thus, the device sets the value of the characteristic of the object
    equal to the intermediate value of the closest anchor and scrolls the document to the
    intermediate value of the closest anchor. In an example where the characteristic is zoom size,
    the magnification of the object is change to the intermediate value of the closest anchor.

    [00278]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating display of the object in
    accordance with the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object comprises
    animating the object to reflect the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the
    object. Thus, for example, the scroll of the document 842 from the stopped (steady state)
  5 scroll position to the subsequently updated value is animated.
    [00279]      In accordance with some embodiments, the corresponding intermediate value of
    the identified closest anchor is between the respective start value (e.g., 846E) and the
    respective end value (e.g., 846D) of the identified closest anchor, exclusive of the start value
    and end value, such as with anchor 846B.
  0 [00280]      In accordance with some embodiments, the corresponding intermediate value
    (e.g., 844C) of the identified closest anchor is equal to the respective start value (e.g., 844C)
    or the respective end value of the identified closest anchor, such as with anchor 844B.
    [00281]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating the value of the characteristic of
    the object based on the corresponding intermediate value of the identified closest anchor
  5 comprises updating the value of the characteristic of the object to be equal to the
    corresponding intermediate value of the identified closest anchor.
    [00282]      In accordance with some embodiments, the corresponding start value and the
    corresponding end value of the identified closest anchor are different. In accordance with
    some embodiments, the corresponding intermediate value of the identified closest anchor is
 '0 the average of the corresponding start value and the corresponding end value.
    [00283]      In accordance with some embodiments, subsequent to updating display of the
    object in accordance with the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object,
    the device initiates a duration (e.g., a time period) during which received user input requests
    to manipulate the characteristic of the object do not affect the displayed characteristic of the
25  object. This is helpful, for example, to give the user time to visually recognize that the object
    has moved to an intermediate value of the closest anchor. In accordance with some
    embodiments, subsequent to the duration, updating display of the object in accordance with
    user input requests received during the duration.
    [00284]      In accordance with some embodiments, the closest anchor is identified by
30  identifying the closest zone once the document 842 stops scrolling (e.g., reaches a steady
    state). As illustrated in FIG. 8G, the distance from the subsequently updated value (indicated
    by the scroll value indicator 862) to the zone of anchor 844B is the distance 852 (e.g., a
    distance of 0.03), while the distance from the subsequently updated value (indicated by the
    scroll value indicator 862) to the zone of anchor 846B is the distance 850 (e.g., a distance of
                                                     64

    0.07). In this example, anchor 844B is identified as the closest anchor because the distance
    852 (e.g., distance of 0.03) is less than the distance 850 (e.g., distance of 0.07). Thus,
    identifying the closest anchor comprises identifying the nearest of start values and end values
    of the anchor and the second anchor.
  5 [00285]      In accordance with some embodiments, the closest anchor is identified by
    identifying the closest intermediate value once the document 842 stops scrolling (e.g.,
    reaches a steady state). As illustrated in FIG. 8H, the distance from the subsequently updated
    value (indicated by the scroll value indicator 862) to the intermediate value 844C of anchor
    844B is the distance 856 (e.g., a distance of 0.33), while the distance from the subsequently
  0 updated value (indicated by the scroll value indicator 862) to the intermediate value 846C of
    anchor 846B is the distance 854 (e.g., a distance of 0.20). In this example, anchor 844B is
    identified as the closest anchor because the distance 854 (e.g., distance of 0.20) is less than
    the distance 856 (e.g., distance of 0.33). For example, the device calculates a difference
    between the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object and the
  5 corresponding intermediate value of the first anchor, and calculates a difference between the
    subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object and the corresponding
    intermediate value of the second anchor. The lesser of these values indicates the closest
    anchor.
    [00286]      In accordance with some embodiments, the device performs a haptic alert at the
 '0 device (e.g., a mechanical or audible haptic alert) while updating display of the object in
    accordance with the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object. This
    provides an indicated to the user that the object is transitioning to the nearest anchor.
    [00287]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is a document and the
    characteristic of the object is scroll position. Examples of a document include, but are not
25  limited to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). The device analyzes at least a portion of
    the document, wherein analyzing at least the portion of the document comprises identifying
30  locations within the document. In accordance with some embodiments, the locations within
    the document include one or more of: one or more page boundaries of at least the portion of
    the document, one or more paragraph boundaries of at least the portion of the document, and
    one or more keyword locations of at least the portion of the document. The device assigns

    anchors to some or all of the identified page boundaries, paragraph boundaries, and keyword
    locations of the document.
    [00288]      In accordance with some embodiments, the device accesses a first set of anchor
    points (e.g., anchor points indicate where anchors should go, such as at paragraphs and
  5 images). The device assigns respective anchors to the first set of anchor points. The device
    then detects a change in value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the document has been
    scrolled), and in response to detecting the change in the value of the characteristic of the
    object, the device accesses a second set of anchor points (e.g., the document has scrolled and
    more anchors are required). The device assigns respective anchors to the second set of
  0 anchor points, wherein the first set of anchor points and the second set of anchor points are
    different. This is helpful, for example, where an object includes many anchor points that
    require anchors, but device memory is limited and assigning anchors to all the anchor points
    at one time strains the available device memory.
    [00289]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is selected from the group
  5 consisting of a document and an image. Examples of a document include, but are not limited
    to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). In accordance with some embodiments,
 '0 the characteristic of the object is selected from the group consisting of scroll position (e.g.,
    how far up/down is the object scrolled), zoom size (e.g., how large/small is the document
    zoomed), and degree of rotation (e.g., how many radians is the object rotated).
    [00290]      FIG. 9B is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process for manipulating user
    interface objects in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, method 920
25  may be performed at an electronic device with a display (e.g., 112, 340, 504) and a rotatable
    input mechanism (e.g., 506). Some operations in method 920 may be combined, the order of
    some operations may be changed, and some operations may be omitted. Exemplary devices
    that may perform method 920 include devices 100, 300, 500, and/or 550 (FIGS. 1A, 3, 5A,
    and 5C).
30  [00291]      Method 920 provides an intuitive way to manipulate user interface objects. The
    method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when using a device to manipulate a user
    interface object, such as scrolling, zooming, or rotating an object, thereby creating a more
    efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user

    [00292]      At block 922, an object (e.g. document 842) is displayed in accordance with a
    value of a characteristic (e.g., scroll position value) of the object, the value being within a
  5 range of values (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) of the characteristic.
    [00293]      At block 924, a user input request is received. The user input request represents
    rotation of the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506).
    [00294]      At block 926, in response to receiving the user input request, blocks 928 and 930
    are performed. At block 928, the value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., document
  0 842) is updated within the range of values (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) of the characteristic based on the
    user input request. At block 930, display of the object is updated in accordance with the
    updated value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the document is scrolled and then
    reaches a stopped position, which is a steady state).
    [00295]      At block 932, a closest anchor (e.g., anchor 844B or 846B) to the updated value of
  5 the characteristic of the object is identified, the closest anchor identified from among at least
    a first anchor (e.g., 844B) having a corresponding intermediate value (e.g., 844C) and a
    second anchor (e.g., 846B) having a corresponding intermediate value (e.g., 846C).
    [00296]      At block 934, the value of the characteristic of the object is subsequently updated
    based on the corresponding intermediate value (e.g., value at 844C or 846C) of the identified
 '0 closest anchor (e.g., anchor 844B or 846B).
    [00297]      At block 936, display of the object (e.g., document 842) is updated in accordance
    with the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object.
    [00298]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating display of the object in
    accordance with the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object comprises
25  animating the object to reflect the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the

    of the object in accordance with user input requests received during the duration.
  5 [00304]      In accordance with some embodiments, the closest anchor is identified by
    identifying the closest zone once the document 842 stops scrolling (e.g., reaches a steady
    state).
    [00305]      In accordance with some embodiments, the closest anchor is identified by
    identifying the closest intermediate value once the document 842 stops scrolling (e.g.,

    [00306]      In accordance with some embodiments, the device performs a haptic alert at the
    device (e.g., a mechanical or audible haptic alert) while updating display of the object in
    accordance with the subsequently updated value of the characteristic of the object.
    [00307]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is a document and the
25  characteristic of the object is scroll position. Examples of a document include, but are not
    limited to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). The device analyzes at least a portion of

    locations of the document.
    [00308]      In accordance with some embodiments, the device accesses a first set of anchor
    points (e.g., anchor points indicate where anchors should go, such as at paragraphs and
  5 images). The device assigns respective anchors to the first set of anchor points. The device
    then detects a change in value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the document has been
    scrolled), and in response to detecting the change in the value of the characteristic of the
    object, the device accesses a second set of anchor points (e.g., the document has scrolled and
    more anchors are required). The device assigns respective anchors to the second set of
  0 anchor points, wherein the first set of anchor points and the second set of anchor points are
    different.
    [00309]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is selected from the group
    consisting of a document and an image. Examples of a document include, but are not limited
    to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
  5 spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders). In accordance with some embodiments,
    the characteristic of the object is selected from the group consisting of scroll position (e.g.,
    how far up/down is the object scrolled), zoom size (e.g., how large/small is the document
 '0 zoomed), and degree of rotation (e.g., how many radians is the object rotated).
    [00310]      In accordance with some embodiments, analysis of the object is not required to
    specify the anchors. For example, the anchors may be associated with the object (e.g.,
    embedded in the document) prior to the object being accessed at the device. Such predefined
    anchors may be manually specified by the author of the object.
25  [00311]      The anchors described in relation to FIGS. 8 and 9B (e.g., 844B, 846B) have the
    technical advantage of allowing coarse input to be translated to precise control. Certain
    portions of documents (or certain zoom sizes, certain degrees of rotation) can be made easier
    or more difficult to move to, facilitating the process of directing the user's focus. Further, the
    anchors of a particular object may have different properties, such as different size of ranges.
30  The anchors can be used to direct the "flow" through a document to allow for curation.

  0 [00314]      FIGS. 10A-OB illustrate exemplary user interfaces for manipulating user
    interface objects using an electronic device (e.g., 500), in accordance with some
    embodiments. In some embodiments, the electronic device is device 500. The electronic
    device has a display (e.g., 112, 340, 504) and a rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506).
    [00315]      FIGS. 10A-10B illustrates an instant messaging conversation 1002, which is an
  5 example of user interface object. In some embodiments, the electronic device is configured
    to allow a user to scroll the object (e.g., 1002), such that only a portion of the object is visible
    on the display (e.g., 504) at a particular time. The scroll position of the object is a
    characteristic of the object. The value of the scroll position of the object changes as the
    object is scrolled.
 '0 [00316]      The user interface figures described optionally include markers (e.g., 1002A,
     1002B, 1002C). These markers are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are
    provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In these examples, the markers illustrate
    scroll positions of the objects.
    [00317]      FIGS. 10A-OB also illustrate a viewable display area (1020) and a scroll value
25  indicator (e.g., 1022). The viewable display area encompasses an exemplary area identifying
    the displayed user interface. For example, display area 1020 illustrates the portion of the
    conversation 1002 that is displayed on the display when the conversation 1002 is scrolled
    using the rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506). The rotatable input mechanism 506 and the
    scroll value indicator (e.g., 1022) help in the interpretation of the figures and are typically not
30  part of the displayed user interface.
    [00318]      FIG. 1OA illustrates a viewable portion of conversation 1002, as illustrated by
    display area 1020. The device displays, on the display, the object (e.g., conversation 1002).
    The object is associated with a first marker having a first value (e.g. marker 1002A) and a

    value) of a characteristic (e.g., scroll position) of the object is based on the first value of the
    first marker.
    [00319]      The device receives user input representing rotation of the rotatable input
    mechanism. In response to receiving the user input representing rotation of the rotatable
  5 input mechanism, the device determines whether an attribute of the user input (e.g., the
    speed, acceleration, duration of the user input) exceeds a threshold value (e.g., user input is
    above a threshold speed or threshold acceleration). In accordance with a determination that
    the attribute of the user input exceeds the threshold value (e.g., the user input exceeds a
    threshold velocity or exceeds a threshold acceleration), the device updates the value of the
  0 characteristic of the object (e.g., 1002) based on the second value of the second marker. In
    some embodiments, the attribute is acceleration and the threshold is a threshold of
    acceleration of the rotatable input mechanism, wherein the input may be referred to as a
    "flicking" input. The device also updates display of the object in accordance with the
    updated value of the characteristic of the object. Thus, when the device determines that, for
  5 example, the user input on the rotatable input mechanism exceeds a threshold velocity, the
    device scrolls the document on the display to the next marker (e.g., from marker 1002A to
    marker 1002B). In some embodiments, the direction of the rotation of the input mechanism
    determines the direction of the scroll, and the second marker is the closest marker in the
    determined direction of the scroll.
 '0 [00320]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating display of the object in
    accordance with the updated value of the characteristic of the object comprises animating the
    object to reflect the updated value of the characteristic of the object. For example, the device
    displays an animation of scrolling the conversation to the second marker. For another
    example, when the characteristic is a zoom size, the device displays an animation of zooming
25  the object to the second marker.
    [00321]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the attribute of the
    user input is less than the threshold value (e.g., the user input does not exceed a threshold
    velocity or does not exceed a threshold acceleration), the device maintains display of the
    object in accordance with the value of the characteristic of the object based on the first value
30  of the first marker (e.g., continue to display the object at the same position as before, or
    continue to display the object at the same zoom level as before).
    [00322]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the attribute of the
    user input does not exceed the threshold value (e.g., the user input does not exceed a
    threshold velocity or does not exceed a threshold acceleration), updating the value of the
                                                      71

    characteristic of the object to a third value, the third value based on the user input. Thus, if
    the input does not exceed the threshold value, the object is scrolled (or zoomed) to a location
    other than the second marker. Accordingly, when the user rotates the rotatable input
    mechanism without exceeding the threshold value, the device smoothly scrolls the object.
  5 [00323]     In accordance with some embodiments, the second marker is an anchor and the
    second value of the second marker is an intermediate value of the anchor.
    [00324]     In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the attribute of the
    user input exceeds the threshold value (e.g., the user input exceeds a threshold velocity or
    exceeds a threshold acceleration), the device performs a haptic alert (e.g., perform a
  0 mechanical or audible alert) at the electronic device.
    [00325]     In accordance with some embodiments, the object is a document. The device
    analyzes at least a portion of the document, wherein analyzing at least the portion of the
    document comprises identifying locations (e.g., locations to place markers) within the
    document.
  5 [00326]     In accordance with some embodiments, the locations within the document include
    one or more of: one or more page boundaries of at least the portion of the document, one or
    more paragraph boundaries of at least the portion of the document, and one or more keyword
    locations of at least the portion of the document. The device assigns markers to some or all
    of the identified page boundaries, paragraph boundaries, and keyword locations of the
 '0 document.
    [00327]     In accordance with some embodiments, the device accesses a first set of markers
    of the object. The device detects a change in value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the
    document has been scrolled). In response to detecting the change in the value of the
    characteristic of the object, the device associates a second set of markers to the object,
25  wherein the first set and the second set are different.
    [00328]     In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the attribute of the
    user input does exceeds the threshold value (e.g., the user input exceeds a threshold velocity
    or exceeds a threshold acceleration), initiating a duration during which received user inputs
    representing rotation of the rotatable input mechanism do not affect the displayed
30  characteristic of the object.
    [00329]     In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user input is angular
    velocity of the rotatable input mechanism and the threshold value is a threshold angular
    velocity. In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user input is a maximum
    angular velocity of the rotatable input mechanism and the threshold value is a threshold

    angular velocity. In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user input is
    angular acceleration of the rotatable input mechanism and the threshold value is a threshold

    [00330]      In accordance with some embodiments, the object is selected from the group
  5 consisting of a document and an image. Examples of a document include, but are not limited
    to: a message, a text message, a text message conversation, an email, a presentation, a
    spreadsheet, a user editable file (e.g., a word processing file), a user ineditable file (e.g., a
    PDF file), a webpage, a list of items (e.g., list of contacts, list of music, list of calendar
    events, list of messages, list of files, list of folders).
  0 [00331]      In accordance with some embodiments, the characteristic of the object is selected
    from the group consisting of scroll position (e.g., how far up/down is the object scrolled),
    zoom size (e.g., how large/small is the document zoomed), and degree of rotation (e.g., how
    many radians is the object rotated).
    [00332]      FIG. 11 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process for manipulating user
  5 interface objects in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, method
     1100 may be performed at an electronic device with a display (e.g., 112, 340, 504) and a
    rotatable input mechanism (e.g., 506). Some operations in method 1100 may be combined,
    the order of some operations may be changed, and some operations may be omitted.
    Exemplary devices that may perform method 1100 include devices 100, 300, 500, and/or 550
 '0 (FIGS. 1A, 3, 5A, and 5C).
    [00333]      Method 1100 provides an intuitive way to manipulate user interface objects. The
    method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when using a device to manipulate a user
    interface object, such as scrolling, zooming, or rotating an object, thereby creating a more
    efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated computing devices, enabling a user
25  to manipulate user interface objects more efficiently conserves power and increases the time
    between battery charges.
    [00334]      At block 1102, an object (e.g., instant message conversation 1002) is displayed,
    wherein the object (e.g., conversation 1002) is associated with a first marker (e.g., 1002A)
    having a first value and a second marker (e.g., 1002B) having a second value, and wherein a
30  value (e.g., scroll position value or zoom size value) of a characteristic (e.g., scroll position or
    zoom size) of the object (e.g., conversation 1002) is based on the first value of the first
    marker.
    [00335]      At block 1104, user input representing rotation of the rotatable input mechanism
    (e.g., 506) is received.

    [00336]      At block 1106, in response to receiving the user input representing rotation of the
    rotatable input mechanism, it is determined whether an attribute of the user input (e.g., the
    speed, acceleration, duration of the user input) exceeds a threshold value.
    [00337]      At block 1108, in accordance with a determination that the attribute of the user
  5 input exceeds the threshold value (e.g., the user input exceeds a threshold velocity or exceeds
    a threshold acceleration), the value of the characteristic of the object is updated based on the
    second value of the second marker.
    [00338]      At block 1110, display of the object is updated in accordance with the updated
    value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the conversation is scrolled to the marker, as
  0 illustrated in FIG. lOB).
    [00339]      In accordance with some embodiments, updating display of the object (e.g.,
    conversation 1002) in accordance with the updated value of the characteristic of the object
    comprises animating the object to reflect the updated value of the characteristic of the object.
    [00340]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the attribute of the
  5 user input is less than the threshold value, the device maintains display of the object in
    accordance with the value of the characteristic of the object based on the first value of the
    first marker (e.g., the conversation is not scrolled).
    [00341]      In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the attribute of the
    user input does not exceed the threshold value (e.g., the user input does not exceed a
 '0 threshold velocity or does not exceed a threshold acceleration), updating the value of the
    characteristic of the object to a third value, the third value based on the user input. Thus, if
    the input does not exceed the threshold value, the object is scrolled (or zoomed) to a location
    other than the second marker.

    [00346]      In accordance with some embodiments, the device accesses a first set of markers
    of the object. The device detects a change in value of the characteristic of the object (e.g., the

  5 representing rotation of the rotatable input mechanism do not affect the displayed
    characteristic of the object.
    [00348]      In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user input is angular
    velocity of the rotatable input mechanism and the threshold value is a threshold angular
    velocity. In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user input is a maximum
 '0 angular velocity of the rotatable input mechanism and the threshold value is a threshold
    angular velocity. In accordance with some embodiments, the attribute of the user input is

    [00351]     In accordance with some embodiments, analysis of the object is not required to

    embedded in the document) prior to the object being accessed at the device. Such predefined
    markers may be manually specified by the author of the object.
  5 [00352]     The markers described in relation to FIGS. 10 and 11 (e.g., 1002A, 1002B,
     1002C) have the technical advantage of allowing coarse input to be translated to precise
    control. Certain portions of documents (or certain zoom sizes, certain degrees of rotation)
    can be made easier or more difficult to move to, facilitating the process of directing the user's
    focus. Further, the markers of a particular object may have different properties, such as
  0 different thresholds to move to them. The markers can be used to direct the "flow" through a
    document to allow for curation.

  5 various methods described above with reference to the processes in FIGS. 7, 9A, 9B, 13K,
    22, 31, 39, and 46. For brevity, these details are not repeated below.
    [00354]     It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in FIG. 11
    have been described is exemplary and not intended to indicate that the described order is the
    only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in the art would
 '0 recognize various ways to reorder the operations described herein, as well as excluding
    certain operations. For brevity, these details are not repeated here. Additionally, it should be
    noted that aspects of the methods and processes described throughout this description may be
    incorporated with one another.
    [00355]     FIG. 12 shows exemplary functional blocks of an electronic device 1200 that, in
25  some embodiments, perform the features described above and below. As shown in FIG. 12,
    an electronic device 1200 includes a display unit 1202 configured to display graphical

    value of the characteristic of the object is within a predetermined subset of the range of
    values of the characteristic; determining whether the user input request causes the value of
    the characteristic of the object to transition into range of a zone of an anchor, determining
    whether an attribute of the user input exceeds a threshold value;
 '0 [00359]     For example, the updating unit 1216 can be used for: updating the value of the

    hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software to carry out the principles of
  5 the various described examples. It is understood by persons of skill in the art that the
    functional blocks described in FIG. 12 are, optionally, combined or separated into sub-blocks
    to implement the principles of the various described examples. Therefore, the description
    herein optionally supports any possible combination or separation or further definition of the

  0 [00361]     FIGS. 13A-13J illustrate an exemplary user interface 1300 displaying multiple
    user interface objects in the form of selectable elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 and a focus
    selector 1310. A user can select a selection element from among the multiple selectable

  5 [00362]     Crown 558 of device 550 is a user rotatable user interface input (e.g., a rotatable
    input mechanism). The crown 558 can be turned in two distinct directions: clockwise and
    counterclockwise. FIGS. 13-13J include rotation direction arrows illustrating the direction of
    crown rotation and movement direction arrows illustrating the direction of movement of one
    or more user interface objects, where applicable. The rotation direction arrows and
 '0 movement direction arrows are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are
    provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In this example, a clockwise direction
    rotation of crown 558 is illustrated by a rotation direction arrow pointing in the up direction.
    Similarly, a counterclockwise direction rotation of crown 558 is illustrated by a rotation
    direction arrow pointing in the down direction. The characteristics of the rotation direction
25  arrow are not indicative of the distance, speed, or acceleration with which crown 558 is
    rotated by a user. Instead, the rotation direction arrow is indicative of the direction of
    rotation of crown 558 by the user.

    control a user's interactions with user interface objects in conjunction with a physical crown
30  user input device. In this example, elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 are stationary and the
    focus selector 1310 is movable via user input received from crown 558. Clockwise
    movement of crown 558 is associated with a force on the focus selector 1310 in the up
    movement direction and counterclockwise movement of crown 558 is associated with a force
    on the focus selector 1310 in the down movement direction. Accordingly, moving the focus

    [00364]     To facilitate a user's ability to control the movement of focus selector 1310
  5 among the four user-selectable elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308, a "magnetic" relationship is
    associated between each user selectable element and the focus selector 1310. Each element
     1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 is associated with a simulated magnetic value. In this example, the
    magnetic values of elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 are equal. In other examples, the
    magnetic values of elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 may not be equal.
  0 [00365]     Using the magnetic relationship between the elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 and
    focus selector 1310, physics-based modeling can be used to simulate magnetic attraction
    between elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 and focus selector 1310. As will be described in
    further detail below, user interface 1300 causes an attraction between elements 1302, 1304,
     1306, 1308 and focus selector 1310. As a result, when user input is not received, focus
  5 selector 1310 ultimately reaches a steady state where it is aligned with one of elements 1302,
     1304, 1306, 1308. An object is in a steady state when the object is not being translated,
    rotated, or scaled. The alignment of focus selector 1310 with the element allows the element
    to be activated using a user input. Even before any user input for activation, alignment of
    focus selector 1310 with the element is indicative of the selection of that element. This
 '0 physics-based magnetic modeling results in the user interface exhibiting virtual detents.
    [00366]     In this example, physics-based magnetic modeling is achieved, for example, by
    modeling each element 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 as an object made from a magnetized
    material that creates its own persistent magnetic field and modeling focus selector 1310 as a
    material that is attracted to a magnet, such as ferromagnetic materials including iron, cobalt,
25  and nickel. In another example, the physics-based modeling can be achieved by modeling
    each element 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 as an object made from a material that is attracted to a
    magnet and modeling focus selector 1310 as a material that creates its own persistent
    magnetic field. In another example, the physics-based modeling can be achieved by
    modeling each element 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 as an object that creates its own persistent
30  magnetic field and modeling focus selector 1310 as a material that also creates its own
    persistent magnetic field, such as two magnets that attract. Each of these physics-based
    models can be adapted to include magnetic fields that vary, rather than remain persistent,
    based on certain factors, such as the distance between the element and focus selector 1310,
    the speed of focus selector 1310, the acceleration of focus selector 1310, or based on a
                                                      79

       WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
   combination of two or more factors. For example, the varying magnetic field may be
   simulated through the use of an electromagnet which can be turned on and off and can have a
   varying strength.
   [00367]     At FIG. 13A, focus selector 1310 is aligned with element 1306, indicating
 5 selection of element 1306. At FIG. 13B, device 550 determines a change in the position of
   crown 558 in the clockwise direction, as indicated by rotation direction arrow 1312. In
   response to determining the change in the position of the crown 558, the device increases the
   speed of focus selector 1310, moving focus selector 1310 in the up direction, as indicated by
   movement direction arrow 1314. In one example, focus selector 1310 may be associated with
 0 a mass or may have a calculated inertia.
   [00368]     Because element 1306 is modeled as a magnetic element and focus selector 1310
   is modeled as a ferromagnetic material, there is a magnetic attraction between the two user
   interface objects. The physics-based model of user interface 1300 causes a resistance of the
   movement of focus selector 1310 away from element 1306 using this magnetic attraction. An
 5 element's magnetic value (e.g., the strength of an element's magnet attraction) may be
   modeled, for example, in terms of its pull force (the elements ability to move other objects).
   The pull force exerted may be based on the pull force of either an electromagnet or a
   permanent magnet as described by the Maxwell equation.
   [00369]     At FIGS. 13C-13D, device 550 continues to determine a change in the position of
 0 crown 558 in the clockwise direction, as indicated by rotation direction arrow 1316. In
   response to determining the change in the position of the crown 558, the device 550 adds
   additional speed to the focus selector 1310 in the up direction. At the same time, the
   magnetic attraction of elements 1302, 1304, 1306, and 1308 are acting on focus selector
    1310. At FIG. 13C, elements 1306 and 1308 are applying a force to the focus selector 1310
25 in the down direction as a result of the physics-based magnetic modeling. Elements 1302 and
    1304 are applying a force to focus selector 1310 in the up direction as a result of the physics
   based magnetic modeling.
   [00370]     The distance between each element and focus selector 1310 also play a role in the
   amount of force the element applies to focus selector 1310. Generally, as the distance
30 between the element and the focus selector 1310 increases, the intensity of the force between
   the element and the focus selector 1310 decreases. The rate of change in the intensity of the
   force can be modeled in many ways. For example, the inverse square law may apply the
   intensity of the force as a function of the distance. More specifically, I=1/d2, where I is the
                                                    80

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    intensity of the force and d is the distance. In other examples, the magnetic force can vary in
    direct inverse proportion to distance or can vary inversely with the third power of distance.
    [00371]      In some examples, the magnetic attraction between an element and a focus
    selector only exists while the focus selector is within an attraction area having an outer edge
  5 that is a predetermined distance from the element. This simplifies calculations because the
    magnetic force of elements with a distance from the focus selector that is greater than a
    predetermined distance are not considered in determining the forces applied to the focus
    selector.
    [00372]      In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
  0 to the user interface, the system may also employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce
    the speed of the focus selector while the focus selector is in motion. For example, the speed
    of the focus selector can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a friction
    coefficient value. This physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction, drag
    friction, or the like.
  5 [00373]      At FIG. 13D, focus selector 1310 is directly between elements 1302, 1304 and
    elements 1306, 1308. However, focus selector 1310 continues to move in the up direction
    based in part on the speed or inertia associated with focus selector 1310.
    [00374]      At FIGS. 13E-13J, device 550 determines that there is no change in the position of
    crown 558. As a result of this determination, no additional speed is added to the existing
 '0 speed of focus selector 1310. However, the magnetic forces of elements 1302, 1304, 1306,
     1308 continue to be applied, as well as the physics-based friction model. At FIGS. 13E-13J,
    element 1304 has the largest magnetic effect on focus selector 1310, as compared to elements
     1302, 1306, 1308, because element 1304 is the closest to focus selector 1310. This physics
    based magnetic modeling results in the user interface exhibiting virtual detents.
25  [00375]      In FIGS. 13E-13F, element 1304 applies a magnetic force on focus selector 1310
    in the up direction. At FIGS. 13G-13H, as focus selector 1310 overshoots element 1304,
    element 1304 applies a force on focus selector 1310 in the down direction, further reducing
    the speed of focus selector 1310 until focus selector 1310 reaches a momentary stop at FIG.
     13H. At FIG. 131, the magnetic force applied by element 1304 on focus selector 1310 in the
30  down direction causes focus selector 1310 to move down and align with element 1304. At
    FIG. 13J, focus selector 1310 comes to rest while aligned with element 1304. The system
    interprets this alignment as a selection of element 1304, which is achieved by the user
    manipulating focus selector 1310 through the use of crown 558.
                                                    81

       WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
   [00376]     While element 1304 is selected, the user can activate element 1304 by one or
   more techniques. For example, the user may press on touch-sensitive display 556, press on
   the touch-sensitive display with force above a predetermined threshold, press button 562, or
   simply allow element 1304 to remain selected for a predetermined amount of time. In
 5 another example, aligning an element and a focus selector can be interpreted as both a
   selection and an activation of the element.
   [00377]     In this example, movement of focus selector 1310 is constrained along a
   predefined vertical path. In other examples, movement of the focus selector may be
   constrained along a different predefined path, or may not be constrained to a predefined path.
 0 In this example, alignment in only one axis (the vertical axis) is used to indicate selection of
   an element. In some examples, alignment in two, three, or more axes may be required
   between an element and a focus selector to indicate a selection.
   [00378]     FIG. 13K is a flow diagram illustrating a process 1350 for selecting an element in
   a graphical user interface using a physical crown as an input device. Process 1350 is
 5 performed at a wearable electronic device (e.g., device 550 in FIG. 1) having a physical
   crown. In some examples, the electronic device also includes a touch-sensitive display. The
   process provides an efficient technique for selecting an element from among multiple
   elements in a graphical user interface.
   [00379]     At block 1352, the device causes a display of a plurality of selectable elements on
 0 a touch-sensitive display of a wearable electronic device. The device also causes a display of
   a focus selector. The device uses a physics-based model to simulate magnetic attraction
   between the selectable elements and the focus selector. Each selectable element of the
   plurality of selectable elements is associated with a corresponding magnetic value. The
   magnetic value can be the strength of an element's magnet attraction in terms of its pull
25 force.
   [00380]     In some examples, the system causes the plurality of selectable elements to be
   displayed linearly and equidistantly. This configuration adds additional ease of selection of
   the elements by the user. This configuration is especially beneficial when the selectable
   elements have equal importance and are therefore weighted equally.
30 [00381]     At block 1354, the device receives crown position information. The crown
   position information may be received as a series of pulse signals, real values, integer values,
   and the like.
   [00382]     At block 1356, the device determines whether a change has occurred in a crown
   distance value. The crown distance value is based on an angular displacement of the physical
                                                  82

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    crown of the wearable electronic device. A change in the crown distance value is indicative
    of a user providing input to the wearable electronic device by, for example, turning the
    physical crown. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has not
    occurred, the system returns to block 1354 and continues receiving crown position
  5 information. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has occurred,
    the system continues to block 1358, though the system may continue to receive crown
    position information.
    [00383]      The device also determines a direction based on a direction of rotation of the
    physical crown of the wearable electronic device. For example, an up direction can be
  0 determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical crown. Similarly, a down direction
    can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the physical crown. In other
    examples, a down direction can be determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical
    crown and an up direction can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the
    physical crown.
  5 [00384]      At block 1358, in response to determining the change in the crown distance value,
    the devices causes a movement of the focus selector toward a selection element of the
    plurality of selectable elements. This movement changes the focus of the plurality of
    selectable elements. At least initially, the movement of the focus selector is in the
    determined direction. The movement of the focus selector may be animated. The movement
 '0 has a rate of movement (speed). The system causes the rate of movement of the focus
    selector to change using the physics-based magnetic interaction of the focus selector with the
    selection element based at least on the magnetic value associated with the selection element.
    For example, the physics-based magnetic attraction of the selection element may cause the
    rate of movement of the focus selector to increase as the focus selector moves towards the
25  selection element. Similarly, the physics-based magnetic attraction of the selection element
    may cause the rate of movement of the focus selector to decrease as the focus selector moves
    away from the selection element.
    [00385]      Similarly, the magnetic interaction of the focus selector with other selectable
    elements may cause a change in the rate of the movement of the focus selector. For example,
30  the rate of the movement of the focus selector may change as it approaches and passes an
    element that remains unselected. The change in the rate of the movement of the focus
    selector resulting from this interaction with the unselected element is based at least in part on
    the magnetic value of the unselected element.

    [00386]     In some examples, the magnetic values associated with the selectable elements are
    virtual magnetic strengths based on a virtual pull force.
    [00387]     In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
    to the user interface, the system may employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce the
  5 rate of movement of the focus selector while it is in motion. For example, the rate of
    movement of the focus selector can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a
    friction coefficient value. This physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction,
    drag friction, or the like.
    [00388]     In some examples, the device receives an additional input through the rotation of
  0 the crown before the focus selector reaches a steady state. An object is in a steady state when
    the object is not being translated, rotated, or scaled. In this example, the system determines a
    second change in the crown distance value. The system also determines a second direction,
    which is based on the direction of rotation of the physical crown of the wearable electronic
    device. In response to determining the second change in the crown distance value, the system
  5 increases or decreases the rate of movement of the focus selector. The change in the rate of
    the movement of the focus selector is based on the second change in the crown distance value
    and the second direction.
    [00389]     In some examples, once the focus selector aligns with the selection element and is
    in a steady state, the system determines that the selection element has been selected.
 '0 [00390]     FIGS. 14-21 illustrate an exemplary user interface 1400 displaying multiple user
    interface objects in the form of selectable elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 and a focus
    selector 1410. A user can select a selection element from among the multiple selectable
    elements by using a physical crown of a wearable electronic device to move the focus
    selector 1410 to align with desired selection element. An additional input from the user can
25  be used to activate the selection element that is selected.
    [00391]     Crown 558 of device 550 is a user rotatable user interface input (e.g., a rotatable
    input mechanism). Crown 558 can be turned in two distinct directions: clockwise and
    counterclockwise. FIGS. 14-20 include rotation direction arrows illustrating the direction of
    crown rotation and movement direction arrows illustrating the direction of movement of one
30  or more user interface objects, where applicable. The rotation direction arrows and
    movement direction arrows are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are
    provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In this example, a clockwise direction
    rotation of crown 558 is illustrated by a rotation direction arrow pointing in the up direction.
    Similarly, a counterclockwise direction rotation of crown 558 is illustrated by a rotation
                                                     84

    direction arrow pointing in the down direction. The characteristics of the rotation direction
    arrow are not indicative of the distance, speed, or acceleration with which crown 558 is
    rotated by a user. Instead, the rotation direction arrow is indicative of the direction of
    rotation of crown 558 by the user.
  5 [00392]     FIGS. 14-21 illustrate an exemplary physics-based model that can be used to
    control a user's interactions with user interface objects in conjunction with a physical crown
    user input device. In this example, the elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 are stationary and
    the focus selector 1410 is movable via user input received from crown 558. Clockwise
    movement of crown 558 is associated with a force on the focus selector 1410 in the up
  0 movement direction and counterclockwise movement of crown 558 is associated with a force
    on the focus selector 1410 in the down movement direction.
    [00393]     To facilitate a user's ability to control the movement of focus selector 1410
    among the four user-selectable elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408, a "magnetic" relationship is
    associated between each user selectable element and the focus selector 1410. Each element
  5  1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 is associated with a magnetic value. In this example, the magnetic
    values of elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 are not all equal. Unequal magnetic values may
    be helpful for allowing a user to more easily select particular options. For example, if the
    system expects that 90% of the time a user will select a particular option from among
    multiple options, the magnetic value of the particular option may be configured to be
 '0 significantly higher than the magnetic value of the other multiple options. This allows the
    user to quickly and easily select the particular option, while requiring more precise navigation
    of the user interface by the user to select one of the other multiple options.
    [00394]     In this example, the magnetic value of element 1402 is equal to the magnetic
    value of element 1404. This is illustrated in FIGS. 14-21 by the equal size of elements 1402
25  and 1404. The magnetic value of element 1406 is less than the magnetic value of element
     1404. This is illustrated in FIGS. 14-21 by the reduced size of element 1406. The magnetic
    value of element 1408 is larger than the magnetic value of element 1404. This is illustrated
    in FIGS. 14-21 by the larger size of element 1408. Thus, in this example, the magnetic
    strength of each of the elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 is represented in FIGS. 14-21 by the
30  relative size of the elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408.
    [00395]     Using the magnetic relationship between the elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 and
    focus selector 1410, physics-based modeling can be used to simulate magnetic attraction
    between elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 and focus selector 1410. As will be described in
    further detail below, user interface 1400 causes an attraction between elements 1402, 1404,
                                                      85

       WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
     1406, 1408 and focus selector 1410. As a result, when user input is not received, focus
    selector 1410 ultimately reaches a steady state where it is aligned with one of elements 1402,
     1404, 1406, 1408. An object is in a steady state when the object is not being translated,
    rotated, or scaled. The alignment of focus selector 1410 with the element is indicative of the
  5 selection of that element. In other examples, additional input, such as tapping, pressing the
    crown or another button may be required for selection. This physics-based magnetic
    modeling results in the user interface exhibiting virtual detents.
    [00396]      In this example, physics-based magnetic modeling is achieved by modeling each
    element 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 as an object made from a magnetized material that creates its
  0 own persistent magnetic field and modeling focus selector 1410 as a material that is attracted
    to a magnet, such as ferromagnetic materials including iron, cobalt, and nickel. Other
    physics-based models can be used, such as those described above.
    [00397]      In this example, the magnetic strength of the elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 are
    not all the same, as described above. Further, the magnetic strength of elements 1402, 1404,
  5  1406, 1408 vary based on the speed of focus selector 1410. The higher the speed of focus
    selector 1410, the lower the magnetic strength of elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408. The
    lower the speed of focus selector 1410, the higher the magnetic strength of elements 1402,
     1404, 1406, 1408. As a result, when focus selector 1410 is moving quickly, the elements
     1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 play a reduced role in changing the speed of the focus selector as
 '0 compared to when focus selector 1410 is moving slowly.
    [00398]      The technique of varying the magnetic strength of elements 1402, 1404, 1406,
     1408 is illustrated in FIGS. 14-21. The magnetic strength (and in this example, the size) of
    elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 is based on the speed of focus selector 1410. For example,
    the varying magnetic strengths may be simulated through the use of electromagnets which
25  can have varying strengths.
    [00399]      At FIG. 14, focus selector 1410 is aligned with element 1404, indicating selection
    of element 1404. In some examples, additional input, such as tapping, pressing the crown or
    another button may be required for selection. At FIG. 15, device 550 determines a change in
    the position of crown 558 in the counterclockwise direction, as indicated by rotation direction
30  arrow 1430. In response to determining the change in the position of the crown 558, the
    device increases the speed of focus selector 1410, moving the focus selector 1410 in the
    down direction, as indicated by movement direction arrow 1420. In one example, the focus
    selector may be associated with a mass or may have a calculated inertia.

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    [00400]      Because element 1406 is modeled as a magnetic element and focus selector 1410
    is modeled as a ferromagnetic material, there is a magnetic attraction between the two user
    interface objects. An element's magnetic value (e.g., the strength of an element's magnet
    attraction) may be modeled, for example, in terms of its pull force (the elements ability to
  5 move other objects). The pull force exerted may be based on the pull force of either an
    electromagnet or a permanent magnet as described by the Maxwell equation.
    [00401]      However, the magnetic strength of elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 is based on
    the speed of the focus selector 1410. The faster the focus selector 1410 is moving, the
    smaller the magnetic strengths of elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408. This is illustrated in
  0 FIGS. 15-17. As the focus selector 1410 speeds up, elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 lose
    their magnetic strength. This loss of magnetic strength is depicted in FIGS. 15-17 with the
    reduced size of elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 for illustrative purposes. Generally, the size
    of elements and focus selectors do not visually change with changes to their magnetic
    strength.
  5 [00402]      At FIGS. 18-20, focus selector 1410 slows down. The slower the focus selector
     1410 is moving, the larger the magnetic strengths of elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408. This
    is illustrated in FIGS. 18-20. As the focus selector 1410 slows down, elements 1402, 1404,
     1406, 1408 regain their magnetic strength. This regain of magnetic strength is depicted in
    FIGS. 18-20 with the increased size of elements 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 for illustrative
 '0 purposes. Generally, the size of elements and focus selectors do not visually change with
    changes to their magnetic strength. To summarize, the magnetic strength of the elements is
    inversely related to the speed of the focus selector.
    [00403]      As before, the distance between each element 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408 and focus
    selector 1410 also plays a role in the amount of force the elements apply to focus selector
25   1410.
    [00404]      In some examples, the magnetic attraction between an element and a focus
    selector only exists while the focus selector is within an attraction area having an outer edge
    that is a predetermined distance from the element. This simplifies calculations because the
    magnetic force of elements with a distance from the focus selector that is greater than a
30  predetermined distance are not considered in determining the forces applied to the focus
    selector.
    [00405]      In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
    to the user interface, the system may also employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce
    the speed of the focus selector while it is in motion. For example, the speed of the focus
                                                    87

       WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
   selector can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a friction coefficient value.
   This physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction, drag friction, or the like.
   [00406]     At FIGS. 19-20, the magnetic force applied by element 1408 on focus selector
    1410 in the down direction causes focus selector 1410 to move down and align with element
 5  1408. At FIG. 21, focus selector 1410 comes to rest while aligned with element 1408. The
   system interprets this alignment as a selection of element 1408, which is achieved by the user
   manipulating focus selector 1410 through the use of crown 558. In some examples,
   additional input, such as tapping, pressing the crown or another button may be required for
   selection. Further user input can be used to activate the selection.
 0 [00407]     While element 1408 is selected, the user can activate element 1408 by one or
   more of many techniques. For example, the user may press on the touch-sensitive display of
   the device, press on the touch-sensitive display with force above a predetermined threshold,
   press a button, or simply allow element 1408 to remain selected for a predetermined amount
   of time. In another example, aligning an element and a focus selector can be interpreted as
 5 both a selection and an activation of the element.
   [00408]     In this example, movement of the focus selector is constrained along a predefined
   vertical path. In other examples, movement of the focus selector may be constrained along a
   different predefined path, or may not be constrained to a predefined path. In this example,
   alignment in only one axis (the vertical axis) is used to indicate selection of an element. In
 0 some examples, alignment in two, three, or more axes may be required between an element
   and a focus selector to indicate a selection. In some examples, additional input, such as
   tapping, pressing the crown or another button after the alignment may be required for
   selection.
   [00409]     FIG. 22 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 2200 for selecting an element in a
25 graphical user interface using a physical crown as an input device. Process 2200 is
   performed at a wearable electronic device (e.g., device 550 in FIG. 1) having a physical
   crown. In some examples, the electronic device also includes a touch-sensitive display. The
   process provides an efficient technique for selecting an element from among multiple
   elements in a graphical user interface.
30 [00410]     At block 2202, the device causes a display of a plurality of selectable elements on
   a touch-sensitive display of a wearable electronic device. The device also causes a display of
   a focus selector. The device uses a physics-based model to simulate magnetic attraction
   between the selectable elements and the focus selector. Each selectable element of the
   plurality of selectable elements is associated with a corresponding magnetic value. The
                                                   88

       WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
   magnetic value can be the strength of an element's magnet attraction in terms of its pull
   force, and each element can have a different magnetic value.
   [00411]     At block 2204, the device receives crown position information. The position
   information may be received as a series of pulse signals, real values, integer values, and the
 5 like.
   [00412]     At block 2206, the device determines whether a change has occurred in a crown
   distance value. The crown distance value is based on an angular displacement of the physical
   crown of the wearable electronic device. A change in the crown distance value is indicative
   of a user providing input to the wearable electronic device by, for example, turning the
 0 physical crown. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has not
   occurred, the system returns to block 2204 and continues receiving crown position
   information. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has occurred,
   the system continues to block 2208, though the system may continue to receive crown
   position information.
 5 [00413]     The device also determines a direction based on a direction of rotation of the
   physical crown of the wearable electronic device. For example, an up direction can be
   determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical crown. Similarly, a down direction
   can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the physical crown. In other
   examples, a down direction can be determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical
 0 crown and an up direction can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the
   physical crown.
   [00414]     At block 2208, in response to determining the change in the crown distance value,
   the device causes a movement of the focus selector toward a selection element of the plurality
   of selectable elements. This movement changes the focus of the plurality of selectable
25 elements. At least initially, the movement of the focus selector is in the determined direction.
   The movement of the focus selector may be animated. The movement has a rate of
   movement (speed).
   [00415]     In some examples, a minimum angular velocity of crown rotation that is necessary
   for the focus selector to reach an escape velocity corresponds directly to the instantaneous
30 angular velocity of crown 558 (FIG. 1), meaning that the user interface of device 550, in
   essence, responds when crown 558 reaches a sufficient angular velocity. In some
   embodiments, the minimum angular velocity of crown rotation necessary for reaching the
   escape velocity is a calculated velocity that is based on, but not directly equal to, the
   instantaneous ("current") angular velocity of crown 558. In these examples, device 550 can
                                                    89

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    maintain a calculated crown (angular) velocity V in discrete moments in time T according to
    equation 1:
    [00416]     VT=V(T-1) + AVCROWN - AVDRAG.                       (EQ. 1)
    [00417]     In equation 1, VT represents a calculated crown velocity (speed and direction) at
  5 time T, V(T-1) represents the previous velocity (speed and direction) at time T-1,
    AVCROWN represents the change in velocity caused by the force being applied through the
    rotation of the crown at time T, and AVDRAG represents the change in velocity due to a drag
    force. The force being applied, which is reflected through AVCROWN, can depend on the
    current velocity of angular rotation of the crown. Thus, AVCROWN can also depend on the
  0 current angular velocity of the crown. In this way, device 550 can provide user interface
    interactions based not only on instantaneous crown velocity but also based on user input in
    the form of crown movement over multiple time intervals, even if those intervals are finely
    divided. Note, typically, in the absence of user input in the form of AVCROWN, VT will
    approach (and become) zero based on AVDRAG in accordance with EQ. 1, but VT would not
  5 change signs without user input in the form of crown rotation (AVCROWN).
    [00418]     Typically, the greater the velocity of angular rotation of the crown, the greater the
    value of AVCROWN will be. However, the actual mapping between the velocity of angular
    rotation of the crown and AVCROWN can be varied depending on the desired user interface
    effect. For example, various linear or non-linear mappings between the velocity of angular
 '0 rotation of the crown and AVCROWN can be used.
    [00419]     Also, AVDRAG can take on various values. For example, AVDRAG can depend
    on the velocity of crown rotation such that at greater velocities, a greater opposing change in
    velocity (AVDRAG) can be produced. In another example, AVDRAG can have a constant
    value. It should be appreciated that the above-described requirements of AVCROWN and
25  AVDRAG can be changed to produce desirable user interface effects.
    [00420]     As can be seen from EQ. 1, the maintained velocity (VT) can continue to increase
    as long as AVCROWN is greater than AVDRAG. Additionally, VT can have non-zero values
    even when no AVCROWN input is being received, meaning that user interface objects can
    continue to change without the user rotating the crown. When this occurs, objects can stop
30  changing based on the maintained velocity at the time the user stops rotating the crown and
    the AVDRAG component.
    [00421]     In some examples, when the crown is rotated in a direction corresponding to a
    rotation direction that is opposite the current user interface changes, the V(T-1) component
                                                     90

        WO 2015/034969                                                         PCT/US2014/053961
    can be reset to a value of zero, allowing the user to quickly change the direction of the object
    without having to provide a force sufficient to offset the VT.
    [00422]     At block 2210, the system determines a speed of the focus selector. The speed of
    the focus selector may be determined based on crown velocity, as described above.
  5 [00423]     At block 2212, the magnetic values of one or more of the selectable elements are
    modified based on the speed of the focus selector. In one example, the magnetic values of
    one or more selectable elements are inversely related to the speed of the focus selector. For
    example, when the focus selector has a speed above a first threshold, the magnetic values of
    the selectable elements are reduced by a factor of 10 from their original values. When the
  0 focus selector has a speed below the first threshold and above a second threshold, the
    magnetic values of the selectable elements are reduced by a factor of 5 from their original
    values. When the focus selector further slows down and has a speed below the second
    threshold, the magnetic values of the selectable elements are returned to their original values.
    [00424]     In addition, the speed of the focus selector is changed because of the physics
  5 based magnetic interaction of the focus selector with the selection element based at least on
    the magnetic value associated with the selection element. For example, the physics-based
    magnetic attraction of the selection element may cause the speed of the focus selector to
    increase as the focus selector moves towards the selection element. Similarly, the physics
    based magnetic attraction of the selection element may cause the speed of the focus selector
 '0 to decrease as the focus selector moves away from the selection element.
    [00425]     Similarly, the magnetic interaction of the focus selector with other selectable
    elements may cause a change in the speed of the focus selector. For example, the speed of
    the focus selector may change as it approaches and passes an element that remains
    unselected. The change in the speed of the focus selector resulting from this interaction with
25  the unselected element is based at least in part on the magnetic value of the unselected
    element.
    [00426]     In some examples, the magnetic values associated with the selectable elements are
    virtual magnetic strengths based on a virtual pull force.
    [00427]     In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
30  to the user interface, the system may employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce the
    speed of the focus selector while it is in motion. For example, the speed of the focus selector
    can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a friction coefficient value. This
    physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction, drag friction, or the like.
                                                    91

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    [00428]     In some examples, the device receives an additional input through the rotation of
    the crown before the focus selector reaches a steady state. An object is in a steady state when
    the object is not being translated, rotated, or scaled. In this example, the system determines a
    second change in the crown distance value. The system also determines a second direction,
  5 which is based on the direction of rotation of the physical crown of the wearable electronic
    device. In response to determining the second change in the crown distance value, the system
    increases or decreases the speed of the focus selector by applying an additional force to the
    focus selector. The change in the rate of the movement of the focus selector is based on the
    second change in the crown distance value and the second direction.
  0 [00429]     In some examples, once the focus selector aligns with the selection element and is
    in a steady state, the system determines that the selection element has been selected.
    [00430]     FIGS. 23-30 illustrate an exemplary user interface 2300 displaying multiple user
    interface objects in the form of selectable elements 2302, 2304, 2306, 2308 and a focus
    selector 2310. A user can select a selection element from among the multiple selectable
  5 elements by using a physical crown of a wearable electronic device to move the focus
    selector 2310 to align with desired selection element. In some examples, additional input,
    such as tapping, pressing the crown or another button after the alignment may be required for
    the user to select the selection element.
    [00431]     Crown 558 of device 550 is a user rotatable user interface input (e.g., a rotatable
 '0 input mechanism). The crown 558 can be turned in two distinct directions: clockwise and
    counterclockwise. FIGS. 24-29 include rotation direction arrows illustrating the direction of
    crown rotation and movement direction arrows illustrating the direction of movement of one
    or more user interface objects, where applicable. The rotation direction arrows and
    movement direction arrows are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are
25  provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In this example, a counterclockwise
    direction rotation of the crown 558 is illustrated by a rotation direction arrow pointing in the
    down direction. The characteristics of the rotation direction arrow are not indicative of the
    distance, speed, or acceleration with which crown 558 is rotated by a user. Instead, the
    rotation direction arrow is indicative of the direction of rotation of crown 558 by the user.
30  [00432]     FIGS. 23-30 illustrate an exemplary physics-based model that can be used to
    control a user's interactions with user interface objects in conjunction with a physical crown
    user input device. In this example, elements 2302, 2304, 2306, 2308 are stationary and focus
    selector 2310 is movable via user input received from crown 558. Counterclockwise
                                                     92

    movement of the crown 558 is associated with a force on the focus selector 2310 in the down
    movement direction.
    [00433]     As described above, using a magnetic relationship between elements 2302, 2304,
    2306, 2308 and focus selector 2310, physics-based modeling can be used to simulate
  5 magnetic attraction between elements 1302, 1304, 1306, 1308 and focus selector 1310. In
    addition, the movement of focus selector 2310 can be further controlled using a physics
    based spring model.
    [00434]     Physics-based modeling of a spring is achieved, for example, by modeling a
    spring attached to elements 2302 and 2308. As the focus selector 2310 moves beyond the
  0 limits of the plurality of selectable elements, a spring engages the focus selector 2310,
    causing the focus selector to "rubberband." For example, virtual springs 2312, 2314 may be
    modeled using Hook's law. Hook's law states that the force needed to extend or compress a
    spring by a distance is proportional to that distance. Phrased differently, F=kx, where
    F=force, k=spring coefficient, and x=distance. Springs 2312, 2314 are typically not part of
  5 the displayed user interface, but are provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures.
    [00435]     At FIG. 23, focus selector 2310 is aligned with element 2308, indicating selection
    of element 2308. At FIG. 24, device 550 determines a change in the position of crown 558 in
    the counterclockwise direction, as indicated by rotation direction arrow 2330. In response to
    determining the change in the position of the crown 558, the device increases the speed of
 '0 focus selector 2310, moving the focus selector 2310 in the down direction, as indicated by
    movement direction arrow 2320. In one example, the focus selector may be associated with a
    mass or may have a calculated inertia.
    [00436]     Because element 2308 is modeled as a magnetic element and focus selector 2310
    is modeled as a ferromagnetic material, there is a magnetic attraction between the two user
25  interface objects.
    [00437]     At FIGS. 24-26, focus selector 2310 extends beyond the range of the selectable
    elements. As a result, spring 2314 engages the focus selector 2310, causing focus selector
    2310 to "rubberband" back, as illustrated in FIGS. 27-30. The spring coefficient of spring
    2310 may be varied to produce results with different characteristics.
30  [00438]     At FIG. 30, focus selector 2310 comes to rest while aligned with element 2308.
    The system interprets this alignment as a selection of element 2308, which is achieved by the
    user manipulating focus selector 2310 through the use of crown 558. In some examples,
    additional input, such as tapping, pressing the crown or another button after the alignment
    may be required for the user to select element 2308.

   [00439]     While element 2308 is selected, the user can activate element 2308 by one or
   more of many techniques. For example, the user may press on a touch-sensitive display,
   press on the touch-sensitive display with force above a predetermined threshold, press a
   button, or simply allow element 2308 to remain selected for a predetermined amount of time.
 5 In another example, aligning an element and a focus selector can be interpreted as both a
   selection and an activation of the element.
   [00440]     In this example, movement of the focus selector is constrained along a predefined
   vertical path. In other examples, movement of the focus selector may be constrained along a
   different predefined path, or may not be constrained to a predefined path. In this example,
 0 alignment in only one axis (the vertical axis) is used to indicate selection of an element. In
   some examples, alignment in two, three, or more axes may be required between an element
   and a focus selector to indicate a selection.
   [00441]     FIG. 31 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 3100 for selecting an element in a
   graphical user interface using a physical crown as an input device. Process 3100 is
 5 performed at a wearable electronic device (e.g., device 550 in FIG. 1) having a physical
   crown. In some examples, the electronic device also includes a touch-sensitive display. The
   process provides an efficient technique for selecting an element from among multiple
   elements in a graphical user interface.
   [00442]     At block 3102, the device causes a display of a plurality of selectable elements on
 0 a touch-sensitive display of a wearable electronic device. The device also causes a display of
   a focus selector. The device uses a physics-based model to simulate magnetic attraction
   between the selectable elements and the focus selector. Each selectable element of the
   plurality of selectable elements is associated with a corresponding magnetic value. The
   magnetic value can be the strength of an element's magnet attraction in terms of its pull
25 force, and each element can have a different magnetic value.
   [00443]     At block 3104, the device receives crown position information. The position
   information may be received as a series of pulse signals, real values, integer values, and the
   like.
   [00444]     At block 3106, the device determines whether a change has occurred in a crown
30 distance value. The crown distance value is based on an angular displacement of the physical
   crown of the wearable electronic device. A change in the crown distance value is indicative
   of a user providing input to the wearable electronic device by, for example, turning the
   physical crown. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has not
   occurred, the system returns to block 3104 and continues receiving crown position
                                                   94

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    information. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has occurred,
    the system continues to block 3108, though the system may continue to receive crown
    position information.
    [00445]     The device also determines a direction based on a direction of rotation of the
  5 physical crown of the wearable electronic device. For example, an up direction can be
    determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical crown. Similarly, a down direction
    can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the physical crown. In other
    examples, a down direction can be determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical
    crown and an up direction can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the
  0 physical crown.
    [00446]     At block 3108, in response to determining the change in the crown distance value,
    the device causes a movement of the focus selector. This movement changes the focus of the
    plurality of selectable elements. At least initially, the movement of the focus selector is in the
    determined direction. The movement of the focus selector may be animated. The movement
  5 has a rate of movement (speed). Additionally, the magnetic values of one or more of the
    selectable elements may be modified based on the speed of the focus selector.
    [00447]     At block 3110, the system determines whether the focus selector has extended
    beyond a predetermined limit. If the system determines that the focus selector has not
    extended beyond a predetermined limit, the system returns to block 3104. If the system
 '0 determines that the focus selector has extended beyond a predetermined limit, the system
    engages a virtual spring at block 3112. The virtual spring causes the focus selector to slow
    down and rubberband back to within the predetermined limit. This mechanism will prevent a
    user from extending a focus selector too far beyond the scope of the selectable elements. At
    block 3104, the system continues to receive crown position information.
25  [00448]     In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
    to the user interface, the system may employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce the
    speed of the focus selector while it is in motion. For example, the speed of the focus selector
    can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a friction coefficient value. This
    physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction, drag friction, or the like.
30  [00449]     In some examples, the device receives an additional input through the rotation of
    the crown before the focus selector reaches a steady state. An object is in a steady state when
    the object is not being translated, rotated, or scaled. In this example, the system determines a
    second change in the crown distance value. The system also determines a second direction,
    which is based on the direction of rotation of the physical crown of the wearable electronic
                                                     95

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    device. In response to determining the second change in the crown distance value, the system
    increases or decreases the speed of the focus selector by applying an additional force to the
    focus selector. The change in the rate of the movement of the focus selector is based on the
    second change in the crown distance value and the second direction.
  5 [00450]     In some examples, once the focus selector aligns with the selection element and is
    in a steady state, the system determines that the selection element has been selected. In other
    examples, additional input, such as tapping, pressing the crown or another button after the
    alignment may be required for the user to select the selection element that aligns with the
    focus selector and is in a steady state.
  0 [00451]     FIGS. 32-38 illustrate an exemplary user interface 3200 displaying multiple user
    interface objects in the form of selectable elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 and
    focus area 3220. A user can select a selection element from among the multiple selectable
    elements by using a physical crown of a wearable electronic device to scroll the selectable
    elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 to align the desired selection element with
  5 focus area 3220. Focus area 3220 is typically not part of the displayed user interface, but is
    provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In some examples, additional input, such
    as tapping, pressing the crown or another button after the alignment may be required for the
    user to select the selection element.
    [00452]     Crown 558 of device 550 is a user rotatable user interface input (e.g., a rotatable
 '0 input mechanism). The crown 558 can be turned in two distinct directions: clockwise and
    counterclockwise. FIGS. 32-38 include rotation direction arrows illustrating the direction of
    crown rotation and movement direction arrows illustrating the direction of movement of one
    or more user interface objects, where applicable. The rotation direction arrows and
    movement direction arrows are typically not part of the displayed user interface, but are
25  provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures. In this example, a clockwise direction
    rotation of the crown 558 is illustrated by a rotation direction arrow pointing in the up
    direction. Similarly, a counterclockwise direction rotation of the crown 558 is illustrated by a
    rotation direction arrow pointing in the down direction. The characteristics of the rotation
    direction arrow are not indicative of the distance, speed, or acceleration with which the crown
30  558 is rotated by a user. Instead, the rotation direction arrow is indicative of the direction of
    rotation of crown 558 by the user.
    [00453]     FIGS. 32-38 illustrate an exemplary scrollable list of elements using a physics
    based model that can be used to control a user's interactions with user interface objects in
    conjunction with a physical crown user input device. In this example, elements 3202, 3204,

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 are scrollable via user input received from crown 558 and the focus
    area 3220 is stationary. Clockwise movement of crown 558 is associated with a force on
    elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 in the up movement direction and
    counterclockwise movement of crown 558 is associated with a force on elements 3202, 3204,
  5 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 in the down movement direction. In this example, elements 3202,
    3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 form a scrollable list of elements.
    [00454]     To facilitate a user's ability to control the movement of the scrollable list of
    elements, a "magnetic" relationship is associated between each user selectable element and
    the focus area 3220. In this example, the value of the magnetic relationship (also referred to
  0 as a magnetic value) between elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 and focus area
    3220 is uniform. In other examples, the magnetic value of elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208,
    3210, 3212 can vary.
    [00455]     Using the magnetic relationship between elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210,
    3212 and focus area 3220, physics-based modeling can be used to simulate magnetic
  5 attraction between elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 and focus area 3220. As
    will be described in further detail below, user interface 3200 causes an attraction between
    elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 and focus area 3220. As a result, when user
    input is not received, the multiple elements scroll to ultimately reach a steady state where one
    element is aligned with focus area 3220. An object is in a steady state when the object is not
 '0 being translated, rotated, or scaled. The alignment of an element with focus area 3220 is
    indicative of the selection of that element. This physics-based magnetic modeling results in
    the user interface exhibiting virtual detents.
    [00456]     In this example, physics-based modeling is achieved, for example, by modeling
    each element 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 as an object made from a magnetized
25  material that creates its own persistent magnetic field and modeling focus area 3220 as a
    material that is attracted to a magnet, such as ferromagnetic materials including iron, cobalt,
    and nickel. In another example, the physics-based modeling can be achieved by modeling
    each element 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 as an object made from a material that is
    attracted to a magnet and modeling focus area 3220 as a material that creates its own
30  persistent magnetic field. In another example, the physics-based modeling can be achieved
    by modeling each element 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 as an object that creates its
    own persistent magnetic field and modeling focus area 3220 as a material that also creates its
    own persistent magnetic field, such as two magnets that attract. Each of these physics-based
    models can be adapted to include magnetic fields that vary, rather than remain persistent,
                                                      97

        WO 2015/034969                                                          PCT/US2014/053961
    based on certain factors, such as the distance between the element and focus area 3220, the
    speed of the elements, the acceleration of the elements, or based on a combination of two or
    more factors. For example, the varying magnetic field may be simulated through the use of
    an electromagnet, which can be turned on and off and can have a varying strength.
  5 [00457]      In one example, the magnetic strengths of elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210,
    3212 vary based on the speed of the scrollable list of elements. As the speed of the scrollable
    list of elements increases, the magnetic strength of elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210,
    3212 are reduced. As the speed of the scrollable list of elements increases, the magnetic
    strength of elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 is increased. As a result, when the
  0 scrollable list of elements is moving quickly, the elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210,
    3212 play a reduced role in changing the speed of the focus area as compared to when the
    scrollable list of elements is moving slowly.
    [00458]      At FIG. 32, element 3204 is aligned with focus area 3220, indicating selection of
    element 3204. At FIG. 33, device 550 determines a change in the position of crown 558 in
  5 the clockwise direction, as indicated by rotation direction arrow 3230. In response to
    determining the change in the position of the crown 558, the device increases the speed of the
    scrollable list of elements, moving the scrollable list of elements in the up direction, as
    indicated by movement direction arrow 3240. In one example, the scrollable list of elements
    may be associated with a mass or may have a calculated inertia.
 '0 [00459]      Because element 3204 is modeled as a magnetic element and focus area 3220 is
    modeled as a ferromagnetic material, there is a magnetic attraction between the two user
    interface objects. The physics-based model of user interface 3200 causes a resistance of the
    movement of element 3204 away from focus area 3220 using this magnetic attraction. An
    element's magnetic value (e.g., the strength of an element's magnet attraction) may be
25  modeled, for example, in terms of its pull force (the elements ability to move other objects).
    The pull force exerted may be based on the pull force of either an electromagnet or a
    permanent magnet as described by the Maxwell equation.
    [00460]      At FIGS. 33 and 34, device 550 continues to determine a change in the position of
    crown 558 in the clockwise direction, as indicated by rotation direction arrow 3220. In
30  response to determining the changes in the position of the crown 558, the device 550 adds
    additional speed to the scrollable list of elements in the up direction. At the same time, the
    magnetic attraction of elements 3202, 3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 with focus area 3220 are
    acting on the scrollable list of elements. For example, at FIG. 34, at least elements 3204 and
    3206 are applying a force to the scrollable list of elements in the down direction as a result of
                                                    98

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    the magnetic physics-based modeling. This is because the elements 3204 and 3206 are
    attracted to the focus area 3220. Elements 3208 and 3210 are applying a force to the
    scrollable list of elements in the up direction as a result of the magnetic physics-based
    modeling. This is because the elements 3208 and 3210 are also attracted to the focus area
  5 3220. In some examples, elements of the scrollable list of elements that are not displayed
    also apply a force to the scrollable list of elements.
    [00461]      The distance between the elements and focus area 3220 also play a role in the
    amount of force the elements apply to the scrollable list of elements. Generally, as the
    distance between the element and the focus area 3220 increases, the intensity of the force
  0 between the element and the focus area 3220 decreases. The rate of change in the intensity of
    the force can be modeled in many ways. For example, the inverse square law may apply the
    intensity of the force as a function of the distance. More specifically, I=1/d2, where I is the
    intensity of the force and d is the distance. In other examples, the magnetic force can vary in
    direct inverse proportion to distance or can vary inversely with the third power of distance.
  5 [00462]      In some examples, the magnetic attraction between an element and a focus area
    only exists while the element is within a predetermined distance from focus area 3220. This
    simplifies calculations because the magnetic force of elements with a distance from focus
    area 3220 that is greater than the predetermined distance are not considered in determining
    the forces applied to the scrollable list of elements.
 '0 [00463]      In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
    to the user interface, the system may also employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce
    the speed of the scrollable list of elements while it is in motion. For example, the speed of
    the scrollable list of elements can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a
    friction coefficient value. This physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction,
25  drag friction, or the like.
    [00464]      At FIGS. 35-38, device 550 determines that there is no change in the position of
    crown 558. As a result of this determination, no additional speed is added to the existing
    speed of the scrollable list of elements. However, the magnetic forces of elements 3202,
    3204, 3206, 3208, 3210, 3212 continue to be applied the scrollable list of elements.
30  Similarly, the physics-based friction model continues to be applied to the scrollable list of
    elements. At FIGS. 35-38, element 3208 has the largest magnetic effect on the scrollable list
    of elements, as compared to the other elements of the scrollable list of elements because
    element 3208 is the closest to focus area 3220. This physics-based magnetic modeling results
    in the user interface exhibiting virtual detents.

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    [00465]      At FIG. 36, as element 3208 overshoots focus area 3220, element 3208 applies a
    force on the scrollable list of elements in the down direction, further reducing the speed of the
    scrollable list of elements. At FIG. 37, the magnetic force applied by element 3208 on the
    scrollable list of elements in the down direction causes the scrollable list of elements to move
  5 down, aligning element 3208 with focus area 3220. The scrollable list of elements comes to
    rest while element 3208 is aligned with focus area 3220. The system interprets this alignment
    as a selection of element 3208, which is achieved by the user manipulating the scrollable list
    of elements through the use of crown 558.
    [00466]      While element 3208 is selected, the user can activate element 3208 by one or
  0 more of many techniques. For example, the user may press on touch-sensitive display 556,
    press on the touch-sensitive display with force above a predetermined threshold, press button
    562, or simply allow element 3208 to remain selected for a predetermined amount of time. In
    another example, aligning an element and a focus area can be interpreted as both a selection
    and an activation of the element. In some examples, additional input, such as tapping,
  5 pressing the crown or another button after the alignment may be required for the user to select
    the element.
    [00467]      User interface 3200 may be used, for example, for text entry on a device with a
    reduced-size display. Each element of the scrollable list of elements can correspond to a
    letter (such as a letter selected from A-Z), a word, a phrase, or a numeral (such as numeral
 '0 selected from 0-9). A user can scroll through the alphanumeric elements, selecting and
    activating the desired elements sequentially to form a word, number, sentence, or the like. In
    examples where elements have various intensities of magnetic strength, the magnetic strength
    of an element associated with a letter of the alphabet may be based on the frequency of that
    letter's use. As a result, certain letters could be more magnetic than other letters, and
25  therefore easier to select.
    [00468]      In this example, movement of the scrollable list of elements is constrained along a
    predefined vertical path. In other examples, movement of the scrollable list of elements may
    be constrained along a different predefined path, or may not be constrained to a predefined
    path. In this example, alignment in only one axis (the vertical axis) is used to indicate
30  selection of an element. In some examples, alignment in two, three, or more axes may be
    required between an element and a focus area to indicate a selection.
    [00469]      FIG. 39 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 3900 for selecting an element in a
    graphical user interface using a physical crown as an input device. Process 3900 is
    performed at a wearable electronic device (e.g., device 550 in FIG. 1) having a physical
                                                     100

        WO 2015/034969                                                         PCT/US2014/053961
    crown. In some examples, the electronic device also includes a touch-sensitive display. The
    process provides an efficient technique for selecting an element from among multiple
    elements in a graphical user interface.
    [00470]     At block 3902, the device causes a display of a plurality of selectable elements on
  5 a touch-sensitive display of a wearable electronic device. The device also registers a focus
    area. The focus area may be, for example, an area, a line, or a point. The device uses a
    physics-based model to simulate magnetic attraction between the selectable elements and the
    focus area. Each selectable element of the plurality of selectable elements is associated with
    a corresponding magnetic value. The magnetic value can be the strength of an element's
  0 magnet attraction in terms of its pull force, and each element can have a different magnetic
    value.
    [00471]     At block 3904, the device receives crown position information. The position
    information may be received as a series of pulse signals, real values, integer values, and the
    like.
  5 [00472]     At block 3906, the device determines whether a change has occurred in a crown
    distance value. The crown distance value is based on an angular displacement of the physical
    crown of the wearable electronic device. A change in the crown distance value is indicative
    of a user providing input to the wearable electronic device by, for example, turning the
    physical crown. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has not
 '0 occurred, the system returns to block 3904 and continues receiving crown position
    information. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has occurred,
    the system continues to block 3908, though the system may continue to receive crown
    position information.
    [00473]     The device also determines a direction based on a direction of rotation of the
25  physical crown of the wearable electronic device. For example, an up direction can be
    determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical crown. Similarly, a down direction
    can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the physical crown. In other
    examples, a down direction can be determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical
    crown and an up direction can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the
30  physical crown.
    [00474]     At block 3908, in response to determining the change in the crown distance value,
    the devices causes a movement of the plurality of selectable elements. The direction of the
    movement is such that a selection element of the plurality of selectable elements gets closer
    to the focus area than it was before the movement. This movement changes the focus of the
                                                    101

    plurality of selectable elements. At least initially, the movement of the plurality of selectable
    elements is in the determined direction. The movement of the plurality of selectable elements
    may be animated. The movement of the plurality of selectable elements has a rate of
    movement (speed).
  5 [00475]      At block 3910, the magnetic values of one or more of the selectable elements are
    modified based on the speed of the plurality of selectable elements. In one example, the
    magnetic values of one or more selectable elements are inversely related to the speed of the
    plurality of selectable elements. For example, when the plurality of selectable elements has a
    speed above a first threshold, the magnetic values of the selectable elements are reduced by a
  0 first factor (e.g. 10) from their original values. When the plurality of selectable elements has
    a speed below the first threshold and above a second threshold, the magnetic values of the
    selectable elements are reduced by a second factor (e.g. 5) from their original values. When
    the plurality of selectable elements further slows down and has a speed below the second
    threshold, the magnetic values of the selectable elements are returned to their original values.
  5 The first factor is larger than the second factor.
    [00476]      In addition, the speed of the plurality of selectable elements is changed because of
    the physics-based magnetic interaction of the plurality of selectable elements with the focus
    area based at least on the magnetic value associated with the selection element. For example,
    the physics-based magnetic attraction of the selection element to the focus area may cause the
 '0 speed of the plurality of selectable elements to increase as the selection element moves
    towards the focus area. Similarly, the physics-based magnetic attraction of the selection
    element to the focus area may cause the speed of the plurality of selectable elements to
    decrease as the selection element moves away from the focus area. Similarly, the magnetic
    interaction of the focus area with other selectable elements of the plurality of selectable
25  elements may cause a change in the speed of the plurality of selectable elements.
    [00477]      In some examples, the magnetic values associated with the selectable elements are
    virtual magnetic strengths based on a virtual pull force between the selectable element and
    the focus area.
    [00478]      In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
30  to the user interface, the system may employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce the
    speed of the plurality of selectable elements while it is in motion. For example, the speed of
    the plurality of selectable elements can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a
    friction coefficient value. This physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction,
    drag friction, or the like.

    [00479]      In some examples, the device receives an additional input through the rotation of
    the crown before the plurality of selectable elements reach a steady state. An object is in a
    steady state when the object is not being translated, rotated, or scaled. In this example, the
    system determines a second change in the crown distance value. The system also determines
  5 a second direction, which is based on the direction of rotation of the physical crown of the
    wearable electronic device. In response to determining the second change in the crown
    distance value, the system increases or decreases the speed of the plurality of selectable
    elements by applying an additional force to the plurality of selectable elements. The change
    in the rate of the movement of the plurality of selectable elements is based on the second
  0 change in the crown distance value and the second direction.
    [00480]      In some examples, once the selection element aligns with the focus area and the
    plurality of selectable elements are in a steady state, the system determines that the selection
    element has been selected.
    [00481]      FIGS. 40-45 illustrate an exemplary user interface 4000 displaying multiple user
  5 interface objects in the form of selectable elements 4002, 4004 and a focus area 4006. A
    scrollable list of elements includes selectable elements 4002, 4004. A user can select a
    selection element from among the multiple selectable elements by using a physical crown of
    a wearable electronic device to move the scrollable list of elements to align a desired
    selection element with the focus area 4006.
 '0 [00482]      Crown 558 of device 550 is a user rotatable user interface input. Crown 558 can
    be turned in two distinct directions: clockwise and counterclockwise. FIGS. 40-45 include
    rotation direction arrows illustrating the direction of crown rotation and movement direction
    arrows illustrating the direction of movement of the scrollable list of elements, where
    applicable. The rotation direction arrows and movement direction arrows are typically not
25  part of the displayed user interface, but are provided to aid in the interpretation of the figures.
    In this example, a counterclockwise direction rotation of crown 558 is illustrated by a rotation
    direction arrow pointing in the down direction. The characteristics of the rotation direction
    arrow are not indicative of the distance, speed, or acceleration with which crown 558 is
    rotated by a user. Instead, the rotation direction arrow is indicative of the direction of
30  rotation of crown 558 by the user.
    [00483]      FIGS. 40-45 illustrate an exemplary physics-based model that can be used to
    control a user's interactions with user interface objects in conjunction with a physical crown
    user input device. In this example, focus area 4006 is stationary and elements 4002, 4004 are
                                                    103

        WO 2015/034969                                                           PCT/US2014/053961
    movable via user input received from crown 558. Counterclockwise movement of crown 558
    is associated with a force on the scrollable list of elements in the down movement direction.
    [00484]      As described above, using a magnetic relationship between focus area 4006 and
    elements 4002, 4004, physics-based modeling can be used to simulate magnetic attraction
  5 between elements focus area 4006 and elements 4002, 4004. In addition, the movement of
    the scrollable list of elements can be further controlled using a physics-based spring model.
    [00485]      Physics-based modeling of a spring is achieved, for example, by modeling a
    spring attached to one or more ends of the scrollable list of elements. As the scrollable list of
    elements moves beyond a predetermined limit, a spring engages the scrollable list of
  0 elements, causing the scrollable list of elements to "rubberband." For example, virtual spring
    4008 in FIGS. 41-44 may be modeled using Hook's law. Hook's law states that the force
    needed to extend or compress a spring by a distance is proportional to that distance. Phrased
    differently, F=kx, where F=force, k=spring coefficient, and x=distance. Spring 4008 is
    typically not part of the displayed user interface, but is provided to aid in the interpretation of
  5 the figures.
    [00486]      At FIG. 40, element 4002 is aligned with focus area 4006, indicating selection of
    element 4002. At FIG. 41, device 550 determines a change in the position of crown 558 in
    the counterclockwise direction, as indicated by rotation direction arrow 4010. In response to
    determining the change in the position of the crown 558, the device increases the speed of the
 '0 scrollable list of elements, moving the elements 4002, 4004 in the down direction, as
    indicated by movement direction arrow 4012. In one example, the scrollable list of elements
    may be associated with a mass or may have a calculated inertia.
    [00487]      Because element 4002 is modeled as a magnetic element and focus area 4006 is
    modeled as a ferromagnetic material, there is a magnetic attraction between the two user
25  interface objects.
    [00488]      At FIGS. 41-42, the scrollable list of elements extends beyond the predetermined
    limit. As a result, spring 4008 engages the scrollable list of elements, causing the scrollable
    list of elements to "rubberband" back, as illustrated in FIGS. 43-45. The spring coefficient of
    spring 4008 may be varied to produce results with different characteristics.
30  [00489]      At FIG. 45, element 4002 comes to rest while aligned with focus area 4006. The
    system interprets this alignment as a selection of element 4006, which is achieved by the user
    manipulating the scrollable list of elements through the use of crown 558. In some examples,
    additional input, such as tapping, pressing the crown or another button after the alignment
    may be required for the user to select element 4006.
                                                    104

   [00490]     While element 4002 is selected, the user can activate element 4002 by one or
   more of many techniques. For example, the user may press on a touch-sensitive display,
   press a button, or simply allow element 4002 to remain selected for a predetermined amount
   of time. In another example, aligning an element and a focus area can be interpreted as both
 5 a selection and an activation of the element.
   [00491]     In this example, movement of the scrollable list of elements is constrained along a
   predefined vertical path. In other examples, movement of the scrollable list of elements may
   be constrained along a different predefined path, or may not be constrained to a predefined
   path. In this example, alignment in only one axis (the vertical axis) is used to indicate
 0 selection of an element. In some examples, alignment in two, three, or more axes may be
   required between an element and a focus area to indicate a selection.
   [00492]     FIG. 46 is a flow diagram illustrating a process 4600 for selecting an element in a
   graphical user interface using a physical crown as an input device. Process 4600 is
   performed at a wearable electronic device (e.g., device 550 in FIG. 1) having a physical
 5 crown. In some examples, the electronic device also includes a touch-sensitive display. The
   process provides an efficient technique for selecting an element from among multiple
   elements in a graphical user interface.
   [00493]     At block 4602, the device causes a display of a plurality of selectable elements on
   a touch-sensitive display of a wearable electronic device. The device also registers a focus
 0 area. The device uses a physics-based model to simulate magnetic attraction between the
   selectable elements and the focus area. Each selectable element of the plurality of selectable
   elements is associated with a corresponding magnetic value. The magnetic value can be the
   strength of an element's magnet attraction in terms of its pull force, and each element can
   have a different magnetic value.
25 [00494]     At block 4604, the device receives crown position information. The position
   information may be received as a series of pulse signals, real values, integer values, and the
   like.
   [00495]     At block 4606, the device determines whether a change has occurred in a crown
   distance value. The crown distance value is based on an angular displacement of the physical
30 crown of the wearable electronic device. A change in the crown distance value is indicative
   of a user providing input to the wearable electronic device by, for example, turning the
   physical crown. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has not
   occurred, the system returns to block 4604 and continues receiving crown position
   information. If the device determines that a change in the crown distance value has occurred,
                                                  105

    the system continues to block 4608, though the system may continue to receive crown
    position information.
    [00496]     The device also determines a direction based on a direction of rotation of the
    physical crown of the wearable electronic device. For example, an up direction can be
  5 determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical crown. Similarly, a down direction
    can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the physical crown. In other
    examples, a down direction can be determined based on a clockwise rotation of the physical
    crown and an up direction can be determined based on a counterclockwise rotation of the
    physical crown.
  0 [00497]     At block 4608, in response to determining the change in the crown distance value,
    the device causes a movement of the plurality of selectable elements. This movement
    changes the focus of the plurality of selectable elements. At least initially, the movement of
    the plurality of selectable elements is in the determined direction. The movement of the
    plurality of selectable elements may be animated. The movement has a rate of movement
  5 (speed). Additionally, the magnetic values of one or more of the selectable elements may be
    modified based on the speed of the plurality of selectable elements.
    [00498]     At block 4610, the system determines whether the plurality of selectable elements
    has extended beyond a predetermined limit. If the system determines that the plurality of
    selectable elements has not extended beyond a predetermined limit, the system returns to
 '0 block 4604. If the system determines that the plurality of selectable elements has extended
    beyond a predetermined limit, the system engages a virtual spring at block 4612. The virtual
    spring causes the plurality of selectable elements to slow down and rubberband back to
    within the predetermined limit. This mechanism will prevent a user from extending the
    plurality of selectable elements too far beyond the predetermined limit. At block 4604, the
25  system continues to receive crown position information.
    [00499]     In some examples, to add additional realism and provide further ease of usability
    to the user interface, the system may employ a physics-based model of friction to reduce the
    speed of the plurality of selectable elements while it is in motion. For example, the speed of
    the plurality of selectable elements can be continuously (or repeatedly) decreased based on a
30  friction coefficient value. This physics-based friction model may simulate kinetic friction,
    drag friction, or the like.
    [00500]     In some examples, the device receives an additional input through the rotation of
    the crown before the plurality of selectable elements reaches a steady state. An object is in a
    steady state when the object is not being translated, rotated, or scaled. In this example, the
                                                    106

    system determines a second change in the crown distance value. The system also determines
    a second direction, which is based on the direction of rotation of the physical crown of the
    wearable electronic device. In response to determining the second change in the crown
    distance value, the system increases or decreases the speed of the plurality of selectable
  5 elements by applying an additional force to the plurality of selectable elements. The change
    in the rate of the movement of the plurality of selectable elements is based on the second
    change in the crown distance value and the second direction.
    [00501]      In some examples, once the selection element of the plurality of selectable
    elements aligns with the focus area and the plurality of selectable elements is in a steady
  0 state, the system determines that the selection element has been selected. In some examples,
    additional input, such as tapping, pressing the crown or another button after the alignment
    may be required for the user to select the selection element.
    [00502]      In some examples, device 550 can provide haptic feedback based on the content
    displayed on the display 556. When a user interface object is displayed on the display 556,
  5 the device can modify the appearance of the object based on a change in a crown distance
    value received at the device 550 based on a rotation of crown 558. When a criterion is
    satisfied, a tactile output is output at the device 550.
    [00503]      In one example, the object is a scrollable list of elements, such as is described
    above. The criterion is satisfied when a beginning or an end of the scrollable list is reached.
 '0 In another example, the object is a zoomable visual element. The criterion is satisfied when a
    maximum or minimum zoom level of the zoomable visual element is reached. In another
    example, the object is a scrollable list of selectable elements. The criterion is satisfied each
    time a selectable element of the scrollable list occupies a selection area.
    [00504]      One or more of the functions relating to a user interface can be performed by a
25  system similar or identical to system 4700 shown in FIG. 47. System 4700 can include
