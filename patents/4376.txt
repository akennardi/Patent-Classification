10 coatings, it can be used as a spice which is mainly used to contain apples, pineapple
   and other flavors, it can also be used as a chromatographic analysis of standard
   substances and solvents, but also used for organic synthesis. However, most of the
   existing synthesis methods are using the method the n-butyl alcohol is heated at 400 C,
   and finally formed by reaction of manganese dioxide. This method needs a very high
15 temperature environment, and high demand for energy consumption, it has higher
   requirements on the heat resistance of the equipment and maintenance costs, it is not
   conducive to reduce the production cost, but also need manganese dioxide as reaction,

   invention provides nitro-cotton intermediates butyl butyrate synthesis method, it is
   unnecessary to use the method that n-butyl alcohol heated at 400C, and finally
   formed by reaction of manganese dioxide. It doesn't need reaction at very high
   temperatures, and reduces the demand for energy consumption, reduces the
20 requirements on the heat resistance of the equipment and maintenance costs, it is
   unnecessary to use manganese dioxide as reaction, and reduce manganese dioxide's
   pollution to the environment, the cost of follow-up pollution treatment is low,
