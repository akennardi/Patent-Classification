                   A wireless controlled decorative string light device
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
                           of performing it known to me/us:-

   Field of the Invention
            The invention relates to a wireless controlled string light device and, more
   specifically but not exclusively, a Christmas wireless controlled string light device
   controlled by a Bluetooth-enabled mobile device.
 5 Background of the Invention
            It is known to provide decorative string lights which typically play a significant
   part in many different festive decorative displays.       Though previously typically used
   during Christmas and on Christmas trees, it is now common to use decorative string lights
   as part of various festive celebrations through the year for both inside and outside displays.
10 The gradual development over the years in technology has produced a more user-friendly
   and safer string light.      String lights were originally produced using mains voltage
   incandescent bulbs, then progressed to extra safe low voltage bulbs, then to LED bulbs to
   Wifi enabled lights, then Bluetooth-enabled extra safe low voltage LED string lights.
            Bluetooth technology has been around for many years and there are existing
15 products available.    It is proposed to provide a decorative LED string light that can be
   controlled manually or by using Bluetooth technology (as opposed to Wifi or infrared
   technology).
            The applicant has identified limitations with existing string light products. More
   specifically, decorative string lights are often placed in locations that are not easily
20 accessible or the controller is not in a convenient position once installed. The applicant
   has determined it would be advantageous to provide an alternative method for controlling
   the decorative string lights in addition to manual control.     It is therefore suggested that
   Bluetooth technology be incorporated directly into the same housing as the plugpack
   transformer that converts the mains AC voltage to extra safe low voltage power (DC)
25 which operate the string lights. This would allow the user to either manually control the
   string lights via a push button or using Bluetooth-enabled devices such as, but not limited
   to smartphones and tablets (via an App).

                                                  -2
            Examples of the invention seek to provide an improved wireless controlled string
   light device which eliminates or at least ameliorates disadvantages of previous string light
   products.
   Summary of the Invention
 5          In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
   wirelessly controlled string light device, including a string light having a plurality of LED
   lights, and a controller unit electrically connected to the string light for controlling
   illumination of the string light, wherein the controller unit has Bluetooth connection
   functionality for receiving illumination commands from a wirelessly connected Bluetooth
10 device, and wherein the controller unit has rigidly mounted on the controller unit electrical
   pins for connection to a supply of electricity such that the controller unit is in the form of a
   plugpack.
            Preferably, the controller unit includes a transformer for transforming the supply of
   electricity into safety extra low voltage electrical supply for the string light.
15          In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
   wirelessly controlled string light device, including a string light having a plurality of lights,
   and a controller unit electrically connected to the string light for controlling illumination of
   the string light, wherein the controller unit has Bluetooth connection functionality for
   receiving illumination commands from a wirelessly connected Bluetooth device.
20          Preferably, the controller unit includes a manual control for controlling illumination
   of the string light.    More preferably, the controller unit includes a manual control for
   controlling selection between a plurality of lighting modes of illumination of the string
   light. Even more preferably, the manual control is in the form of a button for manually
   cycling through said plurality of lighting modes.
25          In a preferred form, the wirelessly controlled string light device includes a plurality
   of string lights and the controller unit controls illumination of each of the string lights.
            Preferably, the string light device includes a motion and/or sound sensor for
   detecting motion and/or sound whereby the controller unit controls illumination of the

                                                 -3
   string light accordingly. More preferably, the motion and/or sound sensor is fitted to the
   controller unit.
            In a preferred form, the wirelessly controlled string light device includes a sensor
   for sensing a condition in response to which the controller unit automatically controls
 5 turning the lights on and/or off.
            Preferably, the controller unit includes a solar panel for electrical supply to the
   string light.
            The controller may also include a battery for electrical supply to the string light.
            In one form, the controller unit includes a plurality of DC sockets on a surface of a
10 casing of the controller unit.

   the accompanying drawings, in which:
            Figure 1 shows a wireless controlled string light device diagrammatically, in
15 accordance with an example of the present invention.
            Figure 2 shows a rear view of a plugpack of the wireless controlled string light
   device of Figure 1;
            Figure 3 shows a side view of the plugpack of Figure 2; and
            Figure 4 shows an underside of the plugpack of Figures 2 and 3.
20 Detailed Description
            With reference to Figure 1, there is shown a string light device which incorporates
   Bluetooth technology directly into the same housing as the plugpack transformer which
   converts the mains AC voltage to extra safe low voltage power (DC) which operates the
   string lights. Advantageously, this allows the user to either manually control the string
25 lights via a push button or using Bluetooth-enabled devices such as smartphones and
   tablets. Figure 1 also shows that a solar panel and/or batteries may be used as a power
   supply for the string light.

                                                 -4
            More specifically, with reference to Figure 1, there is provided a wirelessly
   controlled string light device 10, including a string light 12 having a plurality of LED
   lights 14, and a controller unit 16 electrically connected to the string light 12 for
   controlling illumination of the string light 12.       The controller unit 16 has Bluetooth
 5 connection functionality for receiving illumination commands from a wirelessly connected
   Bluetooth device (not shown). The controller unit 16 has rigidly mounted on the controller
   unit electrical pins 18 (see Figures 3 and 4) for connection to a supply of electricity such
   that the controller unit 16 is in the form of a plugpack. Accordingly, Bluetooth technology
   is incorporated directly into the mains plugpack (transformer) body which provides safe
10 extra low voltage supply to the user-detachable decorative string lights. The lights are
   connected via common DC power line connectors/jacks.
           Advantageously, the main benefits of having the plug in the casing of the controller
   unit 16 include that:
   1.       It avoids messy and entangled cords, which obviously gets worse with length of
15          cables;
   2.      Better product reliability/safety as it avoids chafing or damage to the cord as there
           is none;
   3.      If a cord is used there is a greater likelihood of the plug pins being strained in the
           socket if the casing cannot rest on anything, so casing weight on the cord pulls the
20         plug pins down causing poor contact or for the plug to fall out cutting the power or
           in worst case causing a hot spot and safety concern. This may be avoided if the
           plug point is close to the floor or near a table top but this may not always be the
           case; and
   4.      Avoids animals chewing or children pulling on the dangerous high voltage cord,
25         only SELV power is exposed if a cord is damaged so it is safer.
            The controller unit 16 includes a transformer for transforming the supply of
   electricity into safety extra low voltage electrical supply for the string light 12.

                                                 -5
            With reference to Figure 2, the controller unit 16 may include a manual control 20
   for controlling illumination of the string light 12. The manual control 20 may be arranged
   for controlling selection between a plurality of lighting modes of illumination of the string
   light 12. A range of lighting modes are listed on the rear of the controller unit 16 shown in
 5 Figure 2 as follows:
            1.      ON
            2.      COMBINATION
            3.      WAVE
            4.      ALTERNATING
10          5.      GLOW
            6.      RUNNING FLASH
            7.      FADE
            8.      TWINKLE
            9.      DANCING.
15          The manual control 20 may be in the form of a button 22 for manually cycling
   through said plurality of lighting modes.
            With reference to Figure 1, there are shown on the right-hand side of the
   representation three alternatives including a first alternative where the string light device
   includes a linear string light, a second alternative wherein the string light includes
20 branched string lights, and a final alternative in which the string light device includes
   extended linear string lights connected in series. The string lights 12 may be detachable
   from the controller unit 16 so that the alternatives depicted in Figure 1 can be used
   interchangeably. With the branched string lights in which the string light device includes a
   plurality of string lights 12, the controller unit 16 may be able to control illumination of
25 each of the string lights 12 separately.
            The string light device 10 may include a motion and/or sound sensor for detecting
   motion and/or sound whereby the controller unit 16 controls illumination of the string light
   12 accordingly. The motion and/or sound sensor may be fitted to the controller unit 16.
   Alternatively, the controller unit 16 may be provided with connectors to extend the
30 range/position of external sensors or to potentially use existing Bluetooth connectivity for

                                                -6
   sensors.    Existing string lights may use the mobile device to sense sounds via the
   microphone on the mobile device and then adjust the light display by Bluetooth. This
   system would require that the mobile device be in the range of the Bluetooth modules
   controlling the festive lights which usually means a range of around 10 meters, depending
 5 on other factors.    The applicant has identified that as people will often want to move
   around with their smartphones, it is not ideal to use the sensors on the mobile Bluetooth
   device for this purpose.
           Further distinctions of examples of the present invention over existing string light
   arrangements are discussed in the points below:
10          1.     The Bluetooth technology is incorporated directly into the mains plugpack
   (transformer) body which provides safe extra low voltage supply to the user detachable
   decorative string lights. Lights are connected via common DC power line connectors/jacks.
   The transformer/plugpack will include a manual override button but with the added feature
   of Bluetooth.
15         2.      Examples may provide a portable set of low voltage controllable LED string
   lights separated from the power source rather than an individual Bluetooth controllable
   mains voltage LED bulb ( or separated group of bulbs)
           3.      In an example, the proposed Bluetooth module may be incorporated into the
   mains plugpack body, which still includes a manual override button. Existing products
20 have a Bluetooth module attached directly to the string lights and not directly into the
   transformer (plugpack).     Separating the Bluetooth module from the strings lights allows
   any damaged lights to be easily and cheaply replaced without having to replace the
   Bluetooth module and then having to reset/pair or reprogram the Bluetooth device. It is
   also more cost effective as you house all the electronics in one body.
25         4.      It is often the case that in other Bluetooth designs there is no manual
   override and everything is controlled via the Bluetooth module itself.
           5.      In other designs, Bluetooth is used to control a separate device such as a
   speaker(s) which is connected to a string of lights for effect.     The Bluetooth does not
   control the lights, only the speaker. Examples of the present invention do not require

                                                   -7
   speakers and are able to control the lights by changing colours (if applicable) of the lights
   directly. Examples may also be able to control the sequence of how LEDs flash, or stay on
   or off, or on timer.
            6.      It is also possible to include in the present invention the additional
 5 following technology, if required, such as motion or sound sensing technology so that the
   lights will respond differently to changing external stimuli.
            7.      It is also possible to include a daylight sensor or a sensing circuit (solar
   product), if required, to control when the string lights turn on or off automatically.
            8.      It is also possible to substitute the transformer/plugpack with a solar panel
10 and battery incorporating Bluetooth, if required, to power the string lights for places that
   have no power or installations that are hard to maintain.
            9.      It is also possible to allow a plurality of string lights to be connected into
   the body of the Bluetooth plugpack (rather than into wire hanging off plug pack like
   octopus arms) to create a branching effect of string lights or as an extension onto the
15 existing string lights to create an even longer string. A plugged (weather protected)
   positive/negative power connector would be required at each string end to make the join if
   extending the string light.
            10.     The controller casing is an all-in-one (fully integrated) unit with the mains
   plug encased with the Bluetooth, transformer and string light controller. The unit may be
20 connected to a wall-mounted mains electricity supply socket.
            11.     Examples of the invention use a manual control on the casing as well as
   Bluetooth functionality.
            12.     Rather than controlling each light bulb individually, examples of the present
   invention control each string light segment.
25          13.     In a proposed design multiple string lights are connected to the casing of the
   plug pack.

                                                -8
