               USER INTERFACE IMPROVEMENTS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES
[000 1A] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn> in turn a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2013260724,
the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present invention relates to medical devices. More specifically, the invention relates
to infusion pumps that include touch screen graphical user interfaces.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] Graphical user interfaces for medical devices that display patient and treatment
information have improved clinician efficiency when caring for patients. However, a challenge
for designing graphical user interfaces is the need to balance the amount of information
displayed on any one screen viewable be the clinician with the need to create a device that is
easy to read and navigate. Too often the user is presented with an overwhelming amount of
information, impeding the interaction between the user and the user interface.
[0003] Additionally, medical devices, including medical pumps, can be complicated and time
consuming for caregivers to program. The need for an improved graphical interface is critical to
maintain efficiency of patient care and to reduce potential clinical errors and thereby improve
patient safety. Device interfaces that increase input efficiency and accuracy are critical to
improve patient safety and therapy.
[0004] Graphical user interface design must also take into account strict design parameters as
well as safety parameters. As a result, many medical devices do not provide flexibility in
programming parameters, neither for the administrator nor for the clinician.

                                                2

  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
        [00043]    The present invention will be described as it applies to its preferred
embodiment. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to the preferred
embodiment. It is intended that the invention cover all modifications and alternatives
that may be included within the scope of the appended claims
        [00044]    With reference to FIG. 1, the medication management system
(MMS) 10 of the present invention includes a medication management unit (MMU)
12 and a medical device 14, typically operating in conjunction with one or more
information systems or components of a hospital environment 16. The term hospital
environment should be construed broadly herein to mean any medical care facility,
including but not limited to a hospital, treatment center, clinic, doctor's office, day
surgery center, hospice, nursing home, and any of the above associated with a
home care environment. As discussed below, there can be a variety of information
systems in a hospital environment. As shown in FIG. 1, the MMU 12 communicates
to a hospital information system (HIS) 18 via a caching mechanism 20 that is part of
the hospital environment 16.
        [00045]    It will be understood by those of skill in art that the caching
mechanism 20 is primarily a pass through device for facilitating communication with
the HIS 18 and its functions can be eliminated or incorporated into the MMU 12 (FIG.
1) and/or the medical device 14 and/or the HIS 18 and/or other information systems
or components within the hospital environment 16. The caching mechanism 20
provides temporary storage of hospital information data separate from the HIS 18,
the medication administration record system (MAR) 22, pharmacy information
system (PhIS) 24, physician order entry (POE) 26, and/or Lab System 28. The
caching mechanism 20 provides information storage accessible to the Medication
Management System 10 to support scenarios where direct access to data within the
hospital environment 16 is not available or not desired. For example, the caching
mechanism 20 provides continued flow of information in and out of the MMU 12 in

                                           6
instances where the HIS 18 is down or the connectivity between the MMU 12 and
the electronic network (not shown) is down.
        [00046]   The HIS 18 communicates with a medication administration record
system (MAR) 22 for maintaining medication records and a pharmacy information
system (PhIS) 24 for delivering drug orders to the HIS. A physician/provider order
entry (POE) device 26 permits a healthcare provider to deliver a medication order
prescribed for a patient to the hospital information system directly or indirectly via the
PhIS 24. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that a medication order can be
sent to the MMU 12 directly from the PhIS 24 or POE device 26. As used herein the
term medication order is defined as an order to administer something that has a
physiological impact on a person or animal, including but not limited to liquid or
gaseous fluids, drugs or medicines, liquid nutritional products and combinations
thereof.
        [00047]    Lab system 28 and monitoring device 30 also communicate with the
MMU 12 to deliver updated patient-specific information to the MMU 12. As shown,
the MMU 12 communicates directly to the lab system 28 and monitoring device 30.
However, it will be understood to those of skill in art that the MMU 12 can
communicate to the lab system 28 and monitoring device 30 indirectly via the HIS
18, the caching mechanism 20, the medical device 14 or some other intermediary
device or system.
        [00048]    Delivery information input device 32 also communicates with the
MMU 12 to assist in processing drug orders for delivery through the MMU 12. The
delivery information input device 32 can be any sort of data input means, including
those adapted to read machine readable indicia such as barcode labels; for example
a personal digital assistant (PDA) with a barcode scanner. Hereinafter the delivery
information input device 32 will be referred to as input device 32. Alternatively, the
machine readable indicia may be in other known forms, such as radio frequency
identification (RFID) tag, two-dimensional bar code, ID matrix, transmitted radio ID
code, human biometric data such as fingerprints, etc. and the input device 32
adapted to "read" or recognize such indicia. The input device 32 is shown as a
separate device from the medical device 14; alternatively, the input device 32
communicates directly with the medical device 14 or may be integrated wholly or in
part with the medical device.

                                             7
        [00049]     With reference to FIG. 2, the medication management unit 12
includes a network interface 34 for connecting the MMU 12 to multiple components
of a hospital environment 16, one or more medical devices 14, and any other desired
device or network. A processing unit 36 is included in MMU 12 and performs various
operations described in greater detail below. A display/input device 38
communicates with the processing unit 36 and allows the user to receive output from
processing unit 36 and/or input information into the processing unit 36. Those of
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that display/input device 38 may be provided
as a separate display device and a separate input device.
        [00050]     An electronic storage medium 40 communicates with the
processing unit 36 and stores programming code and data necessary for the
processing unit 36 to perform the functions of the MMU 12. More specifically, the
storage medium 40 stores multiple programs formed in accordance with the present
invention for various functions of the MMU 12 including but not limited to the
following programs: Maintain Drug Library 42; Download Drug Library 44; Process
Drug Order 46; Maintain Expert Clinical Rules 48; Apply Expert Clinical Rules 50;
Monitor Pumps 52; Monitor Lines 54; Generate Reports 56; View Data 58; Configure
the MMS 60; and Monitor the MMS 62. The Maintain Drug Library 42 program
creates, updates, and deletes drug entries and establishes a current active drug
library. The Download Drug Library 44 program updates medical devices 14 with the
current drug library. The Process Drug Order 46 program processes the medication
order for a patient, verifying that the point of care (POC) medication and delivery
parameters match those ordered. The Maintain Expert Clinical Rules 48 program
creates, updates, and deletes the rules that describe the hospital's therapy and
protocol regimens. The Apply Expert Clinical Rules 50 program performs logic
processing to ensure safety and considers other infusions or medication orders,
patient demographics, and current patient conditions. The Monitor Pumps 52
program acquires ongoing updates of status, events, and alarms transmitted both
real-time and in batch mode, as well as tracking the location, current assignment,
and software versions such as the drug library version residing on medical device 14.
The Monitor Lines 54 program acquires ongoing updates of status, events and
alarms for each channel or line for a medical device 14 that supports multiple drug
delivery channels or lines. The Generate Reports 56 program provides a mechanism
that allows the user to generate various reports of the data held in the MMU storage

                                           8
medium 40. The View Data 58 program provides a mechanism that supports various
display or view capabilities for users of the MMU 12. The Notifications 59 program
provides a mechanism for scheduling and delivery of events to external systems and
users. The Configure the MMS 60 program provides a mechanism for system
administrators to install and configure the MMS 10. The Monitor the MMS 62
program enables information technology operations staff capabilities to see the
current status of MMS 10 components and processing, and other aspects of day-to
day operations such as system start up, shut down, backup and restore.
        [00051]    With reference to FIG. 3, the various functional programs 42-62 of
the MMU 12, each including separate features and rules, are partitioned (at a higher
level than shown in FIG. 2) and logically organized into interrelated managing units
of the MMU 12. As shown, the MMU 12 includes an asset manager 64, an alarm
manager 66, a drug library manager (such as, for example, is included in HOSPIRA
MEDNET software) 68, a caregiver manager 70, a therapy manager 72, and/or a
clinical data manager 73. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that
additional or alternative hospital system managing units can be provided without
departing from the present invention. Additionally, the MMU 12 includes a master
adjudicator 74 between the separate interrelated hospital system managing units 64
73 of the MMU 12, to regulate the interaction between the separate management
units.
        [00052]    Further, while the MMU 12 as described herein appears as a single
device, there may be more than one MMU 12 operating harmoniously and sharing
the same database. For example the MMU 12 can consist of a collection of MMU
specific applications running on distinct servers in order to avoid a single point of
failure, address availability requirements, and handle a high volume of requests. In
this example, each individual server portion of the MMU 12 operates in conjunction
with other server portions of the MMU 12 to redirect service requests to another
server portion of the MMU 12. Additionally, the master adjudicator 74 assigns
redirected service requests to another server portion of the MMU 12, prioritizing each
request and also ensuring that each request is processed.
        [00053]    With reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the managing units 64-72 each
include separate features and rules to govern their operation. For example, the asset
manager 64 governs the execution of the Monitor Pumps 52 and Monitor Lines 54
programs; the drug library manager 68 governs the execution of the Drug Library 42

                                             9
and Download Drug Library 44 programs; the therapy manager 72 governs the
execution of the Process Drug Order 46, Maintain Expert Clinical Rules 48, and
Apply Expert Clinical Rules 50 programs; and the clinical data manager 73 governs
the execution of the Generate Reports 56 and View Data 58 programs. Other
distribution of the functional MMU programs 42-62 among the hospital system
managing units 64-73 can be made in accordance with the present invention.
         [00054]    With reference to FIG. 4, an electronic network 114 connects the
MMU 12, medical device 14, and hospital environment 16 for electronic
communication. The electronic network 114 can be a completely wireless network, a
completely hard wired network, or some combination thereof.
         [00055]    FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating several functional
components of a medical device 14 for implementing the present invention. Those of
ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the device 14 includes many more
components than those shown in FIG. 4. However, it is not necessary that all these
components be shown in order to disclose an illustrative embodiment for practicing
the present invention.
         [00056]    In the context of the present invention, the term "medical device"
includes without limitation a device that acts upon a cassette, reservoir, vial, syringe,
or tubing to convey medication or fluid to or from a patient (for example, an enteral
pump, a parenteral infusion pump, a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) or pain
management medication pump, or a suction pump), a monitor for monitoring patient
vital signs or other parameters, or a diagnostic, testing or sampling device.
         [00057]    With reference to FIG. 5, for the purpose of exemplary illustration
only, the medical device 14 is disclosed as an infusion pump. More particularly, the
medical device 14 can be a single channel infusion pump, a multi-channel infusion
pump (as shown), or some combination thereof.
         [00058]    With reference to FIG 4, the pump style medical device 14 includes
a network interface 112 for connecting the medical device 14 to electronic network
114. Where a wireless connection to the electronic network 114 is desired, network
interface 112 operates an antenna for wireless connection to the electronic network
114. The antenna can project outside the device 14 or be enclosed within the
housing of the device.
         [00059]    A processor 118 is included in the medical device 14 and performs
various operations described in greater detail below. The input/output device 120

                                           10
allows the user to receive output from the medical device 14 and/or input information
into the medical device 14. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that
input/output device 120 may be provided as a single device such as a touch screen
122, or as a separate display device and a separate input device (not shown). In the
preferred embodiment, the display screen 122 of the medical pump 14 is a thin film
transistor active matrix color liquid crystal display with a multi-wire touch screen. A
membrane generally impermeable to fluids overlays the display screen 122 so the
user can press on images of keys or buttons on the underlying screen with wet
gloves, dry gloves or without gloves to trigger an input.
        [00060] A memory 124 communicates with the processor 118 and stores
code and data necessary for the processor 118 to perform the functions of the
medical device 14. More specifically, the memory 124 stores multiple programs
formed in accordance with the present invention for various functions of the medical
device 14 including a graphical user interface program 126 with multiple subparts
described in greater detail below.
        [00061]    With reference to FIG. 5, the present invention provides a machine
readable input device 130. The machine-readable input device 130 communicates
with the medical device 14 to input machine-readable information to the medical
device 14. The machine-readable input device 130 can communicate, directly or
indirectly, with the medical device 14 via a wireless or hard-wired connection. The
machine-readable input device 130 can be a device that is separate from but
associated or in communication with the medical device 14. The machine-readable
input device 130 can be any sort of data input means, including those adapted to
read machine-readable indicia, such as a barcode scanner or handheld personal
digital assistant (PDA). Alternatively, the machine-readable input device 130 may be
operable to read in other known forms of machine-readable information, such as
radio frequency identification tags (RFID), touch memory, digital photography,
biometrics, etc.
        [00062]    With reference to FIG. 5, the medical device 14 is a multi-channel
pump having a first channel 132 with first channel machine-readable label 134 and a
second channel 136 with a second channel machine-readable label 138. A user of
the medical device 14 operates the machine-readable input device 130 to select a
channel from one or more channels 132 and 136, by scanning in the associated
machine-readable label 134 or 138.

                                           11
        [00063]   The user selects the desired channel 132 or 136 by using the
machine-readable input device 130 to scan a factory or hospital programmed,
unique, machine-readable label 134 or 138 that is electronically generated and
presented on the screen 122, preferably juxtapositioned near the respective channel
132 or 136. Alternatively, the machine-readable labels 134 and 138 are physically
affixed to the medical device 14, preferably on or juxtapositioned near the channel
132 and 136, respectively. Since the machine-readable labels 134 and 138 are
generated and/or can be stored in memory 124 by the pump 14, the pump 14 can
associate the machine-readable labels 134 and 138 to the channels 132 or 136. The
pump 14 then allows the user to program and activate the selected channel 132 or
136. The user may also manually select the desired channel by touching an
appropriate folder tab on the touch screen. The folder tabs are labeled and/or
physically arranged on the screen so as to be proximate to the corresponding
channel 132 or 136.
        [00064]   In a further aspect of the wireless embodiment, all the medical
devices can periodically broadcast a unique wireless device/channel IP address
and/or a self-generated unique machine-readable label (for example, a barcode) 134
or 138 that can also be presented on the screen 122. Alternatively, the machine
readable labels 134 and 138 are physically affixed to or posted on the medical
device 14. Each medical device will correlate such broadcasted or posted
device/channel IP addresses and/or barcodes with a particular patient, who is also
identified by a unique machine readable label (not shown) or patient IP address. The
user associates the desired pump(s) or channel(s) 132, 136 with the patient by using
the machine-readable input device 130 to scan the unique machine-readable labels
134, 138 and the patient's machine readable label. This causes the appropriate
pump processor(s) 118 to associate the appropriate pump channel(s) 132, 136 with
the patient. Then the pumps or channels can associate, communicate, and
coordinate with each other wirelessly.
        [00065]   With reference to FIGS. 4, 5, 5A and 17A to 17C, the graphical user
interface program 126 reallocates screen 122 for a medical device 14. Specifically,
FIG. 5 and 17B illustrates a multi-channel infusion pump 14 with a split touch screen
122 having a first channel screen portion 140 associated with first channel 132 and a
second channel screen portion 142 associated with the second channel 136. Each
channel screen portion 140 and 142 presents a subset of the delivery information

                                           12
regarding the respective channels 132 or 136, including without limitation therapeutic
agent name, concentration, dose rate, VTBI, and alarm information, in a font size
that it is easily readable by a user from a distance such as, for example, from
approximately fifteen to twenty feet (4.6-6.2 meters) away. This is what is referred to
as a "far view" delivery screen. The far view delivery screens display subsets of the
information found on the relevant "near view" delivery screens, illustrated in FIGS.
17A and 17C. The near view delivery screen displays information such as, drug
name, concentration, dose rate, time remaining, VTBI, volume remaining, and alarm
name for the highest priority alarm if in an alarm state.
         [00066] In practice, the delivery screen displays a near view when the user
is programming the device as illustrated by FIG. 5A. The near view delivery screen
will switch to the far view delivery screen after a predetermined period of time that is
predetermined by the manufacturer, configurable by the facility via the drug library,
and/or set by the caregiver at the pump, for example after 20 seconds. Often, the
user does not want to wait for the predetermined length of time to view the far
screen. FIGS. 17A to 17C illustrate one embodiment of a medical device that allows
the user to switch from the near view screen to the far view screen and vice versa at
any time, in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 17A illustrates a near view
screen for channel A 1705. If, while in the near view screen, the user wants to view
the far view screen, the user touches anywhere within the body 1710 of the near
view screen. Touching the body 1710 of the near view screen displays the far view
screen 1720 illustrated in FIG. 17B. Referring to FIG. 17B, upon a user touching one
of the tabs "A" or "B" or anywhere on the channel screen portions 1725 or 1730 of
the far view delivery screen, a "near view" delivery screen is presented on the screen
(FIG. 17C). In one embodiment, the user touches a "hotspot" or special toggle
button within the body of the current display screen to return to either the far view
screen or the near view screen.
         [00067]    Referring to FIG. 18, a flow chart for a program 1800 to immediately
transition the display screen between the near view screen and the far view screen is
illustrated. Program 1800 begins at block 1801 and progresses to block 1802 where
the program determines that the near view delivery screen is displayed. In one
aspect of the invention, program 1800 progresses in block 1804 to block 1803 when
a near view time out elapses. In another aspect of the invention, program 800
moves from block 1802 to block 1803 when a user touches the near view hotspot in

                                          13
block 1805. Program 1800 may return to the near view screen, block 1802, from the
far view screen, block 1803, when a user touches the far view screen in block 1806.
        [00068]    Returning to FIG. 5, the channel screen portion 140 or 142 selected
or corresponding to the tab selected expands in area but the size of at least some of
the text therein is shrunk, as shown in FIG. 17A. The shrinkage of one of the
channel screen portions 140 and 142 and enlargement of its counterpart provides
additional space for one or more data display or data entry fields to be placed on
screen 122, as shown in FIG. 5A. As discussed below, data displays or data entry
fields are placed on screen 122 in space previously occupied by portions of the
channel screen portion 140 or 142. This reallocation of space on screen 122 permits
the user to enter inputs more easily since the data entry field can be large, preferably
at least as large or, more preferably, larger in area than the original channel screen
portions 140 and 142 were in the delivery screen mode. Additionally, the reallocation
of space on screen 122 provides greater space for presenting information on the
channel being adjusted or monitored. Further details on the reallocation of screen
 122 and the near view and far view delivery screens can be found in commonly
owned and co-pending application USSN 11/103,235 entitled USER INTERFACE
IMPROVEMENTS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES filed on April 11, 2005, which is
expressly incorporated herein in its entirety.
        [00069]    Referring again to FIG. 5, pump 14 includes dedicated or fixed
tactile infuser buttons, and images of buttons on the LCD-touch screen 122. The
fixed tactile buttons 133, 135, 137, and 139 provide the following functions:
LOAD/EJECT button 133--opens and closes the cassette carriage; ON/OFF button
 135--turns power on and off; ALARM SILENCE button 137--silences a silenceable
alarm for a specified period of time, for example two minutes; and EMERGENCY
STOP button 139--stops all channels.
        [00070]    The LCD color touch screen 122 allows the user to access and use
on-screen button images, for example 3D button images, and data entry fields. The
touch screen 122 uses a membrane over the LCD display so a single keypress does
not cause significant infusion pole movement nor is it mistaken for a double
keypress. The touch screen also accommodates a keypress whether the user is
wearing wet gloves, dry gloves, or no gloves.
        [00071]    LCD touch screen button images 143, 145, 147 and 149A-149E are
 located as shown in FIGS. 5 and 5A and perform the following functions: Patient

                                          14
Information Tab 143--displays the clinical care area, preselected patient information
(including without limitation name, ID number, etc.), and provides access to a more
detailed patient information screen (FIG. 9C); Channel Level Therapy Buttons 145-
accessed by button images on the infuser touch screen, are used to select an
infusion therapy; Program Level Buttons 147--accessed by pressing areas, drop
down list triangles, boxes or text boxes on the programming screen, are used to
select dose parameters of an infusion; and Device Level Buttons 149A-149E at the
bottom of the touch screen are used to display and control device level features,
including without limitation Mode 149A (for example, Operational or Biomed), Logs
 149B, Locks 149C, Settings 149D, and Calculator display 149E. A wireless indicator
image 102 displayed at the bottom of the screen 122 indicates that the device 14 is
connected and ready for communication.
        [00072]    By using the Channel Level Therapy Buttons 145 and the Program
Level Buttons 147, the healthcare practitioner can program each individual channel
of the pump with specific fluid therapies in a variety of weight- and body surface
area-based units such as micrograms/kg/hour, grams/m 2/hr, and other delivery
specifications for the following modes: Basic Therapy--includes dose calculation,
which allows dose rate programming based on volume to be infused (VTBI), drug
amount, infusion time and drug concentration and simple rate programming that
allows programming of volumetric rate (mL/hr) based upon VTBI and time; Bolus
delivery --allows user to program a single uninterrupted discrete delivery based on
dose amount and time (the bolus can be delivered from the primary or a secondary
container); Piggyback delivery --allows user to program the delivery of a secondary
infusion, to be delivered through the same cassette as the primary infusion (the
primary infusion is paused until the piggyback VTBI completes); and Advanced
 Programming. Advanced Programming mode provides various types of programs
including: Multistep--which allows a sequential delivery of fluid in up to 10 steps, with
fluid volumes and delivery rates programmable for each step based on Rate and
Volume or Volume and Time; Variable Time--which allows up to 24 dose calculation
steps at specified clock times; Intermittent--a calculated dose or step to be delivered
at regular intervals; and Taper--a delivery that ramps up and/or ramps down to a
plateau rate.
        [00073]    With reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, the graphical user interface 126
provides channel indicators presented on screen 122. The channel indicators

                                          15
associate on-screen programming, delivery, and alarm information with a particular
delivery channel by using graphical depictions such as a channel indication icon 154,
 155. The channel indication icon 154 or 155 is a graphical item clearly associating
on-screen programming, delivery, and alarm information with a specified associated
delivery channel. The channel indication icons 154 and 155 are located on a tab 158
associated with a specified delivery channel of the medical device The channel
indication icon 154 or 155 may include but is not limited to a user readable letter or
number, a machine-readable indicator 134, or a combination thereof. The graphical
user interface program 126 also provides a drip indicator icon 160 and an infusion
status icon 156 presented on screen 122.
        [00074]    With reference to FIGS. 4, 5, 5A and 19A to 20, in one embodiment
of the present invention, the graphical user interface 126 provides quick titration
buttons 1910, 1912 presented on a far view screen 122, 1922. FIG. 19A illustrates
quick titration buttons for VTBI 1910 and Rate 1912. In another or the same
embodiment, graphical user interface 1922 may also have a quick titration button for
"dose" or other titration parameters. Quick titration buttons 1910, 1912 operate as
explode or active buttons that when pressed take a user to a standard data entry
field for data entry when the button is selected. In this manner, with one press of a
button the user can be quickly taken to the desired data entry location rather than
having to back track through several screens as is common. The quick titration
buttons, thus, increase the users efficiency in programming the medical device in
accordance with the present invention. FIGS. 19A to 19G illustrate the use of the
VTBI quick titration button 1910. In practice, the user presses quick titration button
1910 (FIG. 19A) to bring up data entry field 1930 in FIG. 19B. In this embodiment,
data entry field is a numerical keypad for entering a value for the VTBI. Once the
desired value 1935 is entered, the user is prompted to use the keypad to cancel the
entry by pressing the cancel button 1940, delete the entry by pressing the clear
button 1945, or save the change and continue by pressing the enter button 1950
(FIG. 19C). FIG. 19D illustrates that the user pressed the enter button 1950 to
accept and change the VTBI entry. At the graphical user interface illustrated in FIG.
19D, the user has the option to press "Next A" 1955 to continue, "Cancel Titration"
1960 to cancel the titration, or Options 1965 to edit the program. FIG. 19E illustrates
that the user pressed "Next A" 1955 to continue. FIG. 19E illustrates a confirmation
screen 1970. At this screen, the user is instructed to press "Start Titration A" 1975 to

                                           16
confirm the VTBI change and begin the infusion. At screen 1980 illustrated in FIG.
19F, the user can stop the titration by pressing "Stop Basic A" 1985. The near view
screen 1980 illustrated in FIG. 19F returns to a far view screen 1990 shown in FIG.
19G.
         [00075]   FIG. 20 is a flow chart of a program 2000 for operating quick
titration buttons for "dose," "rate" and "VTBI" as discussed above. Program 2000
begins at block 2001 and progresses to block 2005 which indicates that the pump is
delivering an infusion and displaying the far view delivery screen (see FIG. 19A).
Program 2000 moves to block 2010 when a user presses one of the quick titration
buttons 1910, 1912. In response to the pressing of the quick titration button, at block
2015 the program 2000 changes the display to the programming screen for the
therapy which is currently delivering (e.g. Channel A or B). After the transition to the
near view screen, program 2000 determines at blocks 2020 and 2025 which button
was pressed. If the program determines that the Dose button was pressed the
program displays the dose numeric keypad, block 2030. If the program determines
that the rate button 1912 was pressed, the program displays the rate numeric
keypad. If the program determines that neither the dose nor the rate button was
pressed, the program displays the VTBI numeric keypad. Those with skill in the art
will recognize that program 2000 can determine which button was pressed in any
order other than that described herein. Once the keypad for the chosen button is
displayed, the user inputs the desired data and continues with the program to
confirm and run the infusion with the changed parameter as described above and
illustrated in FIGS. 19A to 19G.
         [00076]   With reference to FIGS. 14 to 16, in another aspect of the present
invention, the drug library, located within the medication management system and
downloaded to the medical device, can be configured to display either the VTBI or
the volume infused as a default setting on the far view delivery screen. In another or
the same embodiment, the user can change the default setting at the medical
device, as provided in more detail below.
         [00077]   With reference to FIG. 14, illustrated is a screen shot of a graphical
user interface 1400 for changing a plurality of settings of a drug library for a chosen
CCA. In this example, the CCA is the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), though it should be
understood that device settings for other CCAs may be similarly configured. The
drug library includes drug and device related information, which may include but is

                                            17
not limited to drug name, drug class, drug concentration, drug amount, drug units,
diluent amount, diluent units, dosing units, delivery dose or rate, medication
parameters or limits, device/infuser settings and/or modes, CCA designations and
constraints, and library version. Through the maintain drug library program 42 the
drug library may be configured to provide a medical device 14 that includes a
customized display. In one embodiment, the display is customized based on the
Clinical Care Area (CCA) the medical device 14 is located in, assigned to, and/or to
be assigned to.
         [00078]   Once the drug library graphical user interface 1400 for the chosen
CCA is displayed, the administrator sets the "default far view setting" 1405 to either
VTBI 1410 or volume infused 1415. FIG. 14 shows that VTBI 1410 has been
selected as the default far view setting 1405.
         [00079]   With reference to FIGS. 15A to 15C, a user of a medical device
having a default far view setting 1405 can change the default setting. To change the
default far view setting 1405, the user presses settings button 1525 to access the
settings screen 1522. Next, the user presses the far delivery screen button 1530 to
access the settings far delivery screen interface 1535 illustrated in FIG. 15B. In this
illustration, the default setting was set to display VTBI 1545. To change the default
to display "volume infused" the user accesses pull down menu 1550 (FIG. 15C) by
activating arrow 1540. Pressing the Volume Infused button 1555 will change the
default setting to display the volume infused instead of the VTBI. The user can press
the save button (FIG. 15B) or the cancel button 1560 (FIG. 15C) for no change to the
default setting.
         [00080]   With reference to FIG. 16, illustrated is a flow chart of a program
1600 for determining at the medical device whether the VTBI should be displayed or
the volume infused should be displayed, as described above. Program 1600 begins
at block 1601 and proceeds to block 1605 where the display is about to switch from
the near view to the far view. Prior to the switch program 1600 determines the
display parameter based on the default far view setting 1405 from the drug library for
the CCA chosen by the user or the most recent setting established by the user at the
device. Based on the current display parameter setting, program 1600 determines at
block 1610 whether to display the VTBI. If yes, program 1600 proceeds to 1615 to
display VTBI on the far view screen. If no, program 1600 moves to block 1620 to
display the volume delivered on the far view screen. Program 1600 ends at 1625. In

                                            18
another embodiment, the near view screen display parameter settings could be
similarly configured and/or adjusted.
        [00081]    With reference to FIGS. 5, 6A and 6B, illustrated is graphical user
interface 600 of an input device 38 within MMU 12 that is used to configure, within a
medication management system all of the associated medical devices 14 as a part of
the master infuser setup 610. Pursuant to the present invention, graphical user
interface 600 is used by authorized personnel to configure medical device
programming parameters. Infusion devices such as the pump 14 require an
administration set to perform the infusion. In one embodiment, the administration set
is a cassette. The below discussion is in relation to a cassette, however, other types
of administration sets as known in the art may be used in accordance with the
present invention. Prior art devices require that the cassette be in place prior to
programming the pump for an infusion. There are some circumstances within the
hospital environment, however, where this requirement is inefficient and wasteful of
expensive supplies that go unused, merely because the clinical caregiver has set up
an infusion just in case it is need in, for example, the OR, ER or the ICU. In other
situations, the time it takes to program a pump only when it is needed may be
harmful to the patient, especially in the OR and the emergency room. Conversely,
disallowing the programming of a medical device without a cassette may enhance
patient safety by, for example, reducing the risk of line confusion during setup.
        [00082]    Therefore, in one aspect of the present invention, the drug library,
via the master infuser setup 610, can be configured by a hospital administrator
based on hospital policy and procedure. FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate the configurable
parameter 620 of allowing programming of infusion pumps with or without a cassette
in place. Thus, at graphical user interface 600, an administrator may choose to allow
programming without a cassette by selecting "yes" 630 (FIG. 6B) or disallow
programming without a cassette by selecting "no" 640 (FIG. 6A). FIG. 7A illustrates
a warning message 720 that appears on screen 700 when a user tries to program
the medical device without a required cassette. Once the cassette is loaded, the
programming can continue. FIG. 7B illustrates how a programming screen would
appear if the programming was started with a cassette in place, whether or not
required, or if programming was started without a cassette which has been allowed
by the configuration of the master infuser setup 610.

                                            19
       [00083]     With reference to FIG. 8, a flow chart of a program 800 for
determining at the medical device whether the drug library within the memory of the
medical device allows the medical device to be programmed with or without a
cassette in place. Program 800 begins at 801 and proceeds to 805 where upon
some user interaction (e.g. power on), program 800 proceeds to block 810 where the
program 800 receives an indication that the user is starting to program a therapy.
Upon receiving the indication, program 800 determines at block 815 whether a
cassette is required for programming. If no, the program allows the user to proceed,
block 820 and the program ends at block 835. However, if at block 815 it is
determined that a cassette is required, program 800 determines at block 825
whether a cassette is in place. If yes, program 800 proceeds to block 820 to allow
the user to continue and the program ends at 835. If, at block 825, program 800
determines that a cassette is not present, a warning message 720 is displayed that
indicates to the user that a cassette is required. The user may either place a
cassette as required and continue or discontinue the attempted programming.
       [00084]    Another aspect of the present invention allows the user to modify
the CCA without the interruption of a current infusion. FIGS. 9A to 11 illustrate
various embodiments of allowing the user to modify the CCA "on the fly." The ability
to change the CCA is this manner increases user and workflow efficiency. In
particular, the ability to change the CCA while an infusion is running is crucial where
a patient is being transported from one CCA to another such as from the emergency
room (ER) to the OR, or from the OR to the ICU. This ability to change the CCA also
enhances patient safety where time to wait for an infusion to end may be harmful to
the patient. FIGS. 9A to 9G illustrate a series of screen shots of a medical device
configured to allow the CCA to be changed while an infusion is ongoing on another
channel of the multi-channel pump.
       [00085]     FIG. 9A illustrates that a therapy is delivering on channel A 910 with
the ICU CCA 915. In this example, a user wants to change the CCA and program
Channel B 920. The user selects channel B by pressing tab B 925, which brings up
the channel B programming display screen 930 shown in FIG. 9B. Moving from FIG.
9B to FIG. 9C, the patient information button 940 has been pressed. Pressing the
patient information button displays a patient information data field 950 for entry of
patient data and changing the CCA 960. When the user presses the CCA button, a
"Change CCA" message 965 appears requesting that the user confirm that the CCA

                                          20
is to be changed (FIG.9D). In this example, the user wants to change the CCA from
ICU to Gen Med. To confirm, the user presses the "yes" button 970. In response to
the confirmation, a "multiple CCAs" system message 975 appears. To confirm, the
user presses the "OK" button 980. Once the OK button 980 has been pressed, the
CCA has been changed at 985 and a "Done" button 990 is displayed to continue with
the programming of the infusion at infusion screen 995 (FIG. 9G).
        [00086]   With reference to FIG. 10, illustrated is a program 1000 for
changing the CCA at a multi-channel medical device 14. Program 1000 starts at
1001 and proceeds to block 1005 where it is determined that the user has changed
the CCA. Program 1000 then determines at block 1010 whether the new CCA is the
same as the old CCA for Channel A. If yes, the program proceeds to block 1020 to
retain the old CCA on Channel A. If no, program 1000 proceeds to block 1015 to
determine whether channel A is idle. If yes, program accepts the new CCA on
channel A at block 1025. If no, channel A is set to wait at block 1030 until either 1)
the user changes the CCA while waiting on channel A (block 1060), whereby
program 1000 proceeds to 1005; or 2) channel A becomes idle (block 1065),
whereby program 1000 proceeds to block 1025 and accepts the new CCA on
channel A.
        [00087]   Additionally, when a user has changed a CCA (block9 1005),
channel B is evaluated. Program 1000 proceeds from block 1005 to block 1035 to
determined whether the new CCA is the same as the old CCA for Channel B. If yes,
the program proceeds to block 1045 to retain the old CCA on Channel B. If no,
program 1000 proceeds to block 1040 to determine whether channel B is idle. If yes,
program 1000 accepts new CCA on channel B, block 1050. If no, channel B is set to
wait at block 1055 until either 1) the user changes the CCA while waiting for channel
B (block 1070), whereby program 1000 proceeds to 1005 or 2) channel B becomes
idle (block 1075), whereby program 1000 proceeds to block 1050 and accepts the
new CCA on channel B.
        (00088]   With reference to FIG. 11, illustrated is a program 1100 for
changing the CCA at a single channel medical device. Program 1100 starts at 1101
and proceeds to block 1105 where it is determined that the user has changed the
CCA. Program 1100 then determined at block 1110 whether the new CCA is the
same as the old CCA. If yes, the program proceeds to block 1120 to retain the old
CCA. If no, program 1100 proceeds to block 1115 to determine whether the channel

                                           21
is idle. If yes, program 1100 accepts the new CCA, block 1125. If no, the channel is
set to wait at block 1130 until either 1) the user changes the CCA while waiting
(block 1160), whereby program 1100 proceeds to 1105; or 2) the channel becomes
idle (block 1170), whereby program 1100 proceeds to block 1125 and accepts the
new CCA.
         [00089]    With reference to FIGS. 12A to 13, illustrated is another aspect of
the present invention that allows a medical device 14 user to modify the VTBI
parameter to specify additional fluid when an infusion is nearing completion or is
delivering in a KVO (keep vein open) mode. A configured medical device that
includes a program to allow the additional fluid provides for more efficient workflow
as well as a more efficient user. In one embodiment of the invention, the program for
allowing additional VTBI maintains all other delivery parameters while allowing the
user to specify the additional VTBI. Thus, the user does not have to re-enter
common delivery parameters when only an additional VTBI is needed. This reduces
programming effort, saves time and reduces the potential for errors.
         [00090]    FIGS. 12 A to 12F illustrate, using a series of screen shots, one
embodiment of a program for modifying the VTBI delivery parameter. At FIG. 12A, a
basic infusion is delivering on channel A, as shown by screen display 1200. At this
point in the infusion, FIG. 12A shows that the remaining VTBI is 45.3 mL. FIG. 12B
illustrates that the user has pressed "basic" button 1210. A data entry field 1220
appears based on the pressing of the basic button 1210. At data entry field 1220,
the user can press the particular field to edit. FIG. 12C illustrates that the user
pressed the VTBI button 1230 to edit the VTBI. In response to pressing the VTBI
button 1230 a keypad 1240 appears on the display screen. Here, the user enters
the total amount of VTBI desired. In this example, the user enters 75 via the keypad
1240 into the data field for VTBI 1245. The user then presses "Enter" 1250 to save
the changes and continue. Alternatively, the user can press "Clear" 1255 to delete
the entry or cancel 1260 to exit without saving the changes. FIG. 12D illustrates that
the VTBI has been changed to 75 mL and entered. FIG. 12D also illustrates that the
time remaining has been recalculated and is displayed in area 1270 based on the
new VTBI displayed in area 1265. At FIG. 12E, a confirmation of titration screen
1275 has appeared to confirm the new VTBI. The user confirms the change to the
VTBI by pressing "Start Titration" button 1280. FIG. 12F illustrates that the infusion
has been updated with the new VTBI and is continuing to run. In one embodiment,

                                           22
the method illustrated in FIGS. 12A to 12F is used to add to the VTBI the fluid
remaining in the fluid container that is currently infusing. In another embodiment, the
user may add a new container of fluid as long as all other delivery parameters
remain the same as the currently running infusion.
        [00091]    FIG. 13 is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a method
1300 for adding additional VTBI to a current infusion. Method 1300 starts at block
 1301 and proceeds to block 1305 where it is determined that the pump is delivering
a programmed therapy. Method 1300 continues at block 1310 where the
programmed VTBI reached zero and the KVO delivery starts. At block 1315, a user
accesses a VTBI programming screen 1220 and enters a VTBI value 1245. The
user confirms the new value at block 1320 and starts the new delivery. Method 1300
ends at 1325. One skilled in the art will appreciate from the disclosure herein that
such adding of VTBI can also be adapted for use in bolus or piggyback situations.
        [00092]    With reference to FIGS. 21A to 22, one embodiment of the present
invention provides for improved callback rules for the medical device. Medical
devices generally have three classes of callback alarms based on urgency: High
Urgency (e.g. Air-In-Line); Medium Urgency (e.g. Inactivity callback); and Low
Urgency (e.g. Battery not Charging). In one embodiment of the invention, the alarms
are configured at the drug library. In one embodiment, the alarms are configured at
the drug library based on the CCA in which the medical device resides. In another
embodiment, the alarms are configured at the drug library master infuser settings so
that the alarm configurations apply to all medical devices within the medication
management system. In other embodiments, the alarms are configurable by the
clinician at the medical device. For example, in one embodiment, default alarm
settings were configured at the drug library, and sent to the medical device where,
depending on the alarm configuration rules set by the hospital administration, a
clinician may modify the alarm based on factors such as the particular CCA, or
personal preference.
        [00093]    In one embodiment of the invention, a specific alarm type or
configuration is assigned to each class of urgency such that a clinician can
determine the urgency of the callback alarm upon hearing the alarm. In one
embodiment of the invention, each class of alarm is assigned a different melody, a
different tone or series of tones and/or a different volume. In other embodiments, the
frequency of the alarm is configured based on the class of alarm. In other

                                           23
embodiments, the volume, melody, tone and/or frequency may escalate based on a
non-response by the clinician.
        [00094]    In one embodiment of the invention, when an audible alarm occurs
at the medical device, the audio volume starts at the volume setting configured at the
drug library and or by the clinician. However, if the alarm is not acknowledged, the
volume is automatically escalated to a predetermined volume after a predetermined
time out period passes. In one embodiment, the time out period is configurable at
the drug library. In another embodiment, the time out period is configurable at the
drug library for each particular CCA. In yet another embodiment, the time out period
is configurable at the medical device. In another embodiment, a default value for the
time out period is set at the drug library and may be changed at the medical device
to a value that does not exceed the default value. For example, if the default time
out period is 20 seconds, the user may set the time out period to less than 20
seconds such as for 10 seconds. In on embodiment of the invention, the volume
escalates for only those alarms in the High Urgency class of alarms. In other
embodiments, the volume escalates for both High Urgency and Medium Urgency
classes of alarms.
        [00095]    In another embodiment of the present invention, the alarm tone
escalates after a predetermined time out period if the alarm is not acted upon. In this
embodiment, a default tone set at the drug library may be configurable by a user at
the medical device. In one embodiment, the pitch of the tone becomes higher when
the alarm escalates due to the non-response of the clinician.
        [00096]    In another embodiment of the present invention, the alarm
comprises a predetermined tone melody. In one embodiment, a different tone
melody is chosen for each class of alarm urgency or priority. In one embodiment,
the High Urgency audible alarm is a sequence of six or seven tones that continually
repeat until the alarm is acted upon by the clinician. In one embodiment, a brief
pause of the tone sequence (melody) occurs between each repeat of the sequence.
In one embodiment, the melody for the High Urgency alarm also escalates in volume
with continued inactivity by the clinician. In one embodiment, the volume of the
melody escalates after a predetermined length of time. In one embodiment, the
escalation of volume is configured at the drug library. In another embodiment, the
volume escalation is set as a default in the drug library and is further configurable at
the medical device by the clinician.

                                           24
        [00097]   In another or the same embodiment, the Medium Urgency audible
alarm is a sequence of three tones. In one embodiment, the tone sequence
(melody) repeats after a predetermined length of time if the clinician has not
responded to the alarm. In one embodiment the predetermined length of time is 1 to
2 minutes. In another embodiment, the predetermined length of time is from 1 to 60
seconds. In one embodiment, the predetermined length of time is configured at the
drug library. In another embodiment, the predetermined length of time is set as a
default at the drug library and is further configurable by the clinician at the medical
device.
        [00098]   In another embodiment, the Low Urgency audible alarm is a
sequence of two tones. In one embodiment, the tone sequence repeats every two to
ten minutes until acted upon by the clinician. The time to repeat may be configured
as above for the Medium Urgency alarm.
        [00099]   In one embodiment, the High Urgency alarms are configured to
have a melody with a very fast paced tempo. While the lesser urgency alarms have
a melody with a slower paced tempo. In one embodiment, an alarm comprising a
melody escalates in tempo when the alarm is not responded to by the user. In one
embodiment, the alarm is configurable by the user at the medical device to a melody
of the user's choice. In an example, a melody may be assigned to each user
whereby the user sets the alarm on each medical device the user is responsible for
to that one melody. In this manner, any one user in a location with multiple users
can identify by sound that the alarm is for a medical device of a patient under their
specific care.
        [000100]   FIG. 21A illustrates a screen shot of a medical device showing that
a channel level callback alarm 2110, 2115 has sounded for each channel A and B
where a therapy was partially programmed and no other action was taken by the
user. FIG. 21B illustrates a device level callback alarm 2120 has appeared because
no keypress was made while a popup 2125 was displaying.
        [000101] With regard to FIG. 22, a flow chart of a program 2200 for
escalating an audible callback alarm, in accordance with the present invention.
Program 2200 begins at 2201 and proceeds to block 2205 where an alarm has been
activated. At block 2210, program 2200 determines whether the clinician has
acknowledged the alarm during a timeout period. If yes, program 2200 proceeds to
end at 2235. If no, program 2200 proceeds to block 2215 where a determination is

                                          25
made as to whether the current volume is at a maximum level. If no, program
proceeds to block 2220 where the program increases the alarm volume. If yes at
block 2215, program 2200 proceeds to block 2225 to determine whether the melody
is at a High Urgency and has a melody change been configured. If yes, program
2200 proceeds to end at 2235. If no at block 2225, program 2200 proceeds to block
2230 to change the melody. Program 2200 then proceeds to end at block 2235.
         [000102] When an alarm occurs on a medical device it may apply to the
entire device (e.g. low battery) or it may only apply to a specific channel (e.g.
inactivity callback on channel A). If the alarm is channel specific, the user needs to
navigate to the channel to view what is causing the callback. In another aspect of
the present invention, a device program automatically takes the user to the precise
location of the alarm when the user touches the alarm display area on the display
screen as will be described below with reference to FIGS 23A to 23C.
         [000103] FIGS. 23A to 23C are screen shots of a display interface for a multi
channel infusion pump. In this example, the infusion pump has a therapy
programmed for both channel A and channel B. Channel A is idle waiting for the
bolus programmed on channel B to complete. FIG. 23A shows that an alarm 2310
has occurred on channel B based on the completion of the bolus infusion
programmed on channel B. The drug library or the user had previously configured
the pump to stop the infusion or request the pump generate a callback to them when
the bolus was complete. When the user presses alarm tab B 2315 the user is taken
directly to the display screen 2320 for channel B. Display screen for channel B
indicates that the bolus is completed.
         [000104] FIG. 23A also illustrates that an alarm 2325 has occurred for
channel A. When the user presses alarm tab A 2330, the user is taken directly to
display screen 2335shown in FIG. 23C. Display screen 2335 indicates to the user
the pump is waiting for input from the user. The user must clear the alarm and
provide the necessary input before the infusion scheduled on channel A may be
started by pressing Start 2340. The ability for a user to navigate quickly to the cause
of the alarm improves efficiency of the user as well as workflow. Additionally, the
ability to navigate directly to the cause of the alarm decreases or eliminates errors
that may occur if the user had to take many steps to navigate to the appropriate
display screen.

                                            26
        [000105] With reference to FIG 24, a flow chart for one embodiment for a
program 2400 for navigating directly to a cause of an alarm is shown in accordance
with the present invention. Program 2400 begins at block 2401 and proceeds to
block 2405 where an alarm has been activated. In response to the alarm, an
acknowledgement is received from the user in response to the user pressing an
alarm tab in block 2410. Program 2400 determines at block 2415 whether the alarm
was for channel A. If yes, the program proceeds to block 2420 where the program
navigates to the screen on channel A from where the alarm is arising if the current
screen is allowed to be navigated away from. At block 2425, the user takes
appropriate action in relation to the alarm. If, at block 2415, the program determines
that the alarm is not for channel A, program 2400 proceeds to block 2430 where it is
determined whether the alarm is for channel B. If yes, the program proceeds to
block 2435 where the program navigates to the screen on channel B from where the
alarm is arising if the current screen is allowed to be navigated away from. If at
block 2430, the alarm is not for channel B, program 2400 proceeds to block 2440. At
block 2440, the program determines that no navigation is required and proceeds to
block 2425 where the user is instructed to take a specific action. Program 2400
ends at 2445.
        [000106] In another embodiment of the present invention, the drug library
may be configured to allow for a dose back calculation during the programming of an
infusion delivery. During the programming of an infuser for a dose-based therapy
(e.g. weight or BSA based therapy), the user must enter the dose first before being
allowed to enter the rate. In certain clinical scenarios it is preferable for the user to
enter the rate first and the dose is calculated from the rate. Providing this flexibility
to the user and the hospital administration allows for increased efficiency and better
work flow.
        [000107]    FIG. 25 illustrates a graphical user interface 2500 for configuring a
drug library. A default "dose back calculate" can be set at 2510. To enable the dose
back calculation at the medical device, an administrator selects "enabled" 2520. To
disable the dose back calculation at the medical device, the administrator selects
"disabled" 2530.
        [000108] FIG. 26A is a screen shots of a medical device that allows for the
dose back calculation as determined within the drug library. The user is allowed to
enter dose, rate, etc. in any order as further described below. FIG. 26B is a screen

                                           27
shot of a medical device that disallows for the dose back calculation as determined
within the drug library. The user is forced by the user interface to enter the dose
first.
         [000109] With reference to FIG. 27, illustrated is a flow chart of a program
2700 residing in the medical device for programming a drug and calculating a dose.
Program 2700 begins at 2701 and proceeds to block 2705 where the program
determines if the user selected a dose-based drug. If not, program 2700 proceeds to
block 2710 where program 2700 determines whether the dose back calculation is
enabled at the drug library. If yes, program 2700 proceeds to block 2715, where
program 2700 enables dose, rate, VTBI, time and/or weight/BSA fields. Program
2700 proceeds to 2720 where it is determined whether the user entered the dose or
the rate. If dose, program 2700 proceeds to block 2725 to calculate rate based on
the provided dose. If rate, program 2700 proceeds to block 2735 to calculate the
dose based on the provided rate.
         [000110] If at block 2710 the dose-back calculation is not enabled, program
2700 proceeds to block 2740 where program 2700 enables a dose field as well as
weight/BSA if required. Program 2700 proceeds to block 2745 where a dose is
provided as well as weight/BSA if required. Next, a rate is calculated based on the
entered dose. Program 2700 proceeds to block 2755 where rate, VTBI and time
fields are enabled. Program 2700 ends at 2730.
         [000111] One skilled in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that the
functionality shown in the figures and described herein is made possible by computer
program code, and as such those features could be combined, distributed or shared
among the processors of the pump 14, the MMU 12, or other computers within the
healthcare facility without detracting from the present invention. Those skilled in the
art will also recognize from this disclosure that selecting the CCA and providing other
information or input can be done via scanning or passively receiving input from drug
containers, a patient identifier, a nurse identifier or other similar items.
         [000112] While the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are
presently considered to be preferred, various changes and modifications can be
made without departing from the scope of the invention. The scope of the invention
is indicated in the appended claims, and all changes and modifications that come
within the meaning and range of equivalents are intended to be embraced therein.
