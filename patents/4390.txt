                                         BACKGROUND
           Cancer represents the phenotypic end-point of multiple genetic lesions that endow
   cells with a full range of biological properties required for tumorigenesis. Indeed, a
   hallmark genomic feature of many cancers, including, for example, B cell cancer, lung
15 cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer, is the presence
   of numerous complex chromosome structural aberrations, including translocations,
   intra-chromosomal inversions, point mutations, deletions, gene copy number changes,
   gene expression level changes, and germline mutations, among others.
           The need still exists for identifying novel genetic lesions associated with cancer.
20 Such genetic lesions can be an effective approach to develop compositions, methods and
   assays for evaluating and treating cancer patients.
                                            SUMMARY
           The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of novel inversion events
25 that include a fragment of a KIF5B gene ("Kinesin Family Member 5B- RET
   proto-oncogene") and a fragment of a RET proto-oncogene in a cancer, e.g., a lung
   cancer, referred to herein as "KIF5B-RET." The term "KIF5B-RET" or "KIF5B-RET
   fusion" is used generically herein, and includes any fusion molecule (e.g., gene, gene
   product (e.g., cDNA, mRNA, or polypeptide), and variant thereof) that includes a
30 fragment of KIF5B and a fragment of RET, including, e.g., a 5'KIF5B-3'RET.
           In one embodiment, a KIF5B-RET fusion includes an in-frame fusion of an exon
   of KIF5B (e.g., one more exons encoding a kinesin motor domain or a fragment thereof)
                                                     1

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   and an exon of RET (e.g., one or more exons encoding a RET tyrosine kinase domain or
   a fragment thereof). For example, the KIF5B-RET fusion can include an in-frame fusion
   of at least exon 15 of KIF5B or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 1-15 of KIF5B or a
   fragment thereof) with at least exon 12 of RET or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 12-20
 5 of RET or a fragment thereof). In certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is in a 5'
   KIF5B to 3'-RET configuration referred to herein as "5'KIF5B-3'RET." A KIF5B-RET
   fusion polypeptide encoded by a 5'KIF5B-3'RET nucleic acid is sometimes referred to
   herein as a 5'KIF5B-3'RET polypeptide. In an embodiment, the 5'KIF5B-3'RET fusion
   comprises sufficient KIF5B and sufficient RET sequence such that the 5'KIF5B-3'RET
10 fusion has kinase activity, e.g., has elevated activity, e.g., kinase activity, as compared
   with wild type RET, e.g., in a cell of a cancer referred to herein. In one embodiment, the
   5'KIF5B-3'RET fusion comprises at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, or 11 exons from
   KIF5B and at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 10, RET exons. In one embodiment, the
   5'KIF5B-3'RET fusion polypeptide includes a kinesin motor domain, a coiled coil
15 domain, or a functional fragment thereof, and a RET tyrosine kinase domain or a
   functional fragment thereof.
            The RET proto-oncogene is associated with cancerous phenotypes, including
   papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN),
   phaeochromocytoma, among others. For example, chromosomal rearrangements that
20 generate a fusion gene resulting in the juxtaposition of the C-terminal region of the RET
   protein with an N-terminal portion of another protein (known as RET/PTC) are known to
   be associated with PTC (Nikiforov, YE (2002) Endocr. Pathol. 13 (1):3-16). The
   RET/PTC has been shown to cause constitute activation of the RET kinase domain,
   which is a likely contributor to tumorigenicity. The KIF5B-RET fusions disclosed herein
25 (e.g., the 5'- KIF5B to 3'-RET fusions that include a RET tyrosine kinase domain) are
   associated with cancers, e.g., lung cancer. Elevated expression of the 3' end of RET
   beginning in exon 12 is detected in lung tumor samples, suggesting that the KIF5B-RET
   fusion transcript can result in RET kinase domain overexpression.
            In other embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion includes an in-frame fusion of at
30 least exon 11 of RET or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 1-11 of RET or a fragment
   thereof) with at least exon 16 or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 16-25 of KIF5B or a
   fragment thereof). In certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is in a 5'- RET to 3'
                                                   2

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   KIF5B configuration referred to herein as "5'RET-3'KIF5B"). The 5'RET-3'KIF5B
   configuration of the fusion molecule is not believed to be expressed.
           Accordingly, the invention provides, methods of: identifying, assessing or
   detecting a KIF5B-RET fusion; methods of identifying, assessing, evaluating, and/or
 5 treating a subject having a cancer, e.g., a cancer having a KIF5B-RET fusion; isolated
   KIF5B-RET nucleic acid molecules, nucleic acid constructs, host cells containing the
   nucleic acid molecules; purified KIF5B-RET polypeptides and binding agents; detection
   reagents (e.g., probes, primers, antibodies, kits, capable, e.g., of specific detection of a
   KIF5B-RET nucleic acid or protein); screening assays for identifying molecules that
10 interact with, e.g., inhibit, 5'KIF5B-3'RET fusions, e.g., novel kinase inhibitors; as well
   as assays and kits for evaluating, identifying, assessing and/or treating a subject having a
   cancer, e.g., a cancer having a KIF5B-RET fusion. The compositions and methods
   identified herein can be used, for example, to identify new KIF5B-RET inhibitors; to
   evaluate, identify or select subject, e.g., a patient, having a cancer; and to treat or prevent
15 a cancer.

           In one aspect, the invention features a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an isolated or
   purified) nucleic acid molecule that includes a fragment of a KIF5B gene and a fragment
20 of a RET proto-oncogene. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule includes a

   kinesin motor domain or a fragment thereof), and an exon of RET (e.g., one or more
   exons encoding a RET tyrosine kinase domain or a fragment thereof).
           In an embodiment the 5'KIF5B-3'RET nucleic acid molecule comprises sufficient
25 KIF5B and sufficient RET sequence such that the encoded 5'KIF5B-3'RET fusion has
   kinase activity, e.g., has elevated activity, e.g., kinase activity, as compared with wild
   type RET, e.g., in a cell of a cancer referred to herein. In an embodiment the encoded
   5'KIF5B-3'RET fusion comprises at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, or 11 exons from
   KIF5B and at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, or 10, RET exons. In one embodiment, the

   coil domain, or a functional fragment thereof, and a RET tyrosine kinase domain or a
   functional fragment thereof.

   acid molecules includes a nucleotide sequence in the region of 32,316,376-32,316,416 of

   molecule includes a nucleotide sequence that includes a breakpoint, e.g., a breakpoint
   identified in FIGs. 1, 2 and 3A-3D. For example, the nucleic acid molecule includes a
   nucleotide sequence that includes the fusion junction between the KIF5B transcript and
10 the RET transcript, e.g., a nucleotide sequence that includes a portion of SEQ ID NO: 1
   (e.g., a nucleotide sequence within exons 1-15 of a KIF5B gene and 12-20 of a RET
   gene) (e.g., a portion of SEQ ID NO:1 comprising nucleotides 1720-1731, 1717-1734, or
    1714-1737 of SEQ ID NO:1 (see FIG. 3B)).
            In other embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule includes a KIF5B-RET fusion
15 having a configuration shown in FIGs. 2B and 3A-3D. For example, the KIF5B-RET
   fusion can include an in-frame fusion of at least exon 15 of KIF5B or a fragment thereof
   (e.g., exons 1-15 of KIF5B or a fragment thereof) with at least exon 12 of RET or a
   fragment thereof (e.g., exons 12-20 of RET or a fragment thereof). In certain
   embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is in a 5'-KIF5B to 3'-RET configuration referred

     WO 2013/028817                                                          PCT/US2012/051978
   disclosed herein, e.g., is capable of hybridizing under a stringency condition described
   herein to a nucleotide sequence complementary to SEQ ID NO: 1 or a fragment thereof.
   The nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding an exemplary 5'KIF5B-3'RET fusion is
   shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, and the amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:2.

   acid encoding KIF5B-RET, or a transcription regulatory region of KIF5B-RET, and
   blocks or reduces mRNA expression of KIF5B-RET.
   Nucleic Acid Detection and CapturingReagents
 5          The invention also features a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., nucleic acid fragment,
   suitable as probe, primer, bait or library member that includes, flanks, hybridizes to,
   which are useful for identifying, or are otherwise based on, the KIF5B-RET fusions
   described herein. In certain embodiments, the probe, primer or bait molecule is an
   oligonucleotide that allows capture, detection or isolation of a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic
10 acid molecule described herein. The oligonucleotide can comprise a nucleotide sequence
   substantially complementary to a fragment of the KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid
   molecules described herein. The sequence identity between the nucleic acid fragment,
   e.g., the oligonucleotide, and the target KIF5B-RET sequence need not be exact, so long
   as the sequences are sufficiently complementary to allow the capture, detection or
15 isolation of the target sequence. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid fragment is a probe
   or primer that includes an oligonucleotide between about 5 and 25, e.g., between 10 and
   20, or 10 and 15 nucleotides in length. In other embodiments, the nucleic acid fragment
   is a bait that includes an oligonucleotide between about 100 to 300 nucleotides, 130 and
   230 nucleotides, or 150 and 200 nucleotides, in length.
20          In one embodiment, the nucleic acid fragment can be used to identify or capture,
   e.g., by hybridization, a KIF5B-RET fusion. For example, the nucleic acid fragment can
   be a probe, a primer, or a bait, for use in identifying or capturing, e.g., by hybridization, a
   KIF5B-RET fusion described herein. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid fragment can
   be useful for identifying or capturing a KIF5B-RET breakpoint, e.g., as identified in FIG.
25  1. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid fragment hybridizes to a nucleotide sequence
   within a chromosomal rearrangement that creates an in-frame fusion of exon 15 of
   KIF5B with exon 12 of RET (e.g., a sequence within an 11MB pericentric inversion on
   chromosome 10). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid fragment hybridizes to a
   nucleotide sequence in the region of 32,316,376-32,316,416 of chromosome 10 coupled
30 to (e.g., juxtaposed to) nucleotides in the region of nucleotides 43,611,042-43,611,118 of
   chromosome 10. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid fragment hybridizes to a
   nucleotide sequence that includes a breakpoint, e.g., a breakpoint as identified in FIGs. 1,
                                                  7

      WO 2013/028817                                                          PCT/US2012/051978
   2 and 3A-3D. For example, the nucleic acid fragment can hybridize to a nucleotide
    sequence that includes the fusion junction between the KIF5B transcript and the RET
   transcript, e.g., a nucleotide sequence that includes a portion of SEQ ID NO: 1 (e.g., a
   nucleotide sequence within exons 1-15 of a KIF5B gene and 12-20 of a RET gene) (e.g.,
 5  a portion of SEQ ID NO:1 comprising nucleotides 1720-1731, 1717-1734, or 1714-1737
    of SEQ ID NO:1 (see FIG. 3B)).
            The probes or primers described herein can be used, for example, for FISH
   detection or PCR amplification. In one exemplary embodiment where detection is based
    on PCR, amplification of the KIF5B-RET fusion junction can be performed using a
10 primer or a primer pair, e.g., for amplifying a sequence flanking the KIF5B-RET fusion
   junctions described herein, e.g., the mutations or the junction of a chromosomal
   rearrangement described herein. In one embodiment, a pair of isolated oligonucleotide
   primers can amplify a region containing or adjacent to a position in the KIF5B-RET
   fusion. For example, forward primers can be designed to hybridize to a nucleotide
15  sequence within KIF5B genomic or mRNA sequence (e.g., a nucleotide sequence within
   exons 1-15 of a KIF5B gene, or nucleotides 1-1725 of SEQ ID NO:1), and the reverse
   primers can be designed to hybridize to a nucleotide sequence within RET (e.g., a
   nucleotide sequence within exons 12-20 of RET, or nucleotides 1725-2934 of SEQ ID
   NO:1).
20          In another embodiment, the nucleic acid fragments can be used to identify, e.g.,
   by hybridization, a 5'RET-3'KIF5B fusion. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid
   fragment hybridizes to a nucleotide sequence that include a fusion junction between the
   RET transcript and the KIF5B transcript, e.g., a nucleotide sequence within SEQ ID
   NO:3 (e.g., a sequence comprising nucleotides 2131-2142, 2128-2145, or 2125-2148 of
25  SEQ ID NO:3 (see FIG. 4B)).
            In other embodiments, the nucleic acid fragment includes a bait that comprises a
   nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule
   described herein, and thereby allows the capture or isolation said nucleic acid molecule.
   In one embodiment, a bait is suitable for solution phase hybridization. In other
30 embodiments, a bait includes a binding entity, e.g., an affinity tag, that allows capture and
    separation, e.g., by binding to a binding entity, of a hybrid formed by a bait and a nucleic

    KIF5B-RET-expressing cell, with an agent that inhibits an activity or expression of
30  KIF5B-RET (e.g., a kinase inhibitor). In one embodiment, the contacting step can be
   effected in vitro, e.g., in a cell lysate or in a reconstituted system. Alternatively, the
   method can be performed on cells in culture, e.g., in vitro or ex vivo. In other
                                                     11

   embodiments, the method can be performed on KIF5B-RET-expressing cells present
   in a subject, e.g., as part of an in vivo (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic) protocol. In
   an embodiment the method is practiced on an animal subject (e.g., an in vivo animal
   model). In certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is a nucleic acid molecule or
 5 a polypeptide as described herein.
            In a related aspect, a method of inhibiting, reducing, or treating a
   hyperproliferative disorder, e.g., a cancer, in a subject is provided. The method
   includes administering to the subject a preselected therapeutic agent, e.g., an anti
   cancer agent (e.g., a kinase inhibitor), as a single agent, or in combination, in an
10 amount sufficient to reduce, inhibit or treat the activity or expression of KIF5B-RET
   (e.g., a KIF5B-RET fusion described herein), thereby inhibiting, reducing, or treating
   the hyperproliferative disorder in the subject. "Treatment" as used herein includes,
   but is not limited to, inhibiting tumor growth, reducing tumor mass, reducing size or
   number of metastatic lesions, inhibiting the development of new metastatic lesions,
15 prolonged survival, prolonged progression-free survival, prolonged time to
   progression, and/or enhanced quality of life.
            In one embodiment, the kinase inhibitor is administered based on a
   determination that a KIF5B-RET fusion is present in a subject, e.g., based on its
   present in a subject's sample. Thus, treatment can be combined with a KIF5B-RET
20 detection or evaluation method, e.g., as described herein, or administered in response
   to a determination made by a KIF5B-RET detection or evaluation method, e.g., as
   described herein. In certain embodiments, the kinase inhibitor is administered
   responsive to acquiring knowledge or information of the presence of the KIF5B-RET
   fusion in a subject. In one embodiment, the kinase inhibitor is administered
25 responsive to acquiring knowledge or information on the subject's genotype, e.g.,
   acquiring knowledge or information that the patient's genotype has a KIF5B-RET
   fusion. In other embodiments, the kinase inhibitor is administered responsive to
   receiving a communication (e.g., a report) of the presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion
   in a subject (e.g., a subject's sample). In yet other embodiments, the kinase inhibitor
30 is administered responsive to information obtained from a collaboration with another
   party that identifies the presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion in a subject (e.g., a
   subject's sample). In other embodiments, the kinase inhibitor is administered
                                                     12

   responsive to a determination that the KIF5B-RET fusion is present in a subject. In
   one embodiment, the determination of the presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion is
   carried out using one or more of the methods, e.g., the sequencing methods, described
   herein. In other embodiments, the determination of the presence of the KIF5B-RET
 5 fusion includes receiving information on the subject's KIF5B-RET fusion genotype,
   e.g., from another party or source.
            The methods can, optionally, further include the step(s) of identifying (e.g.,
   evaluating, diagnosing, screening, and/or selecting) a subject at risk of having, or
   having, a KIF5B-RET fusion. In one embodiment, the method further includes one or
10 more of: acquiring knowledge or information of the presence of the KIF5B-RET
   fusion in a subject (e.g., a subject's sample); acquiring knowledge or information on
   the subject's genotype, e.g., acquiring knowledge or information that the patient's
   genotype has a KIF5B-RET fusion; receiving a communication (e.g., a report) of the
   presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion in a subject (e.g., a subject's sample); or
15 collaborating with another party that identifies the presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion
   in a subject.
            In one embodiment, the subject treated has a KIF5B-RET fusion; e.g., the
   subject has a tumor or cancer harboring a KIF5B-RET fusion. In other embodiments,
   the subject has been previously identified as having a KIF5B-RET fusion. In yet
20 other embodiments, the subject has been previously identified as being likely or
   unlikely to respond to treatment with a protein kinase inhibitor, e.g., a subject that has
   previously participated in a clinical trial. In other embodiments, the subject has been
   previously identified as being likely or unlikely to respond to treatment with a protein
   kinase inhibitor, based on the presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion. In one
25 embodiment, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a human. In one embodiment, the subject
   has, or at risk of having a cancer at any stage of disease. In other embodiments, the
   subject is a patient, e.g., a cancer patient.
            In other embodiments, the subject treated is a cancer patient who has
   participated in a clinical trial. For example, the subject participated in a clinical trial
30 that evaluated a kinase inhibitor (e.g., a multikinase inhibitor, a RET kinase inhibitor).
   In other embodiment, the subject participated in a clinical trial that evaluates upstream

   or downstream targets of RET. In one embodiment, said cancer patient responded to
   the kinase inhibitor evaluated.
           In certain embodiments, the cancer is a solid tumor, a soft tissue tumor, or a
   metastatic lesion. In one embodiment, the cancer is chosen from a lung cancer, a
 5 pancreatic cancer, melanoma, a colorectal cancer, an esophageal-gastric cancer, a

   chosen from one or more of the following: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
   small cell lung cancer (SCLC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma of
   the lung, bronchogenic carcinoma, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the
10 lung cancer is NSCLC or SCC.
           In one embodiment, the anti-cancer agent is a kinase inhibitor. For example,
   the kinase inhibitor is a multi-kinase inhibitor or a RET-specific inhibitor. In one
   embodiment, the kinase inhibitor is chosen from lenvatinib (E7080) (Eisai Co.),
   sorafenib (NEXAVAR®), sunitinib (SUTENT®, SU 11248), vandetanib
15 (CAPRELSA®, ZACTIMA®, ZD6474), NVP-AST487, regorafenib (BAY-73-4506),
   motesanib (AMG 706), cabozantinib (XL-184), apatinib (YN-968D1), or DCC-2157.
           In other embodiments, the anti-cancer agent is a KIF5B-RET antagonist
   inhibits the expression of nucleic acid encoding KIF5B-RET. Examples of such
   KIF5B-RET antagonists include nucleic acid molecules, for example, antisense
20 molecules, ribozymes, RNAi, triple helix molecules that hybridize to a nucleic acid
   encoding KIF5B-RET, or a transcription regulatory region, and blocks or reduces
   mRNA expression of KIF5B-RET.
           In other embodiments, the kinase inhibitor is administered in combination with a
   second therapeutic agent or a different therapeutic modality, e.g., anti-cancer agents,
25 and/or in combination with surgical and/or radiation procedures. For example, the
   second therapeutic agent can be a cytotoxic or a cytostatic agent. Exemplary cytotoxic
   agents include antimicrotubule agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, or taxanes,
   antimetabolites, mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, intercalating agents, agents capable
   of interfering with a signal transduction pathway, agents that promote apoptosis and
30 radiation. In yet other embodiments, the methods can be used in combination with
   immunodulatory agents, e.g., IL-1, 2, 4, 6, or 12, or interferon alpha or gamma, or
   immune cell growth factors such as GM-CSF.

   Screening Methods
            In another aspect, the invention features a method, or assay, for screening for
   agents that modulate, e.g., inhibit, the expression or activity of a KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g.,
 5 a KIF5B-RET fusion as described herein. The method includes contacting a KIF5B-RET
   fusion, or a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion, with a candidate agent; and detecting a
   change in a parameter associated with a KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., a change in the
   expression or an activity of the KIF5B-RET fusion. The method can, optionally, include
   comparing the treated parameter to a reference value, e.g., a control sample (e.g.,
10 comparing a parameter obtained from a sample with the candidate agent to a parameter
   obtained from a sample without the candidate agent). In one embodiment, if a decrease
   in expression or activity of the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected, the candidate agent is
   identified as an inhibitor. In another embodiment, if an increase in expression or activity
   of the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected, the candidate agent is identified as an activator. In
15 certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is a nucleic acid molecule or a polypeptide
   as described herein.
            In one embodiment, the contacting step is effected in a cell-free system, e.g., a
   cell lysate or in a reconstituted system. In other embodiments, the contacting step is
   effected in a cell in culture, e.g., a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a
20 mammalian cell, a tumor cell or cell line, a recombinant cell). In yet other embodiments,
   the contacting step is effected in a cell in vivo (a KIF5B-RET-expressing cell present in a
   subject, e.g., an animal subject (e.g., an in vivo animal model).
            Exemplary parameters evaluated include one or more of:
            (i) a change in binding activity, e.g., direct binding of the candidate agent to a
25 KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide; a binding competition between a known ligand and the
   candidate agent to a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide;
            (ii) a change in kinase activity, e.g., phosphorylation levels of a KIF5B-RET
   fusion polypeptide (e.g., an increased or decreased autophosphorylation); or a change in
   phosphorylation of a target of a RET kinase, e.g., focal adhesion kinase (FAK), persephin
30 or glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), In certain embodiments, a change in kinase
   activity, e.g., phosphorylation, is detected by any of Western blot (e.g., using an anti
   KIF5B or anti-RET antibody; a phosphor-specific antibody, detecting a shift in the

   immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, immunomagnetic beads, among others;
            (iii) a change in an activity of a cell containing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a tumor
   cell or a recombinant cell), e.g., a change in proliferation, morphology or tumorigenicity
 5 of the cell;
            (iv) a change in tumor present in an animal subject, e.g., size, appearance,
   proliferation, of the tumor; or
            (v) a change in the level, e.g., expression level, of a KIF5B-RET fusion
   polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule.
10          In one embodiment, a change in a cell free assay in the presence of a candidate
   agent is evaluated. For example, an activity of a KIF5B-RET fusion, or interaction of a
   KIF5B-RET fusion with a downstream ligand can be detected. In one embodiment, a
   KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide is contacted with a ligand, e.g., in solution, and a
   candidate agent is monitored for an ability to modulate, e.g., inhibit, an interaction, e.g.,
15 binding, between the KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide and the ligand.
            In other embodiments, a change in an activity of a cell is detected in a cell in
   culture, e.g., a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a mammalian cell, a tumor cell
   or cell line, a recombinant cell). In one embodiment, the cell is a recombinant cell that is
   modified to express a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid, e.g., is a recombinant cell
20 transfected with a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid. The transfected cell can show a
   change in response to the expressed KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., increased proliferation,
   changes in morphology, increased tumorigenicity, and/or acquired a transformed
   phenotype. A change in any of the activities of the cell, e.g., the recombinant cell, in the
   presence of the candidate agent can be detected. For example, a decrease in one or more
25 of: proliferation, tumorigenicity, transformed morphology, in the presence of the
   candidate agent can be indicative of an inhibitor of a KIF5B-RET fusion. In other
   embodiments, a change in binding activity or phosphorylation as described herein is
   detected.
            In yet other embodiment, a change in a tumor present in an animal subject (e.g.,
30 an in vivo animal model) is detected. In one embodiment, the animal model is a tumor
   containing animal or a xenograft comprising cells expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g.,
   tumorigenic cells expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion). The candidate agent can be

   administered to the animal subject and a change in the tumor is detected. In one
   embodiment, the change in the tumor includes one or more of a tumor growth, tumor
   size, tumor burden, survival, is evaluated. A decrease in one or more of tumor growth,
   tumor size, tumor burden, or an increased survival is indicative that the candidate agent is
 5 an inhibitor.
            In other embodiments, a change in expression of a KIF5B-RET fusion can be
   monitored by detecting the nucleic acid or protein levels, e.g., using the methods
   described herein.
            In certain embodiments, the screening methods described herein can be repeated
10 and/or combined. In one embodiment, a candidate agent that is evaluated in a cell-free or
   cell-based described herein can be further tested in an animal subject.
            In one embodiment, the candidate agent is a small molecule compound, e.g., a

   an antibody molecule (e.g., a full antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that binds
15 to KIF5B5 or RET). The candidate agent can be obtained from a library (e.g., a
   commercial library of kinase inhibitors) or rationally designed (e.g., based on the RET
   kinase domain).
   Methods for Detecting KIF5B-RET Fusions
20          In another aspect, the invention features a method of determining the presence of
   a KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., a KIF5B-RET fusion as described herein. In one
   embodiment, the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected in a nucleic acid molecule or a
   polypeptide. The method includes detecting whether a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid
   molecule or polypeptide is present in a cell (e.g., a circulating cell), a tissue (e.g., a
25 tumor), or a sample, e.g., a tumor sample, from a subject. In one embodiment, the sample
   is a nucleic acid sample. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sample comprises DNA,
   e.g., genomic DNA or cDNA, or RNA, e.g., mRNA. In other embodiments, the sample
   is a protein sample.
            In one embodiment, the sample is, or has been, classified as non-malignant using
30 other diagnostic techniques, e.g., immunohistochemistry.
            In one embodiment, the sample is acquired from a subject (e.g., a subject having
   or at risk of having a cancer, e.g., a patient), or alternatively, the method further includes
                                                   17

   acquiring a sample from the subject. The sample can be chosen from one or more of:
   tissue, e.g., cancerous tissue (e.g., a tissue biopsy), whole blood, serum, plasma, buccal
   scrape, sputum, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, stool, circulating tumor cells,
   circulating nucleic acids, or bone marrow. In certain embodiments, the sample is a tissue
 5 (e.g., a tumor biopsy), a circulating tumor cell or nucleic acid.
            In embodiments, the tumor is from a cancer described herein, e.g., is chosen from
   a lung cancer, a colorectal cancer, an esophageal-gastric cancer, a thyroid cancer, an
   adenocarcinoma or a melanoma. In one embodiment, the tumor is from a lung cancer,
   e.g., a NSCLC, a SCLC, a SCC, or a combination thereof.
10          In one embodiment, the subject is at risk of having, or has a cancer (e.g., a patient
   with a cancer described herein). For example, in one embodiment, the subject is at risk
   for having, or has a lung cancer.
            In other embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected in a nucleic acid
   molecule by a method chosen from one or more of: nucleic acid hybridization assay,
15 amplification-based assays (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR)), PCR-RFLP
   assay, real-time PCR, sequencing, screening analysis (including metaphase
   cytogenetic analysis by standard karyotype methods, FISH (e.g., break away FISH),
   spectral karyotyping or MFISH, comparative genomic hybridization), in situ
   hybridization, SSP, HPLC or mass-spectrometric genotyping.
20          In one embodiment, the method includes: contacting a nucleic acid sample,
   e.g., a genomic DNA sample (e.g., a chromosomal sample or a fractionated, enriched
   or otherwise pre-treated sample) or a gene product (mRNA, cDNA), obtained from
   the subject, with a nucleic acid fragment (e.g., a probe or primer as described herein
   (e.g., an exon-specific probe or primer) under conditions suitable for hybridization,
25 and determining the presence or absence of the KIF5B-RET nucleic acid molecule.
   The method can, optionally, include enriching a sample for the gene or gene product.
            In a related aspect, a method for determining the presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion
   nucleic acid molecule is provided. The method includes: acquiring a sequence for a
   position in a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., by sequencing at least one nucleotide of the
30 nucleic acid molecule (e.g., sequencing at least one nucleotide in the nucleic acid
   molecule that comprises the KIF5B-RET fusion), thereby determining that the KIF5B
   RET fusion is present in the nucleic acid molecule. Optionally, the sequence acquired is
                                                   18

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   compared to a reference sequence, or a wild type reference sequence. In one
   embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is from a cell (e.g., a circulating cell), a tissue
   (e.g., a tumor), or any sample from a subject (e.g., blood or plasma sample). In other
   embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule from a tumor sample (e.g., a tumor or cancer
 5 sample) is sequenced. In one embodiment, the sequence is determined by a next
   generation sequencing method. The method further can further include acquiring, e.g.,
   directly or indirectly acquiring, a sample, e.g., a tumor or cancer sample, from a subject
   (e.g., a patient). In certain embodiments, the cancer is chosen from a lung cancer,
   colorectal cancer, esophageal-gastric cancer or melanoma.
10          In another aspect, the invention features a method of analyzing a tumor or a
   circulating tumor cell. The method includes acquiring a nucleic acid sample from the
   tumor or the circulating cell; and sequencing, e.g., by a next generation sequencing
   method, a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., a nucleic acid molecule that includes a
   KIF5B-RET fusion described herein.
15          In yet another embodiment, a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide is detected. The
   method includes: contacting a protein sample with a reagent which specifically binds
   to a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide; and detecting the formation of a complex of the
   KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide and the reagent. In one embodiment, the reagent is
   labeled with a detectable group to facilitate detection of the bound and unbound
20 reagent. In one embodiment, the reagent is an antibody molecule, e.g., is selected
   from the group consisting of an antibody, and antibody derivative, and an antibody
   fragment.
            In yet another embodiment, the level (e.g., expression level) or activity the
   KIF5B-RET fusion is evaluated. For example, the level (e.g., expression level) or
25 activity of the KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., mRNA or polypeptide) is detected and
   (optionally) compared to a pre-determined value, e.g., a reference value (e.g., a
   control sample).
            In yet another embodiment, the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected prior to initiating,
   during, or after, a treatment in a subject, e.g., a treatment with a kinase inhibitor. In one
30 embodiment, the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected at the time of diagnosis with a cancer. In
   other embodiment, the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected at a pre-determined interval, e.g., a
   first point in time and at least at a subsequent point in time.

     WO 2013/028817                                                              PCT/US2012/051978
            In certain embodiments, responsive to a determination of the presence of the
   KIF5B-RET fusion, the method further includes one or more of:
            (1) stratifying a patient population (e.g., assigning a subject, e.g., a patient, to
   a group or class);
 5          (2) identifying or selecting the subject as likely or unlikely to respond to a
   treatment, e.g., a kinase inhibitor treatment as described herein;
            (3) selecting a treatment option, e.g., administering or not administering a
   preselected therapeutic agent, e.g., a kinase inhibitor as described herein; or
            (4) prognosticating the time course of the disease in the subject (e.g.,
10 evaluating the likelihood of increased or decreased patient survival).
            In certain embodiments, the kinase inhibitor is a multi-kinase inhibitor or a
   RET-specific inhibitor. In one embodiment, the kinase inhibitor is chosen from
   lenvatinib (E7080), sorafenib (NEXAVAR@), sunitinib (SUTENT@, SU1 1248),
   vandetanib (CAPRELSA@, ZACTIMA®, ZD6474), NVP-AST487, regorafenib
15 (BAY-73-4506), motesanib (AMG 706), cabozantinib (XL-184), apatinib (YN
   968D1), or DCC-2157.
            In certain embodiments, responsive to the determination of the presence of the
   KIF5B-RET fusion, the subject is classified as a candidate to receive treatment with a
   kinase inhibitor, e.g., a kinase inhibitor as described herein. In one embodiment,
20 responsive to the determination of the presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion, the subject,
   e.g., a patient, can further be assigned to a particular class if a KIF5B-RET fusion is
   identified in a sample of the patient. For example, a patient identified as having a
   KIF5B-RET fusion can be classified as a candidate to receive treatment with a kinase
   inhibitor, e.g., a kinase inhibitor as described herein. In one embodiment, the subject,
25 e.g., a patient, is assigned to a second class if the mutation is not present. For example, a
   patient who has a lung tumor that does not contain a KIF5B-RET fusion, may be
   determined as not being a candidate to receive a kinase inhibitor, e.g., a kinase inhibitor
   as described herein.
            In another embodiment, responsive to the determination of the presence of the
30 KIF5B-RET fusion, the subject is identified as likely to respond to a treatment that
   comprises a kinase inhibitor e.g., a kinase inhibitor as described herein.

           In yet another embodiment, responsive to the determination of the presence of
   the KIF5B-RET fusion, the method includes administering a kinase inhibitor, e.g., a
   kinase inhibitor as described herein, to the subject.
 5 Method of Evaluating a Tumor or a Subject
           In another aspect, the invention features a method of evaluating a subject (e.g., a
   patient), e.g., for risk of having or developing a cancer, e.g., a lung cancer, colorectal
   cancer or skin cancer. The method includes: acquiring information or knowledge of the
   presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion in a subject (e.g., acquiring genotype information of the
10 subject that identifies a KIF5B-RET fusion as being present in the subject); acquiring a
   sequence for a nucleic acid molecule identified herein (e.g., a nucleic acid molecule that
   includes a KIF5B-RET fusion sequence); or detecting the presence of a KIF5B-RET
   fusion nucleic acid or polypeptide in the subject), wherein the presence of the KIF5B
   RET fusion is positively correlated with increased risk for, or having, a cancer associated
15 with the KIF5B-RET fusion.
           The method can further include the step(s) of identifying (e.g., evaluating,
   diagnosing, screening, and/or selecting) the subject as being positively correlated with
   increased risk for, or having, a cancer associated with the KIF5B-RET fusion. In one
   embodiment, the subject is identified or selected as likely or unlikely to respond to a

   participated in a clinical trial. In one embodiment, the subject has participated in a
   clinical trial for evaluating a kinase inhibitor (e.g., a multikinase inhibitor or a RET
   inhibitor). In one embodiment, the clinical trial is discontinued or terminated. In other
30 embodiments, the subject has participated in a clinical trial that evaluates a RET kinase, a
   KIF5B inhibitor (e.g., a kinesin inhibitor), an upstream or downstream component of
   RET or KIF5B. In one embodiment, the subject responded favorably to the clinical trial,
                                                  21

   e.g., experience an improvement in at least one symptom of a cancer (e.g., decreased in
   tumor size, rate of tumor growth, increased survival). In other embodiments, the subject
   did not respond in a detectable way to the clinical trial.
            In a related aspect, a method of evaluating a patient or a patient population is
 5 provided. The method includes: identifying, selecting, or obtaining information or
   knowledge that the patient or patient population has participated in a clinical trial;
            acquiring information or knowledge of the presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion in
   the patient or patient population (e.g., acquiring genotype information of the subject that
   identifies a KIF5B-RET fusion as being present in the subject); acquiring a sequence for
10 a nucleic acid molecule identified herein (e.g., a nucleic acid molecule that includes a
   KIF5B-RET fusion sequence); or detecting the presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic
   acid or polypeptide in the subject), wherein the presence of the KIF5B-RET fusion is
   identifies the patient or patient population as having an increased risk for, or having, a
   cancer associated with the KIF5B-RET fusion.
15          In certain embodiments, the subject is a patient or patient population that has
   participated in a clinical trial. In one embodiment, the subject has participated in a
   clinical trial for evaluating a kinase inhibitor (e.g., a multikinase inhibitor or a RET
   inhibitor). In one embodiment, the clinical trial is discontinued or terminated. In other
   embodiments, the subject has participated in a clinical trial that evaluates a RET kinase, a
20 KIF5B inhibitor (e.g., a kinesin inhibitor), an upstream or downstream component of
   RET or KIF5B. In one embodiment, the subject responded favorably to the clinical trial,
   e.g., experience an improvement in at least one symptom of a cancer (e.g., decreased in
   tumor size, rate of tumor growth, increased survival). In other embodiments, the subject
   did not respond in a detectable way to the clinical trial.
25          In embodiments, the method further includes treating the subject with a kinase
   inhibitor, e.g., a kinase inhibitor as described herein.
   Reporting
            Methods described herein can include providing a report, such as, in electronic,
30 web-based, or paper form, to the patient or to another person or entity, e.g., a caregiver,
   e.g., a physician, e.g., an oncologist, a hospital, clinic, third-party payor, insurance
   company or government office. The report can include output from the method, e.g., the
                                                  22

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   identification of nucleotide values, the indication of presence or absence of a KIF5B-RET
   fusion as described herein, or wildtype sequence. In one embodiment, a report is
   generated, such as in paper or electronic form, which identifies the presence or absence of
   an alteration described herein, and optionally includes an identifier for the patient from
 5 which the sequence was obtained.
            The report can also include information on the role of a sequence, e.g., a KIF5B
   RET fusion as described herein, or wildtype sequence, in disease. Such information can
   include information on prognosis, resistance, or potential or suggested therapeutic
   options. The report can include information on the likely effectiveness of a therapeutic
10 option, the acceptability of a therapeutic option, or the advisability of applying the
   therapeutic option to a patient, e.g., a patient having a sequence, alteration or mutation
   identified in the test, and in embodiments, identified in the report. For example, the
   report can include information, or a recommendation on, the administration of a drug,
   e.g., the administration at a preselected dosage or in a preselected treatment regimen, e.g.,
15 in combination with other drugs, to the patient. In an embodiment, not all mutations
   identified in the method are identified in the report. For example, the report can be
   limited to mutations in genes having a preselected level of correlation with the
   occurrence, prognosis, stage, or susceptibility of the cancer to treatment, e.g., with a
   preselected therapeutic option. The report can be delivered, e.g., to an entity described
20 herein, within 7, 14, or 21 days from receipt of the sample by the entity practicing the
   method.
            In another aspect, the invention features a method for generating a report, e.g., a
   personalized cancer treatment report, by obtaining a sample, e.g., a tumor sample, from a
   subject, detecting a KIF5B-RET fusion as described herein in the sample, and selecting a
25 treatment based on the mutation identified. In one embodiment, a report is generated that
   annotates the selected treatment, or that lists, e.g., in order of preference, two or more
   treatment options based on the mutation identified. In another embodiment, the subject,
   e.g., a patient, is further administered the selected method of treatment.

20                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a novel chromosomal
   inversion event and its association with cancer, e.g., lung cancer. In one embodiment,
   Applicants have discovered an inversion on chromosome 10 that results in an in-frame
   fusion of a fragment of a KIF5B gene and a fragment of a RET gene.
25         The term "KIF5B-RET" or "KIF5B-RET fusion" is used generically herein, and
   includes any fusion molecule (e.g., gene, gene product (e.g., cDNA, mRNA,
   polypeptide), and variant thereof) that includes a fragment of KIF5B and a fragment of
   RET, in any configuration, including, e.g., a 5'KIF5B-3'RET or a 5'RET-3'KIF5B
   fusion molecule.
30         In one embodiment, a KIF5B-RET fusion includes an in-frame fusion of an exon
   of KIF5B (e.g., one more exons encoding a kinesin motor domain or a fragment thereof)
   and an exon of RET (e.g., one or more exons encoding a RET tyrosine kinase domain or
                                                 26

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   a fragment thereof). For example, the KIF5B-RET fusion can include an in-frame fusion
   of at least exon 15 of KIF5B or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 1-15 of KIF5B or a
   fragment thereof) with at least exon 12 of RET or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 12-20
   of RET or a fragment thereof). In certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is in a 5'
 5 KIF5B to 3'-RET configuration referred to herein as "5'KIF5B-3'RET."
            In other embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion includes an in-frame fusion of at
   least exon 11 of RET or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 1-11 of RET or a fragment
   thereof) with at least exon 16 or a fragment thereof (e.g., exons 16-25 of KIF5B or a
   fragment thereof). In certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is in a 5'- RET to 3'
10 KIF5B configuration referred to herein as "5'RET-3'KIF5B").
            The RET proto-oncogene is known to be associated with cancerous phenotypes,
   including papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN),
   phaeochromocytoma, among others. For example, chromosomal rearrangements that
   generate a fusion gene resulting in the juxtaposition of the C-terminal region of the RET
15 protein with an N-terminal portion of another protein (known as RET/PTC) are known to
   be associated with PTC (Nikiforov, YE (2002) Endocr. Pathol. 13 (1):3-16). Thus, the
   KIF5B-RET fusions disclosed herein (e.g., the 5'- KIF5B to 3'-RET fusions that include
   a RET tyrosine kinase domain) are likely to be associated with cancers, e.g., lung cancer.
            Accordingly, the invention provides, at least in part, isolated KIF5B-RET nucleic
20 acid molecules, nucleic acid constructs, host cells containing the nucleic acid molecules;
   purified KIF5B-RET polypeptides and binding agents; detection reagents (e.g., probes,
   primers, antibodies, kits); screening assays for identifying novel kinase inhibitors; as well
   as methods, assays and kits for evaluating, identifying, assessing and/or treating a subject
   having a cancer, e.g., a cancer having a KIF5B-RET fusion disclosed herein. The
25 compositions and methods identified herein can be used, for example, to identify new
   KIF5B-RET inhibitors; to treat or prevent a cancer; as well as in methods or assays for
   evaluating a cancer (e.g., evaluating one or more of: cancer progression, cancer
   treatment response or resistance to cancer treatment; selecting a treatment option,
   stratifying a patient population, and/or more effectively monitoring, treating or
30 preventing a cancer).
            Certain terms are first defined. Additional terms are defined throughout the
   specification.

            As used herein, the articles "a" and "an" refer to one or to more than one (e.g., to at
   least one) of the grammatical object of the article.
            The term "or" is used herein to mean, and is used interchangeably with, the term
   "and/or", unless context clearly indicates otherwise.
 5          "About" and "approximately" shall generally mean an acceptable degree of error for
   the quantity measured given the nature or precision of the measurements. Exemplary degrees
   of error are within 20 percent (%), typically, within 10%, and more typically, within 5% of a
   given value or range of values.
            "Acquire" or "acquiring" as the terms are used herein, refer to obtaining
10 possession of a physical entity, or a value, e.g., a numerical value, by "directly acquiring"
   or "indirectly acquiring" the physical entity or value. "Directly acquiring" means
   performing a process (e.g., performing a synthetic or analytical method) to obtain the
   physical entity or value. "Indirectly acquiring" refers to receiving the physical entity or
   value from another party or source (e.g., a third party laboratory that directly acquired the
15 physical entity or value). Directly acquiring a physical entity includes performing a
   process that includes a physical change in a physical substance, e.g., a starting material.
   Exemplary changes include making a physical entity from two or more starting materials,
   shearing or fragmenting a substance, separating or purifying a substance, combining two
   or more separate entities into a mixture, performing a chemical reaction that includes
20 breaking or forming a covalent or non-covalent bond. Directly acquiring a value includes
   performing a process that includes a physical change in a sample or another substance,
   e.g., performing an analytical process which includes a physical change in a substance,
   e.g., a sample, analyte, or reagent (sometimes referred to herein as "physical analysis"),
   performing an analytical method, e.g., a method which includes one or more of the
25 following: separating or purifying a substance, e.g., an analyte, or a fragment or other
   derivative thereof, from another substance; combining an analyte, or fragment or other
   derivative thereof, with another substance, e.g., a buffer, solvent, or reactant; or changing
   the structure of an analyte, or a fragment or other derivative thereof, e.g., by breaking or
   forming a covalent or non-covalent bond, between a first and a second atom of the
30 analyte; or by changing the structure of a reagent, or a fragment or other derivative
   thereof, e.g., by breaking or forming a covalent or non-covalent bond, between a first and
   a second atom of the reagent.

     WO 2013/028817                                                              PCT/US2012/051978
            "Acquiring a sequence" as the term is used herein, refers to obtaining possession
   of a nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, by "directly acquiring" or "indirectly
   acquiring" the sequence. "Directly acquiring a sequence" means performing a process
   (e.g., performing a synthetic or analytical method) to obtain the sequence, such as
 5 performing a sequencing method (e.g., a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) method).
   "Indirectly acquiring a sequence" refers to receiving information or knowledge of, or
   receiving, the sequence from another party or source (e.g., a third party laboratory that
   directly acquired the sequence). The sequence acquired need not be a full sequence, e.g.,
   sequencing of at least one nucleotide, or obtaining information or knowledge, that
10 identifies a KIF5B-RET fusion disclosed herein as being present in a subject constitutes
   acquiring a sequence.
            Directly acquiring a sequence includes performing a process that includes a
   physical change in a physical substance, e.g., a starting material, such as a tissue sample,
   e.g., a biopsy, or an isolated nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA) sample. Exemplary
15 changes include making a physical entity from two or more starting materials, shearing or
   fragmenting a substance, such as a genomic DNA fragment; separating or purifying a
   substance (e.g., isolating a nucleic acid sample from a tissue); combining two or more
   separate entities into a mixture, performing a chemical reaction that includes breaking or
   forming a covalent or non-covalent bond. Directly acquiring a value includes performing
20 a process that includes a physical change in a sample or another substance as described
   above.
            "Acquiring a sample" as the term is used herein, refers to obtaining possession of
   a sample, e.g., a tissue sample or nucleic acid sample, by "directly acquiring" or
   "indirectly acquiring" the sample. "Directly acquiring a sample" means performing a
25 process (e.g., performing a physical method such as a surgery or extraction) to obtain the
   sample. "Indirectly acquiring a sample" refers to receiving the sample from another party
   or source (e.g., a third party laboratory that directly acquired the sample). Directly
   acquiring a sample includes performing a process that includes a physical change in a
   physical substance, e.g., a starting material, such as a tissue, e.g., a tissue in a human
30 patient or a tissue that has was previously isolated from a patient. Exemplary changes
   include making a physical entity from a starting material, dissecting or scraping a tissue;
   separating or purifying a substance (e.g., a sample tissue or a nucleic acid sample);
                                                  29

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   combining two or more separate entities into a mixture; performing a chemical reaction
   that includes breaking or forming a covalent or non-covalent bond. Directly acquiring a
   sample includes performing a process that includes a physical change in a sample or
   another substance, e.g., as described above.
 5          "Binding entity" means any molecule to which molecular tags can be directly or
   indirectly attached that is capable of specifically binding to an analyte. The binding
   entity can be an affinity tag on a nucleic acid sequence. In certain embodiments, the
   binding entity allows for separation of the nucleic acid from a mixture, such as an avidin
   molecule, or an antibody that binds to the hapten or an antigen-binding fragment thereof.
10 Exemplary binding entities include, but are not limited to, a biotin molecule, a hapten, an
   antibody, an antibody binding fragment, a peptide, and a protein.
            "Complementary" refers to sequence complementarity between regions of two
   nucleic acid strands or between two regions of the same nucleic acid strand. It is known
   that an adenine residue of a first nucleic acid region is capable of forming specific
15 hydrogen bonds ("base pairing") with a residue of a second nucleic acid region which is
   antiparallel to the first region if the residue is thymine or uracil. Similarly, it is known
   that a cytosine residue of a first nucleic acid strand is capable of base pairing with a
   residue of a second nucleic acid strand which is antiparallel to the first strand if the
   residue is guanine. A first region of a nucleic acid is complementary to a second region
20 of the same or a different nucleic acid if, when the two regions are arranged in an
   antiparallel fashion, at least one nucleotide residue of the first region is capable of base
   pairing with a residue of the second region. In certain embodiments, the first region
   comprises a first portion and the second region comprises a second portion, whereby,
   when the first and second portions are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, at least about
25 50%, at least about 75%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95% of the nucleotide
   residues of the first portion are capable of base pairing with nucleotide residues in the
   second portion. In other embodiments, all nucleotide residues of the first portion are
   capable of base pairing with nucleotide residues in the second portion.
           The term "cancer" or "tumor" is used interchangeably herein. These terms refer
30 to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer-causing cells, such as
   uncontrolled proliferation, immortality, metastatic potential, rapid growth and
   proliferation rate, and certain characteristic morphological features. Cancer cells are
                                                   30

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   often in the form of a tumor, but such cells can exist alone within an animal, or can be a
   non-tumorigenic cancer cell, such as a leukemia cell. These terms include a solid tumor,
   a soft tissue tumor, or a metastatic lesion. As used herein, the term "cancer" includes
   premalignant, as well as malignant cancers.
 5          Cancer is "inhibited" if at least one symptom of the cancer is alleviated,
   terminated, slowed, or prevented. As used herein, cancer is also "inhibited" if
   recurrence or metastasis of the cancer is reduced, slowed, delayed, or prevented.
            "Chemotherapeutic agent" means a chemical substance, such as a cytotoxic or
   cytostatic agent, that is used to treat a condition, particularly cancer.
10          As used herein, "cancer therapy" and "cancer treatment" are synonymous
   terms.
            As used herein, "chemotherapy" and "chemotherapeutic" and
   "chemotherapeutic agent" are synonymous terms.
            The terms "homology" or "identity," as used interchangeably herein, refer to
15 sequence similarity between two polynucleotide sequences or between two
   polypeptide sequences, with identity being a more strict comparison. The phrases
   "percent identity or homology" and "% identity or homology" refer to the percentage
   of sequence similarity found in a comparison of two or more polynucleotide
   sequences or two or more polypeptide sequences. "Sequence similarity" refers to the
20 percent similarity in base pair sequence (as determined by any suitable method)
   between two or more polynucleotide sequences. Two or more sequences can be
   anywhere from 0-100% similar, or any integer value there between. Identity or
   similarity can be determined by comparing a position in each sequence that can be
   aligned for purposes of comparison. When a position in the compared sequence is
25 occupied by the same nucleotide base or amino acid, then the molecules are identical
   at that position. A degree of similarity or identity between polynucleotide sequences
   is a function of the number of identical or matching nucleotides at positions shared by
   the polynucleotide sequences. A degree of identity of polypeptide sequences is a
   function of the number of identical amino acids at positions shared by the polypeptide
30 sequences. A degree of homology or similarity of polypeptide sequences is a function
   of the number of amino acids at positions shared by the polypeptide sequences. The
   term "substantially identical," as used herein, refers to an identity or homology of at
                                                  31

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%,
   97%, 98%, 99%, or more.
           "Likely to" or "increased likelihood," as used herein, refers to an increased
   probability that an item, object, thing or person will occur. Thus, in one example, a
 5 subject that is likely to respond to treatment with a kinase inhibitor, alone or in
   combination, has an increased probability of responding to treatment with the
   inhibitor alone or in combination, relative to a reference subject or group of subjects.
           "Unlikely to" refers to a decreased probability that an event, item, object, thing
   or person will occur with respect to a reference. Thus, a subject that is unlikely to
10 respond to treatment with a kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination, has a decreased
   probability of responding to treatment with a kinase inhibitor, alone or in
   combination, relative to a reference subject or group of subjects.
           "Sequencing" a nucleic acid molecule requires determining the identity of at least
    1 nucleotide in the molecule. In embodiments, the identity of less than all of the
15 nucleotides in a molecule are determined. In other embodiments, the identity of a
   majority or all of the nucleotides in the molecule is determined.
           "Next-generation sequencing or NGS or NG sequencing" as used herein, refers to
   any sequencing method that determines the nucleotide sequence of either individual
   nucleic acid molecules (e.g., in single molecule sequencing) or clonally expanded proxies
20 for individual nucleic acid molecules in a highly parallel fashion (e.g., greater than 105
   molecules are sequenced simultaneously). In one embodiment, the relative abundance of
   the nucleic acid species in the library can be estimated by counting the relative number of
   occurrences of their cognate sequences in the data generated by the sequencing
   experiment. Next generation sequencing methods are known in the art, and are
25 described, e.g., in Metzker, M. (2010) Nature Biotechnology Reviews 11:31-46,
   incorporated herein by reference. Next generation sequencing can detect a variant
   present in less than 5% of the nucleic acids in a sample.
           "Sample," "tissue sample," "patient sample," "patient cell or tissue sample" or
   "specimen" each refers to a collection of similar cells obtained from a tissue of a subject
30 or patient. The source of the tissue sample can be solid tissue as from a fresh, frozen
   and/or preserved organ, tissue sample, biopsy, or aspirate; blood or any blood
   constituents; bodily fluids such as cerebral spinal fluid, amniotic fluid, peritoneal fluid or
                                                 32

     WO 2013/028817                                                              PCT/US2012/051978
   interstitial fluid; or cells from any time in gestation or development of the subject. The
   tissue sample can contain compounds that are not naturally intermixed with the tissue in
   nature such as preservatives, anticoagulants, buffers, fixatives, nutrients, antibiotics or the
   like. In one embodiment, the sample is preserved as a frozen sample or as formaldehyde
 5 or paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue preparation. For example,
   the sample can be embedded in a matrix, e.g., an FFPE block or a frozen sample.
            A "tumor nucleic acid sample" as used herein, refers to nucleic acid molecules
   from a tumor or cancer sample. Typically, it is DNA, e.g., genomic DNA, or cDNA
   derived from RNA, from a tumor or cancer sample. In certain embodiments, the tumor
10 nucleic acid sample is purified or isolated (e.g., it is removed from its natural state).
            A "control" or "reference" "nucleic acid sample" as used herein, refers to nucleic
   acid molecules from a control or reference sample. Typically, it is DNA, e.g., genomic
   DNA, or cDNA derived from RNA, not containing the alteration or variation in the gene
   or gene product, e.g., not containing a KIF5B-RET fusion. In certain embodiments, the
15 reference or control nucleic acid sample is a wild type or a non-mutated sequence. In
   certain embodiments, the reference nucleic acid sample is purified or isolated (e.g., it is
   removed from its natural state). In other embodiments, the reference nucleic acid sample
   is from a non-tumor sample, e.g., a blood control, a normal adjacent tumor (NAT), or any
   other non-cancerous sample from the same or a different subject.
20          Headings, e.g., (a), (b), (i) etc, are presented merely for ease of reading the
   specification and claims. The use of headings in the specification or claims does not
   require the steps or elements be performed in alphabetical or numerical order or the order
   in which they are presented.
            Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail below. Additional
25 definitions are set out throughout the specification.
   IsolatedNucleic Acid Molecules
            One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that
   include a KIF5B-RET fusion, including nucleic acids which encode a KIF5B-RET
30 fusion polypeptide or a portion of such a polypeptide. The nucleic acid molecules
   include those nucleic acid molecules which reside in genomic regions identified
   herein. As used herein, the term "nucleic acid molecule" includes DNA molecules
                                                     33

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the
   DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be
   single-stranded or double-stranded; in certain embodiments the nucleic acid molecule
   is double-stranded DNA.
 5          Isolated nucleic acid molecules also include nucleic acid molecules sufficient
   for use as hybridization probes or primers to identify nucleic acid molecules that
   correspond to a KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., those suitable for use as PCR primers for the
   amplification or mutation of nucleic acid molecules.
            An "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is one which is separated from other
10 nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid
   molecule. In certain embodiments, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is free of
   sequences (such as protein-encoding sequences) which naturally flank the nucleic acid
   (i.e., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA
   of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various
15 embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kB,
   less than about 4 kB, less than about 3 kB, less than about 2 kB, less than about 1 kB,
   less than about 0.5 kB or less than about 0.1 kB of nucleotide sequences which
   naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the
   nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule, such as a
20 cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material or culture medium
   when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical
   precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.
            The language "substantially free of other cellular material or culture medium"
   includes preparations of nucleic acid molecule in which the molecule is separated
25 from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly
   produced. Thus, nucleic acid molecule that is substantially free of cellular material
   includes preparations of nucleic acid molecule having less than about 30%, less than
   about 20%, less than about 10%, or less than about 5% (by dry weight) of other
   cellular material or culture medium.
30          A KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule can be isolated using standard
   molecular biology techniques and the sequence information in the database records
   described herein. Using all or a portion of such nucleic acid sequences, KIF5B-RET
                                                  34

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   fusion nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning
   techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook et al., ed., Molecular Cloning: A
   Laboratory Manual,2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring
   Harbor, NY, 1989).
 5          A KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule can be amplified using cDNA,
   mRNA, or genomic DNA as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers
   according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid molecules so
   amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA
   sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to all or a portion of
10 a nucleic acid molecule of the invention can be prepared by standard synthetic
   techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer.
            In another embodiment, a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule comprises
   a nucleic acid molecule which has a nucleotide sequence complementary to the
   nucleotide sequence of a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule or to the
15 nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid encoding a KIF5B-RET fusion protein. A
   nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to a given nucleotide sequence is one
   which is sufficiently complementary to the given nucleotide sequence that it can
   hybridize to the given nucleotide sequence thereby forming a stable duplex.
            Moreover, a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule can comprise only a
20 portion of a nucleic acid sequence, wherein the full length nucleic acid sequence or
   which encodes a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide. Such nucleic acid molecules can be
   used, for example, as a probe or primer. The probe/primer typically is used as one or
   more substantially purified oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide typically comprises
   a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least

   substantially homologous to the KIF5B-RET fusion gene mutations and/or gene
   products described herein, such that they differ by only or at least 1, at least 2, at least

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   or to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein corresponding to a marker of the
   invention.
            As used herein, the term "hybridizes under stringent conditions" is intended to
   describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences
 5 at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, or at least 85%
   identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent
   conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in sections 6.3.1
   6.3.6 of CurrentProtocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989).
   Another, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization
10 in 6X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45C, followed by one or more
   washes in 0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50-65C.
            The invention also includes molecular beacon nucleic acid molecules having
   at least one region which is complementary to a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid
   molecule, such that the molecular beacon is useful for quantitating the presence of the
15 nucleic acid molecule of the invention in a sample. A "molecular beacon" nucleic
   acid is a nucleic acid molecule comprising a pair of complementary regions and
   having a fluorophore and a fluorescent quencher associated therewith. The
   fluorophore and quencher are associated with different portions of the nucleic acid in
   such an orientation that when the complementary regions are annealed with one
20 another, fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched by the quencher. When the
   complementary regions of the nucleic acid molecules are not annealed with one
   another, fluorescence of the fluorophore is quenched to a lesser degree. Molecular
   beacon nucleic acid molecules are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,876,930.
25 Probes
            The invention also provides isolated KIF5B-RET nucleic acid molecules useful as
   probes.
            Probes based on the sequence of a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule
   can be used to detect transcripts or genomic sequences corresponding to one or more
30 markers of the invention. The probe comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., a
   radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such
   probes can be used as part of a test kit for identifying cells or tissues which express
                                                  37

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   the KIF5B-RET protein, such as by measuring levels of a nucleic acid molecule
   encoding the protein in a sample of cells from a subject, e.g., detecting mRNA levels
   or determining whether a gene encoding the protein has been mutated or deleted.
            Probes featured in the invention include those that will specifically hybridize to a
 5 gene sequence described in the Example, e.g., a KIF5B-RET fusion. Typically these
   probes are 12 to 20, e.g., 17 to 20 nucleotides in length (longer for large insertions) and
   have the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the region of the mutations at their
   respective nucleotide locations on the gene sequence. Such molecules can be labeled
   according to any technique known in the art, such as with radiolabels, fluorescent labels,
10 enzymatic labels, sequence tags, biotin, other ligands, etc. As used herein, a probe that
   "specifically hybridizes" to a KIF5B-RET fusion gene sequence will hybridize under
   high stringency conditions.
            A probe will typically contain one or more of the specific mutations described
   herein. Typically, a nucleic acid probe will encompass only one mutation. Such
15 molecules may be labeled and can be used as allele-specific probes to detect the mutation
   of interest.
            In one aspect, the invention features a probe or probe set that specifically
   hybridizes to a nucleic acid comprising an inversion resulting in a KIF5B-RET fusion.
            Isolated pairs of allele specific oligonucleotide probes are also provided, where
20 the first probe of the pair specifically hybridizes to the mutant allele, and the second
   probe of the pair specifically hybridizes to the wildtype allele. For example, in one
   exemplary probe pair, one probe will recognize the fusion junction in the KI5B-RET
   fusion, and the other probe will recognize a sequence downstream or upstream of KIF5B
   or RET, neither of which includes the fusion junction. These allele-specific probes are
25 useful in detecting a RET somatic mutation in a tumor sample, e.g., a lung tumor sample.
   Primers
            The invention also provides isolated nucleic acid molecules useful as primers.
            The term "primer" as used herein refers to a sequence comprising two or more
30 deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, e.g., more than three, and more than eight, or at
   least 20 nucleotides of a gene described in the Example, where the sequence corresponds
   to a sequence flanking one of the mutations or a wild type sequence of a gene identified
                                                   38

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   in the Example, e.g., a KIF5B or RET gene. Primers may be used to initiate DNA
   synthesis via the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or a sequencing method. Primers
   featured in the invention include the sequences recited and complementary sequences
   which would anneal to the opposite DNA strand of the sample target. Since both strands
 5 of DNA are complementary and mirror images of each other, the same segment of DNA
   will be amplified.
           Primers can be used to sequence a nucleic acid, e.g., an isolated nucleic acid
   described herein, such as by an NGS method, or to amplify a gene described in the
   Example, such as by PCR. The primers can specifically hybridize, for example, to the
10 ends of the exons or to the introns flanking the exons. The amplified segment can then be
   further analyzed for the presence of the mutation such as by a sequencing method. The
   primers are useful in directing amplification of a target polynucleotide prior to
   sequencing. In another aspect, the invention features a pair of oligonucleotide primers
   that amplify a region that contains or is adjacent to a fusion junction identified in the
15 Example. Such primers are useful in directing amplification of a target region that
   includes a fusion junction identified in the Example, e.g., prior to sequencing. The
   primer typically contains 12 to 20, or 17 to 20, or more nucleotides, although a primer
   may contain fewer nucleotides.
           A primer is typically single stranded, e.g., for use in sequencing or amplification
20 methods, but may be double stranded. If double stranded, the primer may first be treated
   to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. A primer must be
   sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the
   inducing agent for polymerization. The exact length of primer will depend on many
   factors, including applications (e.g., amplification method), temperature, buffer, and
25 nucleotide composition. A primer typically contains 12-20 or more nucleotides, although
   a primer may contain fewer nucleotides.
           Primers are typically designed to be "substantially" complementary to each strand
   of a genomic locus to be amplified. Thus, the primers must be sufficiently
   complementary to specifically hybridize with their respective strands under conditions
30 which allow the agent for polymerization to perform. In other words, the primers should
   have sufficient complementarity with the 5' and 3' sequences flanking the mutation to
   hybridize therewith and permit amplification of the genomic locus.
                                                 39

      WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
            The term "substantially complementary to" or "substantially the sequence" refers
   to sequences that hybridize to the sequences provided under stringent conditions and/or
    sequences having sufficient homology with a sequence comprising a fusion junction
   identified in the Example, or the wildtype counterpart sequence, such that the allele
 5  specific oligonucleotides hybridize to the sequence. In one embodiment, a sequence is
    substantially complementary to a fusion junction in an inversion event, e.g., to a fusion
   junction in SEQ ID NO: 1. "Substantially the same" as it refers to oligonucleotide
    sequences also refers to the functional ability to hybridize or anneal with sufficient
    specificity to distinguish between the presence or absence of the mutation. This is
10 measurable by the temperature of melting being sufficiently different to permit easy
   identification of whether the oligonucleotide is binding to the normal or mutant gene
    sequence identified in the Example.
            In one aspect, the invention features a primer or primer set for amplifying a
   nucleic acid comprising an inversion resulting in a KIF5B-RET fusion.
15          Isolated pairs of allele specific oligonucleotide primer are also provided, where
   the first primer of the pair specifically hybridizes to the mutant allele, and the second
   primer of the pair specifically hybridizes to a sequence upstream or downstream of a
   mutation, or a fusion junction resulting from, e.g., an inversion, duplication, deletion,
   insertion or translocation. For example, in one exemplary primer pair, one probe will
20 recognize the a KIF5B-RET inversion, such as by hybridizing to a sequence at the fusion
   junction between the KIF5B and RET transcripts, and the other primer will recognize a
    sequence upstream or downstream of the fusion junction. These allele-specific primers
    are useful for amplifying a KIF5B-RET fusion sequence from a tumor sample, e.g., an
    adenocarcinoma, such as an adenocarcinoma of the lung.
25          In another exemplary primer pair, one primer can recognize a RET-KIF5B
   inversion (e.g., the reciprocal of the KIF5B-RET inversion), such as by hybridizing to a
    sequence at the fusion junction between the RET and KIF5B transcripts, and the other
   primer will recognize a sequence upstream or downstream of the fusion junction. These
    allele-specific primers are useful for amplifying a RET-KIF5B fusion sequence from a
30 tumor sample, e.g., an adenocarcinoma, such as an adenocarcinoma of the lung.
            Primers can be prepared using any suitable method, such as conventional
   phosphotriester and phosphodiester methods or automated embodiments thereof. In one
                                                   40

     WO 2013/028817                                                          PCT/US2012/051978
   such automated embodiment, diethylphosphoramidites are used as starting materials and
   may be synthesized as described by Beaucage, et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 22:1859-1862,
   (1981). One method for synthesizing oligonucleotides on a modified solid support is
   described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066.
 5          An oligonucleotide probe or primer that hybridizes to a mutant or wildtpe allele is
   said to be the complement of the allele. As used herein, a probe exhibits "complete
   complementarity" when every nucleotide of the probe is complementary to the
   corresponding nucleotide of the allele. Two polynucleotides are said to be "minimally
   complementary" if they can hybridize to one another with sufficient stability to permit
10 them to remain annealed to one another under at least conventional "low-stringency"
   conditions. Similarly, the polynucleotides are said to be "complementary" if they can
   hybridize to one another with sufficient stability to permit them to remain annealed to one
   another under conventional "high-stringency" conditions. Conventional stringency
   conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found, for example in
15 Molecular Cloning:A Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition Volumes 1, 2, and 3. J. F.
   Sambrook, D. W. Russell, and N. Irwin, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2000.
            Departures from complete complementarity are therefore permissible, as long as
   such departures do not completely preclude the capacity of a probe to hybridize to an
   allele. Thus, in order for a polynucleotide to serve as a primer or probe it need only be
20 sufficiently complementary in sequence to be able to form a stable double-stranded
   structure under the particular solvent and salt concentrations employed. Appropriate
   stringency conditions which promote DNA hybridization are, for example, 6.0 X sodium
   chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45'C, followed by a wash of 2.0 X SSC at 50'C.
   Such conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found, for example in
25 CurrentProtocols in MolecularBiology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989). Salt
   concentration and temperature in the wash step can be adjusted to alter hybridization
   stringency. For example, conditions may vary from low stringency of about 2.0 X SSC at
   40'C to moderately stringent conditions of about 2.0 X SSC at 50'C to high stringency
   conditions of about 0.2 X SSC at 50'C.

   KIF5B-RET Fusion Proteinsand Antibodies

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
           One aspect of the invention pertains to purified KIF5B-RET fusion
   polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, the native
   KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an
   appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In
 5 another embodiment, a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide is produced by recombinant
   DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a KIF5B-RET fusion
   polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis
   techniques.
           An "isolated" or "purified" protein or biologically active portion thereof is
10 substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or
   tissue source from which the protein is derived, or substantially free of chemical
   precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language
   "substantially free of cellular material" includes preparations of protein in which the
   protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or
15 recombinantly produced. Thus, protein that is substantially free of cellular material
   includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less
   than about 10%, or less than about 5% (by dry weight) of heterologous protein (also
   referred to herein as a "contaminating protein"). When the protein or biologically
   active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it can be substantially free of culture
20 medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, less than about 10%, or
   less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. When the protein is
   produced by chemical synthesis, it can substantially be free of chemical precursors or
   other chemicals, i.e., it is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals
   which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. Accordingly such preparations of
25 the protein have less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 10%, less
   than about 5% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or compounds other than the
   polypeptide of interest.
           Biologically active portions of a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide include
   polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently identical to or derived
30 from the amino acid sequence of the KIF5B-RET fusion protein, which include fewer
   amino acids than the full length protein, and exhibit at least one activity of the
   corresponding full-length protein, e.g., a kinase activity, or a dimerizing or
                                                 42

     WO 2013/028817                                                                 PCT/US2012/051978
   multimerizing activity. A biologically active portion of a protein of the invention can
   be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 100 or more amino acids in length.
   Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are
   deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of
 5 the functional activities of the native form of a polypeptide.
            In certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide has an amino acid
   sequence of a protein encoded by a nucleic acid molecule disclosed herein. Other
   useful proteins are substantially identical (e.g., at least 60, at least 65, at least 70, at
   least 75, at least 80, at least 85, at least 86, at least 87, at least 88, at least 89, at least
10 90, at least 91, at least 92, at least 93, at least 94, at least 95, at least 96, at least 97, at
   least 98, at least 99, at least 99.5% or greater) to one of these sequences and retain the
   functional activity of the protein of the corresponding full-length protein yet differ in
   amino acid sequence.
            To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two
15 nucleic acids, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps
   can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for
   optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid
   residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions
   are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same
20 amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second
   sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity
   between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared
   by the sequences (i.e., % identity = # of identical positions/total # of positions (e.g.,
   overlapping positions) x100). In one embodiment the two sequences are the same
25 length.
            The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be
   accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Another, non-limiting example of a
   mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm
   of Karlin and Altschul (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268, modified as
30 in Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877. Such an
   algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul, et al.
   (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with

   the NBLAST program, score = 100, wordlength = 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences

   amino acid sequences homologous to protein molecules of the invention. To obtain
 5 gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as
   described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Alternatively,
   PSI-Blast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships
   between molecules. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-Blast
   programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and
10 NBLAST) can be used. See online at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Another non-limiting
   example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the
   algorithm of Myers and Miller, (1988) ComputAppl Biosci, 4:11-7. Such an
   algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the
   GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for
15 comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM 120 weight residue table, a gap length
   penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Yet another useful algorithm for
   identifying regions of local sequence similarity and alignment is the FASTA
   algorithm as described in Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA
   85:2444-2448. When using the FASTA algorithm for comparing nucleotide or amino
20 acid sequences, a PAM 120 weight residue table can, for example, be used with a k
   tuple value of 2.
           The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using
   techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In
   calculating percent identity, only exact matches are counted.
25         An isolated KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide, or a fragment thereof, can be
   used as an immunogen to generate antibodies using standard techniques for
   polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparation. The full-length KIF5B-RET fusion
   polypeptide can be used or, alternatively, the invention provides antigenic peptide
   fragments for use as immunogens. The antigenic peptide of a protein of the invention
30 comprises at least 8 (or at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, or at least 30 or more)
   amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of one of the polypeptides of the
   invention, and encompasses an epitope of the protein such that an antibody raised
                                                   44

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   against the peptide forms a specific immune complex with a marker of the invention
   to which the protein corresponds. Exemplary epitopes encompassed by the antigenic
   peptide are regions that are located on the surface of the protein, e.g., hydrophilic
   regions. Hydrophobicity sequence analysis, hydrophilicity sequence analysis, or
 5 similar analyses can be used to identify hydrophilic regions.
            An immunogen typically is used to prepare antibodies by immunizing a
   suitable (i.e., immunocompetent) subject such as a rabbit, goat, mouse, or other
   mammal or vertebrate. An appropriate immunogenic preparation can contain, for
   example, recombinantly-expressed or chemically- synthesized polypeptide. The
10 preparation can further include an adjuvant, such as Freund's complete or incomplete
   adjuvant, or a similar immunostimulatory agent.
            Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to antibodies directed
   against a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide. In one embodiment, the antibody molecule
   specifically binds to KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., specifically binds to an epitope formed
15 by the KIF5B-RET fusion. In embodiments the antibody can distinguish wild type
   RET (or KIF5B) from KIF5B-RET.
            The terms "antibody" and "antibody molecule" as used interchangeably herein
   refer to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of
   immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site which
20 specifically binds an antigen, such as a polypeptide of the invention. A molecule
   which specifically binds to a given polypeptide of the invention is a molecule which
   binds the polypeptide, but does not substantially bind other molecules in a sample,
   e.g., a biological sample, which naturally contains the polypeptide. Examples of
   immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules include F(ab) and
25 F(ab') 2 fragments which can be generated by treating the antibody with an enzyme
   such as pepsin. The invention provides polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The
   term "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition", as used herein,
   refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only one species of an
   antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a particular epitope.
30          Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared as described above by immunizing a
   suitable subject with a polypeptide of the invention as an immunogen. Antibody
   producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare monoclonal
                                                45

     WO 2013/028817                                                        PCT/US2012/051978
   antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally
   described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495-497, the human B cell
   hybridoma technique (see Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunol. Today 4:72), the EBV
   hybridoma technique (see Cole et al., pp. 77-96 In MonoclonalAntibodies and
 5 Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985) or trioma techniques. The technology for
   producing hybridomas is well known (see generally Current Protocols in
   Immunology, Coligan et al. ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994). Hybridoma
   cells producing a monoclonal antibody of the invention are detected by screening the
   hybridoma culture supernatants for antibodies that bind the polypeptide of interest,
10 e.g., using a standard ELISA assay.
            Alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas, a
   monoclonal antibody can be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant
   combinatorial immunoglobulin library (e.g., an antibody phage display library) with
   the polypeptide of interest. Kits for generating and screening phage display libraries
15 are commercially available (e.g., the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System,
   Catalog No. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene SurJZAP Phage Display Kit, Catalog No.
   240612). Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for
   use in generating and screening antibody display library can be found in, for example,

            Completely human antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice which
10 are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains
   genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. For an overview of
   this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995) Int.
   Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing
   human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such
15 antibodies, see, e.g., U.S. Patent 5,625,126; U.S. Patent 5,633,425; U.S. Patent
   5,569,825; U.S. Patent 5,661,016; and U.S. Patent 5,545,806. In addition, companies
   such as Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, CA), can be engaged to provide human antibodies
   directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.
            An antibody directed against a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide (e.g., a
20 monoclonal antibody) can be used to isolate the polypeptide by standard techniques,
   such as affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation. Moreover, such an antibody
   can be used to detect the marker (e.g., in a cellular lysate or cell supernatant) in order
   to evaluate the level and pattern of expression of the marker. The antibodies can also
   be used diagnostically to monitor protein levels in tissues or body fluids (e.g., in a
25 tumor cell-containing body fluid) as part of a clinical testing procedure, e.g., to, for
   example, determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be
   facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable
   substances include, but are not limited to, various enzymes, prosthetic groups,
   fluorescent materials, luminescent materials, bioluminescent materials, and
30 radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include, but are not limited to,
   horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, P-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase;

   Antigens and Vaccines
10            Embodiments of the invention include preparations, e.g., antigenic
   preparations, of the entire fusion or a fragment thereof, e.g., a fragment capable of
   raising antibodies specific to the fusion protein, e.g., a fusion junction containing
   fragment (collectively referred to herein as a fusion specific polypeptides or FSP).
   The preparation can include an adjuvant or other component.
15            An FSP can be used as an antigen or vaccine. E.g., an FSP can be used as an
   antigen to immunize an animal, e.g., a rodent, e.g., a mouse or rat, rabbit, horse, goat,
   dog, or non-human primate, to obtain antibodies, e.g., fusion protein specific
   antibodies. In an embodiment a fusion specific antibody molecule is an antibody
   molecule described herein, e.g., a polyclonal. In other embodiments a fusion specific
20 antibody molecule is monospecific, e.g., monoclonal, human, humanized, chimeric or
   other monospecific antibody molecule. The fusion protein specific antibody
   molecules can be used to treat a subject having cancer, e.g., a cancer described herein.
              Embodiments of the invention include vaccine preparations that comprise an
   FSP capable of stimulating an immune response in a subject, e.g., by raising, in the
25 subject, antibodies specific to the fusion protein. The vaccine preparation can include
   other components, e.g., an adjuvant. The vaccine preparations can be used to treat a
   subject having cancer, e.g., a cancer described herein.
   Expression Vectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Cells
30            In another aspect, the invention includes vectors (e.g., expression vectors), containing
   a nucleic acid encoding a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide described herein. As used herein,
   the term "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic
                                                    48

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   acid to which it has been linked and can include a plasmid, cosmid or viral vector. The
   vector can be capable of autonomous replication or it can integrate into a host DNA. Viral
   vectors include, e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated
   viruses.
 5         A vector can include a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid in a form suitable for
   expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell. Preferably the recombinant expression vector
   includes one or more regulatory sequences operatively linked to the nucleic acid sequence to
   be expressed. The term "regulatory sequence" includes promoters, enhancers and other
   expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Regulatory sequences include
10 those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence, as well as tissue-specific
   regulatory and/or inducible sequences. The design of the expression vector can depend on
   such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein
   desired, and the like. The expression vectors can be introduced into host cells to thereby
   produce KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide, including fusion proteins or polypeptides encoded
15 by nucleic acids as described herein, mutant forms thereof, and the like).
           The term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell" or "recombinant cell"), as
   used herein, is intended to refer to a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has been
   introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the
   particular subject cell, but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may
20 occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such
   progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope
   of the term "host cell" as used herein.
           The recombinant expression vectors can be designed for expression of KIF5B-RET
   fusion polypeptide in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, polypeptides of the
25 invention can be expressed in E. coli, insect cells (e.g., using baculovirus expression vectors),
   yeast cells or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, (1990)
   Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego,
   CA. Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in
   vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase.
30         Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in E. coli with vectors
   containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or
   non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded
                                                  49

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors
   typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant protein; 2) to
   increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and 3) to aid in the purification of the
   recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, a proteolytic
 5 cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to
   enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to
   purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences,
   include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical fusion expression vectors include
   pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith, D.B. and Johnson, K.S. (1988) Gene 67:31-40),
10 pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) which
   fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to
   the target recombinant protein.
           Purified KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptides can be used in activity assays (e.g., direct
   assays or competitive assays described in detail below), or to generate antibodies specific for
15 KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptides.
           To maximize recombinant protein expression in E. coli is to express the protein in a
   host bacteria with an impaired capacity to proteolytically cleave the recombinant protein
   (Gottesman, S., (1990) Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic
   Press, San Diego, California 119-128). Another strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence
20 of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an expression vector so that the individual codons for
   each amino acid are those preferentially utilized in E. coli (Wada et al., (1992) Nucleic Acids
   Res. 20:2111-2118). Such alteration of nucleic acid sequences of the invention can be carried
   out by standard DNA synthesis techniques.
           The KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide expression vector can be a yeast expression
25 vector, a vector for expression in insect cells, e.g., a baculovirus expression vector or a vector
   suitable for expression in mammalian cells.
           When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions can be
   provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived
   from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40.
30         In another embodiment, the promoter is an inducible promoter, e.g., a promoter
   regulated by a steroid hormone, by a polypeptide hormone (e.g., by means of a signal
   transduction pathway), or by a heterologous polypeptide (e.g., the tetracycline-inducible
                                                 50

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   systems, "Tet-On" and "Tet-Off"; see, e.g., Clontech Inc., CA, Gossen and Bujard (1992)
   Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. USA 89:5547, and Paillard (1989) Human Gene Therapy 9:983).
           In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of
   directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue
 5 specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Non-limiting examples of
   suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert et al.
   (1987) Genes Dev. 1:268-277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton (1988) Adv.
   Immunol. 43:235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore
   (1989) EMBO J. 8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji et al. (1983) Cell 33:729-740;
10 Queen and Baltimore (1983) Cell 33:741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the
   neurofilament promoter; Byrne and Ruddle (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5473
   5477), pancreas-specific promoters (Edlund et al. (1985) Science 230:912-916), and
   mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Patent No. 4,873,316
   and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters
15 are also encompassed, for example, the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss (1990)
   Science 249:374-379) and the ax-fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman (1989) Genes
   Dev. 3:537-546).
           The invention further provides a recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA
   molecule of the invention cloned into the expression vector in an antisense orientation.
20 Regulatory sequences (e.g., viral promoters and/or enhancers) operatively linked to a nucleic
   acid cloned in the antisense orientation can be chosen which direct the constitutive, tissue
   specific or cell type specific expression of antisense RNA in a variety of cell types. The
   antisense expression vector can be in the form of a recombinant plasmid, phagemid or
   attenuated virus.
25         Another aspect the invention provides a host cell which includes a nucleic acid
   molecule described herein, e.g., a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule within a
   recombinant expression vector or a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule containing
   sequences which allow it to homologous recombination into a specific site of the host cell's
   genome.
30         A host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, a KIF5B-RET
   fusion polypeptide can be expressed in bacterial cells (such as E. coli), insect cells, yeast or
   mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS cells, e.g., COS-7
                                                 51

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   cells, CV-1 origin SV40 cells; Gluzman (1981) Cell 23:175-182). Other suitable host cells
   are known to those skilled in the art.
            Vector DNA can be introduced into host cells via conventional transformation or
   transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms "transformation" and "transfection" are
 5 intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid
   (e.g., DNA) into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co
   precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation.
            A host cell can be used to produce (e.g., express) a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide.
   Accordingly, the invention further provides methods for producing a KIF5B-RET fusion
10 polypeptide using the host cells. In one embodiment, the method includes culturing the host
   cell of the invention (into which a recombinant expression vector encoding a KIF5B-RET
   fusion polypeptide has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that a KIF5B-RET fusion
   polypeptide is produced. In another embodiment, the method further includes isolating a
   KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide from the medium or the host cell.
15          In another aspect, the invention features, a cell or purified preparation of cells which
   include a KIF5B-RET fusion transgene, or which otherwise misexpress KIF5B-RET fusion.
   The cell preparation can consist of human or non-human cells, e.g., rodent cells, e.g., mouse
   or rat cells, rabbit cells, or pig cells. In embodiments, the cell or cells include a KIF5B-RET
   fusion transgene, e.g., a heterologous form of a KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., a gene derived from
20 humans (in the case of a non-human cell). The KIF5B-RET fusion transgene can be
   misexpressed, e.g., overexpressed or underexpressed. In other preferred embodiments, the
   cell or cells include a gene that mis-expresses an endogenous KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., a gene
   the expression of which is disrupted, e.g., a knockout. Such cells can serve as a model for
   studying disorders that are related to mutated or mis-expressed KIF5B-RET fusion alleles
25 (e.g., cancers) or for use in drug screening, as described herein.
   Therapeutic Methods
            Alternatively, or in combination with the methods described herein, the
   invention features a method of treating a cancer or tumor harboring a KIF5B-RET
30 fusion described herein. The methods include administering an anti-cancer agent,
   e.g., a kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination, e.g., in combination with other

   chemotherapeutic agents or procedures, in an amount sufficient to reduce or inhibit
   the tumor cell growth, and/or treat or prevent the cancer(s), in the subject.
           "Treat," "treatment," and other forms of this word refer to the administration
   of a kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination with a second agent to impede growth of
 5 a cancer, to cause a cancer to shrink by weight or volume, to extend the expected
   survival time of the subject and or time to progression of the tumor or the like. In
   those subjects, treatment can include, but is not limited to, inhibiting tumor growth,
   reducing tumor mass, reducing size or number of metastatic lesions, inhibiting the
   development of new metastatic lesions, prolonged survival, prolonged progression
10 free survival, prolonged time to progression, and/or enhanced quality of life.
           As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the terms "prevent," "preventing"
   and "prevention" contemplate an action that occurs before a subject begins to suffer
   from the re-growth of the cancer and/or which inhibits or reduces the severity of the
   cancer.
15         As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a "therapeutically effective
   amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the
   treatment or management of the cancer, or to delay or minimize one or more
   symptoms associated with the cancer. A therapeutically effective amount of a
   compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other
20 therapeutic agents, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or
   management of the cancer. The term "therapeutically effective amount" can
   encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or
   causes of the cancer, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent.
           As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a "prophylactically effective
25 amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent re-growth of the cancer, or
   one or more symptoms associated with the cancer, or prevent its recurrence. A
   prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of the compound,
   alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, which provides a prophylactic
   benefit in the prevention of the cancer. The term "prophylactically effective amount"
30 can encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the
   prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent.

   AST-487.
15         In other embodiments, the anti-cancer agent is a KIF5B-RET antagonist
   inhibits the expression of nucleic acid encoding KIF5B-RET. Examples of such
   KIF5B-RET antagonists include nucleic acid molecules, for example, antisense
   molecules, ribozymes, RNAi, triple helix molecules that hybridize to a nucleic acid
   encoding KIF5B-RET, or a transcription regulatory region, and blocks or reduces
20 mRNA expression of KIF5B-RET.
           In other embodiments, the kinase inhibitor is administered in combination
   with a second therapeutic agent or a different therapeutic modality, e.g., anti-cancer
   agents, and/or in combination with surgical and/or radiation procedures.
           By "in combination with," it is not intended to imply that the therapy or the
25 therapeutic agents must be administered at the same time and/or formulated for
   delivery together, although these methods of delivery are within the scope of the
   invention. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered concurrently with,
   prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other additional therapies or therapeutic agents.
   In general, each agent will be administered at a dose and/or on a time schedule
30 determined for that agent. In will further be appreciated that the additional
   therapeutic agent utilized in this combination can be administered together in a single
   composition or administered separately in different compositions. The particular

   combination to employ in a regimen will take into account compatibility of the
   inventive pharmaceutical composition with the additional therapeutically active agent
   and/or the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved.
            For example, the second therapeutic agent can be a a cytotoxic or a cytostatic
 5 agent. Exemplary cytotoxic agents include antimicrotubule agents, topoisomerase
   inhibitors, or taxanes, antimetabolites, mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents,
   intercalating agents, agents capable of interfering with a signal transduction pathway,
   agents that promote apoptosis and radiation. In yet other embodiments, the methods
   can be used in combination with immunodulatory agents, e.g., IL-1, 2, 4, 6, or 12, or
10 interferon alpha or gamma, or immune cell growth factors such as GM-CSF.
            Anti-cancer agents, e.g., kinase inhibitors, used in the therapeutic methods of the
   invention can be evaluated using the screening assays described herein. In one
   embodiment, the anti-cancer agents are evaluated in a cell-free system, e.g., a cell lysate
   or in a reconstituted system. In other embodiments, the anti-cancer agents are evaluated
15 in a cell in culture, e.g., a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a mammalian cell, a
   tumor cell or cell line, a recombinant cell). In yet other embodiments, the anti-cancer
   agents are evaluated cell in vivo (a KIF5B-RET-expressing cell present in a subject, e.g.,
   an animal subject (e.g., an in vivo animal model).
            Exemplary parameters evaluated include one or more of:
20          (i) a change in binding activity, e.g., direct binding of the candidate agent to a
   KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide; a binding competition between a known ligand and the
   candidate agent to a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide;
            (ii) a change in kinase activity, e.g., phosphorylation levels of a KIF5B-RET
   fusion polypeptide (e.g., an increased or decreased autophosphorylation); or a change in
25 phosphorylation of a target of a RET kinase, e.g., focal adhesion kinase (FAK), persephin
   or glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF);
            (iii) a change in an activity of a cell containing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a tumor
   cell or a recombinant cell), e.g., a change in proliferation, morphology or tumorigenicity
   of the cell;
30          (iv) a change in tumor present in an animal subject, e.g., size, appearance,
   proliferation, of the tumor; or
                                                    56

            (v) a change in the level, e.g., expression level, of a KIF5B-RET fusion
   polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule.
            In one embodiment, a change in a cell free assay in the presence of a candidate
   agent is evaluated. For example, an activity of a KIF5B-RET fusion, or interaction of a
 5 KIF5B-RET fusion with a downstream ligand can be detected.
            In other embodiments, a change in an activity of a cell is detected in a cell in
   culture, e.g., a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a mammalian cell, a tumor cell
   or cell line, a recombinant cell). In one embodiment, the cell is a recombinant cell that is
   modified to express a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid, e.g., is a recombinant cell
10 transfected with a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid. The transfected cell can show a
   change in response to the expressed KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., increased proliferation,
   changes in morphology, increased tumorigenicity, and/or acquired a transformed
   phenotype. A change in any of the activities of the cell, e.g., the recombinant cell, in the
   presence of the candidate agent can be detected. For example, a decrease in one or more
15 of: proliferation, tumorigenicity, transformed morphology, in the presence of the
   candidate agent can be indicative of an inhibitor of a KIF5B-RET fusion. In other
   embodiments, a change in binding activity or phosphorylation as described herein is
   detected.
            In yet other embodiment, a change in a tumor present in an animal subject (e.g.,
20 an in vivo animal model) is detected. In one embodiment, the animal model is a tumor
   containing animal or a xenograft comprising cells expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g.,
   tumorigenic cells expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion). The anti-cancer agents can be
   administered to the animal subject and a change in the tumor is detected. In one
   embodiment, the change in the tumor includes one or more of a tumor growth, tumor
25 size, tumor burden, survival, is evaluated. A decrease in one or more of tumor growth,
   tumor size, tumor burden, or an increased survival is indicative that the candidate agent is
   an inhibitor.
            The screening methods and assays are described in more detail herein below.
30 Screening Methods
            In another aspect, the invention features a method, or assay, for screening for
   agents that modulate, e.g., inhibit, the expression or activity of a KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g.,
                                                   57

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   a KIF5B-RET fusion as described herein. The method includes contacting a KIF5B-RET
   fusion, or a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion, with a candidate agent; and detecting a
   change in a parameter associated with a KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., a change in the
   expression or an activity of the KIF5B-RET fusion. The method can, optionally, include
 5 comparing the treated parameter to a reference value, e.g., a control sample (e.g.,
   comparing a parameter obtained from a sample with the candidate agent to a parameter
   obtained from a sample without the candidate agent). In one embodiment, if a decrease
   in expression or activity of the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected, the candidate agent is
   identified as an inhibitor. In another embodiment, if an increase in expression or activity
10 of the KIF5B-RET fusion is detected, the candidate agent is identified as an activator. In
   certain embodiments, the KIF5B-RET fusion is a nucleic acid molecule or a polypeptide
   as described herein.
            In one embodiment, the contacting step is effected in a cell-free system, e.g., a
   cell lysate or in a reconstituted system. In other embodiments, the contacting step is
15 effected in a cell in culture, e.g., a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a
   mammalian cell, a tumor cell or cell line, a recombinant cell). In yet other embodiments,
   the contacting step is effected in a cell in vivo (a KIF5B-RET-expressing cell present in a
   subject, e.g., an animal subject (e.g., an in vivo animal model).
            Exemplary parameters evaluated include one or more of:
20          (i) a change in binding activity, e.g., direct binding of the candidate agent to a
   KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide; a binding competition between a known ligand and the
   candidate agent to a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide;
            (ii) a change in kinase activity, e.g., phosphorylation levels of a KIF5B-RET
   fusion polypeptide (e.g., an increased or decreased autophosphorylation); or a change in
25 phosphorylation of a target of a RET kinase, e.g., focal adhesion kinase (FAK), persephin
   or glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), In certain embodiments, a change in kinase
   activity, e.g., phosphorylation, is detected by any of Western blot (e.g., using an anti
   KIF5B or anti-RET antibody; a phosphor-specific antibody, detecting a shift in the
   molecular weight of a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide), mass spectrometry,
30 immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, immunomagnetic beads, among others;

            (iii) a change in an activity of a cell containing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a tumor
   cell or a recombinant cell), e.g., a change in proliferation, morphology or tumorigenicity
   of the cell;
            (iv) a change in tumor present in an animal subject, e.g., size, appearance,
 5 proliferation, of the tumor; or
            (v) a change in the level, e.g., expression level, of a KIF5B-RET fusion
   polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule.
            In one embodiment, a change in a cell free assay in the presence of a candidate
   agent is evaluated. For example, an activity of a KIF5B-RET fusion, or interaction of a
10 KIF5B-RET fusion with a downstream ligand can be detected. In one embodiment, a
   KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide is contacted with a ligand, e.g., in solution, and a
   candidate agent is monitored for an ability to modulate, e.g., inhibit, an interaction, e.g.,
   binding, between the KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide and the ligand. In one exemplary
   assay, purified KIF5B-RET fusion protein is contacted with a ligand, e.g., in solution,
15 and a candidate agent is monitored for an ability to inhibit interaction of the fusion
   protein with the ligand, or to inhibit phosphorylation of the ligand by the fusion protein.
   An effect on an interaction between the fusion protein and a ligand can be monitored by
   methods known in the art, such as by absorbance, and an effect on phosphorylation of the
   ligand can be assayed, e.g., by Western blot, immunoprecipitation, or immunomagnetic
20 beads.
            In other embodiments, a change in an activity of a cell is detected in a cell in
   culture, e.g., a cell expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., a mammalian cell, a tumor cell
   or cell line, a recombinant cell). In one embodiment, the cell is a recombinant cell that is
   modified to express a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid, e.g., is a recombinant cell
25 transfected with a KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid. The transfected cell can show a
   change in response to the expressed KIF5B-RET fusion, e.g., increased proliferation,
   changes in morphology, increased tumorigenicity, and/or acquired a transformed
   phenotype. A change in any of the activities of the cell, e.g., the recombinant cell, in the
   presence of the candidate agent can be detected. For example, a decrease in one or more
30 of: proliferation, tumorigenicity, transformed morphology, in the presence of the
   candidate agent can be indicative of an inhibitor of a KIF5B-RET fusion. In other
                                                    59

   embodiments, a change in binding activity or phosphorylation as described herein is
   detected.
            In an exemplary cell-based assay, a nucleic acid comprising a KIF5B-RET fusion
   can be expressed in a cell, such as a cell (e.g., a mammalian cell) in culture. The cell
 5 containing a nucleic acid expressing the KIF5B-RET fusion can be contacted with a
   candidate agent, and the cell is monitored for an effect of the candidate agent. A
   candidate agent that causes decreased cell proliferation or cell death can be determined to
   be a candidate for treating a tumor (e.g., a cancer) that carries a KIF5B-RET fusion.
            In one embodiment, a cell containing a nucleic acid expressing a KIF5B-RET
10 fusion can be monitored for expression of the KIF5B-RET fusion protein. Protein
   expression can be monitored by methods known in the art, such as by, e.g., mass
   spectrometry (e.g., tandem mass spectrometry), a reporter assay (e.g., a
   fluorescence-based assay), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. By one method,
   decreased KIF5B-RET expression is detected. A candidate agent that causes decreased
15 expression of the KIF5B-RET fusion protein as compared to a cell that does not contain
   the KIF5B-RET nucleic acid fusion can be determined to be a candidate for treating a
   tumor (e.g., a cancer) that carries a KIF5B-RET fusion.
            A cell containing a nucleic acid expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion can be
   monitored for altered KIF5B-RET kinase activity. Kinase activity can be assayed by
20 measuring the effect of a candidate agent on a known RET kinase target protein, such as
   focal adhesion kinase (FAK), persephin or GDNF (glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic
   factor).
            In yet other embodiment, a change in a tumor present in an animal subject (e.g.,
   an in vivo animal model) is detected. In one embodiment, the animal model is a tumor
25 containing animal or a xenograft comprising cells expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g.,
   tumorigenic cells expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion). The candidate agent can be
   administered to the animal subject and a change in the tumor is detected. In one
   embodiment, the change in the tumor includes one or more of a tumor growth, tumor
   size, tumor burden, survival, is evaluated. A decrease in one or more of tumor growth,
30 tumor size, tumor burden, or an increased survival is indicative that the candidate agent is
   an inhibitor.

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
            In one exemplary animal model, a xenograft is created by injecting cells into
   mouse. A candidate agent is administered to the mouse, e.g., by injection (such as
   subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or tail vein injection, or by injection directly into the
   tumor) or oral delivery, and the tumor is observed to determine an effect of the candidate
 5 anti-cancer agent. The health of the animal is also monitored, such as to determine if an
   animal treated with a candidate agent survives longer. A candidate agent that causes
   growth of the tumor to slow or stop, or causes the tumor to shrink in size, or causes
   decreased tumor burden, or increases survival time, can be considered to be a candidate
   for treating a tumor (e.g., a cancer) that carries a KIF5B-RET fusion.
10          In another exemplary animal assay, cells expressing a KIF5B-RET fusion are
   injected into the tail vein, e.g., of a mouse, to induce metastasis. A candidate agent is
   administered to the mouse, e.g., by injection (such as subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or
   tail vein injection, or by injection directly into the tumor) or oral delivery, and the tumor
   is observed to determine an effect of the candidate anti-cancer agent. A candidate agent
15 that inhibits or prevents or reduces metastasis, or increases survival time, can be
   considered to be a candidate for treating a tumor (e.g., a cancer) that carries a KIF5B
   RET fusion.
            Cell proliferation can be measured by methods known in the art, such as PCNA
   (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen) assay, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation,
20 Ki-67 assay, mitochondrial respiration, or propidium iodide staining. Cells can also be
   measured for apoptosis, such as by use of a TUNEL (Terminal Deoxynucleotide
   Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling) assay. Cells can also be assayed for presence of
   angiogenesis using methods known in the art, such as by measuring endothelial tube
   formation or by measuring the growth of blood vessels from subcutaneous tissue, such as
25 into a solid gel of basement membrane.
            In other embodiments, a change in expression of a KIF5B-RET fusion can be
   monitored by detecting the nucleic acid or protein levels, e.g., using the methods
   described herein.
            In certain embodiments, the screening methods described herein can be repeated
30 and/or combined. In one embodiment, a candidate agent that is evaluated in a cell-free or
   cell-based described herein can be further tested in an animal subject.
                                                   61

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
            In one embodiment, the candidate agent is identified and re-tested in the same or a
   different assay. For example, a test compound is identified in an in vitro or cell-free system,
   and re-tested in an animal model or a cell-based assay. Any order or combination of assays
   can be used. For example, a high throughput assay can be used in combination with an
 5 animal model or tissue culture.
            Candidate agents suitable for use in the screening assays described herein include,
   e.g., small molecule compounds, nucleic acids (e.g., siRNA, aptamers, short hairpin
   RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, antagomirs, microRNA mimics or DNA,
   e.g., for gene therapy) or polypeptides, e.g., antibodies (e.g., full length antibodies or
10 antigen-binding fragments thereof, Fab fragments, or scFv fragments). The candidate
   anti-cancer agents can be obtained from a library (e.g., a commercial library), or can be
   rationally designed, such as to target an active site in a functional domain of RET (e.g.,
   the kinase domain of RET), or a functional domain of KIF5B (e.g., the oligomerization
   domain or the kinesin domain).
15          In other embodiments, the method, or assay, includes providing a step based on
   proximity-dependent signal generation, e.g., a two-hybrid assay that includes a first fusion
   protein (e.g., a KIF5B-RET fusion protein), and a second fusion protein (e.g., a ligand),
   contacting the two-hybrid assay with a test compound, under conditions wherein said two
   hybrid assay detects a change in the formation and/or stability of the complex, e.g., the
20 formation of the complex initiates transcription activation of a reporter gene.
            In one non-limiting example, the three-dimensional structure of the active site of
   KIF5B-RET fusion is determined by crystallizing the complex formed by the KIF5B-RET
   fusion and a known inhibitor. Rational drug design is then used to identify new test agents by
   making alterations in the structure of a known inhibitor or by designing small molecule
25 compounds that bind to the active site of the KIF5B-RET fusion.
            The candidate agents can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in
   combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; peptoid
   libraries (libraries of molecules having the functionalities of peptides, but with a novel, non
   peptide backbone which are resistant to enzymatic degradation but which nevertheless remain
30 bioactive; see, e.g., Zuckermann, R.N. et al. (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:2678-85); spatially
   addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods
   requiring deconvolution; the 'one-bead one-compound' library method; and synthetic library

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library and peptoid library
   approaches are limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to
   peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam (1997)
   Anticancer Drug Des. 12:145).
 5         Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art,
   for example in: DeWitt et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6909; Erb et al. (1994)

10 J. Med. Chem. 37:1233.
           Libraries of compounds may be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten (1992)
   Biotechniques 13:412-421), or on beads (Lam (1991) Nature 354:82-84), chips (Fodor (1993)
   Nature 364:555-556), bacteria (Ladner, U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409), spores (Ladner U.S.
   Patent No. 5,223,409), plasmids (Cull et al. (1992) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:1865-1869)
15 or on phage (Scott and Smith (1990) Science 249:386-390; Devlin (1990) Science 249:404
   406; Cwirla et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 87:6378-6382; Felici (1991) J. Mol. Biol.
   222:301-3 10; Ladner supra.).
           The interaction between two molecules can also be detected, e.g., using fluorescence
   energy transfer (FET) (see, for example, Lakowicz et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,631,169;
20 Stavrianopoulos, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,868,103). A fluorophore label on the first, 'donor'
   molecule is selected such that its emitted fluorescent energy will be absorbed by a fluorescent
   label on a second, 'acceptor' molecule, which in turn is able to fluoresce due to the absorbed
   energy. Alternately, the 'donor' protein molecule may simply utilize the natural fluorescent
   energy of tryptophan residues. Labels are chosen that emit different wavelengths of light,
25 such that the 'acceptor' molecule label may be differentiated from that of the 'donor'. Since
   the efficiency of energy transfer between the labels is related to the distance separating the
   molecules, the spatial relationship between the molecules can be assessed. In a situation in
   which binding occurs between the molecules, the fluorescent emission of the 'acceptor'
   molecule label in the assay should be maximal. An FET binding event can be conveniently
30 measured through standard fluorometric detection means known in the art (e.g., using a
   fluorimeter).
                                                 63

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
           In another embodiment, determining the ability of the KIF5B-RET fusion protein
   to bind to a target molecule can be accomplished using real-time Biomolecular
   Interaction Analysis (BIA) (see, e.g., Sjolander, S. and Urbaniczky, C. (1991) Anal.
   Chem. 63:2338-2345 and Szabo et al. (1995) Curr.Opin. Struct. Biol. 5:699-705).
 5 "Surface plasmon resonance" or "BIA" detects biospecific interactions in real time,
   without labeling any of the interactants (e.g., BlAcore). Changes in the mass at the
   binding surface (indicative of a binding event) result in alterations of the refractive index
   of light near the surface (the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)),
   resulting in a detectable signal which can be used as an indication of real-time reactions
10 between biological molecules.
   Nucleic Acid Inhibitors
           In yet another embodiment, the KIF5B-RET fusion inhibitor inhibits the expression of
   nucleic acid encoding a KIF5B-RET fusion. Examples of such KIF5B-RET fusion inhibitors
15 include nucleic acid molecules, for example, antisense molecules, ribozymes, siRNA, triple
   helix molecules that hybridize to a nucleic acid encoding a KIF5B-RET fusion, or a
   transcription regulatory region, and blocks or reduces mRNA expression of the KIF5B-RET
   fusion.
           In one embodiment, the nucleic acid antagonist is a siRNA that targets mRNA
20 encoding KIF5B-RET fusion. Other types of antagonistic nucleic acids can also be used, e.g.,
   a dsRNA, a ribozyme, a triple-helix former, or an antisense nucleic acid. Accordingly,
   isolated nucleic acid molecules that are nucleic acid inhibitors, e.g., antisense, RNAi, to a
   KIF5B-RET fusion-encoding nucleic acid molecule are provided.
           An "antisense" nucleic acid can include a nucleotide sequence which is
25 complementary to a "sense" nucleic acid encoding a protein, e.g., complementary to the
   coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA molecule or complementary to an mRNA
   sequence. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to an entire KIF5B-RET fusion
   coding strand, or to only a portion thereof. In another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid
   molecule is antisense to a "noncoding region" of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence
30 encoding KIF5B-RET fusion (e.g., the 5' and Y untranslated regions). Anti-sense agents can
   include, for example, from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases (i.e. from about 8 to about 80
   nucleotides), e.g., about 8 to about 50 nucleobases, or about 12 to about 30 nucleobases.
                                                 64

     WO 2013/028817                                                              PCT/US2012/051978
   Anti-sense compounds include ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides
   (oligozymes), and other short catalytic RNAs or catalytic oligonucleotides which hybridize to
   the target nucleic acid and modulate its expression. Anti-sense compounds can include a
   stretch of at least eight consecutive nucleobases that are complementary to a sequence in the
 5 target gene. An oligonucleotide need not be 100% complementary to its target nucleic acid
   sequence to be specifically hybridizable. An oligonucleotide is specifically hybridizable
   when binding of the oligonucleotide to the target interferes with the normal function of the
   target molecule to cause a loss of utility, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity
   to avoid non-specific binding of the oligonucleotide to non-target sequences under conditions
10 in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo
   assays or therapeutic treatment or, in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the
   assays are conducted.
           Hybridization of antisense oligonucleotides with mRNA can interfere with one or
   more of the normal functions of mRNA. The functions of mRNA to be interfered with
15 include all key functions such as, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site of protein
   translation, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more
   mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in by the RNA. Binding of
   specific protein(s) to the RNA may also be interfered with by antisense oligonucleotide
   hybridization to the RNA.
20         Exemplary antisense compounds include DNA or RNA sequences that specifically
   hybridize to the target nucleic acid, e.g., the mRNA encoding KIF5B-RET fusion. The
   complementary region can extend for between about 8 to about 80 nucleobases. The
   compounds can include one or more modified nucleobases. Modified nucleobases are known
   in the art. Descriptions of modified nucleic acid agents are also available. See, e.g., U.S.

30         The antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention are typically administered to a
   subject (e.g., by direct injection at a tissue site), or generated in situ such that they hybridize
   with or bind to cellular mRNA and/or genomic DNA encoding a KIF5B-RET fusion to
                                                   65

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   thereby inhibit expression of the protein, e.g., by inhibiting transcription and/or translation.
   Alternatively, antisense nucleic acid molecules can be modified to target selected cells and
   then administered systemically. For systemic administration, antisense molecules can be
   modified such that they specifically bind to receptors or antigens expressed on a selected cell
 5 surface, e.g., by linking the antisense nucleic acid molecules to peptides or antibodies which
   bind to cell surface receptors or antigens. The antisense nucleic acid molecules can also be
   delivered to cells using the vectors described herein. To achieve sufficient intracellular
   concentrations of the antisense molecules, vector constructs in which the antisense nucleic
   acid molecule is placed under the control of a strong pol II or pol III promoter are preferred.
10          In yet another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule of the invention is an
   a-anomeric nucleic acid molecule. An a-anomeric nucleic acid molecule forms specific
   double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual j-units,
   the strands run parallel to each other (Gaultier et al. (1987) Nucleic Acids. Res. 15:6625
   6641). The antisense nucleic acid molecule can also comprise a 2'-o-methylribonucleotide
15 (Inoue et al. (1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15:6131-6148) or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue
   (Inoue et al. (1987) FEBS Lett. 215:327-330).
             siRNAs are small double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that optionally include
   overhangs. For example, the duplex region of an siRNA is about 18 to 25 nucleotides in
   length, e.g., about 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 nucleotides in length. Typically, the siRNA
20 sequences are exactly complementary to the target mRNA. dsRNAs and siRNAs in particular
   can be used to silence gene expression in mammalian cells (e.g., human cells). siRNAs also
   include short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) with 29-base-pair stems and 2-nucleotide 3'
   overhangs. See, e.g., Clemens et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:6499-6503; Billy
   et al. (2001) Proc. Natl. Sci. USA 98:14428-14433; Elbashir et al. (2001) Nature. 411:494-8;

   Biotechnol. 23(2):227-31; 20040086884; U.S. 20030166282; 20030143204; 20040038278;
   and 20030224432.
            In still another embodiment, an antisense nucleic acid of the invention is a ribozyme.
   A ribozyme having specificity for a KIF5B-RET fusion -encoding nucleic acid can include
30 one or more sequences complementary to the nucleotide sequence of a KIF5B-RET fusion
   cDNA disclosed herein (i.e., SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:3), and a sequence having known
   catalytic sequence responsible for mRNA cleavage (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,246 or Haselhoff
                                                  66

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   and Gerlach (1988) Nature 334:585-591). For example, a derivative of a Tetrahymena L-19
   IVS RNA can be constructed in which the nucleotide sequence of the active site is
   complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be cleaved in a KIF5B-RET fusion -encoding
   mRNA. See, e.g., Cech et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,987,071; and Cech et al. U.S. Patent No.
 5 5,116,742. Alternatively, KIF5B-RET fusion mRNA can be used to select a catalytic RNA
   having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules. See, e.g., Bartel, D.
   and Szostak, J.W. (1993) Science 261:1411-1418.
           KIF5B-RET fusion gene expression can be inhibited by targeting nucleotide
   sequences complementary to the regulatory region of the KIF5B-RET fusion to form triple
10 helical structures that prevent transcription of the KIF5B-RET fusion gene in target cells. See
   generally, Helene, C. (1991) AnticancerDrug Des. 6:569-84; Helene, C. i (1992) Ann. N.Y
   Acad. Sci. 660:27-36; and Maher, L.J. (1992) Bioassays 14:807-15. The potential sequences
   that can be targeted for triple helix formation can be increased by creating a so-called
   "switchback" nucleic acid molecule. Switchback molecules are synthesized in an alternating
15 5'-3', Y-5' manner, such that they base pair with first one strand of a duplex and then the
   other, eliminating the necessity for a sizeable stretch of either purines or pyrimidines to be
   present on one strand of a duplex.
           The invention also provides detectably labeled oligonucleotide primer and probe
   molecules. Typically, such labels are chemiluminescent, fluorescent, radioactive, or
20 colorimetric.
           A KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule can be modified at the base moiety, sugar
   moiety or phosphate backbone to improve, e.g., the stability, hybridization, or solubility of
   the molecule. For non-limiting examples of synthetic oligonucleotides with modifications
   see Toulm6 (2001) Nature Biotech. 19:17 and Faria et al. (2001) Nature Biotech. 19:40-44.
25 Such phosphoramidite oligonucleotides can be effective antisense agents.
           For example, the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid molecules can
   be modified to generate peptide nucleic acids (see Hyrup B. et al. (1996) Bioorganic &
   Medicinal Chemistry 4: 5-23). As used herein, the terms "peptide nucleic acid" or "PNA"
   refers to a nucleic acid mimic, e.g., a DNA mimic, in which the deoxyribose phosphate
30 backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone and only the four natural nucleobases are
   retained. The neutral backbone of a PNA can allow for specific hybridization to DNA and
   RNA under conditions of low ionic strength. The synthesis of PNA oligomers can be
                                                 67

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   performed using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols as described in Hyrup B. et
   al. (1996) supra and Perry-O'Keefe et al. Proc. Nati. A cad. Sci. 93: 14670-675.
           PNAs of KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecules can be used in therapeutic and
   diagnostic applications. For example, PNAs can be used as antisense or antigene agents for
 5 sequence-specific modulation of gene expression by, for example, inducing transcription or
   translation arrest or inhibiting replication. PNAs of KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid
   molecules can also be used in the analysis of single base pair mutations in a gene, (e.g., by
   PNA-directed PCR clamping); as 'artificial restriction enzymes' when used in combination
   with other enzymes, (e.g., SI nucleases (Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra)); or as probes or
10 primers for DNA sequencing or hybridization (Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra; Perry-O'Keefe
   supra).
           In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such
   as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport
   across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al. (1989) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA
15 86:6553-6556; Lemaitre et al. (1987) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 84:648-652; W088/09810)
   or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., WO 89/10134). In addition, oligonucleotides can be
   modified with hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (see, e.g., Krol et al. (1988) Bio
   Techniques 6:958-976) or intercalating agents (See, e.g., Zon (1988) Pharm. Res. 5:539-549).
   To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, (e.g., a peptide,
20 hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, or hybridization-triggered
   cleavage agent).
   Evaluation of Subjects
            Subjects, e.g., patients, can be evaluated for the presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion.
25 A patient can be evaluated, for example, by determining the genomic sequence of the
   patient, e.g., by an NGS method. Alternatively, or in addition, evaluation of a patient can
   include directly assaying for the presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion in the patient, such as
   by an assay to detect a KIF5B-RET nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA), such as by,
   Southern blot, Northern blot, or RT-PCR, e.g., qRT-PCR. Alternatively, or in addition, a
30 patient can be evaluated for the presence of a KIF5B-RET protein fusion, such as by
   immunohistochemistry, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, or immunomagnetic bead
   assay.
                                                  68

     WO 2013/028817                                                                PCT/US2012/051978
            Evaluation of a patient can also include a cytogenetic assay, such as by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), to identify the chromosomal rearrangement
   resulting in the KIF5B-RET fusion. For example, to perform FISH, at least a first
   probe tagged with a first detectable label can be designed to target KIF5B, such as in
 5 one or more of exons 1-15 of KIF5B (e.g., the exons containing the part of the protein
   that includes the kinesin motor domain and the oligomeric domain), and at least a
   second probe tagged with a second detectable label can be designed to target RET,
   such as in one or more of exons 12-25 of RET (e.g., the exons containing the part of
   the protein that includes the tyrosine kinase domain). The at least one first probe and
10 the at least one second probe will be closer together in patients who carry the
   KIF5B-RET fusion than in patients who do not carry the KIF5B-RET fusion.
            Additional methods for KIF5B-RET fusion detection are provided below.
            In one aspect, the results of a clinical trial, e.g., a successful or unsuccessful
   clinical trial, can be repurposed to identify agents that target a KIF5B-RET fusion. By
15 one exemplary method, a candidate agent used in a clinical trial can be reevaluated to
   determine if the agent in the trial targets a KIF5B-RET fusion, or is effective to treat a
   tumor containing a KIF5B-RET fusion. For example, subjects who participated in a
   clinical trial for an agent, such as a kinase inhibitor, can be identified. Patients who
   experienced an improvement in symptoms, e.g., cancer (e.g., lung cancer) symptoms,
20 such as decreased tumor size, or decreased rate of tumor growth, can be evaluated for the
   presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion. Patients who did not experience an improvement in
   cancer symptoms can also be evaluated for the presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion. Where
   patients carrying a KIF5B-RET fusion are found to have been more likely to respond to
   the test agent than patients who did not carry a KIF5B-RET fusion, then the agent is
25 determined to be an appropriate treatment option for a patient carrying the KIF5B-RET
   fusion.
            "Reevaluation" of patients can include, for example, determining the genomic
   sequence of the patients, or a subset of the clinical trial patients, e.g., by an NGS method.
   Alternatively, or in addition, reevaluation of the patients can include directly assaying for
30 the presence of a KIF5B-RET fusion in the patient, such as by an assay to detect a
   KIF5B-RET nucleic acid (e.g., RNA), such as by RT-PCR, e.g., qRT-PCR.
   Alternatively, or in addition, a patient can be evaluated for the presence of a KIF5B-RET

            Clinical trials suitable for repurposing as described above include trials that
   tested RET inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, multikinase inhibitors, and drugs
 5 purported to act upstream or downstream of RET in a pathway involving RET. Other
   clinical trials suitable for repurposing as described above include trials that tested
   KIF5B inhibitors, kinesin inhibitors, inhibitors of cell trafficking and drugs purported
   to act upstream or downstream of KIF5B in a pathway involving KIF5B.
10 Methods for Detection of KIF5B-RET Fusion Nucleic Acids and Polypeptides
            Methods for evaluating a KIF5B-RET gene, mutations and/or gene products
   are known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the KIF5B-RET fusion is
   detected in a nucleic acid molecule by a method chosen from one or more of: nucleic
   acid hybridization assay, amplification-based assays (e.g., polymerase chain reaction
15 (PCR)), PCR-RFLP assay, real-time PCR, sequencing, screening analysis (including
   metaphase cytogenetic analysis by standard karyotype methods, FISH (e.g., break
   away FISH), spectral karyotyping or MFISH, comparative genomic hybridization), in
   situ hybridization, SSP, HPLC or mass-spectrometric genotyping.
            Additional exemplary methods include, traditional "direct probe" methods
20 such as Southern blots or in situ hybridization (e.g., fluorescence in situ hybridization
   (FISH) and FISH plus SKY), and "comparative probe" methods such as comparative
   genomic hybridization (CGH), e.g., cDNA-based or oligonucleotide-based CGH, can
   be used. The methods can be used in a wide variety of formats including, but not
   limited to, substrate (e.g., membrane or glass) bound methods or array-based
25 approaches.
            In certain embodiments, the evaluation methods include the probes/primers
   described herein.
            In one embodiment, probes/primers can be designed to detect a KIF5B/RET
   fusion. The KIF5B probes/primers can be from nucleotides 1-1725 of SEQ ID NO: 1
30 (e.g., can hybridize to the nucleotides encoding exons 1-15 of the KIF5B protein).
   These probes/primers are suitable, e.g., for FISH or PCR amplification. The RET
   probes/primers can be from nucleotides 1726-2934 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (e.g., can
                                                   70

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   hybridize to the nucleotides encoding exons 12-20 of the RET protein). These
   probes/primers are suitable, e.g., for FISH or PCR amplification. For PCR, e.g., to
   amply the region including the KIF5B/RET fusion junction, forward primers can be
   designed to hybridize to KIF5B sequence from nucleotides 1-1725 of SEQ ID NO:1,
 5 and reverse primers can be designed to hybridize from nucleotides 1726-2934 of SEQ
   ID NO:1.
            In another embodiment, probes/primers can be designed to detect a
   RET/KIF5B fusion. The RET probes/primers can be from nucleotides 1-2138 of SEQ
   ID NO:3 (i.e., can hybridize to the nucleotides encoding exons 1-11 of the RET
10 protein). These probes/primers are suitable, e.g., for FISH or PCR amplification.
   The KIF5B probes/primers can be from nucleotides 2139-3360 of SEQ ID NO:3 (i.e.,
   can hybridize to the nucleotides encoding exons 16-26 of the KIF5B protein). These
   probes/primers are suitable, e.g., for FISH or PCR amplification. For PCR, e.g., to
   amply the region including the RET/KIF5B fusion junction, forward primers can be
15 designed to hybridize to Ret sequence from nucleotides 1-2138 of SEQ ID NO:3, and
   reverse primers can be designed to hybridize from nucleotides 2139-3360 of SEQ ID
   NO:3.
            In one embodiment, FISH analysis is used to identify the chromosomal
   rearrangement resulting in the KIF5B-RET fusion as described above. For example,
20 to perform FISH, at least a first probe tagged with a first detectable label can be
   designed to target KIF5B, such as in one or more of exons 1-15 of KIF5B (e.g., the
   exons containing the part of the protein that includes the kinesin motor domain and
   the oligomeric domain), and at least a second probe tagged with a second detectable
   label can be designed to target RET, such as in one or more of exons 12-25 of RET
25 (e.g., the exons containing the part of the protein that includes the tyrosine kinase
   domain). The at least one first probe and the at least one second probe will be closer
   together in a subject who carries the KIF5B-RET fusion compared to a subject who
   does not carry the KIF5B-RET fusion.
            In one approach, a variation of a FISH assay, e.g., "break-away FISH", is used
30 to evaluate a patient. By this method, at least one probe targeting the RET intron 11/
   RET exon 12 junction and at least one probe targeting KIF5B, e.g., at one or more of
   exons 1-15, and or introns 1-14, are utilized. In normal cells, both probes with be
                                                 71

     WO 2013/028817                                                        PCT/US2012/051978
   observed (or a secondary color will be observed due to the close proximity of the
   KIF5B and RET genes), and only the KIF5B probe will be observed when the
   translocation occurs. Other variations of the FISH method known in the art are
   suitable for evaluating a patient.
 5         Probes are used that contain DNA segments that are essentially
   complementary to DNA base sequences existing in different portions of
   chromosomes. Examples of probes useful according to the invention, and labeling
   and hybridization of probes to samples are described in two U.S. patents to Vysis, Inc.
   U.S. Patent Nos. 5,491,224 and 6,277,569 to Bittner, et al.
10         Additional protocols for FISH detection are described below.
           Chromosomal probes are typically about 50 to about 105 nucleotides in length.
   Longer probes typically comprise smaller fragments of about 100 to about 500
   nucleotides in length. Probes that hybridize with centromeric DNA and locus-specific
   DNA are available commercially, for example, from Vysis, Inc. (Downers Grove,
15 Ill.), Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, Oreg.) or from Cytocell (Oxfordshire, UK).
   Alternatively, probes can be made non-commercially from chromosomal or genomic
   DNA through standard techniques. For example, sources of DNA that can be used
   include genomic DNA, cloned DNA sequences, somatic cell hybrids that contain one,
   or a part of one, chromosome (e.g., human chromsome) along with the normal
20 chromosome complement of the host, and chromosomes purified by flow cytometry
   or microdissection. The region of interest can be isolated through cloning, or by site
   specific amplification via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). See, for example,
   Nath and Johnson, Biotechnic Histochem., 1998, 73(1):6-22, Wheeless et al.,
   Cytometry 1994, 17:319-326, and U.S. Patent No. 5,491,224.
25         The probes to be used hybridize to a specific region of a chromosome to
   determine whether a cytogenetic abnormality is present in this region. One type of
   cytogenetic abnormality is a deletion. Although deletions can be of one or more
   entire chromosomes, deletions normally involve loss of part of one or more
   chromosomes. If the entire region of a chromosome that is contained in a probe is
30 deleted from a cell, hybridization of that probe to the DNA from the cell will normally
   not occur and no signal will be present on that chromosome. If the region of a
   chromosome that is partially contained within a probe is deleted from a cell,
                                                 72

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   hybridization of that probe to the DNA from the cell can still occur, but less of a
   signal can be present. For example, the loss of a signal is compared to probe
   hybridization to DNA from control cells that do not contain the genetic abnormalities
   which the probes are intended to detect. In some embodiments, at least 1, 5, 10, 20,
 5 30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120,130,140,150,160,170,180,190,200,or
   more cells are enumerated for presence of the cytogenetic abnormality.
            Cytogenetic abnormalities to be detected can include, but are not limited to,
   non-reciprocal translocations, intra-chromosomal inversions, point mutations,
   deletions, gene copy number changes, gene expression level changes, and germ line
10 mutations. In particular, one type of cytogenetic abnormality is a duplication.
   Duplications can be of entire chromosomes, or of regions smaller than an entire
   chromosome. If the region of a chromosome that is contained in a probe is duplicated
   in a cell, hybridization of that probe to the DNA from the cell will normally produce
   at least one additional signal as compared to the number of signals present in control
15 cells with no abnormality of the chromosomal region contained in the probe.
            Chromosomal probes are labeled so that the chromosomal region to which
   they hybridize can be detected. Probes typically are directly labeled with a
   fluorophore, an organic molecule that fluoresces after absorbing light of lower
   wavelength/higher energy. The fluorophore allows the probe to be visualized without
20 a secondary detection molecule. After covalently attaching a fluorophore to a
   nucleotide, the nucleotide can be directly incorporated into the probe with standard
   techniques such as nick translation, random priming, and PCR labeling.
   Alternatively, deoxycytidine nucleotides within the probe can be transaminated with a
   linker. The fluorophore then is covalently attached to the transaminated
25 deoxycytidine nucleotides. See, U.S. Patent No. 5,491,224.
            U.S. Patent No. 5,491,224 describes probe labeling as a number of the
   cytosine residues having a fluorescent label covalently bonded thereto. The number
   of fluorescently labeled cytosine bases is sufficient to generate a detectable
   fluorescent signal while the individual so labeled DNA segments essentially retain
30 their specific complementary binding (hybridizing) properties with respect to the
   chromosome or chromosome region to be detected. Such probes are made by taking
   the unlabeled DNA probe segment, transaminating with a linking group a number of
                                                  73

     WO 2013/028817                                                          PCT/US2012/051978
   deoxycytidine nucleotides in the segment, covalently bonding a fluorescent label to at
   least a portion of the transaminated deoxycytidine bases.
            Probes can also be labeled by nick translation, random primer labeling or PCR
   labeling. Labeling is done using either fluorescent (direct)-or haptene (indirect)
 5 labeled nucleotides. Representative, non-limiting examples of labels include:
   AMCA-6-dUTP, CascadeBlue-4-dUTP, Fluorescein-12-dUTP, Rhodamine-6-dUTP,
   TexasRed-6-dUTP, Cy3-6-dUTP, Cy5-dUTP, Biotin(BIO)-1 1-dUTP,
   Digoxygenin(DIG)-1 1-dUTP or Dinitrophenyl (DNP)-1 1-dUTP.
            Probes also can be indirectly labeled with biotin or digoxygenin, or labeled
10 with radioactive isotopes such as 3 p and .3H, although secondary detection molecules
   or further processing then is required to visualize the probes. For example, a probe
   labeled with biotin can be detected by avidin conjugated to a detectable marker. For
   example, avidin can be conjugated to an enzymatic marker such as alkaline
   phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. Enzymatic markers can be detected in
15 standard colorimetric reactions using a substrate and/or a catalyst for the enzyme.
   Catalysts for alkaline phosphatase include 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and
   nitro blue tetrazolium. Diaminobenzoate can be used as a catalyst for horseradish
   peroxidase.
            Probes can also be prepared such that a fluorescent or other label is not part of
20 the DNA before or during the hybridization, and is added after hybridization to detect
   the probe hybridized to a chromosome. For example, probes can be used that have
   antigenic molecules incorporated into the DNA. After hybridization, these antigenic
   molecules are detected using specific antibodies reactive with the antigenic molecules.
   Such antibodies can themselves incorporate a fluorochrome, or can be detected using
25 a second antibody with a bound fluorochrome.
            However treated or modified, the probe DNA is commonly purified in order to
   remove unreacted, residual products (e.g., fluorochrome molecules not incorporated
   into the DNA) before use in hybridization.
            Prior to hybridization, chromosomal probes are denatured according to
30 methods well known in the art. Probes can be hybridized or annealed to the
   chromosomal DNA under hybridizing conditions. "Hybridizing conditions" are
   conditions that facilitate annealing between a probe and target chromosomal DNA.
                                                 74

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   Since annealing of different probes will vary depending on probe length, base
   concentration and the like, annealing is facilitated by varying probe concentration,
   hybridization temperature, salt concentration and other factors well known in the art.
            Hybridization conditions are facilitated by varying the concentrations, base
 5 compositions, complexities, and lengths of the probes, as well as salt concentrations,
   temperatures, and length of incubation. For example, in situ hybridizations are
   typically performed in hybridization buffer containing 1-2x SSC, 50-65% formamide
   and blocking DNA to suppress non-specific hybridization. In general, hybridization
   conditions, as described above, include temperatures of about 250 C to about 550 C,
10 and incubation lengths of about 0.5 hours to about 96 hours.
            Non-specific binding of chromosomal probes to DNA outside of the target
   region can be removed by a series of washes. Temperature and concentration of salt
   in each wash are varied to control stringency of the washes. For example, for high
   stringency conditions, washes can be carried out at about 650 C to about 800 C, using
15 0.2x to about 2x SSC, and about 0.1% to about 1% of a non-ionic detergent such as
   Nonidet P-40 (NP40). Stringency can be lowered by decreasing the temperature of
   the washes or by increasing the concentration of salt in the washes. In some
   applications it is necessary to block the hybridization capacity of repetitive sequences.
   Thus, in some embodiments, tRNA, human genomic DNA, or Cot-I DNA is used to
20 block non-specific hybridization. After washing, the slide is allowed to drain and air
   dry, then mounting medium, a counterstain such as DAPI, and a coverslip are applied
   to the slide. Slides can be viewed immediately or stored at -20' C. before
   examination.
            For fluorescent probes used in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
25 techniques, fluorescence can be viewed with a fluorescence microscope equipped with
   an appropriate filter for each fluorophore, or by using dual or triple band-pass filter
   sets to observe multiple fluorophores. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,776,688.
   Alternatively, techniques such as flow cytometry can be used to examine the
   hybridization pattern of the chromosomal probes.
30          In CGH methods, a first collection of nucleic acids (e.g., from a sample, e.g., a
   possible tumor) is labeled with a first label, while a second collection of nucleic acids
   (e.g., a control, e.g., from a healthy cell/tissue) is labeled with a second label. The
                                                   75

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   ratio of hybridization of the nucleic acids is determined by the ratio of the two (first
   and second) labels binding to each fiber in the array. Where there are chromosomal
   deletions or multiplications, differences in the ratio of the signals from the two labels
   will be detected and the ratio will provide a measure of the copy number. Array
 5 based CGH can also be performed with single-color labeling (as opposed to labeling
   the control and the possible tumor sample with two different dyes and mixing them
   prior to hybridization, which will yield a ratio due to competitive hybridization of
   probes on the arrays). In single color CGH, the control is labeled and hybridized to
   one array and absolute signals are read, and the possible tumor sample is labeled and
10 hybridized to a second array (with identical content) and absolute signals are read.
   Copy number difference is calculated based on absolute signals from the two arrays.
           Hybridization protocols suitable for use with the methods of the invention are
   described, e.g., in Albertson (1984) EMBO J. 3: 1227-1234; Pinkel (1988) Proc. Natl.
   Acad. Sci. USA 85: 9138-9142; EPO Pub. No. 430,402; Methods in Molecular
15 Biology, Vol. 33: In situ Hybridization Protocols, Choo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa,
   N.J. (1994), etc. In one embodiment, the hybridization protocol of Pinkel, et al.
   (1998) Nature Genetics 20: 207-211, or of Kallioniemi (1992) Proc. Natl Acad Sci
   USA 89:5321-5325 (1992) is used. Array-based CGH is described in U.S. Patent No.
   6,455,258, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
20         In still another embodiment, amplification-based assays can be used to
   measure presence/absence and copy number. In such amplification-based assays, the
   nucleic acid sequences act as a template in an amplification reaction (e.g., Polymerase
   Chain Reaction (PCR). In a quantitative amplification, the amount of amplification
   product will be proportional to the amount of template in the original sample.
25 Comparison to appropriate controls, e.g., healthy tissue, provides a measure of the
   copy number.
           Methods of "quantitative" amplification are well known to those of skill in the
   art. For example, quantitative PCR involves simultaneously co-amplifying a known
   quantity of a control sequence using the same primers. This provides an internal
30 standard that can be used to calibrate the PCR reaction. Detailed protocols for
   quantitative PCR are provided in Innis, et al. (1990) PCR Protocols, A Guide to
   Methods and Applications, Academic Press, Inc. N.Y.). Measurement of DNA copy

   number at microsatellite loci using quantitative PCR analysis is described in
   Ginzonger, et al. (2000) CancerResearch 60:5405-5409. The known nucleic acid
   sequence for the genes is sufficient to enable one of skill in the art to routinely select
   primers to amplify any portion of the gene. Fluorogenic quantitative PCR can also be
 5 used in the methods of the invention. In fluorogenic quantitative PCR, quantitation is
   based on amount of fluorescence signals, e.g., TaqMan and sybr green.
            Other suitable amplification methods include, but are not limited to, ligase
   chain reaction (LCR) (see Wu and Wallace (1989) Genomics 4: 560, Landegren, et al.
   (1988) Science 241:1077, and Barringer et al. (1990) Gene 89: 117), transcription
10 amplification (Kwoh, et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. USA 86: 1173), self
   sustained sequence replication (Guatelli, et al. (1990) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 87:
    1874), dot PCR, and linker adapter PCR, etc.
   Nucleic Acid Samples
15         A variety of tissue samples can be the source of the nucleic acid samples used in
   the present methods. Genomic or subgenomic DNA fragments can be isolated from a
   subject's sample (e.g., a tumor sample, a normal adjacent tissue (NAT), a blood sample
   or any normal control)). In certain embodiments, the tissue sample is preserved as a
   frozen sample or as formaldehyde- or paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
20 tissue preparation. For example, the sample can be embedded in a matrix, e.g., an FFPE
   block or a frozen sample. The isolating step can include flow-sorting of individual
   chromosomes; and/or micro-dissecting a subject's sample (e.g., a tumor sample, a NAT,
   a blood sample).
           Protocols for DNA isolation from a tissue sample are known in the art.
25 Additional methods to isolate nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) from formaldehyde- or
   paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are disclosed, e.g., in Cronin
   M. et al., (2004) Am JPathol.164(1):35-42; Masuda N. et al., (1999) Nucleic Acids Res.

   temperatures to solubilize paraffin-embedded samples and a glass-fiber filter to capture

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   nucleic acids. QIAamp@ DNA FFPE Tissue Kit uses QIAamp@ DNA Micro technology
   for purification of genomic and mitochondrial DNA.
            The isolated nucleic acid samples (e.g., genomic DNA samples) can be
   fragmented or sheared by practicing routine techniques. For example, genomic DNA can
 5 be fragmented by physical shearing methods, enzymatic cleavage methods, chemical
   cleavage methods, and other methods well known to those skilled in the art. The nucleic
   acid library can contain all or substantially all of the complexity of the genome. The term
   "substantially all" in this context refers to the possibility that there can in practice be
   some unwanted loss of genome complexity during the initial steps of the procedure. The
10 methods described herein also are useful in cases where the nucleic acid library is a
   portion of the genome, i.e., where the complexity of the genome is reduced by design. In
   some embodiments, any selected portion of the genome can be used with the methods
   described herein. In certain embodiments, the entire exome or a subset thereof is
   isolated.
15          Methods can further include isolating a nucleic acid sample to provide a library
   (e.g., a nucleic acid library). In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sample includes
   whole genomic, subgenomic fragments, or both. The isolated nucleic acid samples can
   be used to prepare nucleic acid libraries. Thus, in one embodiment, the methods featured
   in the invention further include isolating a nucleic acid sample to provide a library (e.g., a
20 nucleic acid library as described herein). Protocols for isolating and preparing libraries
   from whole genomic or subgenomic fragments are known in the art (e.g., Illumina's
   genomic DNA sample preparation kit). In certain embodiments, the genomic or
   subgenomic DNA fragment is isolated from a subject's sample (e.g., a tumor sample, a
   normal adjacent tissue (NAT), a blood sample or any normal control)). In one
25 embodiment, the sample (e.g., the tumor or NAT sample) is a preserved. For example,
   the sample is embedded in a matrix, e.g., an FFPE block or a frozen sample. In certain
   embodiments, the isolating step includes flow-sorting of individual chromosomes; and/or
   microdissecting a subject's sample (e.g., a tumor sample, a NAT, a blood sample). In
   certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sample used to generate the nucleic acid library is
30 less than 5, less than 1 microgram, less than 500 ng, less than 200 ng, less than 100 ng,
   less than 50 ng or less than 20 ng (e.g., 10 ng or less).

     WO 2013/028817                                                         PCT/US2012/051978
            In still other embodiments, the nucleic acid sample used to generate the library
   includes RNA or cDNA derived from RNA. In some embodiments, the RNA includes
   total cellular RNA. In other embodiments, certain abundant RNA sequences (e.g.,
   ribosomal RNAs) have been depleted. In some embodiments, the poly(A)-tailed mRNA
 5 fraction in the total RNA preparation has been enriched. In some embodiments, the
   cDNA is produced by random-primed cDNA synthesis methods. In other embodiments,
   the cDNA synthesis is initiated at the poly(A) tail of mature mRNAs by priming by
   oligo(dT)-containing oligonucleotides. Methods for depletion, poly(A) enrichment, and
   cDNA synthesis are well known to those skilled in the art.
10          The method can further include amplifying the nucleic acid sample (e.g., DNA or
   RNA sample) by specific or non-specific nucleic acid amplification methods that are well
   known to those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, certain embodiments, the
   nucleic acid sample is amplified, e.g., by whole-genome amplification methods such as
   random-primed strand-displacement amplification.
15          In other embodiments, the nucleic acid sample is fragmented or sheared by
   physical or enzymatic methods and ligated to synthetic adapters, size-selected (e.g., by
   preparative gel electrophoresis) and amplified (e.g., by PCR). In other embodiments, the
   fragmented and adapter-ligated group of nucleic acids is used without explicit size
   selection or amplification prior to hybrid selection.
20          In other embodiments, the isolated DNA (e.g., the genomic DNA) is fragmented
   or sheared. In some embodiments, the library includes less than 50% of genomic DNA,
   such as a subtraction of genomic DNA that is a reduced representation or a defined
   portion of a genome, e.g., that has been subfractionated by other means. In other
   embodiments, the library includes all or substantially all genomic DNA.
25          In some embodiments, the library includes less than 50% of genomic DNA, such
   as a subtraction of genomic DNA that is a reduced representation or a defined portion of
   a genome, e.g., that has been subfractionated by other means. In other embodiments, the
   library includes all or substantially all genomic DNA. Protocols for isolating and
   preparing libraries from whole genomic or subgenomic fragments are known in the art
30 (e.g., Illumina's genomic DNA sample preparation kit). Alternative DNA shearing
   methods can be more automatable and/or more efficient (e.g., with degraded FFPE
                                                 79

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   samples). Alternatives to DNA shearing methods can also be used to avoid a ligation
   step during library preparation.
           The methods described herein can be performed using a small amount of nucleic
   acids, e.g., when the amount of source DNA is limiting (e.g., even after whole-genome
 5 amplification). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises less than about 5 pg, 4
   pg, 3 ag, 2 ag, 1 ag, 0.8 jg, 0.7 jg, 0.6 jg, 0.5 ag, or 400 ng, 300 ng, 200 ng, 100 ng, 50
   ng, or 20 ng or less of nucleic acid sample. For example, to prepare 500 ng of
   hybridization-ready nucleic acids, one typically begins with 3 Pg of genomic DNA. One
   can start with less, however, if one amplifies the genomic DNA (e.g., using PCR) before
10 the step of solution hybridization. Thus it is possible, but not essential, to amplify the
   genomic DNA before solution hybridization.
           In some embodiments, a library is generated using DNA (e.g., genomic DNA)
   from a sample tissue, and a corresponding library is generated with RNA (or cDNA)
   isolated from the same sample tissue.
15
   Design of Baits
           A bait can be a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., a DNA or RNA molecule, which can
   hybridize to (e.g., be complementary to), and thereby allow capture of a target nucleic
   acid. In one embodiment, a bait is an RNA molecule. In other embodiments, a bait
20 includes a binding entity, e.g., an affinity tag, that allows capture and separation, e.g., by
   binding to a binding entity, of a hybrid formed by a bait and a nucleic acid hybridized to
   the bait. In one embodiment, a bait is suitable for solution phase hybridization.
           Baits can be produced and used by methods and hybridization conditions as
   described in US 2010/0029498 and Gnirke, A. et al. (2009) Nat Biotechnol. 27(2):182
25  189, and USSN 61/428,568, filed December 30, 2010, incorporated herein by reference.
   For example, biotinylated RNA baits can be produced by obtaining a pool of synthetic
   long oligonucleotides, originally synthesized on a microarray, and amplifying the
   oligonucleotides to produce the bait sequences. In some embodiments, the baits are
   produced by adding an RNA polymerase promoter sequence at one end of the bait
30 sequences, and synthesizing RNA sequences using RNA polymerase. In one
   embodiment, libraries of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides can be obtained from
                                                  80

      WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   commercial suppliers, such as Agilent Technologies, Inc., and amplified using known
   nucleic acid amplification methods.
            Each bait sequence can include a target-specific (e.g., a member-specific) bait
    sequence and universal tails on each end. As used herein, the term "bait sequence" can
 5 refer to the target-specific bait sequence or the entire oligonucleotide including the
   target-specific "bait sequence" and other nucleotides of the oligonucleotide. In one
   embodiment, a target-specific bait hybridizes to a nucleic acid sequence comprising a
   nucleic acid sequence in intron 15 of KIF5B, in intron 11 of RET, or a fusion junction
   joining exon 15 of KIF5B and exon 12 of RET.
10          In one embodiment, the bait is an oligonucleotide about 200 nucleotides in length,
    of which 170 nucleotides are target-specific "bait sequence". The other 30 nucleotides
    (e.g., 15 nucleotides on each end) are universal arbitrary tails used for PCR amplification.
   The tails can be any sequence selected by the user. For example, the pool of synthetic
    oligonucleotides can include oligonucleotides of the sequence of 5'
15 ATCGCACCAGCGTGTN 170CACTGCGGCTCCTCA-3' with N 17 0 indicating the target
    specific bait sequences.
            The bait sequences described herein can be used for selection of exons and short
   target sequences. In one embodiment, the bait is between about 100 nucleotides and 300
   nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the bait is between about 130 nucleotides
20  and 230 nucleotides in length. In yet another embodiment, the bait is between about 150
   nucleotides and 200 nucleotides in length. The target-specific sequences in the baits, e.g.,
   for selection of exons and short target sequences, are between about 40 nucleotides and
    1000 nucleotides in length. In one embodiment, the target-specific sequence is between
    about 70 nucleotides and 300 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the target
25  specific sequence is between about 100 nucleotides and 200 nucleotides in length. In yet
    another embodiment, the target-specific sequence is between about 120 nucleotides and
    170 nucleotides in length.
   Sequencing
30            The invention also includes methods of sequencing nucleic acids. In one
   embodiment, any of a variety of sequencing reactions known in the art can be used to
   directly sequence at least a portion of a KIF5B-RET fusion. In one embodiment, the
                                                 81

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   KIF5B-RET fusion sequence is compared to a corresponding reference (control)
   sequence.
           In one embodiment, the sequence of the KIF5B-RET fusion nucleic acid molecule
   is determined by a method that includes one or more of: hybridizing an oligonucleotide,
 5 e.g., an allele specific oligonucleotide for one alteration described herein to said nucleic
   acid; hybridizing a primer, or a primer set (e.g., a primer pair), that amplifies a region
   comprising the mutation or a fusion junction of the allele; amplifying, e.g., specifically
   amplifying, a region comprising the mutation or a fusion junction of the allele; attaching
   an adapter oligonucleotide to one end of a nucleic acid that comprises the mutation or a
10 fusion junction of the allele; generating an optical, e.g., a colorimetric signal, specific to
   the presence of the one of the mutation or fusion junction; hybridizing a nucleic acid
   comprising the mutation or fusion junction to a second nucleic acid, e.g., a second nucleic
   acid attached to a substrate; generating a signal, e.g., an electrical or fluorescent signal,
   specific to the presence of the mutation or fusion junction; and incorporating a nucleotide
15 into an oligonucleotide that is hybridized to a nucleic acid that contains the mutation or
   fusion junction.
           In another embodiment, the sequence is determined by a method that comprises
   one or more of: determining the nucleotide sequence from an individual nucleic acid
   molecule, e.g., where a signal corresponding to the sequence is derived from a single
20 molecule as opposed, e.g., from a sum of signals from a plurality of clonally expanded
   molecules; determining the nucleotide sequence of clonally expanded proxies for
   individual nucleic acid molecules; massively parallel short-read sequencing;
   template-based sequencing; pyrosequencing; real-time sequencing comprising imaging
   the continuous incorporation of dye-labeling nucleotides during DNA synthesis;
25 nanopore sequencing; sequencing by hybridization; nano-transistor array based
   sequencing; polony sequencing; scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) based
   sequencing; or nanowire-molecule sensor based sequencing.
             Any method of sequencing known in the art can be used. Exemplary
   sequencing reactions include those based on techniques developed by Maxam and
30 Gilbert (Proc.Natl Acad Sci USA (1977) 74:560) or Sanger (Sanger et al. (1977)
   Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci 74:5463). Any of a variety of automated sequencing procedures
   can be utilized when performing the assays (Biotechniques (1995) 19:448), including
                                                 82

   international patent application Publication Number WO 94/21822 entitled DNA

   Apple Biochem Biotechnol 38:147-159).
10          Sequencing of nucleic acid molecules can also be carried out using next
   generation sequencing (NGS). Next-generation sequencing includes any sequencing
   method that determines the nucleotide sequence of either individual nucleic acid
   molecules or clonally expanded proxies for individual nucleic acid molecules in a highly
   parallel fashion (e.g., greater than 105 molecules are sequenced simultaneously). In one
15 embodiment, the relative abundance of the nucleic acid species in the library can be
   estimated by counting the relative number of occurrences of their cognate sequences in
   the data generated by the sequencing experiment. Next generation sequencing methods
   are known in the art, and are described, e.g., in Metzker, M. (2010) Nature Biotechnology
   Reviews 11:31-46, incorporated herein by reference.
20         In one embodiment, the next-generation sequencing allows for the determination
   of the nucleotide sequence of an individual nucleic acid molecule (e.g., Helicos
   BioSciences' HeliScope Gene Sequencing system, and Pacific Biosciences' PacBio RS
   system). In other embodiments, the sequencing method determines the nucleotide
   sequence of clonally expanded proxies for individual nucleic acid molecules (e.g., the
25 Solexa sequencer, Illumina Inc., San Diego, Calif; 454 Life Sciences (Branford, Conn.),
   and Ion Torrent). e.g., massively parallel short-read sequencing (e.g., the Solexa
   sequencer, Illumina Inc., San Diego, Calif.), which generates more bases of sequence per
   sequencing unit than other sequencing methods that generate fewer but longer reads.
   Other methods or machines for next-generation sequencing include, but are not limited
30 to, the sequencers provided by 454 Life Sciences (Branford, Conn.), Applied Biosystems
   (Foster City, Calif.; SOLiD sequencer), and Helicos BioSciences Corporation
   (Cambridge, Mass.).

           Platforms for next-generation sequencing include, but are not limited to,
   Roche/454's Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX System, Illumina/Solexa's Genome Analyzer
   (GA), Life/APG's Support Oligonucleotide Ligation Detection (SOLiD) system,
   Polonator's G.007 system, Helicos BioSciences' HeliScope Gene Sequencing system,
 5 and Pacific Biosciences' PacBio RS system.
           NGS technologies can include one or more of steps, e.g., template preparation,
   sequencing and imaging, and data analysis.
   Template preparation
10         Methods for template preparation can include steps such as randomly breaking
   nucleic acids (e.g., genomic DNA or cDNA) into smaller sizes and generating sequencing
   templates (e.g., fragment templates or mate-pair templates). The spatially separated
   templates can be attached or immobilized to a solid surface or support, allowing massive
   amounts of sequencing reactions to be performed simultaneously. Types of templates
15 that can be used for NGS reactions include, e.g., clonally amplified templates originating
   from single DNA molecules, and single DNA molecule templates.
           Methods for preparing clonally amplified templates include, e.g., emulsion PCR
   (emPCR) and solid-phase amplification.
           EmPCR can be used to prepare templates for NGS. Typically, a library of nucleic
20 acid fragments is generated, and adapters containing universal priming sites are ligated to
   the ends of the fragment. The fragments are then denatured into single strands and
   captured by beads. Each bead captures a single nucleic acid molecule. After
   amplification and enrichment of emPCR beads, a large amount of templates can be
   attached or immobilized in a polyacrylamide gel on a standard microscope slide (e.g.,
25 Polonator), chemically crosslinked to an amino-coated glass surface (e.g., Life/APG;
   Polonator), or deposited into individual PicoTiterPlate (PTP) wells (e.g., Roche/454), in
   which the NGS reaction can be performed.
           Solid-phase amplification can also be used to produce templates for NGS.
   Typically, forward and reverse primers are covalently attached to a solid support. The
30 surface density of the amplified fragments is defined by the ratio of the primers to the
   templates on the support. Solid-phase amplification can produce hundreds of millions
                                                84

     WO 2013/028817                                                         PCT/US2012/051978
   spatially separated template clusters (e.g., Illumina/Solexa). The ends of the template
   clusters can be hybridized to universal sequencing primers for NGS reactions.
            Other methods for preparing clonally amplified templates also include, e.g.,
   Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) (Lasken R. S. Curr Opin Microbiol. 2007;
 5  10(5):510-6). MDA is a non-PCR based DNA amplification technique. The reaction
   involves annealing random hexamer primers to the template and DNA synthesis by high
   fidelity enzyme, typically D29 at a constant temperature. MDA can generate large sized
   products with lower error frequency.
            Template amplification methods such as PCR can be coupled with NGS platforms
10 to target or enrich specific regions of the genome (e.g., exons). Exemplary template
   enrichment methods include, e.g., microdroplet PCR technology (Tewhey R. et al.,
   Nature Biotech. 2009, 27:1025-103 1), custom-designed oligonucleotide microarrays
   (e.g., Roche/NimbleGen oligonucleotide microarrays), and solution-based hybridization
   methods (e.g., molecular inversion probes (MIPs) (Porreca G. J. et al., Nature Methods,
15 2007, 4:931-936; Krishnakumar S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2008, 105:9296
   93 10; Turner E. H. et al., Nature Methods, 2009, 6:315-316), and biotinylated RNA
   capture sequences (Gnirke A. et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27(2):182-9)
            Single-molecule templates are another type of templates that can be used for NGS
   reaction. Spatially separated single molecule templates can be immobilized on solid
20 supports by various methods. In one approach, individual primer molecules are
   covalently attached to the solid support. Adapters are added to the templates and
   templates are then hybridized to the immobilized primers. In another approach, single
   molecule templates are covalently attached to the solid support by priming and extending
   single-stranded, single-molecule templates from immobilized primers. Universal primers
25 are then hybridized to the templates. In yet another approach, single polymerase
   molecules are attached to the solid support, to which primed templates are bound.
   Sequencing and imaging
            Exemplary sequencing and imaging methods for NGS include, but are not limited
30 to, cyclic reversible termination (CRT), sequencing by ligation (SBL), single-molecule
   addition (pyro sequencing), and real-time sequencing.
                                                  85

     WO 2013/028817                                                         PCT/US2012/051978
           CRT uses reversible terminators in a cyclic method that minimally includes the
   steps of nucleotide incorporation, fluorescence imaging, and cleavage. Typically, a DNA
   polymerase incorporates a single fluorescently modified nucleotide corresponding to the
   complementary nucleotide of the template base to the primer. DNA synthesis is
 5 terminated after the addition of a single nucleotide and the unincorporated nucleotides are
   washed away. Imaging is performed to determine the identity of the incorporated labeled
   nucleotide. Then in the cleavage step, the terminating/inhibiting group and the
   fluorescent dye are removed. Exemplary NGS platforms using the CRT method include,
   but are not limited to, Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer (GA), which uses the clonally
10 amplified template method coupled with the four-color CRT method detected by total
   internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF); and Helicos BioSciences/HeliScope, which uses
   the single-molecule template method coupled with the one-color CRT method detected
   by TIRF.
            SBL uses DNA ligase and either one-base-encoded probes or two-base-encoded
15 probes for sequencing. Typically, a fluorescently labeled probe is hybridized to its
   complementary sequence adjacent to the primed template. DNA ligase is used to ligate
   the dye-labeled probe to the primer. Fluorescence imaging is performed to determine the
   identity of the ligated probe after non-ligated probes are washed away. The fluorescent
   dye can be removed by using cleavable probes to regenerate a 5'-PO4 group for
20 subsequent ligation cycles. Alternatively, a new primer can be hybridized to the template
   after the old primer is removed. Exemplary SBL platforms include, but are not limited
   to, Life/APG/SOLiD (support oligonucleotide ligation detection), which uses two-base
   encoded probes.
           Pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of DNA polymerase
25 with another chemiluminescent enzyme. Typically, the method allows sequencing of a
   single strand of DNA by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at
   a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step. The template DNA is
   immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides are sequentially added and
   removed from the reaction. Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution
30 complements the first unpaired base of the template. The sequence of solutions which
   produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the
   template. Exemplary pyrosequencing platforms include, but are not limited to,
                                                 86

     WO 2013/028817                                                         PCT/US2012/051978
   Roche/454, which uses DNA templates prepared by emPCR with 1-2 million beads
   deposited into PTP wells.
           Real-time sequencing involves imaging the continuous incorporation of dye
   labeled nucleotides during DNA synthesis. Exemplary real-time sequencing platforms
 5 include, but are not limited to, Pacific Biosciences platform, which uses DNA
   polymerase molecules attached to the surface of individual zero-mode waveguide (ZMW)
   detectors to obtain sequence information when phospholinked nucleotides are being
   incorporated into the growing primer strand; Life/VisiGen platform, which uses an
   engineered DNA polymerase with an attached fluorescent dye to generate an enhanced
10 signal after nucleotide incorporation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET);
   and LI-COR Biosciences platform, which uses dye-quencher nucleotides in the
   sequencing reaction.
           Other sequencing methods for NGS include, but are not limited to, nanopore
   sequencing, sequencing by hybridization, nano-transistor array based sequencing, polony
15 sequencing, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) based sequencing, and nanowire
   molecule sensor based sequencing.
           Nanopore sequencing involves electrophoresis of nucleic acid molecules in
   solution through a nano-scale pore which provides a highly confined space within which
   single-nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed. Exemplary methods of nanopore
20 sequencing are described, e.g., in Branton D. et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2008; 26(10):1146
   53.
           Sequencing by hybridization is a non-enzymatic method that uses a DNA
   microarray. Typically, a single pool of DNA is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to
   an array containing known sequences. Hybridization signals from a given spot on the
25 array can identify the DNA sequence. The binding of one strand of DNA to its
   complementary strand in the DNA double-helix is sensitive to even single-base
   mismatches when the hybrid region is short or is specialized mismatch detection proteins
   are present. Exemplary methods of sequencing by hybridization are described, e.g., in
   Hanna G.J. et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38 (7): 2715-21; and Edwards J.R. et al., Mut.
30 Res. 2005; 573 (1-2): 3-12.
           Polony sequencing is based on polony amplification and sequencing-by-synthesis
   via multiple single-base-extensions (FISSEQ). Polony amplification is a method to
                                                 87

   amplify DNA in situ on a polyacrylamide film. Exemplary polony sequencing methods
   are described, e.g., in US Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0087362.
            Nano-transistor array based devices, such as Carbon NanoTube Field Effect
   Transistor (CNTFET), can also be used for NGS. For example, DNA molecules are
 5 stretched and driven over nanotubes by micro-fabricated electrodes. DNA molecules
   sequentially come into contact with the carbon nanotube surface, and the difference in
   current flow from each base is produced due to charge transfer between the DNA
   molecule and the nanotubes. DNA is sequenced by recording these differences.
   Exemplary Nano-transistor array based sequencing methods are described, e.g., in U.S.
10 Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0246497.
            Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can also be used for NGS. STM uses a
   piezo-electric-controlled probe that performs a raster scan of a specimen to form images
   of its surface. STM can be used to image the physical properties of single DNA
   molecules, e.g., generating coherent electron tunneling imaging and spectroscopy by
15 integrating scanning tunneling microscope with an actuator-driven flexible gap.
   Exemplary sequencing methods using STM are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent
   Application Publication No. 2007/0194225.
            A molecular-analysis device which is comprised of a nanowire-molecule sensor
   can also be used for NGS. Such device can detect the interactions of the nitrogenous
20 material disposed on the nanowires and nucleic acid molecules such as DNA. A
   molecule guide is configured for guiding a molecule near the molecule sensor, allowing
   an interaction and subsequent detection. Exemplary sequencing methods using
   nanowire-molecule sensor are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Application Publication
   No. 2006/0275779.
25          Double ended sequencing methods can be used for NGS. Double ended
   sequencing uses blocked and unblocked primers to sequence both the sense and antisense
   strands of DNA. Typically, these methods include the steps of annealing an unblocked
   primer to a first strand of nucleic acid; annealing a second blocked primer to a second
   strand of nucleic acid; elongating the nucleic acid along the first strand with a
30 polymerase; terminating the first sequencing primer; deblocking the second primer; and
   elongating the nucleic acid along the second strand. Exemplary double ended sequencing
   methods are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Serial No. 7,244,567.

   Data analysis
          After NGS reads have been generated, they can be aligned to a known reference
   sequence or assembled de novo.
 5         For example, identifying genetic variations such as single-nucleotide
   polymorphism and structural variants in a sample (e.g., a tumor sample) can be
   accomplished by aligning NGS reads to a reference sequence (e.g., a wild-type
   sequence). Methods of sequence alignment for NGS are described e.g., in Trapnell C.
   and Salzberg S.L. Nature Biotech., 2009, 27:455-457.
10         Examples of de novo assemblies are described, e.g., in Warren R. et al.,
   Bioinformatics, 2007, 23:500-501; Butler J. et al., Genome Res., 2008, 18:810-820; and
   Zerbino D.R. and Birney E., Genome Res., 2008, 18:821-829.
            Sequence alignment or assembly can be performed using read data from one or
   more NGS platforms, e.g., mixing Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa read data.

   KIF5B-RET Fusion Expression Level
           In certain embodiments, KIF5B-RET fusion expression level can also be
20 assayed. KIF5B-RET fusion expression can be assessed by any of a wide variety of
   methods for detecting expression of a transcribed molecule or protein. Non-limiting
   examples of such methods include immunological methods for detection of secreted,
   cell-surface, cytoplasmic, or nuclear proteins, protein purification methods, protein
   function or activity assays, nucleic acid hybridization methods, nucleic acid reverse
25 transcription methods, and nucleic acid amplification methods.
           In certain embodiments, activity of a particular gene is characterized by a
   measure of gene transcript (e.g., mRNA), by a measure of the quantity of translated
   protein, or by a measure of gene product activity. KIF5B-RET fusion expression can
   be monitored in a variety of ways, including by detecting mRNA levels, protein
30 levels, or protein activity, any of which can be measured using standard techniques.
   Detection can involve quantification of the level of gene expression (e.g., genomic
   DNA, cDNA, mRNA, protein, or enzyme activity), or, alternatively, can be a
                                                 89

     WO 2013/028817                                                          PCT/US2012/051978
   qualitative assessment of the level of gene expression, in particular in comparison
   with a control level. The type of level being detected will be clear from the context.
           Methods of detecting and/or quantifying the KIF5B-RET gene transcript
   (mRNA or cDNA made therefrom) using nucleic acid hybridization techniques are
 5 known to those of skill in the art (see Sambrook et al. supra). For example, one
   method for evaluating the presence, absence, or quantity of cDNA involves a
   Southern transfer as described above. Briefly, the mRNA is isolated (e.g., using an
   acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction method, Sambrook et al. supra.) and
   reverse transcribed to produce cDNA. The cDNA is then optionally digested and run
10 on a gel in buffer and transferred to membranes. Hybridization is then carried out
   using the nucleic acid probes specific for the KIF5B-RET fusion cDNA, e.g., using
   the probes and primers described herein.
           In other embodiments, KIF5B-RET expression is assessed by preparing
   genomic DNA or mRNA/cDNA (i.e., a transcribed polynucleotide) from cells in a
15 subject sample, and by hybridizing the genomic DNA or mRNA/cDNA with a
   reference polynucleotide which is a complement of a polynucleotide comprising the
   KIF5B-RET fusion, and fragments thereof. cDNA can, optionally, be amplified using
   any of a variety of polymerase chain reaction methods prior to hybridization with the
   reference polynucleotide. Expression of KIF5B-RET fusion can likewise be detected
20 using quantitative PCR (QPCR) to assess the level of KIF5B-RET expression.
   Detection of KIF5B-RET Fusion Polypeptide
           The activity or level of a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide can also be detected
   and/or quantified by detecting or quantifying the expressed polypeptide. The KIF5B
25 RET fusion polypeptide can be detected and quantified by any of a number of means
   known to those of skill in the art. These can include analytic biochemical methods
   such as electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), hyperdiffusion
   chromatography, and the like, or various immunological methods such as fluid or gel
30 precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion (single or double), immunoelectrophoresis,
   radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs),
   immunofluorescent assays, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the
                                                90

     WO 2013/028817                                                             PCT/US2012/051978
   like. A skilled artisan can adapt known protein/antibody detection methods.
            Another agent for detecting a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide is an antibody
   molecule capable of binding to a polypeptide corresponding to a marker of the
   invention, e.g., an antibody with a detectable label. Techniques for generating
 5 antibodies are described herein. The term "labeled", with regard to the probe or
   antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by
   coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as
   well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent
   that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary
10 antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA
   probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin.
            In another embodiment, the antibody is labeled, e.g., a radio-labeled,
   chromophore-labeled, fluorophore-labeled, or enzyme-labeled antibody. In another
   embodiment, an antibody derivative (e.g., an antibody conjugated with a substrate or
15 with the protein or ligand of a protein-ligand pair { e.g., biotin-streptavidinI ), or an
   antibody fragment (e.g., a single-chain antibody, an isolated antibody hypervariable
   domain, etc.) which binds specifically with a KIF5B-RET fusion protein, is used.
            KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptides from cells can be isolated using techniques
   that are known to those of skill in the art. The protein isolation methods employed
20 can, for example, be such as those described in Harlow and Lane (Harlow and Lane,
    1988, Antibodies: A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold
   Spring Harbor, New York).
            Means of detecting proteins using electrophoretic techniques are well known
   to those of skill in the art (see generally, R. Scopes (1982) ProteinPurification,
25 Springer-Verlag, N.Y.; Deutscher, (1990) Methods in Enzymology Vol. 182: Guide to
   ProteinPurification,Academic Press, Inc., N.Y.).
            In another embodiment, Western blot (immunoblot) analysis is used to detect and
   quantify the presence of a polypeptide in the sample.
            In another embodiment, the polypeptide is detected using an immunoassay. As
30 used herein, an immunoassay is an assay that utilizes an antibody to specifically bind to
   the analyte. The immunoassay is thus characterized by detection of specific binding of a
   polypeptide to an anti-antibody as opposed to the use of other physical or chemical
                                                   91

   properties to isolate, target, and quantify the analyte.
           The KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide is detected and/or quantified using any of a
   number of immunological binding assays (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,366,241;
   4,376,110; 4,517,288; and 4,837,168). For a review of the general immunoassays, see

   Kits
10         In one aspect, the invention features, a kit, e.g., containing an oligonucleotide
   having a mutation described herein, e.g., a KIT5B-RET fusion. Optionally, the kit can
   also contain an oligonucleotide that is the wildtype counterpart of the mutant
   oligonucleotide.
           A kit featured in the invention can include a carrier, e.g., a means being
15 compartmentalized to receive in close confinement one or more container means. In one
   embodiment the container contains an oligonucleotide, e.g., a primer or probe as
   described above. The components of the kit are useful, for example, to diagnose identify
   a mutation in a tumor sample in a patient, and to accordingly identify an appropriate
   therapeutic agent to treat the cancer. The probe or primer of the kit can be used in any
20 sequencing or nucleotide detection assay known in the art, e.g., a sequencing assay, e.g.,
   an NGS method, RT-PCR, or in situ hybridization.
           A kit featured in the invention can include, e.g., assay positive and negative
   controls, nucleotides, enzymes (e.g., RNA or DNA polymerase or ligase), solvents or
   buffers, a stabilizer, a preservative, a secondary antibody, e.g., an anti-HRP antibody
25 (IgG) and a detection reagent.
           An oligonucleotide can be provided in any form, e.g., liquid, dried, semi-dried, or
   lyophilized, or in a form for storage in a frozen condition.
           Typically, an oligonucleotide, and other components in a kit are provided in a
   form that is sterile. When an oligonucleotide, e.g., an oligonucleotide that contains a
30 RET mutation, e.g., a KIF5B-RET fusion, described herein, or an oligonucleotide
   complementary to a mutation RET mutataion described herein, is provided in a liquid
   solution, the liquid solution generally is an aqueous solution, e.g., a sterile aqueous
                                                  92

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   solution. When the oligonucleotide is provided as a dried form, reconstitution generally
   is accomplished by the addition of a suitable solvent. The solvent, e.g., sterile buffer, can
   optionally be provided in the kit.
            The kit can include one or more containers for the composition containing an
 5 oligonucleotide in a concentration suitable for use in the assay or with instructions for
   dilution for use in the assay. In some embodiments, the kit contains separate containers,
   dividers or compartments for the oligonucleotide and assay components, and the
   informational material. For example, the oligonucleotides can be contained in a bottle or
   vial, and the informational material can be contained in a plastic sleeve or packet. In
10 other embodiments, the separate elements of the kit are contained within a single,
   undivided container. For example, an oligonucleotide composition is contained in a
   bottle or vial that has attached thereto the informational material in the form of a label. In
   some embodiments, the kit includes a plurality (e.g., a pack) of individual containers,
   each containing one or more unit forms (e.g., for use with one assay) of an
15 oligonucleotide. For example, the kit includes a plurality of ampoules, foil packets, or
   blister packs, each containing a single unit of oligonucleotide for use in a sequencing or
   detecting a mutation in a tumor sample. The containers of the kits can be air tight and/or
   waterproof. The container can be labeled for use.
           For antibody-based kits, the kit can include: (1) a first antibody (e.g., attached to a
20 solid support) which binds to a KIF5B-RET fusion polypeptide; and, optionally, (2) a second,
   different antibody which binds to either the polypeptide or the first antibody and is
   conjugated to a detectable agent.
            In one embodiment, the kit can include informational material for performing and
   interpreting the sequencing or diagnostic. In another embodiment, the kit can provide
25 guidance as to where to report the results of the assay, e.g., to a treatment center or
   healthcare provider. The kit can include forms for reporting the results of a sequencing
   or diagnostic assay described herein, and address and contact information regarding
   where to send such forms or other related information; or a URL (Uniform Resource
   Locator) address for reporting the results in an online database or an online application
30 (e.g., an app). In another embodiment, the informational material can include guidance
   regarding whether a patient should receive treatment with a particular chemotherapeutic
   drug, depending on the results of the assay.

            The informational material of the kits is not limited in its form. In many cases,
   the informational material, e.g., instructions, is provided in printed matter, e.g., a printed
   text, drawings, and/or photographs, e.g., a label or printed sheet. However, the
   informational material can also be provided in other formats, such as computer readable
 5 material, video recording, or audio recording. In another embodiment, the informational
   material of the kit is contact information, e.g., a physical address, email address, website,
   or telephone number, where a user of the kit can obtain substantive information about the
   sequencing or diagnostic assay and/or its use in the methods described herein. The
   informational material can also be provided in any combination of formats.
10          In some embodiments, a biological sample is provided to an assay provider, e.g., a
   service provider (such as a third party facility) or a healthcare provider, who evaluates the
   sample in an assay and provides a read out. For example, in one embodiment, an assay
   provider receives a biological sample from a subject, such as a blood or tissue sample,
   e.g., a biopsy sample, and evaluates the sample using an assay described herein, e.g., a
15 sequencing assay or in situ hybridization assay, and determines that the sample contains a
   nucleic acid containing a mutation described in the Example. The assay provider, e.g., a
   service provider or healthcare provider, can then conclude that the subject is, or is not, a
   candidate for a particular drug or a particular cancer treatment regimen.
            The assay provider can provide the results of the evaluation, and optionally,
20 conclusions regarding one or more of diagnosis, prognosis, or appropriate therapy options
   to, for example, a healthcare provider, or patient, or an insurance company, in any
   suitable format, such as by mail or electronically, or through an online database. The
   information collected and provided by the assay provider can be stored in a database.
            The invention is further illustrated by the following example, which should not be
25 construed as further limiting.

   Introduction
           A pan-cancer diagnostic assay based on massively parallel sequencing
   technology was developed to interrogate 2574 coding exons representing 145 cancer
 5 relevant genes (associated with cancer-related pathways, targeted-therapy or
   prognosis), plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer, using
   minimal DNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens. This
   assay can identify all classes of DNA alterations (e.g., base substitutions, insertions
   and deletions, copy number alterations and rearrangements) in a single diagnostic test.
10 In a cohort of 40 colorectal cancer (CRC) and 24 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
   specimens, 175 alterations were identified in 33 cancer genes. 38 samples (59%)
   harbored at least one alteration that could be linked to a clinical treatment option or
   clinical trial of novel targeted therapies, including a novel KIF5B-RET gene fusion in
   NSCLC (the KIF5B-RET gene fusions is described in Example 2 herein).
15
   Results
           An evaluation of assays using genomic DNA derived from 40 CRC and 24
   NSCLC FFPE tissue samples was performed (Supplementary Table 1). In total, 2574
   coding exons representing 145 cancer genes, plus 37 introns from 15 frequently
20 rearranged cancer genes (Supplementary Table 2) were selected using solution phase
   hybrid capture and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform(Illumina, Inc., San
   Diego, CA) to an average coverage of 253X. 175 alterations in 33 cancer genes were
   identified of which 116 were single base substitutions (75 non synonymous, 41
   nonsense), 46 were small insertions or deletions (indels) (44 frameshift, 2 in-frame),
25  10 were copy number alterations (9 amplifications, 1 homozygous deletion) and 3
   were rearrangements (Figure 5, Supplementary Table 2).
           The percentage distribution of DNA alterations in 40 CRCs is roughly as
   follows: about 58% are base substitutions, 28% are insertions and deletions, 12% are
   copy number alterations, about 1% are gene fusions.
30         The percentage distribution of DNA alterations in 24 NSCLCs is roughly as
   follows: about 72% are base substitutions, 14% are insertions and deletions, 12% are
   copy number alterations, about 2% are gene fusions.

   Mutations identified in CRC cases
            Among 40 CRCs, 125 alterations were identified in 21 genes. 39 tumors
   carried at least one mutation (range 1-9) and 25 tumors (62.5%) contained at least two
 5 different classes of DNA alteration (Figure 5). TP53 and APC were the most
   frequently altered genes (32/40 (80%) and 27/40 (67.5%), respectively), with both
   mutated at higher frequencies than reported in COSMIC (on the worldwide web at
   sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). 41/42 (98%) of the APC mutations in the cohort
   were truncating (21 nonsense, 17 frameshift indel), an observation unique to CRC
10 tumors which indicates the specificity of the assay. 15 samples had bi-allelic
   inactivation and 12 a single truncating APC mutation and LOH.
            In addition, 11 known cancer genes were mutated, amplified or rearranged in
   multiple CRC cases: KRAS (10), BRAF (6), FBXW7 (5), ATM (2), BCL2L] (2),
   BRCA2 (2), CDH] (2), ERBB3 (2), GNAS (2), PIK3CA (2) and SMAD4 (2), ALK,
15 CDK8, LRP]B, MYC, MSH6, RICTOR, SMAD2 and STK]] were each altered in a
   single case (Figure 5, Supplementary Table 1). Notably, 21 CRCs (52.5%) harbored
   at least one alteration that could be linked to a clinical treatment option or clinical trial
   of novel targeted therapies. Examples include mutations in KRAS and
   BRAF(resistance to cetuximab (Lievre et al., CancerRes 66:3992-3995, 2006; Di
20 Nicolantonio et al., J Clin Oncol. 26:5705-5712, 2008) or panitumumab (Di
   Nicolantonio et al., supra; Lievre et al., Bull Cancer 95:133-140, 2008), FBXW7

   (Supplementary Table 3).
            Mutations identified in NSCLC cases
            Among 24 NSCLCs, 50 mutations were identified in 21 genes. 20 of 24
30 tumors harbored at least one mutation (range 1-7) (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5,
   Supplementary Table 2). Twelve genes were altered in multiple tumors: KRAS (10),
   TP53 (7), STK11 (4), LRP1B (3), JAK2 (3), EGFR (2), BRAF (2), CDKN2A (2),
                                                  96

     WO 2013/028817                                                            PCT/US2012/051978
   CTNNB1 (2), MDM2 (2), PIK3CA (2) and ATM (2). APC, CCNE1, CDK4, MLH1,
   MSH6, NF1, RB1, RET and TSC1 were each mutated in a single case. In addition,
   3 patients had a truncating mutation in the putative tumor suppressor gene LRP1B
   (Liu et al., Genomics 69:271-274, 2000), further supporting the role of inactivation of
 5 this gene in oncogenesis. In 72% (36/50) of NSCLCs at least one alteration was
   associated with a current clinical treatment or targeted therapy trial, including
   mutations in KRAS (resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors (Pao et al., PLoS Med 2:e17,
   2005); clinical trials of P13K and MEK inhibitors) and BRAF (clinical trials of BRAF
   inhibitors including vemurafenibref and GSK 2118436 ref), EGFR (sensitivity to
10 gefitinib or erlotinib ref), MDM2 (clinical trials of nutlins (Vassilev et al., Science
   303:844-848, 2004), CDKN2A, CCNE1 and CDK4 (clinical trials of CDK4 inhibitors
   (Finn et al., Breast CancerRes. 11 :R77, 2009; Toogood et al., J Med Chem
   48:2388-2406, 2005; Konecny et al., Clin CancerRes 17:1591-1602, 2011), and
   PIK3CA (clinical trials of P13 kinase/mTOR inhibitors ref) (Supplementary Table 4).
15 Although the test detects the EML4-ALK inversions in cell lines, EML4-ALK was not
   identified in this patient cohort (Soda et al., Nature 448:561-566, 2007).
            Surprisingly, three patients were found to have a c.1849G>Tp.V617F mutation
   in JAK, which is commonly observed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but has not
   been identified in solid tumors (James et al., Nature 434:1144-1148, 2005) (see online
20 at sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/), although one patient had a history of
   polycythemia vera with a bone marrow positive for the JAK2 mutation. Sequencing a
   larger series of NSCLC specimens can be conducted to further characterize JAK2
   mutations in NSCLC, and further studies can be conducted to assess whether these
   predict clinical sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors.

           Example 2A: Novel KIF5B-RET fusions
           A novel inversion event was identified in a lung adenocarcinoma using NGS
   (Next Generation) sequencing. The adenocarcinoma was from a 44-year old, male
   Caucasian never-smoker. A genomic sequence suggestive of a novel
30 chromosome 10 rearrangement, specifically an 11MB pericentric inversion with
   breakpoints in intron 15 of KIF5B and intron 11 of RET, was observed. The breakpoints
   were determined to be at ChrlO:32,316,376-32,316,416 within intron 15 of KIF5B and
                                                  97

     WO 2013/028817                                                         PCT/US2012/051978
   Chr 10:43,611,042-43,611,118 within intron 11 of RET (see FIG. 1). More specifically,
   an 11,294,741 bp pericentric inversion generates the RET gene fusion joining exons 1-15
   of KIF5B to exon 12-20 of RET. Figure 6A provides a schematic representation of the
    11,294,741 bp inversion in NSCLC that generates an in-frame KIF5B-RET gene fusion
 5 (not to scale). The inverted region of chromosome 10 starts at 32,316,377 bps (within
   KIF5B intron 15) and ends at 43,611,118 bps (within RET intron 11). Figure 6D is a
   summary of the exons present or absent in the KIF5B-RET fusion.
           The inversion results in an in-frame fusion of the 5'end of KIF5B and the 3'end
   of RET, which fusion is expressed to generate a fusion protein that includes a tyrosine
10 kinase domain in the RET protein. More specifically, the protein fusion results in an in
   frame fusion of exon 15 of KIF5B with exon 12 of RET. See FIGs. 2B and 3A-3D. In
   FIGs. 3A-3D, SEQ ID NO:1 is the cDNA sequence of the KIF5B-RET fusion (i.e., 5'
   KIF5B-3'-RET fusion) and SEQ ID NO:2 is the amino acid sequence of the KIF5B-RET
   fusion protein. The underlined sequence in FIGs 3A-3D represents KIF5B cDNA
15 sequence (nucleotides 471-2195 of RefSeq No. NM_004521.2 (GenBank Record
   August 14, 2011)) and KIF5B protein sequence (amino acids 1-575 of RefSeq
   No. NP_004512 (GenBank Record August 14, 2011)). The sequence not underlined in
   FIGs. 3A-3D represents RET cDNA sequence (nucleotides 2327-3535 of RefSeq
   No. NM_020975 (GenBank Record August 14, 2011) and RET protein sequence (amino
20 acids 713-1114 of RefSeq No. NP_066124.1 (GenBank Record August 14, 2011)). The
   RET protein sequence in the KIF5B-RET fusion maintains the intact tyrosine kinase
   domain of RET, and this domain is indicated by a gray box in FIG. 3C. The KIF5B
   protein sequence in the fusion maintains the intact kinesin motor domain, and this domain
   is indicated by a double-underlining in FIGs. 3A-3B. KIF5B exons 1 to 15 also contain
25 the coiled-coil domain that mediates homodimerization. At least because the
   KIF5B-RET fusion is an in-frame fusion that maintains the intact tyrosine kinase domain
   of RET, and the kinesin motor domain and coiled-coil domain of KIF5B, this fusion
   protein is likely to contribute to the oncogenic phenotype of the lung tumor sample.
           Figure 7A provides another schematic representation of the KIF5B-RET
30 fusion. This variant was identified in 10 CRC cases, where KIF5B exon 15 is fused
   in-frame to RET exon 12. The predicted full length fusion protein is 977 amino acids
   in length, with amino acids 1-575 derived from KIF5B and amino acids 576-977
                                                 98

      WO 2013/028817                                                       PCT/US2012/051978
   derived from RET (shown above). Capillary sequence confirmation of the exon
   junction boundaries derived from cDNA is shown below. Figure 7B is another
   representation of the predicted KIF5B-RET variant amino acid sequence. Amino
    acids derived from KIF5B (normal text). Amino acids derived from RET (italics,
 5 underlined).
           KIF5B exons 1-15 comprise a kinesin motor domain and a coiled-coil domain
   that directly mediates homodimerization. KIF5B exon 15 is a known fusion point in
   NSCLC patients with KIF5B-ALK fusions (Wong et al., Cancer,2011; Takeuchi et
   al., Clin CancerRes 15:3143-3149, 2009).
10         Figure 6B is a schematic of the protein domain structure of the RET-KIF5B
   and KIF5B-RET gene fusions. The cadherin domain of RET is included in the
   predictedRET-KIF5B protein. The kinesin and coiled coil domains of KIF5B and the
   tyrosine kinase domain of RET are included in the KIF5B-RET fusion protein.
   RT-PCR of primer designed to RET exon 11 and KIF5B exon 16 yielded no product.
15 RT-PCR of primer designed to KIF5B exon 15 and RET exon 12 yielded a strong
   product. Using cDNA sequencing, a 7.3 fold RET expression increase beginning at
   exon 12 relative to exons I to 11, suggesting the KIF5B-RET fusion transcript results
   in RET kinase domain overexpression. In addition, cDNA sequencing revealed that
   490 unique read pairs spanned the fusion junction.
20         IHC demonstrated focal moderate cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for RET protein
   expression (Figure 6C). Figure 6C is a photograph depicting the distribution of RET
   expression in the case of NSCLC with confirmed RET fusion on DNA sequencing by
   NGS. Note focal moderate cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for RET protein expression
    (avidin-biotin perxodase X 200). High magnification detail of cytoplasmic
25 immunostaining for RET is shown in the insert at the lower right.
           Previous RET fusion proteins have been identified in cancers other than lung
   cancer. For example, the RET oncogene has been shown to be activated through
    somatic rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinomas. RET exons 12-20 comprise
   the RET tyrosine kinase domain which commonly forms the 3' portion of the
30 PTC/RET fusions observed in -35% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. KIF5B-ALK
   fusions have been previously identified in ALK-positive lung cancer. To our
                                                99

     WO 2013/028817                                                         PCT/US2012/051978
   knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a RET fusion cDNA in a lung cancer,
   and also the first demonstration of a KIF5B-RET fusion.
            Thyroid cancer and cell lines harboring oncogenic PTC/RET translocations,
   which overexpress the RET kinase domain, are sensitive to RET inhibitor sorafenib
 5 suggesting that this KIF5B-RET gene fusion may identify a new druggable subset of
   NSCLC tumors (Henderson et al., Clin CancerRes 14:4908-4914, 2008; Carlomagno
   et al., JNatl CancerInst 98:326-334, 2006). Other RET activating mutations have
   been shown to be sensitive to treatment with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (e.g.,
   Plaza-Menacho et al., Jour.Biol. Chem. 282:29230-29240, 2007). It is, therefore,
10 expected that cancers carrying a KIF5B-RET fusion as described herein is likely to be
   susceptible to treatment with multikinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib and sunitinib.
            Together these results suggest druggable gene fusions can occur broadly in cancer
   at low frequency and are more effectively identified with a sequencing-based diagnostic
   such as the one described herein.
15
   RET fusion recurrence
            To determine whether the RET fusion is recurrently expressed in NSCLC, a
   series of 117 NSCLCs (92 Caucasian, 5 African-American, 20 ethnicity unknown)
   were screened for RET by IHC; 22/117 cases showed moderate to intense staining.
20 RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing of RNA from 15 IHC-positive tumors identified one
   additional KIF5B-RET fusion in a male Caucasian smoking patient (Table 2).
   Example 2B: Additional KIF5B-RET fusions
            The chromosome 10 inversion that creates the KIF5B-RET fusion, can also create
25 a reciprocal RET-KIF5B fusion (i.e., 5'-RET-3'-KIF5B fusion). See FIGs. 2A
   and 4A-4D. The predicted RET-KIF5B protein fusion results in a fusion of exon 11 of
   RET with exon 16 of KIF5B. See FIGs. 2A and 4A-4D. In FIGs. 4A-4D, SEQ ID NO:3
   is the cDNA sequence of the RET-KIF5B fusion and SEQ ID NO:4 is the amino acid
   sequence of the predicted RET-KIF5B fusion protein. The underlined sequence in
30 FIGs. 4A-4D represents KIF5B cDNA sequence (nucleotides 2196-3362 of RefSeq No.
   NM_004521.2 (GenBank Record August 14, 2011)) and KIF5B protein sequence (amino
   acids 576-963 of RefSeq No. NP004512 (GenBank Record August 14, 2011)). The
                                                100

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   sequence not underlined in FIGs. 4A-4D represents RET cDNA sequence (nucleotides
    190-2326 of RefSeq No. NM_020975 (GenBank Record August 14, 2011) and RET
   protein sequence (amino acids 1-712 of RefSeq No. NP_066124.1 (GenBank Record
   August 14, 2011)). The predicted RET protein sequence in the RET-KIF5B fusion does
 5 not include the tyrosine kinase domain. RT-PCR studies designed to RET exon 11 and
   KIF5B exon 16 yielded no product. Thus, this orientation of the fusion is not expressed.
           Further screening of tumor samples has identified additional KIF5B-RET gene
   fusions that contain a RET catalytic domain.
10
           Thyroid cancers and cell lines harboring PTC-RET translocations are sensitive
   to sorafenib which inhibits RET, suggesting the KIF5B-RET gene fusion in NSCLC
   may be druggable. KIF5B-RET expression in Ba/F3 cells led to oncogenic
   transformation as determined by IL-3 independent growth. These cells were sensitive
15 to sunitinib, sorafenib and vandetinib, multi-targeted kinase inhibitors that inhibit
   RET, but not gefitinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor (FIG. 8). Sunitinib, but not gefitinib,
   inhibited RET phosphorylation in KIF5B-RET Ba/F3 cells (FIG. 9). These findings
   suggest RET kinase inhibitors should be tested in prospective clinical trials for
   therapeutic benefit in NSCLC patients bearing KIF5B-RET rearrangements.
20
   Discussion
           In the current study, a comprehensive genomic profiling assay that robustly
   identifies base substitutions, insertions, deletions, copy number alterations and
   genomic rearrangements from FFPE tumor tissue is described. Results show that
25 genomic alterations with direct clinical therapeutic relevance are detected in a large
   fraction of CRCs and NSCLCs demonstrating the value of systematically testing for
   such alterations in cancer patients. Due to the wide range of targeted therapies
   already approved or under clinical development, performing simultaneous,
   comprehensive querying for a wide breadth of genomic alterations will speed
30 identification of appropriate patient subsets for these therapeutic approaches.
           The method additionally identified two previously unknown genomic
   rearrangements, each of which could potentially lead to a therapeutic intervention.
                                                 101

     WO 2013/028817                                                           PCT/US2012/051978
   The first is an ALK rearrangement similar to those previously detected in anaplastic
   lymphoma (Morris et al., Science 263:1281-1284, 1994), NSCLC (Soda et al., Nature
   448:561-566, 2007, supra) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (Lawrence et al.,
   Am JPathol 157: 377-384, 2000) that are associated with clinical sensitivity to the
 5 ALK kinase inhibitor crizotinib (Kwak et al., N Engl JMed 363:1693-1703, 2010;
   Butrynski et al., NEngl JMed 363:1727-1733, 2010). The current findings suggest
   that other cancers, including CRC, can contain additional previously undetected ALK
   rearrangements that could be drug sensitive.
            More importantly, applying comprehensive genomic profiling to tumor
10 specimens identified recurrent novel KIF5B-RET inversions in NSCLC patients. This
   fusion gene contains the entire kinase domain of RET and results in increased RET
   kinase domain expression. Oncogenic PTC/RET translocations detected in thyroid
   cancer and cell lines are sensitive in vitro and in vivo to RET inhibitors (Henderson et
   al., Clin CancerRes 14:4908-4914, 2008; Carlomagno et al., J Natl CancerInst
15 98:326-334, 2006; Kim et al., J Clin EndocrinolMetab 91:4070-4076, 2006; Dawson
   et al., Anticancer Drugs 19:547-552, 2008). It is possible that sunitinib or other RET
   tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including vandetinib or sorafenib (Henderson et al., supra),
   can be clinically effective in KIF5B-RET NSCLC. Identification of even a small
   subpopulation of NSCLC patients responsive to a molecular targeted therapy can have
20 large clinical impact as highlighted by the recent FDA approval of crizotinib for ALK
   rearranged NSCLC. It is clear is that harnessing the power of massively parallel
   sequencing to generate comprehensive genomic profiles for patient tumors will be
   increasingly clinically informative and eventually critical to effective therapeutic
   management in the oncology clinic.

   Example 3: Methods
            The following exemplifies certain embodiments of the methods and
   experimental conditions used to identify the KIF5B-RET fusion according to
   Examples 1-2. Additional RET translocation screening can be done using, e.g., either
30 qRT-PCR analysis of cDNA prepared from a pre-selected tumor sample.
            Massively parallel DNA sequencing was done on hybridization captured,
   adaptor ligation-based libraries using DNA isolated from archived fixed paraffin
                                                 102

     WO 2013/028817                                                         PCT/US2012/051978
   embedded tissue. A combination of analysis tools were used to analyze the data and
   assign DNA alteration calls. Additional RET translocation screening was done using
   either qRT-PCR analysis of cDNA prepared from frozen tumors or RET IHC
   assessment of archived FFPE specimens. Massively parallel cDNA sequencing was
 5 performed to confirm expression of both novel translocations using RNA isolated
   from FFPE tissue. Matched normal reference genomic DNA from blood was
   sequenced for the index KIF5B-RET NSCLC patient to confirm the somatic origin of
   the rearrangement.
10 Genomic DNA sequencing
           Sequencing of 2574 exons of 145 cancer genes was performed using DNA
   from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens; 24 from
   NSCLC patients and 40 from colorectal (CRC) pateints. Sequencing libraries of the
   606,675 bp content were constructed by the adapter ligation method using genomic
15 DNA followed by solution phase hybridization selection with optimized RNA
   hybridization capture probes (Agilent SureSelect custom kit). Sequencing on the
   HiSeq2000 instrument (Illumina) was performed using 36 x 36 paired reads to an
   average coverage of 229X with 84% exons at > 1OOX (Supplementary Tables 2A and
   2B). Data processing and mutation assignments for base substitutions, indels, copy
20 number alterations and genomic rearrangements was performed using a combination
   of tools optimized for mutation calling from tumor tissue. To maximize mutation
   detection sensitivity in heterogeneous cancer biopsies, the test was validated to detect
   base substitutions at > 10% mutant allele frequency with > 99% sensitivity and indels
   at > 20% mutant allele frequency with > 95% sensitivity, with a false discovery rate
25 of < 1%.
   cDNA sequencing
           cDNA was generated from total RNA extracted from a single 5-10 um FFPE
   tissue section using the Roche High Pure kit and reverse transcribed to cDNA with
30 random hexamer primers by the SuperScript@ III First-Strand Synthesis System
   (Invitrogen). Double stranded cDNA was made with the NEBNext@ mRNA Second
   Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs) and used as input to library
                                               103

     WO 2013/028817                                                      PCT/US2012/051978
   construction, hybrid capture and sequencing as for FFPE DNA samples. Analysis of
   expression levels was done with a combination of analysis tools.
   RET protein immunohistochemistrv
 5         NSCLC were immunostained after microwave-based epitope retrieval by
   automated methods (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) for RET expression
   using the mouse monoclonal RET Oncoprotein clone 3F8 (Vector Laboratories,
   Burlingame, CA). Slides were scored semi-quantitatively for tumor cell staining
   intensity and distribution using the H Score system.
