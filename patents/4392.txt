   TECHNICAL FIELD
           The invention described herein pertains to the diagnosis, imaging, and/or
   treatment of pathogenic cell populations. In particular, the invention described herein
   pertains to the diagnosis, imaging, and/or treatment of diseases caused by PSMA
15 expressing cells, such as prostate cancer cells, using compounds capable of
   targeting PSMA expressing cells.
   BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           The prostate is a male reproductive organ and functions to produce and store
   seminal fluid that provides nutrients and fluids for the survival of sperm introduced
20 into the vagina during reproduction. Like other tissues, the prostate gland may
   develop either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) tumors. In fact,
   prostate cancer is one of the most common male cancers in western societies, and is
   the second leading form of malignancy among American men. Current treatment
   methods for prostate cancer include hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, surgery,
25 chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and combination therapy. However, many of
   these treatments affect the quality of life of the patient, especially for those men who
   are diagnosed with prostate cancer over age 50. For example, the use of hormonal
   drugs is often accompanied by side effects such as osteoporosis and liver damage.
   Such side effects might be mitigated by the use of treatments that are more selective
                                               - 1-

  or specific to the tissue being responsible for the disease state, and avoid non-target
  tissues like the bones or the liver.
          Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a biomarker that is
  overexpressed on prostate cancer. PSMA is over-expressed in the malignant
5 prostate tissues when compared to other organs in the human body such as kidney,
  proximal small intestine, and salivary glands. PSMA is also expressed on the
  neovasculature within many non-prostate solid tumors, including lung, colon, breast,
  renal, liver and pancreatic carcinomas, but not on normal vasculature. PSMA is also
  expressed minimally in brain. PSMA is a type II cell
                                            - 1a -

    surface membrane-bound glycoprotein with ~110 kD molecular weight, including an
    intracellular segment (amino acids 1-18), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 19-43), and an
    extensive extracellular domain (amino acids 44-750). While the functions of the intracellular
    segment and the transmembrane domains are currently believed to be insignificant, the
  5 extracellular domain is involved in several distinct activities. For example, PSMA plays a role
    in the central nervous system, where it metabolizes N-acetyl-aspartyl glutamate (NAAG) into
    glutamic and N-acetyl aspartic acid. PSMA also plays a role in the proximal small intestine
    where it removes y-linked glutamate from poly-y-glutamated folate and a-linked glutamate
    from peptides and small molecules. However, PSMA's particular function on prostate cancer
 [0 cells remains unresolved.
                    Unlike many other membrane-bound proteins, PSMA undergoes rapid
    internalization into the cell in a similar fashion to cell surface bound receptors like vitamin
    receptors. PSMA is internalized through clathrin-coated pits and subsequently can either
    recycle to the cell surface or go to lysosomes. Accordingly, diagnostic, imaging, and
 [5 therapeutic agents can be targeted to PSMA for delivery into PSMA expressing cells, such as
    prostate cancer cells.
                    Described herein are compounds capable of binding to PSMA. Also described
    herein are compounds capable of targeting PSMA for delivery of diagnostic, imaging, and
    therapeutic agents. Also described herein are compounds and compositions, and methods and
  0 uses thereof for diagnosing, imaging, and treating diseases caused by pathogenic populations of
    cells that express, or overexpress, PSMA.

    selected from C, N, 0, S, Si, and P, or C, N, 0, S, and P, or C, N, 0, and S. The chain of atoms
    covalently connects different functional capabilities of the conjugate, such as binding ligands,
    drugs, diagnostic agents, imaging agents, and the like. The linker may have a wide variety of
 !0 lengths, such as in the range from about 2 to about 100 atoms in the contiguous backbone. The
    atoms used in forming the linker may be combined in all chemically relevant ways, such as
    chains of carbon atoms forming alkylene, alkenylene, and alkynylene groups, and the like;

    pathway through the one or more cyclic structures. Illustratively, the linker length is defined by
    the shortest pathway through the each one of the cyclic structures. It is to be understood that
    the linkers may be optionally substituted at any one or more of the open valences along the
  5 chain of atoms, such as optional substituents on any of the carbon, nitrogen, silicon, or
    phosphorus atoms. It is also to be understood that the linker may connect the two or more
    functional parts of a molecule to form a conjugate at any open valence, and it is not necessary

    hydrophilic radicals, as described herein, which may also be referred to as spacer linkers. It is
    appreciated that the arrangement and/or orientation of the various hydrophilic linkers may be in
    a linear or branched fashion, or both. For example, the hydrophilic linkers may form the
    backbone of the linker forming the conjugate between the ligand and the one or more drugs.
 [0 Alternatively, the hydrophilic portion of the linker may be pendant to or attached to the
    backbone of the chain of atoms connecting the binding ligand B to the one or more drugs D. In

    the linker is formed by a parallel arrangement of branching side chains, such as by connecting
    monosaccharides, sulfonates, and the like, and derivatives and analogs thereof.
25                   It is understood that the linker (L) may be neutral or ionizable under certain
    conditions, such as physiological conditions encountered in vivo. For ionizable linkers, under
    the selected conditions, the linker may deprotonate to form a negative ion, or alternatively
    become protonated to form a positive ion. It is appreciated that more than one deprotonation or
    protonation event may occur. In addition, it is understood that the same linker may deprotonate
30  and protonate to form inner salts or zwitterionic compounds.
                     In another embodiment, the hydrophilic spacer linkers are neutral, an in
    particular neutral under physiological conditions, the linkers do not significantly protonate nor
    deprotonate. In another embodiment, the hydrophilic spacer linkers may be protonated to carry
    one or more positive charges. It is understood that the protonation capability is condition
35  dependent. In one aspect, the conditions are physiological conditions, and the linker is

    carry a negative charge include carboxylic acids, such as aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and
    longer chain carboxylic acid groups, and sulfuric acid esters, such as alkyl esters of sulfuric
    acid. In another embodiment, the regions of the linkers that may be protonated to carry a
 [0 positive charge include amino groups, such as polyaminoalkylenes including ethylene diamines,
    propylene diamines, butylene diamines and the like, and/or heterocycles including pyrollidines,
    piperidines, piperazines, and other amino groups, each of which is optionally substituted. In

                      In another embodiment, the polyvalent linker L is a releasable linker.
                      As used herein, the term "releasable linker" refers to a linker that includes at
   least one bond that can be broken under physiological conditions when the compounds
 5 described herein are delivered to or inside of the target cell. The linker itself may include one
   or more cleavable, scissile, or breakable bond, or form one or more cleavable, scissile, or
   breakable bonds with the PSMA binding ligand (B), and/or with one or more of the drugs (D).
   However, it is appreciated that releasable linkers described herein are advantageously not
   cleavable, scissile, or breakable until the conjugate containing the releasable linker is at or near
10 the intended target site. Accordingly, releasable linkers described herein do not generally
   include those linkers that have bonds that are substantially cleavable, scissile, or breakable
   under non-target conditions, or in non-target tissues. Similarly, releasable linkers described
   herein do not include those linkers that include bonds that are substantially only cleavable,
   scissile, or breakable under non-physiological conditions.
                                                                 -  46 -

                     The term releasable linker does not generally refer simply to a bond that is labile
    in vivo, such as in serum, plasma, the gastrointestinal tract, or liver, unless those systems are the
    target for the cell surface receptor binding ligand. However, after delivery and/or selective
    targeting, releasable linkers may be cleaved by any process that includes at least one bond being
  5 broken in the linker or at the covalent attachment of the linker to B or any D under
    physiological conditions, such as by having one or more pH-labile, acid-labile, base-labile,
    oxidatively labile, metabolically labile, biochemically labile, and/or enzyme-labile bonds. It is
    appreciated that such physiological conditions resulting in bond breaking do not necessarily
    include a biological or metabolic process, and instead may include a standard chemical reaction,
 [0 such as a hydrolysis reaction, for example, at physiological pH, or as a result of
    compartmentalization into a cellular organelle such as an endosome having a lower pH than
    cytosolic pH.
                     It is understood that a cleavable bond can connect two adjacent atoms within the
    releasable linker, and/or connect other linkers with B, and/or any D, as described herein, at any
 [5 ends of the releasable linker. In the case where a cleavable bond connects two adjacent atoms
    within the releasable linker, following breakage of the bond, the releasable linker is broken into
    two or more fragments. Alternatively, in the case where a cleavable bond is between the
    releasable linker and another moiety, such as an additional heteroatom, a spacer linker, another
    releasable portion of the linker, any D, or B, following breakage of the bond, the releasable
 !0 linker is separated from the other moiety. It is to be understood that a linker is a releasable
    linker when if forms a cleavable, scissile, or breakable bond with the one or more of the drugs
    (D) is capable of delivery of the one or more drugs (D) in a traceless manner, where the one or
    more drugs (D) do not include any residual part of the conjugate.

                    It is to be understood that the compounds described herein may contain one or

    understood that the formulae include and represent not only all pharmaceutically acceptable
    salts of the compounds, but also include any and all hydrates and/or solvates of the compound
    formulae. It is appreciated that certain functional groups, such as the hydroxy, amino, and like
    groups form complexes and/or coordination compounds with water and/or various solvents, in
 [5 the various physical forms of the compounds. Accordingly, the above formulae are to be
    understood to be a description of such hydrates and/or solvates, including pharmaceutically
    acceptable solvates.
                     In each of the foregoing and each of the following embodiments, it is also to be
    understood that the formulae include and represent each possible isomer, such as stereoisomers

                     In another embodiment, the compounds described herein can be internalized into
25  the targeted pathogenic cells by binding to PSMA. In particular, PSMA selectively and/or
    specifically binds the conjugate, and internalization can occur, for example, through PSMA
    mediated endocytosis. Once internalized, conjugates containing a releasable linker can
    complete delivery of the drug to the interior of the target cell. Without being bound by theory,
    it is believed herein that in those cases where the drug is toxic to normal cells or tissues, such a
30  delivery system can decrease toxicity against those non-target cells and tissues because the
    releasable linker remains substantially or completely intact until the compounds described
    herein are delivered to the target cells. Accordingly, the compounds described herein act
    intracellularly by delivering the drug to an intracellular biochemical process, which in turn
    decreases the amount of unconjugated drug exposure to the host animal's healthy cells and
35  tissues.

                      The conjugates described herein can be used for both human clinical medicine
    and veterinary applications. Thus, the host animal harboring the population of pathogenic cells
    and treated with the compounds described herein can be human or, in the case of veterinary
    applications, can be a laboratory, agricultural, domestic, or wild animal. The present invention
  5 can be applied to host animals including, but not limited to, humans, laboratory animals such
    rodents (e.g., mice, rats, hamsters, etc.), rabbits, monkeys, chimpanzees, domestic animals such
    as dogs, cats, and rabbits, agricultural animals such as cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and wild

    upon by an enzyme (such as esterases, amidases, phosphatases, and the like), simple biological
    chemistry, or other process in vivo to liberate or regenerate the more pharmacologically active
    drug. This activation may occur through the action of an endogenous host enzyme or a non

  5 and the like is achieved, followed by the subsequent rapid elimination of the released remains
    of the group forming the prodrug.
                     Prodrugs may be prepared from the compounds described herein by attaching
    groups that ultimately cleave in vivo to one or more functional groups present on the

30                   As used herein, the term "composition" generally refers to any product
    comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which
    results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified
    amounts. It is to be understood that the compositions described herein may be prepared from
    isolated compounds described herein or from salts, solutions, hydrates, solvates, and other
35  forms of the compounds described herein. It is also to be understood that the compositions may
                                                       - 63 -

    be prepared from various amorphous, non-amorphous, partially crystalline, crystalline, and/or
    other morphological forms of the compounds described herein. It is also to be understood that
    the compositions may be prepared from various hydrates and/or solvates of the compounds
    described herein. Accordingly, such pharmaceutical compositions that recite compounds
  5 described herein are to be understood to include each of, or any combination of, the various
    morphological forms and/or solvate or hydrate forms of the compounds described herein. In
    addition, it is to be understood that the compositions may be prepared from various co-crystals
    of the compounds described herein.
                      Illustratively, compositions may include one or more carriers, diluents, and/or
 [0 excipients. The compounds described herein, or compositions containing them, may be
    formulated in a therapeutically effective amount in any conventional dosage forms appropriate
    for the methods described herein. The compounds described herein, or compositions containing
    them, including such formulations, may be administered by a wide variety of conventional
    routes for the methods described herein, and in a wide variety of dosage formats, utilizing
 [5 known procedures (see generally, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, (2 1 " ed.,
    2005)).
                      The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, refers to that amount
    of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in
    a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical
 !0 doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder
    being treated. In one aspect, the therapeutically effective amount is that which may treat or
    alleviate the disease or symptoms of the disease at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to
    any medical treatment. However, it is to be understood that the total daily usage of the
    compounds and compositions described herein may be decided by the attending physician
25  within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically-effective dose level
    for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the disorder being
    treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the
    specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, gender and diet of the
    patient: the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific
30  compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidentally
    with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known to the researcher,
    veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician of ordinary skill.
                      It is also appreciated that the therapeutically effective amount, whether referring
    to monotherapy or combination therapy, is advantageously selected with reference to any
35  toxicity, or other undesirable side effect, that might occur during administration of one or more
                                                       - 64 -

    of the compounds described herein. Further, it is appreciated that the co-therapies described
    herein may allow for the administration of lower doses of compounds that show such toxicity,
    or other undesirable side effect, where those lower doses are below thresholds of toxicity or
    lower in the therapeutic window than would otherwise be administered in the absence of a
  5 cotherapy.
                     In addition to the illustrative dosages and dosing protocols described herein, it is
    to be understood that an effective amount of any one or a mixture of the compounds described
    herein can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician or physician by the use of
    known techniques and/or by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In
 [0 determining the effective amount or dose, a number of factors are considered by the attending
    diagnostician or physician, including, but not limited to the species of mammal, including
    human, its size, age, and general health, the specific disease or disorder involved, the degree of
    or involvement or the severity of the disease or disorder, the response of the individual patient,
    the particular compound administered, the mode of administration, the bioavailability
 [5 characteristics of the preparation administered, the dose regimen selected, the use of
    concomitant medication, and other relevant circumstances.
                     The dosage of each compound of the claimed combinations depends on several
    factors, including: the administration method, the condition to be treated, the severity of the
    condition, whether the condition is to be treated or prevented, and the age, weight, and health of
 !0 the person to be treated. Additionally, pharmacogenomic (the effect of genotype on the
    pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or efficacy profile of a therapeutic) information about a
    particular patient may affect the dosage used.
                     It is to be understood that in the methods described herein, the individual
    components of a co-administration, or combination can be administered by any suitable means,
25  contemporaneously, simultaneously, sequentially, separately or in a single pharmaceutical
    formulation. Where the co-administered compounds or compositions are administered in
    separate dosage forms, the number of dosages administered per day for each compound may be
    the same or different. The compounds or compositions may be administered via the same or
    different routes of administration. The compounds or compositions may be administered
30  according to simultaneous or alternating regimens, at the same or different times during the
    course of the therapy, concurrently in divided or single forms.
                     The term "administering" as used herein includes all means of introducing the
    compounds and compositions described herein to the patient, including, but are not limited to,
    oral (po), intravenous (iv), intramuscular (im), subcutaneous (sc), transdermal, inhalation,
35  buccal, ocular, sublingual, vaginal, rectal, and the like. The compounds and compositions
                                                      - 65 -

    described herein may be administered in unit dosage forms and/or formulations containing
    conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and/or vehicles.
                     Illustrative formats for oral administration include tablets, capsules, elixirs,
    syrups, and the like.
  5                  Illustrative routes for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial,
    intraperitoneal, epidurial, intraurethral, intrasternal, intramuscular and subcutaneous, as well as
    any other art recognized route of parenteral administration.
                     Illustratively, administering includes local use, such as when administered
    locally to the site of disease, injury, or defect, or to a particular organ or tissue system.
 [0 Illustrative local administration may be performed during open surgery, or other procedures
    when the site of disease, injury, or defect is accessible. Alternatively, local administration may
    be performed using parenteral delivery where the compound or compositions described herein
    are deposited locally to the site without general distribution to multiple other non-target sites in
    the patient being treated. It is further appreciated that local administration may be directly in
 [5 the injury site, or locally in the surrounding tissue. Similar variations regarding local delivery
    to particular tissue types, such as organs, and the like, are also described herein. Illustratively,
    compounds may be administered directly to the nervous system including, but not limited to,
    intracerebral, intraventricular, intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, intracisternal, intraspinal
    and/or peri-spinal routes of administration by delivery via intracranial or intravertebral needles
 !0 and/or catheters with or without pump devices.
                     Depending upon the disease as described herein, the route of administration
    and/or whether the compounds and/or compositions are administered locally or systemically, a
    wide range of permissible dosages are contemplated herein, including doses falling in the range
    from about 1 pg/kg to about 1 g/kg. The dosages may be single or divided, and may
25  administered according to a wide variety of protocols, including q.d., b.i.d., t.i.d., or even every
    other day, once a week, once a month, once a quarter, and the like. In each of these cases it is
    understood that the therapeutically effective amounts described herein correspond to the
    instance of administration, or alternatively to the total daily, weekly, month, or quarterly dose,
    as determined by the dosing protocol.
30                   In making the pharmaceutical compositions of the compounds described herein,
    a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds in any of the various forms
    described herein may be mixed with one or more excipients, diluted by one or more excipients,
    or enclosed within such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper, or other
    container. Excipients may serve as a diluent, and can be solid, semi-solid, or liquid materials,
35  which act as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the formulation
                                                      - 66  -

    compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs,
    suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium),
    ointments, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile
    packaged powders. The compositions may contain anywhere from about 0.1% to about 99.9%
  5 active ingredients, depending upon the selected dose and dosage form.
                     The effective use of the compounds, compositions, and methods described
    herein for treating or ameliorating diseases caused by pathogenic cells expressing PSMA may
    be based upon animal models, such as murine, canine, porcine, and non-human primate animal
    models of disease. For example, it is understood that prostate cancer in humans may be
 [0 characterized by a loss of function, and/or the development of symptoms, each of which may be
    elicited in animals, such as mice, and other surrogate test animals. In particular the mouse
    models described herein where cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells are subcutaneously implanted
    may be used to evaluate the compounds, the methods of treatment, and the pharmaceutical
    compositions described herein to determine the therapeutically effective amounts described
 [5 herein.
                     The compounds, linkers, intermediates, and conjugates described herein may be
    prepared using conventional processes, including those described in International Patent
    Publication Nos. WO 2009/002993, WO 2004/069159, WO 2007/022494, and WO

   Argon was bubbled for 1 hr, the coupling solution was drained, and the resin was washed with
10 dimethylformamide (3x10 mL) and isopropyl alcohol (3x10 mL). Kaiser tests were performed
   to assess reaction completion. Fmoc deprotection was carried out using 20% piperidine in
   dimethylformamide (3x 10 mL) before each amino acid coupling. The above sequence was
   repeated to complete 2 coupling steps. The resin was dried under argon for 30 min.

    bubbled for 1 hr, the coupling solution was drained, and the resin was washed with
    dimethylformamide (3x10 mL) and isopropyl alcohol (3x10 mL). Kaiser tests were performed
 [0 to assess reaction completion. Peptide was cleaved from the resin using a cleavage mixture
    consisting of dithiothreitol (114mg, 0.74 mmol) dissolved in a solution of trifluoroacetic acid
    (19mL), H 20 (0.5mL), triisopropylsilane (0.5mL). One-third of the cleavage mixture was
    introduced and argon was bubbled for 30 min. The cleavage mixture was drained into a clean
    flask. The resin was bubbled 2 more times with more cleavage mixture, for 30 min each, and
15  drained into a clean flask. The drained cleavage mixture was then concentrated and purified by
    preparative HPLC in 0-30% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid to yield 110 (66.9mg, 43%, 1H NMR
    consistent with structure of 110; ESI m/z = 844.57 [M+H]*).

    Based on 16.5 g of alkylated dipeptide 9 (26.97 mmol.), N-methyl pipecolinate (MEP) (5.51 g,
    1.4 equiv.) and pentafluorophenol (7.63 g, 1.5 equiv.) were added to a 300 mL hydrogenation
    flask. NMP (115 mL) was then added, followed by EDC (7.78 g, 1.5 equiv.). The mixture was
    stirred at room temperature for overnight. 16.5 g of alkylated dipeptide 9 was dissolved in 16.5
30  mL NMP, transferred the solution into the hydrogenation flask, washed the residual 9 with 8
    mL NMP, and transferred into the hydrogenation flask. Dry 10% Pd/C (1.45, 0.05 eq.) was

    added. The reaction mixture was vacuumed/back filled with hydrogen 3 times, and the flask
    was shaken under hydrogen (-35 psi) for 3.5 hours. The reaction mixture was analyzed by
    HPLC. The reaction mixture was filtered through 40 g of celite in a 350 mL sintered glass
    funnel and washed with 250 mL of EtOAc. The filtrate and the wash were transferred to a
  5 separatory funnel and washed with a 1% NaHCO 3/10% NaCl solution (200 mL x 3). The
    organic layer was isolated and dried over 45.2 g of Na 2SO 4 The solution was filtered and
    rotovaped under reduced pressure. A sticky amber residue was obtained and dried under high
    vacuum overnight to give 19.3 g of crude product. The crude product was dissolved in 10 mL of
    dichloromethane, split into two portions, and purified with a 330 g Teledyne Redisep Silica
 [0 Gold column. The combined fractions of two purifications were evaporated and dried under
    high vacuum to give 7.64 g of 10 as a pale yellow solid (overall yield: 39% over 3 steps from
    compound 7).

 [5 Methyl ester 10 (6.9 g, 9.7 mmol) was dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (193 mL) and added to a
    round bottomed flask, equipped with a stir bar and condenser. To this solution was added
    trimethyltin hydroxide (24.6 g, 14 eq.). The mixture was heated at 70 0 C for 5 hours. LC-MS
    analysis indicated that the desired product had been formed and < 15 % of starting methyl ester
    10 remained. The reaction was cooled in an ice bath for 30 minutes. The resulting precipitate
20  was then removed by filtration. The filtrate was stored overnight at - 20 0C. The filtrate was
    then divided into two portions and each was subjected the chromatography procedure which
    follows.
                    Each portion was concentrated under reduced pressure and then placed under
    high vacuum for 30 min. The concentrate was then immediately dissolved in acetonitrile (95
25  mL). To this solution was then added an ammonium bicarbonate solution (95 mL; 50 mM, pH
    = 7). This solution was loaded onto a Biotage SNAP C18 reverse phase cartridge (400g, KP
    C18-HS) and eluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile (1:1 to 100% ACN)
    using a Biotage chromatography system. Fractions were analyzed by LC-MS. Pure fractions
    were combined and ACN was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting aqueous
30  suspension was extracted with EtOAc (3 X). The combined organic layers were washed with

  5 In a round bottomed flask, tripeptide acid 11 (3.9 g, 5.6 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF
    (23 mL). To this solution was added 3 HF-TEA complex (1.8 mL, 2 eq.). The reaction was
    stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. LC-MS analysis indicated complete conversion to the
    desired des-TES product 12. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue
    was placed on the high vacuum for 40 minutes. The resulting residue was then dissolved in
 [0 pyridine (26 mL), and acetic anhydride (7.9 mL, 15 eq.) and DMAP (25 mg) were added. The
    reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. LC-MS analysis indicated complete
    conversion to the desired acetyl tripeptide acid 13. To the reaction mixture was then added a
     1:1 solution of 1,4-dioxane/water (150 mL). The reaction was stirred for 1 hour at which point
    the solvents were removed under high vacuum rotovap. To the residue was added toluene and
15  the solvent was removed under vacuum (80 mL, 3X). The resulting crude 13 was dried under
    high vacuum overnight. The crude material was then dissolved in ACN (72 mL). Sodium
    phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.8, 288 mL) was then added, and the pH of the resulting
    suspension was adjusted to neutral using saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. This solution
    was loaded onto a Biotage SNAP C18 reverse phase cartridge (400 g, KP-C18-HS) and eluted
20  with water and acetonitrile (20% ACN to 65% ACN) using a Biotage chromatography system.
    Fractions were analyzed by LC-MS. Clean fractions were combined, the ACN was removed,
    and the aqueous solution was placed on the freeze dryer, resulting in purified acetyl tripeptide
    13 (2.5 g, 71%).

                    METHOD EXAMPLE. PSMA relative affinity assay. LNCaP cells are seeded
  5 in 12-well Coming Cell-BIND plates and allowed to form adherent monolayers overnight in
    RPMI/HIFCS. Spent incubation media is replaced with RPMI supplemented with 10% HIFCS
    and containing a standard PSMA binding ligand, such as 100 nM of 3H-PMPA or a competing
    compound, such as EC0652, Re-EC652, or           9 9 mTc-EC0652,       in the absence and presence of
    increasing concentrations of test compound, such as unlabeled PMPA, or a compound described
 [0 herein, such as EC1169 or EC1568, a negative control intermediate lacking a PSMA binding
    ligand which is used as a negative control. Cells are incubated for 1 h at 37 0 C and then rinsed
    three times with 0.5 mL of PBS. Five hundred microliters of 1% sodium dodecylsulfate in PBS
    are added to each well; after 5 min, cell lysates are collected, transferred to individual tubes or
    to vials containing 5 mL of scintillation cocktail, and then counted for radioactivity. Cells
 [5 exposed to only the standard PSMA binding ligand, such as 3H-PMPA, or competing
    compound, such as    9 9 mTc-EC0652,    in FFRPMI (no competitor) are designated as negative
    controls, whereas cells exposed to the standard PSMA binding ligand, such as 3H-PMPA, plus 1
    mM unlabeled PMPA or competing compound, such as                9 9 mTc-EC0652     plus Re-EC0652, serve
    as positive controls. Disintegrations per minute (DPMs) measured in the latter samples
20  (representing nonspecific binding of label) are subtracted from the DPM values from all
    samples. Relative affinities are defined as the inverse molar ratio of compound required to
    displace 50% of the standard PSMA binding ligand, such as 3 H-PMPA, or the competing
    compound, such as    9 9 mTc-EC0652,    bound to PSMA on LNCaP cells, and the relative affinity
    of the standard PSMA binding ligand, such as PMPA, or the competing compound, such as Re
25  EC0652, for PSMA is set to 1.
                    METHOD EXAMPLE. Dose response assay against PSMA+ LNCaP cells.
    LNCaP cells are seeded in 24-well Coming Cell-BIND plates and allowed to form nearly
    confluent monolayers overnight in RPMI/HIFCS. Thirty minutes prior to the addition of test
    compound, such as a compound described herein, spent medium is aspirated from all wells and
30  replaced with fresh RPMI. Following one rinse with 1 mL of fresh RPMI/HIFCS, each well

    receives 1 mL of media containing increasing concentrations of test compound (four wells per
    sample). Test compound treated cells are pulsed for 2 h at 37'C, rinsed four times with 0.5 mL
    of media, and then chased in 1 mL of fresh media up to 70 h. Spent media is aspirated from all
    wells and replaced with fresh media containing 5 pCi/mL 3 H-thymidine. Following a further 4
  5 h 37'C incubation, cells are washed three times with 0.5 mL of PBS and then treated with 0.5
    mL of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid per well. After 15 min, the trichloroacetic acid is
    aspirated and the cells are solubilized by the addition of 0.5 mL of 0.25 N sodium hydroxide for
     15 min. Four hundred and fifty microliters of each solubilized sample is transferred to
    scintillation vials containing 3 mL of Ecolume scintillation cocktail and then counted in a liquid
 [0 scintillation counter. Final tabulated results are expressed as the percentage of 3 H-thymidine
    incorporation relative to untreated controls.
                     METHOD EXAMPLE. Activity in vivo against PSMA+ expressing tumor
    implanted in mice. Four to seven week-old male nu/nu mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.,
    Indianapolis, IN) are maintained on a standard 12 h light-dark cycle and fed ad libitum with
 [5 rodent diet #2918 (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) for the duration of the experiment. LNCaP
    cells are grown in RPMI in 10% HIFCS at 37'C in a 5% C0 2 /95% air-humidified atmosphere,
    harvested and resuspended on ice in matrigel solution (50% RPMI + 50% matrigel high
    concentration, BD#354248) to a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/50 PL. Cell solution and
    injection needles (28 gauge) are kept on ice prior to injection and 50 PL of the cell solution
 !0 injected in the subcutis of the dorsal medial area. Mice are divided into groups of five, seven, or
    nine, and freshly prepared test compound solutions are injected through the lateral tail vein
    under sterile conditions in a volume of 200 pL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Intravenous
    (i.v.) treatments are typically initiated when the LNCaP tumors are approximately 100-150 mm 3
    in volume. The mice in the control groups do not receive any treatment. Growth of each s.c.
25  tumor is followed by measuring the tumor three times per week during treatment and twice per
    week thereafter, until a volume of 1500 mm 3 is reached. Tumors are measured in two
    perpendicular directions using Vernier calipers, and their volumes are calculated as 0.5 x L x
    W 2 , where L = measurement of longest axis in mm and W = measurement of axis
    perpendicular to L in mm. As a general measure of gross toxicity, changes in body weights are
30  determined on the same schedule as tumor volume measurements. Maximum % weight loss on
    any given day due to treatment is determined for each mouse. Survival of animals is monitored
    daily. Animals that are moribund (or unable to reach food or water) are euthanized by CO 2
    asphyxiation.

 [0                 EXAMPLE. Activity of compounds described herein against PSMA+ tumors in
    vivo. As shown in FIG. 5 treatment of nude mice bearing PSMA-positive LNCaP human
    xenografts with EC1169 (c), EC1550 (0), and EC1551 (0), each at 2 pmol/kg, TIW, 2 weeks,
    leads to complete responses in all tested animals. Each compound was compared against
    vehicle-treated controls (*). A complete response is observed when the tumor does not appear
15  to have any net growth during the treatment period of 14 days (the vertical dotted line indicates
    the last treatment day). As described herein, it is to be understood that the implants comprise
    the cancer cells in a matrix (100-150 mm 3 total volume). Because the matrix remains during
    the entire observation period, a decrease in the size of the tumor cannot always be determined
    by external measurement. It was also surprisingly found that, treatment with compounds
20  described herein leads to cure. For example, EC 1169 leads to cure in 2/7 tested animals. A
    cure is observed when the tumor does not appear to grow during the entire observation period
    of 85 days. The data shown in FIG. 5 are the average of the measurements for each cohort.
    Therefore, it is to be understood that the increase in tumor volume beginning at about day 40-45
    represents regrowth in the remaining test animals.

  5 human xenografts with EC1584 (V) and EC1588 (A), each at 2 pmol/kg, TIW, 2 weeks, leads
    to complete responses in all tested animals. Each compound was compared against vehicle
    treated controls (0). It was also surprisingly found that treatment with EC1588 leads to cure in
    3/7 tested animals.

    loss or major organ tissue degeneration.
                    EXAMPLE. Activity of compounds described herein against PSMA+ tumors
    compared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. As shown in FIG. 9, treatment of LNCaP
    tumor bearing mice with docetaxel (the most active chemotherapeutic agent approved for
 [5 prostate cancer) at 10 mg/kg, BIW, 2 weeks, MTD (V), was found to produce only modest
    anti-tumor activity, and showed only 1/4 cures, even when administered at its MTD. In
    addition, as shown in FIG. 10, that modest observed docetaxel efficacy was accompanied by
    high gross toxicity, as evidenced by severe weight loss (18%). ECI 169, administered at 2
    pmol/kg, TIW, 2 weeks (0), is more active and less toxic than docetaxel against PSMA+
 !0 LNCaP tumors. FIG. 9 shows that treatment with EC 1169 leads to a complete response in all
    test animals, and resulted in 2/5 cures. FIG. 10 also shows that the higher efficacy displayed by
    EC 1169 was not accompanied by substantially lower toxicity than docetaxel, providing a
    significantly wider therapeutic window. The efficacy of each compound was compared to
    vehicle-treated control (0).

    (*) EC1719; and (0) EC1677; compared to (0) untreated control is shown in FIG. 11. All
    compounds were administered at 2 pmol/kg, TIW for 2 weeks, beginning on day 21 post tumor
    implant (PTI). The dotted line indicates the final treatment day. The data indicate that the
    compounds described herein are efficacious in decreasing tumor growth in vivo compared to
30  untreated animals. In addition, (i) EC1718 lead to 1/7 cures; (V) EC1721 lead to 1/7 cures;
    (*) EC1719 lead to 2/7 cures; and (0) EC1677 lead to 4/7 cures, where regrowth of the tumor
    in those animals was not observed during the observation period. In addition, the compounds
    described herein do not show gross toxicity to the test animals, as shown in FIG. 12. Without

   being bound by theory, it is believed herein that the weight change observed in FIG. 12 for
   EC1718 at about day 81 is due to the effects of the tumor size.
                   EXAMPLE. Specificity of compounds described herein. PSMA-negative KB
   tumors did not appreciably respond to EC 1169 therapy, supporting the conclusion that the
 5 compounds described herein exhibit target specificity for PSMA-expressing cells.
                   EXAMPLE. Hematological Toxicity. Conjugates described herein demonstrate
   significantly improved hematological toxicity. ECI 169, EC1584, and EC1588 were
   administered to rats i.v. at 0.33 and 0.51 pmol/kg, twice per week (BIW), for 2 weeks. The
   hematological toxicity in red blood cells and white blood cells was significantly lower than
[0 untreated controls.
