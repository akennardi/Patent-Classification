           AN EMERGENCY EXIT ARRANGEMENT FOR A BUILDING
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[001] This invention relates to an emergency exit arrangement for a building and
more particularly to an arrangement that includes a pre-existing illuminated exit
sign in close proximity to an exit door.
BACKGROUND ART DISCUSSION
[002] It is now fairly common practice that in most buildings there is the
requirement to include an illuminatable exit sign in close proximity to an exit door
so as to assist the occupants of the building in identifying how to exit a building
during evacuations and other similar emergency situations.
[003] For the most part these exit signs remain illuminated continuously and
maintain power for illumination from conventional AC mains supply to the building.
[004] There are some exit signs that do not remain continuously illuminated such
as those in cinemas and so forth. These types of exit signs typically only become
illuminated when the AC mains supply is interrupted. Nonetheless, whether the
light is continuously illuminated or illuminatable at certain periods, they are all
characterised in having an internal energy source which is generally a back-up
battery such that if the AC mains supply to the exit sign is interrupted the back-up
internal battery takes over the task of keeping the exit sign illuminated.
[005] As is to be expected this is particularly advantageous as people tend to
look for an exit door in emergency situations, wherein many emergency situations
such as a fire and so forth are characterised in the AC mains supply being cut or
disconnected from the building.
[006] The purpose of the illuminated exit sign therefore offers a way in which the
exit door can be recognised.
                                          1

[007] Nonetheless, the further away from an exit an occupant of the building is
from the illuminated sign, the harder it might be to see, especially if there is
smoke and so forth in the building and/or the person inside the building is
unfamiliar with the layout of the floor where the exits may or may not be.
[008] The problem is compounded often when the exit door may be surrounded
by additional signage such as advertising material, notice boards, hanging picture
frames and so forth, all adversely lowering the overall distinguishability and
distinctiveness of the exit sign from its surroundings and its function to highlight
and assist in recognising where an exit door may be located.
[009] Therefore, while an illuminated sign may assist in identifying where an exit
door may be located, there also needs to be an additional means to highlight or
direct the occupants of the building towards that illuminated exit sign particularly
in cases when the occupant is further away from the illuminated sign than would
be expected and the person inside the building is unfamiliar with the layout of the
floor and the various exit doors available. In a noisy environment, such as a
workshop, building occupants may be familiar with exit locations, but not be able
to hear any audible warning to evacuate.
[010] One way in which to overcome this problem presented to the building
occupants is to provide these conventional illuminatable exit signs with the ability
to start flashing when power is interrupted to the light and/or a signal from a fire
panel is sent to the circuitry contained inside the light which is then adapted to
send a signal to the controller of the light such that the light begins to start
flashing.
[011] The problem with such an arrangement is that while the introduction of a
flashing light may help identify where the exit door is located, research has shown
that if people were confronted with a flashing exit sign rather than thinking that
would be a safe point to exit the building, the contrary would be the case because
as they have never seen the exit sign flashing before, concerns would be raised
                                          2

that it is only now flashing in consequence as some type of warning wherein that
particular exit door should now be avoided.
[012] One obvious way of overcoming this problem may be to place a flashing
light close to the exit door wherein the flashing light helps direct people towards
the exit door without altering the illuminated Exit Sign.
[013] Nonetheless as the flashing light is a separate entity to the Exit Sign it
would need its own electrical wiring, power source and communication controller
so that if mains power supplied to the building is interrupted and/or a signal was
sent from a fire indicator panel the flashing light would then begin to flash.
[014] For each floor of the building every exit would require their own separate
illuminatable exit light and also have separate wiring and so forth for the flashing
light.
[015] While installation costs would be significantly increased through the
requirement of two separate devices, the real cost and inconvenience also comes
during maintenance and testing wherein as the flashing light is a separate entity
to the exit light there will be the requirement to undertake separate maintenance
and testing on not only the exit sign but now also the flashing light.
[016] It would therefore be particularly advantageous if an arrangement could be
provided that would be able to utilise the benefits of a flashing light in order to
direct an occupant of a building towards an exit door that has been identified with
an illuminatable flashing light but to do so without disrupting the normal operation
and intended display of an exit sign light and to do so without bringing any
additional costs to the installation, maintenance and testing of the conventional
illuminatable exit sign.
[017] It is an object of this invention to provide such an arrangement or at least
present to the public an alternative emergency exit arrangement for a building.
                                           3

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[018] Accordingly in one form of the invention there is provided an emergency
exit arrangement for a building adapted to raise awareness of an exit door
location for an occupant of said building during a power failure and/or emergency
situation, said arrangement including;
[019] an illuminatable exit sign mountable in close proximity to an exit door within
a building;
[020] said illuminatable exit sign powered by said building's AC mains supply
and further including an internal energy source that acts as a back-up power
source when the AC mains supply is interrupted;
[021] a flashing light mountable in close proximity to the exit door to which said
illuminatable exit sign has been mounted;
[022] said flashing light, when mounted, configured to be in electrical/electronic
communication with the internal energy source of the illuminated exit sign such
that when the power is interrupted to the illuminatable exit sign said flashing light
is able to draw power from said internal energy source of the illuminatable exit
sign so as to commence and maintain flashing of said flashing light.
[023] In preference the arrangement further includes internal circuitry within the
illuminatable exit sign in communication with a fire indicator arrangement within
the building, said circuitry also in electrical/electronic communication with the
flashing light such that a selected signal from the fire indicator arrangement
and/or interruption of the AC mains supply instigates flashing of the flashing light
wherein power generation to maintain flashing of the flashing light is obtained
either from the AC mains supply or from the internal energy source within the
illuminatable exit sign.
                                           4

[024] In preference the internal power source of the illuminatable exit sign is a
battery and/or capacitor configured with a storage capacity providing a period of
time as would be at least required in order to evacuate the building in which the
arrangement has been installed.
[025] In preference the flashing light is connected to the internal energy source
of the illuminatable exit sign by way of an electric cable or wire.
[026] In preference the electrical cable or wire is mounted behind wall and/or
ceiling panels wherein a further preferred embodiment the cable is connected
externally inside a channel.
[027] In preference the circuitry inside the illuminatable exit sign includes a test
button such that the activation of the test button is able to establish a condition led
by the illuminatable exit sign that AC mains supply has been disrupted and/or the
fire indicator panel has sent a signal indicating an emergency situation such that
activation of said button correlates to the commencement of the flashing of the
flashing light, with the power generation being derived either from the internal
energy source of the illuminatable exit sign or the AC mains supply.
[028] An advantage of such an arrangement is that for the first time there is the
one single arrangement which brings together the use of the conventional
illuminatable exit sign with the benefits of a flashing light.
[029] Nonetheless as the flashing light relies upon the internal energy source
contained within the illuminatable exit sign such that an interruption of the AC
mains supply to the illuminatable exit sign will not only instigate the powering of
the illuminatable exit sign by the internal energy source such as a battery but at
the same time use this internal energy source of the illuminatable exit sign to also
place into operation and power the flashing light.
[030] Advantageously there needs to be no two separate tasks in installation of a
separate illuminatable exit sign and that of a flashing light.
                                          5

[031] As the flashing light is powered either from the AC mains supply which is
provided to the illuminatable exit sign or the same internal energy source of the
illuminatable exit sign the wiring requires only a single connection and so too a
single maintenance testing operation to make sure that the AC mains supply
and/or the internal energy source of the illuminatable exit sign is behaving
appropriately in that if AC mains supply is interrupted and/or a signal comes from
the fire indicator arrangement, that power will still be available to illuminate the
exit sign but as introduced above advantageously also at the same time provide a
power source with which to have the flashing light powered for the light to flash
appropriately at the required time.
[032] Therefore whether it is in a building, a public space, a noisy environment
where building occupants may not be able to hear a message to evacuate, or in
shopping centres where there is a lot of advertising which makes it hard to
differentiate where the exit sign is and in situations where someone is unfamiliar
with the layout of the building or location where they are in, they can now be
assisted in being able to raise their awareness as to how to exit the building
through the dual benefits of both an illuminated exit sign and a separate flashing
light.
[033] Having a flashing illuminated exit sign could actually disrupt and cause
confusion as general human behaviour and recognition of the exit sign would be
that a flashing light may be representing the requirement to be cautious and avoid
such an exit.
[034] As the person skilled in the art in this area of technology would be aware, it
is important not to tinker with things that people are familiar with because any
change in that familiarity, especially in times of an emergency such as a fire and
similar evacuation scenarios, could result in people becoming confused and
disorientated.
[035] Therefore it is critical that the conventional illuminatable exit sign is not
tampered with or created with additional functionality to make it flash as this could
                                          6

be disruptive rather than act in assisting awareness of a preferred exit door for an
occupant of the building to head towards during an emergency situation.
[036] In order now to describe the invention in greater detail some preferred
embodiments will be Described with the assistance of the accompanying
illustrations.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[037] Figure 1 is a schematic representation showing a preferred embodiment of
the invention for the emergency exit arrangement for a building.
[038] Figure 2 is a similar schematic representation to Figure 1 however this
embodiment includes further circuitry and control within the arrangement wherein
the flashing light is also in communication with a fire indicator panel.
[039] Figure 3 is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment of the
invention illustrating the emergency exit arrangement for the building, in
operation.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[040] Referring to the drawings now in greater detail wherein the general
embodiment of this preferred embodiment of Figure 1 is shown as (10) which
includes an illuminatable exit sign (12) having the words EXIT (14) embossed
thereon such that as is to be expected when the light is illuminated, the word EXIT
is readable upon the light (12).
[041] The illuminatable exit sign (12) includes an internal energy source which in
this embodiment is a battery (26) where the battery is in communication with a
controller (28) which itself is in communication with the mains power supply (16)
which for the most part can be the source of power generation to keep the exit
sign (12) illuminated.
                                         7

[042] Control (28) of the illuminated exit sign is such that if there is disruption to
the AC mains supply and/or a signal is sent to the controller (28) this then sets
into action the illumination of the illuminated exit sign (12).
[043] Nonetheless, the arrangement also importantly includes a flashing light
(20) which is connected by way of an electrical cord or wire (18) to the exit sign
(12) and is configured as such that once the exit sign (12) needs to be illuminated
through the battery (26) this also constitutes a scenario which leads to the
illumination of the flashing light (20) which in this embodiment includes a strobe
type (24) arrangement to provide the flashing characteristics of the light (20).
[044] The arrangement (30) generally shown in Figure 2 is not dissimilar to the
embodiment shown in Figure 1 however the exit sign (32) with the external
signage EXIT (34) includes additional internal circuitry (42) which is in
communication with the fire indicator panel (40) and also the mains AC power
supply (36)
[045]    The exit sign (32) also includes the internal energy source which is a
battery (38) such that if power is interrupted from the AC mains supply (36) the
battery (38) takes over the energizing of the exit sign (32) to keep it illuminated
and also provides the necessary energy to generate power through the electrical
wiring (40) to the flashing light (31). Furthermore if the AC mains supply (36) is
maintained but a signal from the fire indicator panel (40) is sent to the circuit
control (42), AC mains power is transmitted through the electrical wiring (40) to
the flashing light (31), with this scenario, the exit sign (32) is also illuminated by
the AC mains supply (36).
[046] This arrangement also introduces the functionality of the maintenance
aspect which means that both the exit sign (32) and the flashing light (31) can be
checked for operation through two simple service buttons (39) wherein the
pressing of the service buttons (39) can correlate to providing either a signal from
the fire indicator panel (40) which would be registered on line (43) and/or the
interruption of power with either scenario resulting in the exit sign (32) being
                                           8

illuminated and at the same time the commencing of the flashing of the flashing
light (31).
[047] The flashing light (31) need not have its own separate battery as it is
connected to the exit sign (32) which receives AC mains supply and also has an
internal battery
[048] Figure 3 simply expands upon the preferred arrangements discussed in
Figures 1 and 2, showing the emergency exit arrangement mounted within a
building such that the illuminatable exit sign (52) is mounted in close proximity to
the exit door (54) and therein again the flashing light (56) is also in reasonably
close proximity to both the illuminatable exit sign (52) and the exit door (54).
[049] While not shown in Figure 3, the flashing light (56) and the exit sign (52)
are both in electrical/electronic communication with the other such that if the exit
sign (52) recognises a disruption in the AC mains supply, this instigates the
supply of power to the exit sign (52) through the internal energy source preferably
being a battery of some sort.
[050] This same battery enclosed within the exit sign (52) is also responsible for
the provision of energy in order to commence activation and maintain the flashing
illumination of the flashing light (56).
[051] The flashing light (56) and the exit sign (52) are both in electrical/electronic
communication with the other such that if the exit sign (52) receives a signal from
a fire indicator panel or similar such building monitoring system, the flashing light
is then activated and the flashing illumination maintained by the AC mains supply.
[052] While the walls of the building (50) could include a variety of additional
paraphernalia such as clocks (58), picture frames (60) and (64), calendar (62) and
so forth, the occupant (66) is not distracted from such signage which would make
or potentially obscure the significance and distinguishability of the exit light (52)
because in this emergency exit arrangement for the building of this invention
                                         9

there is also importantly included a flashing light (56) which assists the occupant
(66) in identifying the way in which he or she must proceed to head towards the
available exit door (54).
[053] Importantly, not only has the flashing light (56) been able to be introduced
into the emergency exit arrangement of the invention, it has been able to be done
so without having to have two separate installations and/or a protocol that would
require the maintenance of two separate devices.
[054] As the flashing light (56) is connected to the exit sign (32), testing can be
carried out through the one simple test.
