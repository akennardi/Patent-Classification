BACK STRAP
The back strap is a 30mm leather strap with hook and loop attachment that tightens over the back
of the hand, to support and stabilizes the focus pad. It is attached to the top side of the pad and
tightens over the knuckle area when your hand is inside the focus pad, this stops the pad moving
around while it is being punched by a boxer.
