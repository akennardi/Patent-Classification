                         CONVERTIBLE FURNITURE KIT
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]     The present invention relates to a convertible furniture kit for
assembling one of a bunk bed comprising two beds of substantially equal size, a
bunk bed comprising a lower bed larger in size than an upper bed and a loft bed
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]     Bunk beds in which one mattress is supported above another save
space. The upper and lower beds form upper and lower modules that are
selectively positionable between a stacked position and an unstacked position.
[0003]     The upper and lower beds each have a series of supports. Each
support of the upper bed mates with an opposing support of the lower bed when
the bunk bed assembly is positioned in the stacked position. The mating supports
of the bunk beds provide vertical support for the weight of the stacked upper bed.
Lateral support between the stacked beds must also be provided by the mating
supports to prevent the stacked bunk beds from being inadvertently
disconnected. Lateral support between the stacked bunk beds was provided by a
detached pin extending between each pair of mating supports. Each support also
included a bore extending into an end of the support. The mating supports were
positioned such that the bores of each pair of mating supports were aligned. The
detached pin was inserted into the aligned bores of each of the mating supports.
The detached pins provided a linkage between the mating supports that
prevented the stacked bunk beds from being laterally pulled or pushed apart. The
pins were freely detachable from the supports.
[0004]     There exist multipurpose furniture knits that are provided in 'flat-pack'
form, and allow assembly of different items of furniture depending upon
application. Re-assembly involves de-assembling selected components and then

                                            2
assembling the remaining pieces. The work is involved is relatively minimal, but is
required in any case.
[0005]      As children grow older their sleeping arrangement changes. Typically
if a bunk bed is initially used by two young children, an older child may outgrow
their original size of their bed in the bunk bed while the younger child may still be
suitable for their bed in the bunk bed. In situations where a family may have
visiting guests, for example, an uncle and aunt or cousins, additional sleeping
arrangements are required. Preferably, the additional sleeping arrangements are
more comfortable than a typical sofa bed.
[0006]      As children mature, they may desire their own rooms so that they have
their own personal space. Older children, especially school-age children will
eventually require additional furniture items in their room such as a desk, chair
and shelving for them to perform schoolwork tasks. The additional furniture items
will occupy more space.
[0007]      There is a need, in light of the foregoing, for a furniture kit that at least
attempts to address these and other limitations of existing furniture kits.
[0008]      It is desirable to prolong the useful life of a bunk bed compared to
existing bunk beds. One option to extend the useful life of a bunk bed is to
provide greater flexibility and convenient reconfigurability such that the
components of the bunk bed can be re-configured to meet the needs of the child
as they grow older.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]      The inventive concept arises from a recognition that a furniture kit can
be designed so that assembly ensures that the resulting furniture piece can
function as a bunk bed comprising two beds of substantially equal size, a bunk

                                            3
bed comprising a lower bed larger in size than an upper bed and a loft bed, with a
minimum if any re-assembly.
[0010]       The furniture kit described herein is provided in 'ready-to-assemble' or
'flatpack' form, which has noted cost advantages as regards transport and
storage, and relies upon dowels, fasteners and fixings as required to secure
assembly.
[0011]       The present invention, in one aspect, comprises a convertible furniture
kit for assembling one of a bunk bed comprising two beds of substantially equal
size, a bunk bed comprising a lower bed larger in size than an upper bed and a
loft bed. The furniture kit comprises: a lower bed frame; an upper bed frame
positionable above the lower bed frame and releasably securable to the lower
bed frame; a ladder releasably secured to the upper bed frame; a storage
structure positionable adjacent to the lower bed frame having a height
substantially the same as the distance of a bed platform of the lower bed frame
from the ground; a loft bed support frame positionable below and releasably
securable to the upper bed frame; the components of the kit compatible for
assembly as one of: a bunk bed in which the upper bed frame is positioned above
and releasably secured to the lower bed frame, the upper and lower bed frames
each have a bed platform of substantially equal size; an extendible bunk bed in
which the upper bed is positioned above and releasably secured to the lower bed
frame and the storage structure is positioned adjacent to the lower bed frame to
increase the size of the bed platform for the lower bed, and the ladder is
releasably secured to the upper bed frame and prevents a mattress for the lower
bed frame from sliding off of the bed platform; two beds of substantially equal size
in which the upper bed is detached from the lower bed frame; and a loft bed in
which the upper bed is positioned above and releasably secured to the loft bed
support frame, and the ladder is releasably secured to the upper bed frame.
[0012]       The lower bed frame may comprise two higher end boards secured to
a lower bed platform, and wherein the upper bed frame comprises: two lower end

                                             4
boards secured to the upper bed platform, wherein each end board has two legs,
the legs of the lower end boards having two holes at the bottom of the legs, the
legs of the higher end boards having two holes at the top of the legs, and the two
holes at the bottom of the legs align with the two holes at the top of the legs.
[0013]       The upper bed frame may comprise a front safety rail and a back
safety rail, the front safety rail being shorter in length than the back safety rail to
enable access to the upper bed frame via the ladder.
[0014]       Legs of the loft bed support frame may be substantially the same
height as legs of the lower bed frame.
[0015]       The storage structure may comprise two hollow storage boxes that are
accessible from a front side.
[0016]       The loft bed support frame may comprise two spaced apart longitudinal
spans joining rear legs of the loft bed support frame and two pairs of spaced apart
lateral spans joining rear legs to front legs of the loft bed support frame.
[0017]       The loft bed support frame may comprise two corner members to
enhance rigidity of the furniture kit by securing to legs and longitudinal side rail of
the upper bed and legs of the loft bed support frame.
[0018]       A bunk bed comprising two beds of substantially equal size, a bunk
bed comprising a lower bed larger in size than an upper bed and a loft bed
assembled from components of the kit as described.

                                            5
[0019]      Other advantages and features according to the invention will be
apparent to those of ordinary skill upon reading this application.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0047]       A preferred convertible furniture kit according to the present invention
is illustrated in Figs. 1 to 15 and shown generally at reference numeral 10.
[0048]       Referring to Figs. 1 to 5 in a first configuration, the components of the
kit 10 is compatible for assembly as a bunk bed. The bunk bed comprises an
upper bed 20 positioned above the lower bed 30. A ladder 40 is secured to the
upper bed 20 at one side. The ladder 40 comprises four steps. The ladder 40 is
angled which provides easier accessibility and greater safety because it is not
oriented perpendicular to the ground.
[0049]       The upper bed 20 has four legs 21 of substantially equal height. The
legs 21 are generally rectangular prisms. At the base of each leg 21 are pre
drilled holes. The upper bed 20 has a front safety rail 22 and a back safety rail

                                            8
22A to minimise or prevent the person sleeping on the upper bed 20 from falling
down.
[0050]      Each safety rail 22, 22A comprises two longitudinal spans 22C. The
front safety rail 22 is shorter than the back safety rail 22A by a length substantially
equal to the width of the ladder 40 so that it does not obstruct a person climbing
up or down from the upper bed 20.
[0051]      At the distal ends of the upper bed 20 there are end boards 24: a
headboard and a footboard, which are both substantially the same structure.
Each end board 24 comprises an upper and lower lateral curved members 24A
extending from one leg 21 to an opposite leg 21. The curved members 24A for
each end board are spaced apart by five vertical slats 24B. The five vertical slats
24B are arranged equally apart from each other and there are gaps between
each the vertical slats 24B. Although curved members 24B have been described,
they may be straight horizontal members. The safety rails 22, 2A are connected
to the end boards 24.
[0052]      The upper bed 20 has a bed platform 25 in the form of horizontal bed
slats which rest or are secure to longitudinal side rails 23. The safety rails 22, 22A
are connected to the longitudinal side rails 23 using two vertical members 22B.
Two fasteners connect each vertical member 22B to a longitudinal side rail 23.
The vertical member 22B is connected to each longitudinal span 23C of the
safety rail 22, 22A using a fastener. The fasteners that connect the curved
members 24A to the legs 21 and longitudinal side rails 23 are not visible on the
exterior facing surfaces of the bunk bed.
[0053]      The lower bed 30 is similar in structure to the upper bed 20. There may
also pre-drilled holes at the base of the legs 31 for possible use in a fourth
configuration of the furniture kit which is described later. However, no safety rails
are required as the lower bed 30 is lower to the ground. Also the four legs 31 of
the lower bed 30 are taller than the legs of the upper bed 20 to avoid or minimise

                                           9
head injury when a person enters or leaves the lower bed 30. At the top of each
leg 31 of the lower bed 30 is a pre-drilled hole. Removable caps (not shown) may
be provided to cover the holes at the top of each leg of the lower bed 30 if the
lower bed 30 is used on its own when separated from the upper bed 20. A single
mattress 91, 92 can be positioned on the bed platforms 25, 35.
[0054]      Turning to Figs. 22 and 23, when assembling the bunk bed, four
fasteners 200 are used to securely connect the upper bed 20 to the lower bed 30
or the loft bed support frame 60. Each fastener 200 comprises a round metal
dowel 201 that is configured to be positioned within the pre-drilled holes of each
leg 21, 31. Locking nuts 220 are embedded in the lower portion of the legs 21 of
the upper bed 20. Locking nuts 220 are embedded in the upper portion of the legs
23 of the lower bed 30. The locking nuts 220 can be tightened via the Phillip-head
screw which engages the narrow circumferential portion 202 of the metal dowel
201 to resist movement along the metal dowel 201. Therefore the legs 21, 23 of
the upper and lower beds 20, 30 are prevented from separating after the locking
nuts 220 are tightened. The upper bed 20 is able to support an uplift force of
about or a least 500 Newtons force or approximately 51 kg. Therefore this
minimises or prevents the upper bed 20 from accidentally detaching. Referring to
Fig. 26, in another embodiment, another type of fastener 300 may be used to
securely connect the upper bed 20 to the lower bed 30 or the loft bed support
frame 60. The fastener 300 comprises an embeddable timber insert 304 that is
threaded on its outer surface to be screwed into the pre-drilled holes of the legs
21, 31 such that the timber insert 304 is embedded within the legs 21, 31. The
embeddable timber insert 304 may also be known as a threaded flange insert or
threaded wood insert. The fastener 300 comprises a bolt 301 with a narrow
circumferential portion 302 at one end to be engaged by a locking nut 220 and a
threaded portion 303 at the opposite end. The threaded portion 303 of the bolt
301 is screwed into the embeddable timber insert 304 which has an inner thread
to receive the threaded portion 303 of the bolt 301. A combination of the first type
of fastener 200 and second type of fastener 300 may be used.

                                            10
[0055]      Referring to Figs. 6 and 7 in a second configuration, the components of
the kit 10 is compatible for assembly as a bunk bed with a larger lower bed 30
compared to the upper bed 20. The external facing longitudinal side rail 33 of the
lower bed 30 can be lowered so that it does not obstruct. The bracket 240 that
previously connected the external facing longitudinal side rail 33 to the lower bed
30 is switched with a different bracket 250 to lower the height position of the
longitudinal side rail 33 relative to the lower bed 30 such that it is in line with the
bed platform 35 of the lower bed 30. The brackets 240, 250 have a series of
holes 242, 252 and pins 241, 251. Next, a storage structure 50 is positioned
adjacent to the bunk bed to increase the size of the bed platform 35 for the lower
bed 30 such that it becomes a double bed. The height of the storage structure 50
is substantially the same as the distance of the bed slats 35 of the lower bed 30
from the ground which provides a level surface for a double mattress 93. The
ladder 40 may be temporarily removed prior to positioning the storage structure
50 beside the lower bed 30. Alternatively, if space permits, the storage structure
50 can be manoeuvred beneath the ladder 40 until it is in the correct position
beside the lower bed 30. If the ladder 40 was removed, it should be re-connected
to the upper bed 20. The ladder 40 enables access to the upper bed 20 as well as
prevents the double mattress 93 from sliding off the enlarged bed platform. In one
embodiment, the storage structure 50 comprises two modular storage boxes 51,
52 arranged side by side. Each storage box 51 is hollow and has a planar upper
side, two lateral sides 54 and a base 55. The opening of the storage box 51
allows items to be easily placed and removed and also be externally visible. The
base 55 of the storage box 51 may be raised slightly off the ground by mounting
the base 55 higher on the lateral sides 54..
[0056]      Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, the upper bed 20 of the bunk bed is shown
on its own.
[0057]      Referring to Figure 10, in a third configuration, the components of the
kit 10 is compatible for assembly as separate beds 20, 30. The upper bed 20 is
lifted from the lower bed 30. The locking nuts 220 are untightened and the metal

                                            11
dowel 201 is removed and the end caps are fitted on the tops of the holes of the
legs of the lower bed 30 to cover the holes. Both beds 20, 30 of the bunk bed are
positioned on the ground. This configuration may be useful when children are
older and have their separate rooms. The end boards 34 of the lower bed 30 are
used as the footboard for each separated bed 20, 30 and the end boards 24 of
the upper bed 20 are used as the headboard for each separated bed 20, 30.
Therefore the separated beds appear identical.
[0058]       Referring to Figs. 11 to 15 in a fourth configuration, the components of
the kit 10 is compatible for assembly as a loft bed. If the furniture kit is in the first
or second configuration, the lower bed 30 (and storage structure 50 if present) is
removed and substituted with a loft bed support frame 60. If the furniture kit is in
the third configuration, to convert it to the fourth configuration one of the beds is
selected for positioning above and securing to the loft bed support frame 60. The
lower bed 30 may be used by a younger child in a separate room and the loft bed
may be used by an older child that is school age and requires a study desk 70
and additional storage 100 for their school books. The ladder 40 may be
temporarily removed during conversion from the first or second configuration to
the fourth configuration of the furniture kit 10. The loft bed support frame 60 has
four legs 61 at least the same height as the legs of the lower bed 30. The height
of the legs 61 together with a portion of the legs of the upper bed 20 together
must be sufficient for a child to enter beneath the upper bed 20 and use furniture
items 70, 80, 100 located beneath the upper bed 20 without inconvenience or a
high risk of accidental head injury by ensuring the longitudinal side rail 23 of the
upper bed 20 has a high enough clearance.
[0059]       Metal dowels 201 are inserted into pre-drilled holes at the top of the
legs 61 and secured by locking nuts 220 embedded in the legs 61 of the loft bed
support frame 60. Unlike the lower bed 30, the loft bed support frame 60 does not
have end boards or a bed platform. To provide structural rigidity, the loft bed
support frame 60 has two rear spaced apart longitudinal spans 64 connected to
opposite legs 61. There are two pairs of side lateral spans 62 connected to the

                                            12
other legs 61. The side lateral spans 62 are spaced apart by a similar distance as
the spacing between the two rear longitudinal spans 64 for aesthetic and
structural reasons. Referring to Fig. 11, two corner members 65 are provided to
provide enhanced strength by joining together the longitudinal side rail 23 of the
upper bed 20 and legs of the upper bed 20 to the legs of the loft bed support
frame 60. Two fasteners may join the corner member 65 to each leg 61 of the loft
bed support frame 60. The rear of the loft bed support frame 60 has longitudinal
spans 64 and therefore corner members 65 may not be required for the rear of
the loft bed support frame 60.
[0060]       The fourth configuration of the furniture kit 10 is particularly useful for
bedrooms that are not large and there is not much floor space. The fourth
configuration of the furniture kit 10 uses a minimum amount of floor space to
provide a bed 20, desk 70, chair 80 and storage 100.
[0061]       The lower bed 30 may be positionable over another loft bed support
frame 60. However, the legs 31 are taller than the upper bed 20 and also safety
rails 22, 22A will be needed for the lower bed 30 if positioned above the loft bed
support frame 60.
[0062]       Referring to Figs 17 to 22 is the desk 70 positionable below the loft bed
20. The desk 70 has a height adjustable table top 71. There may be storage
within the desk 70 beneath a hinged table top. The storage may be a slidable
drawer. Four height positions are possible by lowering or raising the table top 71
relative to the side frame members 73 using engageable pins to be inserted into
the mounting holes 74 located on the inner surface of the side frame members
73. The side frame members 73 are generally A-shaped and have a narrower
upper section compared to the lower section of the side frame members 73. The
width of the narrower upper section is less than the width of the table top. A
longitudinal span connecting the rear legs at a lower region is provided for added
rigidity of the desk 70. Other furniture items possible for the loft bed 20 beneath
the upper bed 20 include a chair 80 for the desk 70 and also a modular cube

                                            13
shelving unit 100 (see Fig. 25). These furniture items may match the style and
colour of the furniture kit 10 for visual consistency and aesthetic reasons.
[0063]      Advantageously, the present invention enables the bunk bed to be
expanded by extending the lower bed from a single bed to a double bed and also
enables the conversion of the bunk bed into two separate single beds, and
conversion of the bunk bed into a loft bed and a separate single bed. There is
minimum wastage of components during the reconfiguration and the
reconfiguration is convenient by minimise the quantity of fasteners that need to be
unfastened and re-fastened. Also, the furniture kit 10 has a more useful life than a
conventional bunk bed because it of the variety of additional configurations
possible.
