                                       ABSTRACT
           A tablet device with a flexible cover is disclosed.      Thin flexible display
  technology can be integrated into the flexible cover without affecting the overall form
  factor of the cover or tablet device.   Adding the integrated display to the flexible
5 cover greatly enhances the overall functionality of the tablet device.

                                        BACKGROUND
                      FIELD OF THE DESCRIBED EMBODIMENTS
   [0001]       The described embodiments relate generally to portable electronic devices.
 5 In particular methods for expanding the functionality of tablet devices are disclosed.
   [0001a]          Incorporated     herein    by     reference,    in    its  entirety,    is
   PCT/US2012/021378 (published as W02012/106092), filed on 13 April 2012.
                                        RELATED ART
   [0002]       Recent advances in portable computing include the introduction of hand
10 held electronic devices and computing platforms known generically as tablet devices.
   These devices can be used for any number of tasks including word processing, social
   media networking, video conferencing, and gaming.           Although this type of device
   allows an extensive variety of tasks to be performed, the overall functionality of this
   device type still has room for improvement. For example, increasing the display area
15 could lead to a significant expansion in functionality. Unfortunately, since displays
   already dominate a majority of one side of tablet devices, device manufacturers
   generally choose between making the display and therefore the device itself larger,
   thereby reducing the portability or making the device and display smaller with the
   result of a less functional device.
20 [0003]       Neither solution is desirable; therefore a way to extend the usability and
   functionality of a tablet device without making it any larger is desired.

              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
   [0025]      Representative applications of methods and apparatus according to the
   present application are described in this section. These examples are being provided
10 solely to add context and aid in the understanding of the described embodiments. It
   will thus be apparent to one skilled in the art that the described embodiments may be
   practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known
   process steps have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily
   obscuring the described embodiments. Other applications are possible, such that the
15 following examples should not be taken as limiting.
   [0026]      In the following detailed description, references        are made to the
   accompanying drawings, which form a part of the description and in which are
   shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in accordance with the described
   embodiments.      Although these embodiments are described in sufficient detail to
20 enable one skilled in the art to practice the described embodiments, it is understood
   that these examples are not limiting; such that other embodiments may be used, and
   changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the described
   embodiments.
   [0027]      Accessories for tablet devices have become quite common. Today typical
25 tablet accessories are passive in nature, the majority of which simply function to
   protect the screen, or perhaps support the tablet in some specific orientation.
   Although some devices such as Bluetooth headsets and keyboards do have limited
   interactive capability the majority of accessories are limited to more basic tasks.
   These accessories can be improved by including at least some of the following
30 features: (1) a power source; (2) a communications protocol; (3) an input method; and
   (4) an independent storage medium.
   [0028]      An accessory that takes a more interactive role with the tablet would also
   typically need a power source to drive it. In some embodiments, a battery can be
                                               4

   1002093922
   incorporated within the body of the accessory. The battery can take many forms. For
   example, the battery can be distributed in nature by which it is meant that portions of
   the battery can be placed in disparate locations in the accessory. In another example,
   the battery can be replaceable or otherwise accessible by the user. The operating time
 5 of a built in battery can be augmented by the addition of an auxiliary power supply
   such as a solar panel array to the accessory. For example, a solar panel array spread
   across a surface of an accessory device in the form of a cover can lengthen the amount
   of time the cover could be operated between recharging. A battery can also allow for
   the cover to continue nominal operations after it has been removed from the tablet
10 device, especially with the inclusion of a small amount of storage space.            For
   example, a simple screen saver could be displayed with an embodiment that includes
   an auxiliary display.     In another embodiment where the cover includes a display
   portion, a document could be reviewed. In yet another embodiment, the document
   can be updated or otherwise modified by a user with a user interface, such as a
15 keyboard, or touch pad, where the interface is built into the cover and powered by the
   cover battery.
   [0029]       Active communication between an accessory and a tablet device can be
   accomplished either wirelessly or through a wired data connection. For example, a
   wireless data connection utilizing the 5GHz 802.1 In protocol can provide sufficient
20 data transmission bandwidth to transmit a high quality video stream along the lines of
   NTSC 1080p 30fps video.           The accessory can alternatively or additionally be
   electrically connected to the tablet device using any number of established standards
   such as DisplayPortTM, mini DisplayPortTM, DVI, and ThunderboltTM.            A custom
   wireless or wired protocol is also certainly possible. While the wired solutions would
25 enable simple, high speed data transfer, the wireless protocol has the advantage of
   allowing for communication between the two devices in a detached state.
   [0030]       In another embodiment power could be transferred to the accessory from
   the tablet itself through either a wireless or wired medium.         Wireless charging
   methods, such as inductive charging can allow the accessory to be charged by the
30 tablet itself without the addition of a power connector. Alternatively, a wired solution
   could be implemented by using a connector similar to the MagSafe@ connectors used
   on the MacBook® line of computers manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, CA.
   In one accessory embodiment the accessory can take the form of a cover such as the
                                               5

   1002093922
   Smart CoverTM manufactured by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, CA, which includes
   magnets which precisely align the cover and the tablet in the form of an iPad2. In one
   embodiment, the tablet device can include an electrical connector arranged to be held
   in place by the magnets thereby alleviating the need for a user to take affirmative
 5 action to provide power to and/or from the tablet device.
   [0031]      In yet another embodiment a customized connector that passes both data
   and power could allow for a simple connection between the two devices.             For
   example a connector similar to the MagSafe@ connector can be integrated with an
   auxiliary connector which passes data and or video. FIG. 1A shows arrangement 100
10 in accordance with a described embodiment showing connector 102 used to connect
   tablet device 104 and accessory device 106.      Connector 102 can be configured as
   shown in close up view 108 with a number of separate connectors, allowing the power
   and display transfer lines to traverse separate channels. Such a connector 102 would
   eliminate the need for a wireless data transmitter in the cover and would make the
15 electrical and data connections between the two devices quite simple. A wired data
   connection also removes security concerns associated with wireless communication
   protocols. Now that the electrical and data connection solutions have been discussed
   the following representative embodiments will include power and data connections
   between the accessory device and tablet as required.
20 [0032]       Magnetic attraction areas 110 can be used to magnetically attach
   accessory 106 and tablet device 104. In a specific embodiment, magnetic attachment
   areas 110 can magnetically attach to magnetic elements (not shown) within hinge 112.
   Hinge 112 can be pivotally connected to accessory 106. In this way, accessory 106
   can be configured in either an open or closed configuration with respect to tablet
25 device 104. The magnetic attraction between magnetic attachment areas 110 and the
   magnetic elements in hinge 112 can be such that electronic device 104 and accessory
   106 attach to each other in a preferred alignment.        For example, the preferred
   alignment can assure that connector 102 aligns and mates with a corresponding
   receptor (not shown) on hinge 112. In this way, the user of tablet device 104 can
30 simply place accessory 106 and tablet device 104 within proximity distance dmag to
   each other such that the magnetic attraction between magnetic attachment area 110
   and the magnetic elements in hinge 112 cause tablet device 104 and accessory 106 to
                                              6

   1002093922
   attach to each other with a high degree of confidence that a proper mechanical and
   electrical connection can be made.
   [0033]      In one embodiment, the attachment can occur between a tablet device and
   an accessory device where the tablet device and accessory device are each electronic
 5 devices. The electronic devices can be magnetically attached to each other to form a
   cooperative electronic system in which the electronic devices can communicate with
   each other. In one embodiment, the tablet and accessory devices can be attached to
   each other directly. In another embodiment, a magnetic attachment unit can be used
   to   magnetically    attach   together  the   first  and   second   electronic devices.
10 Communication between the first and second electronic devices can occur before,
   during, and after the magnetic attachment is complete.
   [0034]      FIG. 1B shows a perspective view of tablet device 104 with an attached
   accessory device 106 having display 114. In the described embodiment, accessory
   device 106 can take the form of cover 106 that can be used to both protect as well as
15 provide functional support for tablet device 104. Accordingly, cover display 114 can
   be integrated with cover 106. Therefore, when cover 106 and tablet device 104 form
   cooperating system 100, cover display 114 can be used in conjunction with or in place
   of tablet display 116.    Clearly, in order to maintain flexibility of cover 106, cover
   display 114 must also be flexible. Therefore, cover display 114 can take the form of a
20 flexible display made of a durable, flexible material such as a polyimide substrate. In
   this way, cover display 114 and cover 106 can bend and flex together allowing for a
   thin, robust, and flexible design. It should be noted that touch screen technology can
   also be integrated into cover display 114. The integrated touch screen allows cover
   display 114 and tablet display 116 to have substantially similar functionality.     The
25 addition of cover display 114 ameliorates the limited screen area problem and makes
   a number of tasks significantly easier, in some cases functioning as an extended
   desktop. For example, reviewing two documents on a conventional tablet screen size
   of about 7 - 10 inches is difficult at best. Having two documents open at once on a
   screen of this size makes the text quite difficult to read. With an additional display,
30 instead of having to switch back and forth between documents one of the documents
   can be moved to the cover display. In one embodiment this could be accomplished by
   a multi-touch gesture, essentially allowing a document to be pushed from the tablet
   display to the cover display.
                                               7

   1002093922
   [0035]      FIG. IC shows a perspective view of tablet device 104 attached to cover
   106. Cover 106 has a plurality of segments each of which can include a stiffener. For
   example, stiffeners 118, 120, 122, and 124 embedded within corresponding segments
   of cover 106 can provide shape and support to cover 106. Moreover, each of the
 5 segments can be separated by foldable regions that can provide flexibility in an
   upward or downward direction. For example, FIG. IC shows how stiffener 118 of
   flexible attached cover 106 can flex about a corresponding folded region located
   between stiffeners 118 and 120. In this way flexible cover attachment 106 can be
   folded into number of useful configurations.       In some configurations the flexible
10 cover attachment can fold in half so as to take up less space. In other configurations it
   can take the form of a resilient triangular support structure for holding up a tablet
   device in a number of useful orientations.
   [0036]      FIG. 2A shows a perspective view of tablet device 202 attached to cover
   204 with cover display 206. In one embodiment, cover 204 is shown folded into a
15 triangular shape that can be used for support, allowing tablet device 202 to be placed
   in an orientation that is convenient for typing on tablet device 202's virtual keyboard.
   In this embodiment cover display 206 covers at least first segment 208 of cover 204,
   indicated by label 206-1.     Cover display 206 can also wrap around cover 204 as
   further indicated by label 206-2. Cover display 206 can be automatically activated in
20 this orientation when sensor 208 embedded in flexible cover 204 determines the cover
   is folded.     In another embodiment, after determining the cover is closed an
   accelerometer included in tablet device 202 can confirm the tablet's orientation is
   within a certain range of values before automatically activating cover display 206. By
   using an active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) display for cover
25 display 206 single pixels can be lit up, as opposed to conventional LCD technology in
   which the entire screen is in either an on or an off state. Consequently, an AMOLED
   screen can display small amounts of text at extremely conservative power levels.
   With this technology in combination with the orientation determining sensors only the
   portion of cover display 206 on segment 210 can be activated providing a number of
30 useful features. For example, the small amount of power consumed when only a few
   pixels are active can help to conserve battery life. Once activated, cover display 206
   can perform a number of useful functions when the cover is disposed in this
   orientation. In one embodiment a user's social media site status could be displayed.
                                                8

   1002093922
   In another embodiment a certain number of recent words typed into a word processing
   application could be displayed. In yet another embodiment the display could simply
   display the tablet user's name, which is useful in settings such as a conference or a
   classroom.
 5 [0037]      FIG. 2B shows a perspective view of tablet device 202 supported by
   flexible cover 204 arranged such that tablet device 202 can be placed in a convenient
   orientation for watching video. Flexible cover 204 can include cover display 206-3
   which covers at least single segment 212. Cover display 206 can include user input
   regions having controls that can be used to affect the operation of tablet device 202.
10 For example, in those situations where video is presented on tablet device 202, input
   regions can include, for example, touch sensitive areas 214 located near the outer
   edges of flexible cover 204. The touch sensitive areas 214 can allow specific user
   input that can provide for enabling functions such as play, pause, fast forward, and
   rewind. Although touch sensitive areas 214 are not visible to a user while viewing a
15 video, the size and location of the touch sensitive areas can allow for a user to easily
   learn the locations after a short familiarization period. This allows a user to control
   the video display without having to manipulate on screen controls on the tablet
   display (not shown), which can interfere with the movie watching experience. Cover
   display 206 can also indicate the type of content that is being viewed, as illustrated in
20 FIG. 2B. Furthermore, this orientation is also convenient for reading through or
   reviewing documents, in which case large touch sensitive areas 214 could be
   configured as arrows for panning left, right, up and down across a document, or for
   performing any number of other useful functions. This prevents for example a user's
   hands or fingers from obscuring portions of a document as the user navigates through
25 it.
   [0038]      FIG 3A shows a top view of tablet device 302 attached to a full extended
   flexible cover 304 with cover display 306.       A small cover display 306 as shown
   overlaid on first segment 308 can exhibit all the advantages of the functionality
   described above in FIG 2A, while allowing for the use of a less expensive, smaller,
30 lower power display than one covering the entire inside of cover 304. A smaller
   cover display 306 also allows the inclusion of other features into the inside surface of
   flexible cover 302. Features such as ambient energy collectors can be included. It
   should be noted that ambient energy can be considered to be any form of energy to
                                               9

   1002093922
   which flexible cover 302 is exposed. For example, ambient energy can take the form
   of ambient light energy (sunlight, artificial light, and so on), RF energy, and so forth.
   FIG. 3A shows a specific embodiment with second segment 310, third segment 312,
   and fourth segment 314 integrated with solar panels 316 arranged to collect useful
 5 amounts of solar energy (or more simply ambient light from artificial sources such as
   a light bulb).  Solar panels 316 configured in this way can supply power to cover
   display 306. In another embodiment cover display 306 can include touch sensitive
   control. In this configuration cover display 306 can display and allow selection from
   a list of active program icons, enabling convenient switching between active
10 applications. Alternatively, cover display 306 can display program toolbars or even a
   list of bookmarks for a PDF document, thereby freeing up screen area while enabling
   more convenient access to application functionality. In yet another embodiment both
   sides of flexible cover 304 could be covered with solar panels 316.              In this
   embodiment an electrical connection between tablet device 302 and flexible cover
15 304 can function to move energy from flexible cover 304 to tablet device 302.
   [0039]      FIG. 3B shows a similar embodiment to the representation shown in FIG.
   3A. In this figure flexible cover display 302 has RF energy collection antennas 318
   integrated into second segment 310, third segment 312 and fourth segment 314. RF
   energy collectors can be used to gather ambient RF energy from specific frequency
20 bands broadcast by a number of nearby transmitters such as Wi-Fi antennas, cell
   phone towers, or even radio waves. Although RF energy harvesting without a
   dedicated transmitter typically yields modest amounts of energy, the energy could be
   used to trickle charge a micro battery or super capacitor contained within flexible
   cover 304. This energy could then be applied to handle low energy tasks such as
25 querying tablet device 302 for the presence of any notification updates, or even
   powering a low power sensor such as a thermometer.                One advantage of this
   configuration over the solar panels of FIG. 3A is that the RF antennas 318 could
   collect energy with flexible cover 304 in an open or closed state.     A combination of
   solar panels 316 and RF Antennas 318 can also be combined in one embodiment of
30 the flexible cover.
   [0040]      FIG. 4A shows a cross section of system 400 in accordance with an
   embodiment.     System 400 can include tablet device 402 magnetically attached to
   cover assembly 404 by way of magnetic hinge assembly 406. Cover assembly 404
                                               10

   1002093922
   can include segmented cover 408 pivotally attached to hinge assembly 404 at pivot
   410. Hinge assembly 406 can be magnetically attached to tablet device 402 by way of
   magnetic element 412 in hinge assembly 406 and magnetic attachment feature 414 in
   tablet device 402.    Intervening layer 416 can act to prevent direct metal to metal
 5 contact between hinge assembly 406 and housing 418 of tablet device 402.
   [0041]      Cover assembly 404 can also include separate flap portion 420 pivotally
   attached to hinge assembly 406 at pivot 422. In this way, segmented cover 408 and
   flap portion 420 can be rotated about their respective pivots separately as shown in
   FIG. 4B where segmented cover 408 has been folded into support structure 424.
10 Support structure 424 can be triangular in shape and be used to position tablet device
   402 such that tablet display 426 is presented at about an angle of 75'.          Support
   structure 424 can also include cover display 206 as described in the description
   accompanying FIG. 2B. In addition to the embodiment described in FIG. 2B, cover
   display 206 could work independently or in conjunction with any additional controls
15 or displays included on flap portion 420. In this way, a user could easily switch from
   using controls on flap portion 420 to manipulating video controls.        This might be
   desirable when reviewing email. After finishing writing an email with controls built
   into flap portion 420, a user might receive an email with a link to an internet video, in
   which case the user could follow the link and then quickly control the playback of the
20 internet video with touch screen controls arranged on cover display 206.
   [0042]      Flap portion 420 can be formed of flexible material such as fabric. In one
   embodiment, flap portion 420 can include various input devices. For example, as
   shown in FIG. 5, flap portion 420 can include keyboard 502. Keyboard 502 can be in
   communication with tablet device 402 using, for example, a wired connection.           In
25 another embodiment, keyboard 502 can be in wireless communication with tablet
   device 402. Accordingly, information can be input into tablet device 402 by pressing
   various input keys on fabric keyboard 502 which can give positive tactile feedback.
   Having a separate keyboard attached to tablet device 402 while tablet device 402 is in
   a convenient viewing angle has a number of advantages.         First, this configuration
30 gives the user an experience much closer to the one enjoyed by laptop users. Second,
   by allowing the user to easily view the screen and by providing a convenient surface
   to type on, tasks such as word processing and email become much more efficient.
   Third, the experience is even better in some ways than the laptop experience as most
                                              11

   1002093922
   laptops do not include rear facing touch controls for video or document manipulation.
   Finally, the addition of flap portion 420 adds no significant weight or bulk to the
   tablet device and makes this configuration a true laptop alternative.       Even more
   functionality can be added to flap portion 420 by configuring it with flap screen 504,
 5 positioned either above (as shown in FIG. 5) or below keyboard 502.              When
   configured above keyboard 502 flap screen 504 could allow for customized virtual
   keys to be added specific to each application, or could be used as a way to display
   additional application data. Flap screen 504 could also be configured with application
   toolbars, or even an active application list for easily switching between active
10 applications. When flap screen 504 is configured below keyboard 502 it could act as
   a replacement for a touch pad, bringing the experience even closer to a conventional
   laptop configuration. With this configuration a cursor can even be implemented in
   applications where useful.
   [0043]      It should be noted that flap portion 420 can be configured to include any
15 suitable type of input device. For example, in one embodiment shown in FIG. 6, flap
   portion 420 can include flap screen 602 across a majority of the surface of flap
   portion 520. This configuration allows for the display of a configurable keyboard or a
   completely customized control scheme, as might be desirable for mixing music or
   video compilations.    As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, a second touch
20 screen could be used for a number of functional enhancements as it effectively
   doubles the usable display area of the tablet.
   [0044]      FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C show embodiments with cover displays configured
   on the outside surface of tablet device covers. These embodiments can allow a tablet
   device with a covered screen to display an alert in response to some event without the
25 assistance of the tablet display. In FIG. 7A flexible cover 702 is shown with a small
   cover display 704 for showing notifications such as recent emails, instant messages,
   or upcoming calendar events.       Cover display 704 can be made with AMOLED
   technology.     As stated previously, AMOLED screens can illuminate a discrete
   number of pixels which allows small amounts of text to be displayed at extremely
30 conservative power levels.      AMOLED technology has also been implemented in
   extremely thin configurations and cover display 704 would not add significant depth
   to flexible cover 702.
                                               12

   1002093922
   [0045]      FIG. 7B shows flexible cover 706 which in this particular embodiment is
   shown with displays spread across each of three panels of flexible cover 706. In this
   embodiment the displays spread across first segment 708, second segment 710, and
   third segment 712 can be made with electronic paper technology, similar to the
 5 display technology used by standalone E-reader devices. In this embodiment flexible
   electronic paper displays are not required since they are overlaid on top of the
   following rigid portions of flexible cover 706: segment 708; segment 710; and
   segment 712.      These electronic paper displays require no additional power to
   continuously hold an image on the display; therefore this allows information to be
10 displayed on the outside cover without the need for continuous electrical current.
   This allows for example the display of calendar reminder messages as shown in first
   segment 708, or reminder lists as shown in segment 710, or even a scribbled reminder
   as shown in segment 712. By installing a color electronic paper display the cover
   could even have user-configurable colors.       The electronic paper technology also
15 allows flexible cover 706, which may rely solely on an external power source, to
   continue to maintain whatever information was being displayed after the external
   power source is disconnected.
   [0046]      FIG. 7C shows yet another possible embodiment in which the electronic
   paper displays are used to cover all four segments 708 - 714 of flexible cover 706
20 with custom patterns or designs. Although a polka dotted pattern is displayed in FIG
   7C, stripes, stars, or any number of other user-created or commercially produced
   patterns are certainly possible.
   [0047]      FIG. 8 shows a perspective view of tablet device 802 supported by flexible
   cover 804 in accordance with an alternate embodiment. In this embodiment flexible
25 cover 804 does not have any of the stiffeners that were present in the previous
   embodiments.      Instead flexible cover 804 can be made of a material that is
   substantially rigid in nature but also deformable. This allows flexible cover 804 to be
   manipulated into a number of different shapes, and then for a shape to be maintained
   until further manipulation is desired. FIG. 8 shows flexible cover 804 manipulated
30 into one shape where flexible cover 804 is rigid enough to support the weight of tablet
   device 802 where one edge of flexible cover 804 and one edge of tablet device 802
   are in contact with a flat surface. It is important to note that connecting portion 806
   must also be rigid enough to maintain tablet device 802 and flexible cover 804 at a
                                               13

   1002093922
   consistent relative angle with respect to each other. One way to accomplish this is to
   add a locking mechanism to connecting portion 806 so that the hinge portion of
   connecting portion 806 can swing freely during normal operations, but also be locked
   in place when required to support tablet device 802 in a free standing configuration as
 5 illustrated. Flexible cover 804 can also include cover display 808. Cover display 808
   can include a user interface embodied by a touch sensitive input so that cover display
   808 has equivalent functionality to the tablet display (not shown).     This enables a
   number of useful applications. In one embodiment cover display 808 could be used
   as a presentation platform for a small audience. A speaker could stand behind tablet
10 device 802 with the ability to manipulate controls and view speaker notes on the tablet
   display (not shown) while the audience views a presentation (as illustrated) on cover
   display 808. In another embodiment two users could simultaneously use the tablet
   with one user manipulating each display.        This would enable robust two player
   gaming applications. By having both players on one device, lag created by network
15 latencies can be avoided.      For example, real-time action games and first-person
   shooter games can unfairly disadvantage users playing on slow networks.         With a
   direct connection or a close range communications link these type of latencies can be
   substantially eliminated. In another embodiment two users can efficiently collaborate
   on more business-centric applications.     For example, since each user can have an
20 independent view and set of controls, given an appropriate software implementation a
   single document or spreadsheet can be efficiently edited simultaneously.
   [0048]       FIG. 9 shows flow chart 900 describing interaction between a flexible
   accessory device and a host device. In step 902 a communications link is established
   between the flexible accessory device and the host device. The communication link
25 can be established through a physical connection between the two devices, or through
   a wireless protocol, and could be established in a single direction or in two ways for
   fully cooperative interaction between the devices. In step 904 information is passed
   between the two devices.      This information could include video streams, picture
   slideshows,    gaming data, messaging data, or any number of other types of
30 information. Finally, in step 906 at least some of the information passed between the
   two devices is displayed by the flexible accessory device.
   [0049]       FIG. 10 shows flow chart 1000 describing input on an accessory device
   which affects the operation of a tablet device. In step 1002 a communications link is
                                              14

   1002093922
   established between the flexible accessory device and the host device.                 The
   communication link can be established through a physical connection between the
   two devices, or through a wireless protocol, and could be established in a single
   direction or in two ways for fully cooperative interaction between the devices. In step
 5 1004 a user interface is presented by the flexible accessory device. The user interface
   could be a keyboard (virtual or physical), a customized control layout having virtual
   knobs and buttons specific to a certain application, or any other tailored control
   scheme useful for manipulating the host device or flexible accessory device. In step
   1006 a user input is received at the user interface. In step 1008 a control signal is
10 passed from the flexible accessory device to the host device. The control signal could
   operate to store items to the host device, to manipulate the host device display, or to
   accomplish any other desired change in state of the host device.
   [0050]      In the previous embodiments an accessory device has been used primarily
   as an additional control method for affecting a tablet device. In some embodiments
15 the tablet device can be used to control functionality on the accessory device. For
   example, in an embodiment including wireless communication between the devices
   an auxiliary device with a screen could be configured to display photos, while the
   tablet could be used to adjust the display speed or transitions of the slideshow.
   [0051]      FIG. 11 is a block diagram of an arrangement 1100 of functional modules
20 utilized by an electronic device. The electronic device can, for example, be tablet
   device 1100. The arrangement 1100 includes an electronic device 1102 that is able to
   output media for a user of the portable media device but also store and retrieve data
   with respect to data storage 1104. The arrangement 1100 also includes a graphical
   user interface (GUI) manager 1106.        The GUI manager 1106 operates to control
25 information being provided to and displayed on a display device. The arrangement
   1100 also includes a communication module 1108 that facilitates communication
   between the portable media device and an accessory device.               Still further, the
   arrangement 1100 includes an accessory manager 1110 that operates to authenticate
   and acquire data from an accessory device that can be coupled to the portable media
30 device.
   [0052]      FIG. 12 is a block diagram of an electronic device 1200 suitable for use
   with the described embodiments. The electronic device 1200 illustrates circuitry of a
   representative computing device. The electronic device 1200 includes a processor
                                               15

   1002093922
   1202 that pertains to a microprocessor or controller for controlling the overall
   operation of the electronic device 1200. The electronic device 1200 stores media data
   pertaining to media items in a file system 1204 and a cache 1206. The file system
   1204 is, typically, a storage disk or a plurality of disks.         The file system 1204
 5 typically provides high capacity storage capability for the electronic device 1200.
   However, since the access time to the file system 1204 is relatively slow, the
   electronic device 1200 can also include a cache 1206.            The cache 1206 is, for
   example, Random-Access Memory (RAM) provided by semiconductor memory. The
   relative access time to the cache 1206 is substantially shorter than for the file system
10 1204. However, the cache 1206 does not have the large storage capacity of the file
   system 1204. Further, the file system 1204, when active, consumes more power than
   does the cache 1206. The power consumption is often a concern when the electronic
   device 1200 is a portable media device that is powered by a battery 1208.             The
   electronic device 1200 can also include RAM 1210 and Read-Only Memory (ROM)
15 1212. The ROM 1212 can store programs, utilities or processes to be executed in a
   non-volatile manner. The RAM 1210 provides volatile data storage, such as for the
   cache 1206.
   [0053]       The electronic device 1200 also includes a user input device 1214 that
   allows a user of the electronic device 1200 to interact with the electronic device 1200.
20 For example, the user input device 1214 can take a variety of forms, such as a button,
   keypad, dial, touch screen, audio input interface, visual/image capture input interface,
   input in the form of sensor data, etc. Still further, the electronic device 1200 includes
   a display 1216 (screen display) that can be controlled by the processor 1202 to display
   information to the user. A data bus 1218 can facilitate data transfer between at least
25 the file system 1204, the cache 1206, the processor 1202, and the CODEC 1220.
   [0054]       In one embodiment, the electronic device 1200 serves to store a plurality
   of media items (e.g., songs, podcasts, etc.) in the file system 1204.        When a user
   desires to have the electronic device play a particular media item, a list of available
   media items is displayed on the display 1216. Then, using the user input device 1214,
30 a user can select one of the available media items.           The processor 1202, upon
   receiving a selection of a particular media item, supplies the media data (e.g., audio
   file) for the particular media item to a coder/decoder (CODEC) 1220. The CODEC
   1220 then produces analog output signals for a speaker 1222. The speaker 1222 can
                                               16

   1002093922
   be a speaker internal to the electronic device 1200 or external to the electronic device
   1200. For example, headphones or earphones that connect to the electronic device
   1200 would be considered an external speaker.
   [0055]       The electronic device 1200 also includes a network/bus interface 1224 that
 5 couples to a data link 1226. The data link 1226 allows the electronic device 1200 to
   communicate with a host computer or to accessory devices. The data link 1226 can
   be provided over a wired connection or a wireless connection.          In the case of a
   wireless connection, the network/bus interface         1224 can include a wireless
   transceiver. The media items (media assets) can pertain to one or more different types
10 of media content. In one embodiment, the media items are audio tracks (e.g., songs,
   audio books, and podcasts). In another embodiment, the media items are images (e.g.,
   photos). However, in other embodiments, the media items can be any combination of
   audio, graphical or visual content. Sensor 1228 can take the form of circuitry for
   detecting any number of stimuli. For example, sensor 1228 can include a Hall Effect
15 sensor responsive to external magnetic field, an audio sensor, a light sensor such as a
   photometer, and so on.
   [0056]       The various aspects, embodiments, implementations or features of the
   described embodiments can be used separately or in any combination.              Various
   aspects of the described embodiments can be implemented by software, hardware or a
20 combination of hardware and software.        The described embodiments can also be
   embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium for controlling
   manufacturing operations or as computer readable code on a computer readable
   medium for controlling a manufacturing line. The computer readable medium is any
   data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer
25 system.     Examples of the computer readable medium include read-only memory,
   random-access memory, CD-ROMs, DVDs, magnetic tape, and optical data storage
   devices.     The computer readable medium can also be distributed over network
   coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed
   in a distributed fashion.
