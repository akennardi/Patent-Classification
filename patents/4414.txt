                        "BICYCLE HANDLEBAR MOUNT"
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to a "bicycle handlebar mount assembly";
facilitating a secure platform for the provision of any cycling aid device
Background to the Invention
[0002] Bicycle riders commonly have the requirement to mount cycling aid
devise on their bicycle frame or handlebars for the recording of cycling related
data and 'the viewing of' while participating in the sport and recreation of
cycling. Bicycle handlebar cycling aid device mounts are the preferred method
of device attachment and especially beneficial when securing such devises as
GPS, communication devices, Smartphones, lights or other cycling aids. The
ideal arrangement for the mounting of these devices is so they are in full view
of the rider without the rider having to turn or lower their head in order to view
such devices, thus adverting their attention from the road/trail ahead and
compromising a safe cycling culture
Various devices have already been proposed some that utilise a single central
clamp, stem and an attached flat platform from which to attach the device in
either a fixed orientation or on a swivel (portrait or landscape orientation)
However, these styles of mounts are limited in their use as they are restricted
by having to attach them to the bicycle fore/aft top frame, or on the upper side
of the bicycle handlebar stem, and generally mandate that in order to view the
mounted device the rider must advert their attention directly downwards, as
opposed to continually looking forward (safe cycling) Other devices are
arranged on static rigid support members in front of or on top of the bicycle
handlebars and are generally specific to the one device, and once the cycling
aid device is fixed in location cannot be moved

                                         2
Various existing mounts also use the generic rounded section 15mm either
side of the central handlebar support spindle, and project their fixed cycling
aid device support beams directly outwards, (forwards) however this in turn
means the overall width of the cycling aid device mount platform is
precariously narrow, highly unstable and prone to loss of the cycling aid
device during riding. Rigidly mounted 'device supports' also pose a danger to
the rider in the event of an incident or accident as they are inflexibly fixed to
the bicycle and may puncture or wound the rider in the event of a fall
[0003] The present invention relates to a bicycle mount that also secures to
the generic rounded section 15mm either side of the central handlebar
support spindle and faces forward (away from the rider) However the novel
and inventive step associated with this application sees that the mount
incorporates a set of fully articulated Elbows, Arms and Levers that
accommodates and secures almost any size cycling aid device over a large
platform base and affords the rider an easy and custom viewing angle of that
cycling aid device regardless of size and shape of that device. Importantly
being as the cycling aid device is mounted and secured forward of the
handlebars it positions the cycling aid device in full view of the rider without
the need for the rider to dip or lower their head in order to view the cycling aid
device; affording the rider the ability to maintain continual focus on the
road/trail ahead. The mount is considered passive and does not compromise
the structure of the bicycle in order to attach the mounts to the bicycle
handlebars, nor does the mount compromise the structure of the mounted
cycling aid device in order to secure that cycling aid device to the mount. The
mount is considered crash worthy safe as the mount levers, arms, and elbows
are free to flex, bend and fold in the event of an accident, and as such do not
propose a protrusion or puncture threat to the rider's body

Summary of the Invention
[0004] According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
bicycle handlebar mount comprising:
A pair of (left side and right side) central handlebar 'Supports'
A pair of (left side and right side) 'Elbows' attached to the handlebar Support
boss
A pair of (left side and right side) 'Arms' attached to the outer Elbow boss
A pair of (left side and right side) 'Levers' attached to the outer Arm boss
Wherein the handle bar Supports locate and mount onto the generic rounded
portion of the bicycle handle bars directly adjacent to the left side and right
side of the handlebar central support spindle
The Elbow and Arms act in an articulated manner on a lateral sagittal plane
(along the length of the bicycle handlebars) as outward extension members
and in order to accommodate the correct sizing of the cycling device aid, are
full adjustable extending transversely outwards from the handlebar central
Support.
The Arm then converts in-coming articulated extension from the Elbow on the
lateral sagittal plane to vertical pivot extension of the Lever on the outgoing
plane
The Levers provide a support platform for the cycling aid device and adjust on
a vertical pivot from the lower fulcrum in order to afford the cyclist the correct
vertical angle for which to view the mounted cycling aid device
[0005] Preferably the Elbow and Arms allow for full articulate extension either
inwards or outwards from opposed sides of the handlebar central support
[0006] Preferably the Elbow is cast from a single mould and is fully reversable

                                        4
(by turning upside down) so as to be useable on either the left-side or right-side
mounts of the handlebars spindle
[0007] Preferably the Support, Elbows, Arms and Levers are provided in pairs
being left side and right side and mount on the left side and right side of the
handlebar central support spine, and form a single mount assembly
[0008] Preferably the Elbow attaches directly to the Support, the Arms attach
to the Elbows and the Levers attach to the Arm, when assembled each
separate mount comprises of x3 fully articulated members extending outwards
and upwards from opposed sides of the handlebar central support spine
[0009] Preferably the Elbow comprises the shape of an arc affording lateral
sagittal plane extension with minimal forward extension of the Arm thus
inhibiting the movement of the Arm away from the handlebars
[0010] Preferably the Supports, Elbows, Arms and Levers are curved in their
contour, rounded and smoothed to allow for safe easy handling and can be
manufactured/moulded from a variety of materials, plastics or aluminium's
[0011] Preferably each of the Levers which pivots to the vertical, is provided
with a lower relief slot and two upper outer extension probes such that an
elastomeric band may be contained so as to securely anchor the cycling aid
device to the Levers and prevent the cycling aid device becoming loose when
the Levers are pivoted to the vertical position
[0012] Preferably the Levers contain a lower 'device stop', so as to prevent the

                                         5
cycling aid device from slipping back down the Levers when raised to the
vertical position, and affording the Elastomeric band the ability to securely lock
the cycling aid device firmly into position on the front face/beam of the Levers
[0013] Preferably when mounting the cycling aid device, it will be mounted
upon the Levers and secured by the Elastomeric Bands in a Landscape
orientation along the long end of the cycling aid device axis. The Elastomeric
Bands stretch over the cycling aid device locking it to the Lever
[0014] The Lever arms pivot vertically from the lower fulcrum, independent of
the lateral sagittal plane extension of the Elbow and Arm, so the rider can
select the correct viewing angle of the cycling aid device and to minimise
frontal wind resistance of the device whilst riding
[0015] Preferably an optional Bridge Beam may be attached between the Two
Elastomeric Bands on each of the two Levers so as to increase the stability of
the Levers and maintain perfect Lever alignment while assisting with the
support of the mounted cycling aid device (user preference)
[0016] Preferably in the event of an accident the optional Bridge Beam which
is heled in position by the 'Levers' Elastomeric Bands, (only) will dislodge from
its assigned position and allow the Levers to flex, bend and fall away
independently

[0035] In the embodiment shown in Figure 8
An Elastomeric Band 5 encompasses the length of the Lever 4 and is held in
position on the Lever 4 between a lower relief slot and two upper extension
probes
[0036] In the embodiment shown in Figure 8
The Arm 3 provides a suitable method to convert the angular pivot
displacement between the incoming lateral plane and outgoing vertical plane
[0037] In the embodiment shown Figure 9
The cycling aid device is secured onto the front face of the Levers 4 by the
properties of the Elastomeric Band 5 and is further secured as it locks into two
lower 'device stops' on the front face of the Lever 4
[0038] In the embodiment shown in Figure 10
An optional Bridge Beam 13 may be fitted between the underside of the two
Elastomeric Bands 5 to act as a positioning attachment, in order to hold both
Levers 4 in place and prevent the Levers 4 from spreading while undertaking
cycling on rough or jarring road/tracks

Claims
A bicycle handlebar mount
1.      Comprising:     a series of lightweight members when arranged
        longitudinally form a left-side and right-side combination which forms
        a single mount assembly. The inclusion of the unique Elbow and Arm
        arrangement mount assembly allows for full articulated movement of
        the mount members along the lateral, sagittal plane (along the length
        of the bicycle handlebars) in order to widen or narrow the girth
        between the left-side and right-side Levers so as to accommodate any
        size cycling aid device. Uniquely the Levers pivot from the lower
        fulcrum on the vertical plane to allow for the correct viewing position
        (raising or lowering) of the cycling aid device on the vertical plane
2.      The inclusion of the unique Elbow and Arm arrangement provides a
        mechanism from which to accommodate sideways offset allowing for
        a side shift of the mounted cycling aid device, affording the device to
        be located in a position either side of the central handlebar stem while
        still allowing the left-side and right-side Supports to maintain their
        mounted position either side of the central handlebar support spindle
3.      Wherein each of the mount Supports attach to the only guaranteed
        generic rounded section of the bicycle handlebars being a generally a
        15mm section of rounded bicycle handlebar that extends either side of
        the handle bar support spindle, yet through the inclusion of the unique
        Elbow     and   Arm    mechanism      the  mount    assembly     can  still
        extend/widen to accommodate and properly support/secure any size
        cycling aid device

                                  2
4. Wherein in the event of an accident the mount through the geometry
   of the Elbow and Arm are immediately free to flex, bend and fold
   spreading sideways away from the rider so as they pose no danger of
   puncture or protrusion to the rider
5. Wherein the mount assembly is arranged on the handlebars in a
   forward-facing fashion, affording the rider the ability to view the
   mounted cycling aid device without need to lower their head and avert
   their attention away from looking forward (safe cycling)
