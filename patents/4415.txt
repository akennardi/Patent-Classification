         PREDICTION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LOCATION
                      AND BEHAVIOR INFORMATION
Background of the Present Invention
Field of Invention
     The present invention relates to an information predication system, in particular
to a prediction system and method for location and behavior information.
Description of Related Arts
     In the LBSN (Location-based Social Network) field, the acquisition of user
behavior patterns has already been concerned by vast scholars, and many study results
has been produced. Therein, scientific researchers such as Zheng Yu establish a
transition probability model based on user traveling trajectories by mining frequent
movement sequences of a user, and a next location at which the user possibly will
arrive can be better predicted. On the whole, based on behavior patterns of users, the
accuracy of predicting locations at which the users will arrive can be effectively
improved; and if the behavior patterns of users are combined with a recommendation
system, recommended services which are more compliant with living habits can be
provided for users.
     Cyclic behaviors are one type of user patterns. By mining cyclic behaviors of a
user, the rule of a certain behavior of the user in time can be effectively found. At
present, main study directions of cyclic behaviors are divided into time sequence
cycle acquisition and cyclic pattern acquisition. The former one refers to acquiring
potential cycles in time sequences through related algorithms. Typical algorithms for
acquiring time sequence cycles include cycle charts and self-correlation. When cycle
charts are solely used, acquired cycles are not accurate if the spectrum is leaked.
When self-correlation is solely used, correct cycles are not obvious due to occurrence

                                            2
of other timestamp events. Some scientific researchers use a method of combining
cycle chart with self-correlation to efficiency avoid problem that the acquired cycles
are not accurate due to spectrum leakage when the cycle charts are solely used.
     To sum up, at present, the time sequence cycle acquisition algorithm has the
problem that cycles mutually influence each other when multiple cycles of time
sequences are acquired, resulting that the final results are not accurate. In order to
mine cyclic behaviors of users, a stage of a current cycle at which a behavior of a
useroccurs needs to be accurately acquired. However, self-correlation and cycle charts
both cannot mine this type of information.
Summary of the Present Invention

     Embodiment       1 provides a prediction method for location and behavior
information and provides a prediction server for location and behavior information.
     As illustrated in FIG. 2, the prediction method for location and behavior
information is used for predicting a location at which a user will arrive by mining
cycles of user behaviors; and the location and behavior information prediction method
mainly comprises the following steps:
     In step 1, location and behavior information of a mobile client carried by a user is

                                             8
acquired.
     In step 2, the location and behavior information is classified, location and
behavior information sequences are formed.
     In step 3, different classifications of location and behavior information are put
into different sets, wherein each element in each set is randomly accessible; storage
spaces are dynamically allocated, location and behavior information in sets are
continuously updated; and judgement conditions are executed, the strength of a cyclic
relationship between the location and behavior information is evaluated and multiple
different cycles are acquired.
     In step 4, a location at which the mobile client will arrive at a future time point is
predicted according to the acquired different cycles.
     Step 1 further comprises the following operation: after location and behavior
information is acquired from a database according to a primary code, selecting
location and behavior information in a specific time period.
     Step 2 further comprises the following operations: classifying the location and
behavior information in the specific time period; and adding classification information
generated during classification into each piece of location and behavior information,
and obtaining location and behavior information sequences of different classifications.
     Step 3 further comprises the following operations: in the location and behavior
information sequences, setting a fixed relationship between locations and location
elements in the data storage structure; obtaining corresponding elements according to
the fixed relationship aiming at the location and behavior information in the location
and behavior information sequences, and putting the elements at each position in the
data storage structure according to positions; and setting a fixed relationship between
element values and cycle reliability, and traversing and judging each element in the
data storage structure to determine and save cycles with higher reliability.
     The principle of traversing the data storage structure in step 3 is as follow: there

                                            9
is a set of all different time intervals of occurrence of all specific classifications of
events, and cycles in a time sequence exist in the set. In this embodiment, the data
storage structure is selected to be a matrix since a matrix can better save this type of
information.    By creating a suspected cycle matrix, incorrect cycles can be
preliminarily removed, and based on the feature of random access of two-dimensional
arrays, the efficiency of accessing matrix elements can be more effectively improved.
Based on the feature of time sequence cycles and the basic thought of matrix storage,
a dynamic updating matrix multi-cycle acquisition algorithm is established, whether a
support degree of each suspected cycle in the matrix is greater than a support degree
threshold is judged, and when the current suspected cycle is a real cycle, the elements
in the matrix are dynamically modified to reduce the judgment times of the algorithm,
improve the execution efficiency of the algorithm and finally acquire all cyclic
behaviors in the time sequence.
     According to the actual situation that cyclic behaviors always occur at the same
time interval and the feature of random access of the matrix, firstly a matrix shown
below is established, wherein a first row and a first column are occurrence timestamps
of behaviors. Elements in the matrix are differences between column timestamps and
row timestamps.
     The matrix is a matrix which actually processes the multi-cycle behaviors and
contains real cyclic behaviors and non-real cyclic behaviors, wherein the support
degree of occurrence of each real cyclic behavior is greater than the support degree
threshold set for the algorithm, as shown by formula 1:
                  reaity-happened-time(x)- > threshold-value     Formula 1
                   theory-happened-time(x)
     where reality happened-time (x) represents actual occurrence times of a cycle,
and theory happenedtime(x) represents theoretical occurrence times. In the matrix,
the line number of each element is the timestamp of occurrence for the first time and
the value of the element is the size of the cycle of the cyclic behavior. Since cyclic
behaviors occur at fixed cycles, the theoretical occurrence timestamps can be obtained

                                              10
through the occurrence start time and the size of the cycle, and occurrence times
thereof are statistically collected. The theoretical occurrence timestamps are ranked
from small to large. If two continuous timestamps can be hit in the matrix when the
first one is used as a row and the second one is used as a column, it is denoted as
actual occurrence, and the total hitting times are actual occurrence times which
correspond to reality happened time(x) in formula 1.
     As illustrated in FIG. 4, the time sequence multi-cycle acquisition process in the
present invention mainly comprises the following steps:
     In step 1, this method simulates occurrence sequence of states in time sequences
of the same classification (relationship between timestamp classifications and rows or
columns) by using the feature that row/column numbers of the matrix gradually
increase.
     In    step  2,  time    intervals  between    any   timestamps    are  simulated   by
correspondingly subtracting columns from rows.
     In step 3, after a set containing all time intervals is obtained in a suspected cycle
matrix, the entire matrix is started to be traversed and row numbers of elements
greater than zero are stored as suspected cycles.
     In step 4, timestamps are obtained according to current obtained suspected cycles
and then theoretical occurrence times are obtained.
     In step 5, the theoretical occurrence timestamps are ranked from large to small, if
every two continuous timestamps can be hit in the matrix when the first one is used as
a row and the second one is used as a column, it is denoted as actual occurrence for
the first time, and total hitting times are actual occurrence times.
     In step 6, the actual occurrence times (obtained through statistics) are divided by
the theoretical occurrence times to obtain an actual occurrence support degree, the
actual occurrence support degree is compared with a threshold, if the actual
occurrence support degree is greater than the threshold, the suspected cycle is a real

                                             11
cycle; and if the actual occurrence support degree is smaller than the threshold, cyclic
traversing is performed again.
     In step 7, after the real cycle is stored, this position is made zero, and after the
matrix is dynamically updated, the updated matrix is cyclically traversed.
     In step 8, all element values which are screened out are output as the size of
accurate cycles and the row numbers of the elements are output as first-time
occurrence time.
     As illustrated in FIG. 1, embodiment 2 provides a recording method for user
location and behavior information, used for recording current location and behavior
information of a user; and sending the current location and behavior information to
other receivers.
     The user location recording method comprises the following steps:
     In step 1, a location recording module acquires current location and behavior
information.
     In step 2, the location recording module sends the acquired current location and
behavior information to an information sending module.
     In step 3, the information sending module sends the current location and behavior

classification of behavior nodes.
     In the prior art, main study directions of cyclic behaviors are divided into time
sequence cycle acquisition and cyclic pattern acquisition. The former one refers to
acquiring potential cycles in time sequences through related algorithms. Typical
algorithms    for   acquiring   time    sequence    cycles   include   cycle   charts and
self-correlation. When cycle charts are solely used, a situation that acquired cycles are
not accurate due to spectrum leakage. When self-correlation is solely used, correct
cycles are not obvious due to occurrence of other timestamp events. Some scientific
researchers use a cycle chart and self-correlation combination method such that the
problem that the acquired cycles are not accurate due to spectrum leakage when the
cycle charts are solely used can be efficiency avoided.
     To sum up, the time sequence cycle acquisition algorithm has the problem that
cycles mutually influence each other when multiple cycles of time sequences are
acquired, resulting that final results are not accurate. In order to mine cyclic behaviors
of users, a stage of a current cycle at which a behavior of a user occurs needs to be

                                            17
accurately acquired. However, self-correlation and cycle charts both cannot mine this
type of information. As compared with the traditional methods of using cycle charts,
using self-correlation and using both cycle charts and self-correlation in a combined
manner, the location and behavior information prediction system and method
provided by the present invention can effectively avoid the adverse influences of
cycle length difference and the influence of random fluctuation on acquired cycle
accuracy, simultaneously reduce the mutual interference between different cycles
during acquisition of multiple cycles, can more accurately acquire multi-cycle
behaviors in time sequences and solve the problem that the acquired cycles in the
traditional methods are not obvious; by mining cyclic behaviors of users, the rule of a
certain behavior of a user in time can be effectively found and technical effects can be
produced in combination with a recommendation system; the present invention
screens out more accurate cycle information by randomly traversing the data storage
structure and making judgments instead of finding potential cycles or time sequence
cycles, and thereby the adverse influence of the spectrum leakage problem on the
cycle acquisition process is reduced; the present invention simultaneously can acquire
occurrence time points of cyclic behaviors and thereby solve the problem that the
cycle charts and self-correlation cannot be used for predicting the occurrence time
points of cyclic behaviors of users; and the present invention can accurately acquire a
stage of a current period at which a behavior of a user occurs by traversing the data
structure and making judgments, determine judgment conditions in each traversing
process by using parameters such as time and repetitive occurrence times, and thereby
mine accurate cycle information which cannot be mined through the traditional
self-correlation and cycle charts.
