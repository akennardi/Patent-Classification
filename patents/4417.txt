                    PRODUCTION TUBING FLOW DIVERSION VALVE
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0001]      The present invention relates to a flow diversion apparatus. In particular, the
 invention relates, but is not limited, to a flow diversion valve for use with one or more
 submersible pumps in hydrocarbon producing wells to enable fluid within tubing
 positioned above the pumps to flow into the tubing annulus when pump operation
 ceases or there is a backflow of fluid down through the tubing.
                             BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
 [0002]      Reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an admission
that such art constitutes common general knowledge.
 [0003]      In the extraction of hydrocarbon resources from beneath the earth's surface
it is often necessary to overcome a low or negative pressure differential between the
pressure of the hydrocarbon fluids in the reservoir por6s and the hydrostatic head of
that fluid in wells penetrating the reservoir from the surface. This is often achieved using
a submersible pump that adds energy to a fluid to increase its flow rate and static
pressure. Typical submersible pumps either employ downhole motors, such as
electrical submersible pumps, or alternatively surface motors, such as reciprocating
pumps and rotary progressive cavity pumps (PCP). Reciprocating and rotary pump
types are activated by a rod string that is installed inside the production tubing.
[0004]       In some embodiments, the pump is directly in line with the production tubing.
When the pump shuts down, either planned or unplanned, fluid may flow back down the
tubing and into the outflow port of the pump. This may occur until the level of fluid in the
tubing equals that in the tubing annulus surrounding the tubing. In other situations, the
pressure within the tube may increase, pushing fluid back down the tubing and into the
pump. Whatever the cause, a reverse flow of fluid into the pump can cause mechanical
damage. For example, the fluid may possibly cause spinning of the pump in reverse.

                                               -2
  The downward flow through the pump will also bring any solids entrained in the fluid
  back into the pump. Should this occur, the solids settle and pack in impellers and
  bearings and become impregnated in exposed elastomers, causing damage to the
  pump on later restarting, or cause the pump to seize completely if the torque required to
  turn the solids-laden pump exceeds the torque capacity of the drive motor. Also, at
 times, the tubing string or the pump can pack off or plug after a shut down. This may
  prevent flow back down the tubing. If the tubing does not drain, the operator may then
 have to bail out the production fluid before pulling the pump and tubing. Bailing involves
 running a bailer on a wireline repeatedly down into the tubing, taking time. This
 downtime can result in lost production and increased expenses for workmen and
 materials. Preventing solids from falling back into the pump is therefore desirable to
 prolong pump run life and reduce frequency of costly workovers.
 [0005]       One prior art approach is described in US Pat. No. 6,289,990 awarded to
 D.B. Dillon et al, entitled "Production Tubing Shunt Valve", which describes apparatus
 and methods for preventing solids from falling back into electrical submersible pumps.
 However, the apparatus claimed does not include a passageway for a rod string
through the centre of the Production Tubing Shunt Valve needed to operate and protect
the progressive cavity pumps.
[0006]           Another prior art approach is described in US Pat. No. 8,545,190 awarded
to Lawrence Osborne, which describes a shunt valve device that can be used with
progressive cavity pumps, but which does not incorporate means for disassembly of the
valve to replace damaged or worn parts and thus has a limited run life. Moreover, with
ready means for disassembly, typically the potential for the valve to fail during use,
particularly due to the torque induced along a flow string, is increased.
                                OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0007]       It is an aim of this invention to provide a flow diversion (valve) apparatus
which overcomes or ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages or problems
described above, or which at least provides a useful alternative.

                                               -3
  [0008]      By way of example only, one objective of the present invention is to prevent
  or divert the buildup of solids in downhole submersible pumps, including progressive
  cavity pumps. Alternatively, or additionally, an objective of the present invention is to
  provide a flow diversion valve that can be fully cleaned, inspected and redressed
  between workovers to replace worn seals, fatigued closure mechanisms and corroded
 or eroded parts, and which is fluidly connected to the submersible pump, wherein the
 flow diversion valve automatically diverts hydrocarbons or other fluids and any
 entrained solids present in the production string above the pump away from the
 submersible pump outlet when pump operation is shutdown.
 [0009]      A further potential objective for the flow diversion valve actuator mechanism
 is to be resistant to abrasion by solids entrained in the fluid, reduce permanent pressure
 loss resulting from upward flow of the fluid past the actuator and include a means to
 enable the actuator mechanism to be retrieved using conventional fishing equipment
 should the rod string passing through the actuator become parted from the flow
 diversion valve.
 [0010]      Yet another potential objective is to provide a valve shuttle, actuator, etc.,
within the flow diversion valve contained within a multi-part housing.
 [0011]      Other preferred objects of the present invention are apparent from the
following description.

according to an embodiment of the invention, with a pump 104 connected to a flow
diversion valve 108. The flow diversion valve 108 (hereinafter termed "diversion valve")
is interconnected with the pump 104 via a pump outlet 106. The pump 104 is in the form
of a progressive cavity pump (PCP) and includes a pump inlet 102. The diversion valve
 108 includes a valve outlet 110 and a valve spill port 112. In various embodiments, the
 inlets, outlets and ports are one or more of a fitting, flange, pipe, or similar fluid

                                           - 13
conveyance. In the preferred embodiment, the submersible pump 104 is located below
the diversion valve 108.
 [0060]     Figure 2A shows a section of a typical well 200A. A flow management
system 100A in the well 200A includes a diversion valve 108A interposed between the
 PCP 104 and production tubing 204. In some embodiments, a casing 208 surrounds
one or more joints of the production tubing 204, diversion valve 108A, and PCP 104.
 Here, an annulus 206 is formed between the production tubing 204 and the casing 208.
A production flow is indicated by an arrow 102 while a backflow is indicated by an arrow
202. The diversion valve 108A of this disclosure serves to isolate backflows from one
or more valves, portions of a valve, and the PCP 104.
[0061]     Figure 2B shows a further well 200B. Similar to Figure 2A, Figure 2B
shows a flow management system 100B with a diversion valve 108B interposed
between the PCP 104 and production tubing 204. In comparison to the flow
management system 100A, the flow management system 100B includes production
tubing 204 having a blast joint 205 above the diversion valve 108B. The blast joint 205
is discussed further below along with differences between the diversion valves 108A,
108B.
[0062]     Figures 3A to 3D show an embodiment of the diversion valve 108A in the
form of diversion valve 300A. The diversion valve 300A includes a valve body 324
comprising an upper housing 302 and a lower housing 303. The upper and lower
housings 302, 303 of the diversion valve 300A are connected with threads 304 shown
in Figures 3A and 38. The threads 304 in this embodiment are left-handed threads.
This use of screw threads with left-handedness assists in preventing the threads 304
from backing off as a consequence of torque induced through the diversion valve 300A
by the operation of the pump 104.
[0063]     Separate threads exist on the connection 321 at top of upper housing 302.
These threads can be of a female configuration on the interior surface of connection
321. These threads at the top of the upper housing 321 are compatible with the threads

                                             - 14
 of the production tubing 204. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B, the connection between
 the production tubing 204 and upper housing 302 includes a torque ring 322. The
 torque ring 322 is situated adjacent an end of the production tubing 204 and next to the
 threads on the interior surface of the connection 321. The torque ring 322 is made from
 a rubber and assists in, amongst other things, increasing torsion capacity of the
 connection 321.
 [0064]     The threads 320 at the bottom of the lower housing 303 may be compatible
 with threads located at the top of the PCP 104 assembly (see Figure 2A). It will be
 appreciated that the threads will be of the same spacing and one thread segment will
 be of a female connection and the other segment will be of a male connection. This
 compatibility will eliminate the need for any special crossover pup joints above or below
 the flow diversion valve 300A, thereby simplifying installation and reducing costs.
 Furthermore, as appreciated from above, the connection between the lower housing
 303 and PCP 104 may also include a torque ring 322.
 [0065]     The valve body 324, accommodates components including a shuttle 337, an
 actuator 383, and a closing spring 312. In a further embodiment, the diversion valve
 300A may include a shock absorbing spring (not shown) connected to the upper side of
the actuator 383. It will be recalled that the actuator 383 can traverse up the rotatable
 rod 382, which is typically polished, under the influence of upward fluid flow 390.
 [0066]     Turning to Figure 3C, the flow diversion valve 300 includes a releasable
locking member in the form of anti-rotation screws 305A. The anti-rotation screws 305A
include an aperture in the form of a socket that receives a rotating tool (e.g. a hex key).
The anti-rotation screws 305 respectively engage a locking aperture in the form of
groove 306A in the lower housing 303. The combination of the anti-rotation screws
305A and groove 306A prevent the threaded connection 304 from backing off as a
consequence of torque induced through the diversion valve 300A by the operation of
the submersible PCP 104 located below the diversion valve 300A. See Figure 2A. In
other embodiments, the valve body 324 may have a clam shell like construction
wherein one side of the upper and lower housing 302, 303 of the valve body 324 is

                                           - 15
 connected by a hinge like device and the other side detachably closed by an anti
 rotation screw 305A, horizontal latch device, etc. The valve body 324 may also
 comprise more than two detachable sections.
 [0067]     Whenever the PCP 104 and other equipment above it is retrieved from the
 well 200A, the upper housing 302 can be separated from the lower housing 303 by first
 removing the anti-rotation screws 305A and then unscrewing threads 304. The
 connecting surfaces of the upper and lower housing 302, 303 may contain seals and
 seats holding the seals in position. Suitable seal materials can include silicone rubber,
 elastomers, thermoplastic elastomers, and metals that are soft in comparison to the
 valve body 324, the selection depending, among other things, on the valve application.
 In an embodiment, the seals are made from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
 [0068]     On separation of the two housings 302, 303 the shuttle 337 and closing
 spring 312 can be removed, dismantled, cleaned and inspected, with any worn,
fatigued, corroded or eroded parts replaced. The diversion valve 300A can then be
 reassembled and re-used, thereby extending run life of the valve 300A. This use of a
threaded connection 304 and anti-rotation screws 305A eliminates the need to instead
weld the upper housing 302 to the lower housing 303, which makes it impossible to
subsequently dismantle and redress the device, preventing re-use if any of the internal
 parts are damaged.
 [0069]     The valve body 324 has a central chamber 323. There is also a rotatable rod
382 that extends from the surface down the inside of the production tubing 204. The
rotatable rod 382 passes through the central chamber 323 of the diversion valve 300A.
The shuttle 337 is positioned within the valve body 324. The shuttle 337 includes an
upper section 340, a centre sleeve 342 and a lower section 341. As shown in one
figuration of Figure 3A, the upper section 340 blocks the spill ports 316. The upper
section 340 would be in this position when the fluid flow is upward 390.
[0070]      Upper and lower seals 314, 330 are fitted circumferentially to the centre
sleeve 342 of the shuttle 337. In one embodiment, the seals have a curved cross-

                                             -16
 section such as a circular cross-section. In another embodiment, the seals have a
 rectangular cross-section (as shown in Figure 3A).
 [0071]      In some embodiments, one or more seals 314, 330 have a structure 400
 similar to that shown in Figure 4. Here, a seal body 402 such as a polymeric body, has
 inner and outer lip seals 406, 404 and substantially envelops a charge O-ring or
energizing spring 408 such as a silicon rubber ring, or metal spring. In various
embodiments, the seals 314, 330 are made from one or more of a rubber, plastic,
 metal, or another suitable material known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. For
example, seal materials include silicone rubber, elastomers, thermoplastic elastomers,
and metals that are soft in comparison to the valve body 324, the selection depending
on, among other things, the valve application. In an embodiment, the seals are made
from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
 [0072]      The shuttle and actuator 337, 383, have through-holes 356, 357 (i.e. a bore).
The rotatable rod 382 pass through the through-holes 356, 357. As outlined above,
there is typically a chrome-plated or similar polished surface included on the rotatable
rod 382. A purpose of the chrome-plated polished rod is to limit the friction acting on
the through hole 357 of the actuator inner sleeve 388, as it traverses along the rotatable
rod 382.
[0073]       A first face of the valve shuttle in the form of a first seat 368 is for sealing
against a first (conical) seat closure 367 of the actuator 383. In an embodiment, the first
seat 368 is near an upper end of the upper section 340 of the shuttle 337 and the first
seat closure 367 is near a lower end of the actuator 383. In some embodiments, the
first seat 368 is about radially oriented with respect to the valve body centre line 301. In
various embodiments, the shuttle sealing face (i.e. first seat 368) is integral with or
coupled to the shuttle 337. And, in various embodiments, the first seat closure 367 (i.e.
the actuator sealing face) is integral with or coupled to the actuator 383.
[0074]       The design of actuator 383 may have a conical or tapered lower section to
reduce permanent pressure loss resulting from upward flow of fluid around it.

                                             - 17
  Furthermore, the upper section or surface of the actuator 383 is conical to reduce
  erosion of the actuator 383 by particle impingement of any solids entrained in back
  flowing fluid. In a preferred embodiment, the apex angles of the upper and lower conical
  sections are different.
  [0075]      In the embodiment shown in Figure 3A and 3B, the actuator 383 has a
  conical lower sealing face 367 to reduce permanent pressure loss resulting from
  upward flow of fluid around it. The upper surface of the actuator 383 also has a conical
 shape. In further embodiments, the taper of the upper surface of the actuator 383 may
 be shallower, relative to the conical sealing face 367, and have a greater length to
 reduce turbulence in the upward flow.
 [0076]       The actuator 383 may further comprise threaded components. This is shown
 in the further embodiment of actuator 500 in Figure 5. The upper and lower threaded
 components (or shells) are shown as items 501 and 502. See also Figures 6 and 7.
 The threaded components allow the actuator 383, 500, 600, 700 to be disassembled.
As discussed below, a ferrite material may be placed within the interior of the actuator
 383, 500, 600, 700. This ferro-magnetic material may facilitate recovery of the actuator
 in the event that the rotating rod 382 breaks.
[0077]       A second face (or portion) in the form of second seat 317, on the upper
section 340 of shuttle 337, is for sealing against a face of the valve body 324 above the
spill ports 316. The face of the valve body 324 is in the form of valve shuttle seat 318. In
an embodiment, the valve shuttle seat 318 is near an upper section of the upper
housing 302 of valve body 324. In some embodiments, the valve shuttle seat 318 is
about radially oriented with respect to the valve body centreline 301. In various
embodiments, the second seat 317 of the shuttle 337 is integral with or coupled to the
shuttle 337. And, in various embodiments, the valve shuttle seat 318 is integral with or
coupled to the valve body 324.
[0078]       As indicated above, radially arranged and located on the upper housing 302
of valve body 324 are one or more spill ports 316. Each spill port 316 extends between

                                                - 18
  inner and outer walls 371, 372 of the valve body 324. The inner wall 371 of the valve
  body 324 tapers inwardly towards the valve shuttle seat 318.
  [0079]      Inducing upward movement of the shuttle 337 is the closing spring 312. In
 various embodiments, the closing spring 312 is seated about radially oriented with
 respect to the valve body centreline 301 and is seated on a valve body support 313. In
 the embodiment shown in Figure 3A and 3B, an upper end of the closing spring 315
 presses against an underside of a lower section 341 of the shuttle 337. This lower
 section 342 is known as the shuttle spring end.
 [0080]       It will be appreciated that it will be important for the area or diameter of the
 annulus 323 be as wide as feasible to facilitate production flow.
 [0081]       In the embodiments shown, the spring 312 is positioned in close proximity to
 the interior wall of the valve body 324. In further embodiments, an outer edge of the
 cylindrical coil spring 312 may be in contact with the interior surface. The spring 312 is
 not positioned or supported with an interior partition. This configuration is utilized in part
to maximize the radial space or annulus, 323, 356 between the rotating rod 382 and the
 interior of the valve wall.
 [0082]       Similarly, the shuttle 340 is constructed so the seat of the widely positioned
spring 312 (having a wide radius) and shuttle spring end 341, also having a maximum
radius, meet at or proximate to their interior edges 315. This meeting of components
having wide radii provides maximum diameter to the annulus containing fluid. In further
embodiments, the outer surface of the shuttle 340 may be in contact with at least a
portion of the valve body 324 interior surface. The outer surface of the shuttle 340 and
spring 312 may be coated with a non-friction, high temperature resistant substance
such as Molykote available from Dow Corning. This is a bonding, dry-film lubricant
typically containing MoS2 graphite or PTFE.
[0083]        The resulting widened space within the valve body 324 can decrease the
flow resistance for the pump 104, thereby increasing the pump life. It also decreases

                                                 -19
  the erosion potential of solids-laden fluid through the diversion valve 300, thereby
  minimizing wear of the components of the diversion valve 300.
  [0084]        Operation of the diversion valve 300A includes rotation of the rotatable rod
  382 which is normally the means of operating the PCP 104. In normal operation, forces
 on the shuttle 337 and actuator 383 determine their position. When the PCP 104 is
 lifting fluid within the tubing and within a designed flow-rate range 390, the shuttle 337
 rises to its uppermost position 394 under the influence of the closing spring 312 and the
 rising fluid lifts the actuator 383 free of the shuttle 337 to a higher position 384 on the
 rotatable shaft 382. Notably, in its uppermost position, the shuttle 337 blocks the spill
 ports 316 when the second seat 317 seals with the valve shuttle seat 318. Furthermore,
 the actuator 383 typically leaves the valve body 324 under the influence of the lifting
 fluid. This is shown in Figure 3A. In addition, the actuator 383 may be stopped along
 the rotating rod 382, above the valve body 324, with the coupling 210. The coupling 210
 includes an inner metal body with a thread that connects the rotatable rod 382 with
 additional rods extending from the surface. An outer plastic covering with centralizing
 vanes, which maybe spiral, also surrounds the inner metal body of the coupling 210.
 [0085]        It will be appreciated that the fluids and any entrained solids discharged from
the submersible pump 104 flows through the bore of the diversion valve lower housing
303 and shuttle 337 which is blocking the spill ports 316. The fluids emerge through the
aperture at the top of the upper housing 302 and continue up into the production tubing
above.
[0086]        When the PCP 104 ceases to lift fluid at a sufficient rate, as with back-flow
391, the actuator 383 falls to contact the shuttle 337. This causes the actuator sealing
face 367 to seal with the first seat 368 of the shuttle 337. Further, if the force P22
resulting from the pressure above the first seat 368 overcomes the force of the closing
spring 312 and the force resulting from the pressure below the actuator 383, the shuttle
337 is pushed down to position 396 and the spill port(s) 316 are unblocked allowing
fluid in the tubing above the valve 300A to spill outside the valve 300A, for example into
the annular space between the production tubing 204 and the casing 206.

                                                -20
  [0087]      It will be appreciated that the interior radius of the upper housing 371 may be
  larger than the internal radius of the housing including the cylindrical shape of the
  shuttle 337. Further the external radius of the shuttle 337 is greater than the radius of
 the first seat 367 (or seal) of the actuator 383. This size differentiation results in the
 configuration of the actuator 383 seating against the first seat 368 of the shuttle 337
 and allows the spill ports 316 to open.
 [0088]      From the above, it can be seen that insufficient fluid flow, no fluid flow, or
 reverse fluid flow causes the valve 300A and PCP 104 to be removed from the fluid
 circuit and/or isolated from the fluid column above the shuttle 337. A benefit of this
 isolation is protection of the valve 300A and PCP 104. One protection afforded is
 protection of valve 300A and pump 104 components from solids, normally rising with
 the fluid but now moving toward the valve 300A and PCP 104, that might otherwise foul
 or block one or both of the valve 300A or pump 104. Blocking the flow path around the
 shuttle 337 and opening the spill ports 316 removes these solids outside the valve
 300A.
 [0089]      Figure 3D illustrates an exterior view of the flow diversion valve 300A.
Shown are the screw threads 320 connecting the diversion valve 300A to the PCP 104.
Also shown are the spill ports 316 and the upper section 340 of the shuttle 337. Also
shown are the anti-rotation screws 305A.
[0090]       Figure 5 shows one embodiment of the actuator 500 comprising an upper
metal shell 501 and a lower metal shell 502 encapsulating a non-metallic inner sleeve
503. The metal shells 501, 502 are treated using processes such as electroless nickel
plating or quench polish quench (QPQ) liquid nitriding to confer improved corrosion and
surface hardness. The improved surface hardness boosts abrasion resistance from
impingement of solids entrained in the fluids passing around the actuator 500 (or 383).
The use of a non-metallic material for the inner sleeve 503 ensures the actuator 500 will
not seize on the rotating rod 382. For downhole applications thermoplastics such as
polyether ether ketone (PEEK), or ceramics, are ideally suited for non-metallic parts as

                                               - 21
  they are mechanically and chemically stable at prevailing in-situ conditions, and can be
  used with injection moulds. The actuator 500 is assembled by sandwiching the sleeve
  503 between the upper and lower metal sleeves 501, 502 and screwing these two parts
  together. The advantage of this split shell design is that it enables the inner sleeve 503
 to be fabricated in a separate injection mould or machined from raw stock materials,
 greatly simplifying overall construction of the actuator 500, and enables parts to be
 independently replaced if worn or damaged, rather than having to replace the entire
 assembly, thereby reducing costs. The shape of the actuator 500 is depicted in a cross
 sectional view. The shape can be described as a double conical shape or cross
 sectionally as a rhomboid, being a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal
 lengths and angles are not right angles.
 [0091]      In the eventuality that the rotating rod 382 parts, twists, deforms or separates
 below the diversion valve 300A, the rotating rod 382 above the break is pulled from the
well, causing the actuator 383 to rest against the shuttle 337. The oblique positioning of
 the actuator within the valve body 324 greatly hinders recovery of the remaining section
 of the rotating rod in the well that is attached to the rotor located in the submersible
 pump 104.
 [0092]     Figure 6 shows an alternative actuator 600 embodiment which also
encompasses an upper and lower metal shell 601, 602, an inner non-metallic sleeve
603 and also includes a magnetic ring 604. This ring 604 is made from a ferromagnetic
material, such as alnico or samarium cobalt, that can be suitably plated or coated
(examples: nickel plated, epoxy coated, parylene coated) to confer additional corrosion
resistance.
[0093]      Using the magnetic properties of the magnetic ring 604, the actuator 600 can
then be retrieved using a skirted and bar fishing magnet that can be deployed on
slickline inside the production tubing. The strong magnetic attraction between the bar
magnet and the ferromagnetic ring 604 in the actuator 600 overcomes gravitational pull
and viscous drag on the actuator 600, enabling it to be retrieved to the surface.

                                             -22
  [0094]      Successful retrieval of the actuator 600 then provides access for standard
  fishing equipment to retrieve the remaining part of the rotating rod 382 left in the well
  that will be attached to the PCP rotor located inside PCP 104. The PCP rotor can then
  be re-deployed on a new rotating rod string 382, thereby avoiding a costly well
 workover, involving mobilisation of a drilling or workover rig, to retrieve the production
 tubing 204 and PCP 104.
  [0095]      Figure 7 shows yet another embodiment of an actuator 700 that has a spring
 shock absorber 705 on top. This is positioned over the rotatable rod 382 that passes
 through the centre of the actuator 700 and flow diversion valve 300A. The rotatable rod
 382 comprises multiple individual rods (including the polished rod) that are screwed
 together with the coupling 210, which has a larger diameter than the rod body. When
 the actuator 700 moves up the rod string 382 under the action of flow moving around it,
 there is potential for the actuator 700 to impact the rod coupling 210, imparting a high
 impulse force, otherwise known as shock load. Repeated impacts can obviously lead to
 mechanical fatigue of either the actuator 700, rod coupling 210, or both. The purpose of
 the spring shock absorber 705 is to absorb and dampen the shock impulse, thereby
 extending run life of the actuator 700 and rotatable rod 382.
 [0096]      The actuator embodiments shown in Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7 may
have rhomboid geometries top and bottom. This tapered profile has the benefit of
limiting extent of turbulent eddies created in the fluid as it flows through the annular
restriction around the actuator, thereby reducing energy dissipation. This will in turn
reduce permanent pressure loss, also referred to as irreversible pressure loss. The
tapered geometries of the upper and lower metal shells will therefore also provide the
additional benefit of limiting impact on head efficiency created by the PCP 104.
[0097]       It should be evident to those skilled in the art that the designs shown in
actuator embodiments Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7 can be combined to provide an
actuator than has a top shock absorber but no internal ferromagnetic ring

                                            -23
   [0098]     Figures 8A to 8C show an embodiment of the diversion valve 108B in the
  form of diversion valve 300B. The diversion valve 300B is substantially the same as
  diversion valve 300A and, therefore, like numbering has been used. However, the
  diversions valve 300B includes the following notable differences.
  [0099]     As further shown in Figure 8B, the diversion valve 300B includes a locking
  member having a locking body 305B that is substantially rectangular. The locking body
  305B includes two apertures therethrough. A locking aperture 306B in the form of two
  threaded holes is located in the lower housing 303. The locking aperture 306B extends
  outward to form a ledge in the lower housing 303. The locking body 305B is received
  between the ledge and the upper housing 302. Two fasteners 307B extend through the
 two apertures of the locking body 305B and are connected to the two threaded holes to
  releasably connect the locking member to the valve body 324. Multiple locking
 members are equally spaced around the valve body 324. In a preferred embodiment
 four locking members are incorporated. When the locking members are in place, they
 assist in preventing the threaded connection 304 from backing off as a consequence of
 torque induced through the flow diversion valve 300B during assembly of the flow
 diversion valve 300B with the submersible pump 104 and the production tubing 204,
 during operation of the submersible pump 104 and during removal of the flow diversion
 valve 300B from between the submersible pump 104 and production tubing 204.
 [0100]      In comparison to the flow management system 100A, the production tubing
 204 of the flow management system 100B, above the diversion valve 300B, includes a
 blast joint 205. The blast joint 205 has an inner diameter that is the same as the
 standard tubing used in the production tubing 204 thereabove. However, the blast joint
 includes a greater wall thickness relative to standard tubing. In this regard, the
production tubing is a reinforced tube that connects directly to the diversion valve 300B.
The blast joint 205, by virtue of having a greater wall thickness, can withstand greater
wear caused by any potential rubbing between the actuator 383 and the inner wall of
the blast joint 205.

  337 and actuator 383, the opening and closing of the spill ports 316 in the diversion
 valve 300B is the same as diversion valve 300A.
