                   Description Organic electronics chips (Oechi)
The focus is on sensors for detection, data storage and memory based on organic entities for soft
robotic. This leads to the utilization of sustainable 'Living' organic electronic based around the
surrounding ecosystem (Humans-Robots-Organic). That is, to move to the use of organic chips as
an alternative to silicon chips and still met the performance levels expected. These nested entities
might have 'self-healing' capabilities to repair damaged logic gates and Firmware. As an enabler, a
mapping process was required to identify unique 'Depletion region' surrounding P-N junction in
organic    entities. To do this a systems engineering approach was              used to develop the
conceptualisation of ecosystem (organic-flora) sensors-to-devices options based on environmental
Biorheology. This 'natural' ecosystem narrative dives the use of organic-flora as living organic
power (visible light; infrared; ultraviolet; piezo). What therefore can be highlighted are options
related to the use of 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) for power scavengers, sensors and devices.
These Oechi's may additionally (depending on configuration) assist in developing organic data

                                  Claims Organic electronics chips (Oechi)
                                                              I. METHOD
    To use the ecosystem fibre's for sustainable power there is a need to resolve the incomplete electrical information [33]. A
scientific method (e.g. Observations, Hypothesis; Testing, Conclusions; Retesting) was utilized [32].
A. Concept
    Using a sample of 'vegetation ecosystem entity logic gate' (VEELG), and connectors (1.5cm apart) electrical measurements
(Multimeter) were taken (Fig. 3) (Appendix 'A'). Reading's sequence was Stage 1: place the negative probe on the top connector
and positive probe on the bottom connector and take readings. Stage 2: reverse the negative and positive positions and take
readings. Stage 3: map a VEELG within a possible 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) grid of a selected single entity within the
natural organic ecosystem [38].
B. Diode operation
    A diode (passive device) appears to have a direct relationship to voltage and power consumed, which may be:
    "   Positive (p-type: current flow above a specific voltage (ON: short circuit): current positive; voltage 0).
    "   Negative (n-type: mostly no current flow (OFF: open circuit): current 0; voltage negative) [34] [35].
    Diode biases is required to be noted as it can be 'reverse bias' (negative to p-type; positive to n-type: charge attracted away) and
'forward bias' (positive to p-type; negative to n-type: charge merge) [36].
C. Diode matrix to logicpattern
    Diode matrix arrays are important as they have traditionally assisted in technologies such as microprocessors to static memory
logic gate Truth Tables [09] [10] [11]. The outcomes desired is a clear and concise plan of the pattern of the logic system that is
currently in place. Secondly, to have a simplistic algorithm, unique switch, and pathway for use. Thirdly, to find any viable organic
logic gates (e.g. NOT; AND; OR) and 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) in the testing cycle [37].
D. Types of logic gates and pattern
    Logic gates may be able to be repurposed as a quantum logic gates. The controlled logic gates (quantum) could assist with the
development of inorganic-organic 'Internet-of-Things' (JOT) devices (Attachment 'B') [12] [30] [31].
                                                                II. DATA
    The data reading obtained (Appendix 'A') from plants (Organic: Electrorheological fluids) provides an electrical profile for
each of the samples taken. It is proposed that 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) readings are the 'Check values' as current flows
are only in one direction, but are likely to convert current (AC to DC). What was detected has indicated that voltage only flow
when a specific minimum voltage occurs. There were reversions occurring as the probe changed positions suggesting repurposing
options [6] [38] [33].
A. Electricalprofile data
Within Appendix 'A' is shown the Multimeter (RadioShack) readings obtained. What is emphasised is that the voltages reversals
occurred and that the results were consistent and suggested a 'vegetation ecosystem entity logic gate' (VEELG) and 'Organic
electronic chips' (Oechi) was operating. Plausibly the commonality is likely related to the fluid flow that appears axisymmetric
within unique tubular structures under gradient of pressure that might be considered constant [28]. The data analysis (Appendix
'A' and 'B') suggests plausibility to the existence and use of organic logic gates for possible detection and micro power
harvesting for micro devices (inclusive of 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi)).
                                                          III. CONCLUSIONS
    Overall the sample taken indicates an 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) has an OFF (open circuit) no current flow (zero);
voltage across terminals [341 [351 [361. The data further suggests micro-power 'system-in-package' (SiP) communications sensors
might be supported if more research is undertaken to identify power adjustments (e.g. series; parallel) and circuit combination [70].

Furthermore it appears that the proposed Hypothesis is plausibility: 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) may assist with sustainable
base power loads for micro sensors and micro stand-alone recharging'.
     In a catastrophic event the organic 'vegetation ecosystem entity logic gates' (VEELG's) setup procedure is likely to be enabled
via a 'Biorheological Backup Voltaic Pile' (B2RVP). This should be a 'plug-and play', hot swap architecture and to be locally
sourced from the flora or debris. The outcome required is VEELG-B2RVP emergency power response intervention and
countermeasure tools as 'anywhere--anytime--anyplace--anydevice--anycomms--anyentity' (A6). This should be coupled with
'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) OFF (open circuit) no current flow (zero; negative in data); voltage across terminals and
Reverse Bias (negative (to P-type) and positive (to N-type)).
     Within a harmonised 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) ecosystem the desired outcome is to have vegetation ecosystem (flora)
based recharging by not collapsing the viability of the bio-host in the ecosystem. Secondly, not to damage the battery or equipment
or living unique Firmware, Middleware and Software algorithm's within a changing ecosystem. Thirdly to promote cohabitation of
'human sustainment systems' (HSS) with 'biological sustainment systems' (BSS) with organic-inorganic erasable and
programmable 'Read Only Memory' (ROM) versions (Appendix 'A' and 'B'). That is there is a broadening of the ecosystems
(HSS-BSS-Robots) and inclusion within the 'Internet of Things' (IOT).
     Research is needed into if 'Organic electronic chips' (Oechi) p-n junction depletion zone may have an existing (organic; flora)
'artificial intelligence' (AI) capability than can be utilized (Appendix 'A'). As such, a unique Quantum 'Controlled' AND gate
(CAND) in organic entities might be enabled and organic quantum computing (Appendix 'B').
Any future research is initially focused on decryption of the unique living Firmware, Middleware and Software algorithm's under
control conditions within a Faraday cage. The validation and testing needs to focus on detection of organism imposed changes to
the initially programed gates. In an IOT extrapolation it may lead to an inclusive multiple delivery engine security ecosystem
(machine-organic Active sensing using 'Active perception of motion' (APMs)). Cyber security protection to mitigate system
hacking of the Firmware, Middleware and Software is a must [12] [30] [31] [50] [75].
