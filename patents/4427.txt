    Description
    A touch switch for a control device of an electric and/or elec
    tronic apparatus
 5  The present invention relates to a touch switch for a control
    device of an electric and/or electronic apparatus. Further, the
    present invention relates to a control device for an electric
    and/or electronic apparatus. Moreover, the present invention re
    lates to an electric and/or electronic apparatus, in particular
 0  a domestic appliance.
    An example of a touch switch includes a metal sheet detecting
    the force applied by the finger of the user onto a button of
    said touch switch. The touch switch may include a piezo element
 5  for measuring the pressure of the finger. Such a touch switch
    includes mechanical components being usually liable to wear. An
    other example of the touch switch comprises a metal part elec
    trically isolated from the rest of the front panel. However, it
    is relative expensive and difficult to isolate these metal part
 !0 form the rest of the front panel.
    It is an object of the present invention to provide a touch
    switch for a control device of an electric and/or electronic ap
    paratus, wherein the touch switch is realized by low complexity.
25
    The object of the present invention is achieved by the touch
    switch according to claim 1.
    The present invention relates to a touch switch for a control
30  device of an electric and/or electronic apparatus, wherein said
    touch switch comprises:
    -    a layer made of an electrically non-conductive material or
         material composition,
                                    1

      WO 20151007437                                    PCT/EP2014/062323
    -    a touch sensor arranged at a bottom side or rear side of the
         non conductive layer,
    -    a metallic layer arranged at a top side or front side, re
         spectively, of the non conductive layer, and
 5  -    a cut-out formed in the metallic layer and arranged at the
         non conductive layer opposite to the touch sensor, wherein
    -    the metallic layer is connected to a ground connection.
    The main idea of the touch switch according to the present in
 o  vention is the metallic layer with the cut-out above or in front
    of the touch sensor on the one hand and the connection of the
    metallic layer to the ground connection on the other hand. Fur
    ther, the     layer made of the electrically non-conductive materi
    al is arranged below or behind the cut-out. The connection of
 ,5 the metallic layer to the ground connection allows that the fin
    ger of the user and the metallic layer have the same electric
    potential, since usually the human body of the user is directly
    or indirectly connected to the ground connection. The cut-out
    may be formed as a symbol and/or an alphanumeric sign. The layer
 .0 made of an electrically non-conductive material can be a trans
    parent layer or a non-transparent layer or a layer having a de
    fined opacity.
    Preferably, the metallic layer is formed as a single-piece part.
25  The metallic layer formed as single-piece part allows a low com
    plexity and requires only one connecting line to the ground con
    nection.
    Further, (optional) at least one light source element is ar
30  ranged below or behind, respectively, the touch sensor and/or
    the, preferably transparent, layer extends within and/or below
    the cut out. Since the light source element is arranged below or
    behind the cut-out and the non conductive layer, the touch
    switch can be illuminated independent of the operation by the
                                       2

      WO 20151007437                                 PCT/EP2014/062323
    user. In particular, when an transparent layer is used, its
    structure colour may be different from the front panel. Thus,
    the user of the appliance knows intuitively where to put his
    finger(s) to active the switch.
 5
    Moreover, the touch sensor is at least partially transparent for
    the light from the light source element. The partially or com
    pletely transparent touch sensor makes a contribution to the in
    dependent illumination of the touch switch.
 0
    According to one embodiment of the present invention, the touch
    sensor is a capacitive sensor and includes at least two elec
    trodes. In this case, both electrodes of the capacitor are ar
    ranged below or behind, respectively, the non conductive layer.
 .5
    According to another embodiment of the present invention, the
    touch sensor is a part of a capacitive sensor and forms a first
    electrode, wherein the metallic layer forms a second electrode.
    In this case, the electrodes of the capacitor are arranged at
 .0 both side of the non conductive layer.
    According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the
    touch sensor is an inductive sensor and includes at least one
    coil.
25
    In another example of the present invention, the touch sensor is
    an optical sensor.
    In a similar way, the touch sensor may be an infrared sensor.
30
    In general, the touch sensor works with an electromagnetic field
    and/or electromagnetic radiation, since the non conductive layer
    and the cut-out are permeable for electromagnetic fields and/or
    electromagnetic radiation.

    Moreover, the touch switch may comprise at least one identifica
    tion mark indicating the area, which has to be touched by the
    user in order to actuate the touch switch.
 5
    Further, the present invention relates to a control device for
    an electric and/or electronic apparatus including at least one
    touch switch, wherein the control device includes at least one
    touch switch mentioned above.
 0
    In particular, the control device includes a number of touch
    switches, wherein at least a part of said touch switches com
    prises a common metallic layer formed as a single-piece part.
 ,5 Furthermore, the control device may comprise a number of identi
    fication marks indicating the areas, which have to be touched by
    the user in order to actuate the corresponding touch switch.
    At last, the present invention relates to an electric and/or
 .0 electronic apparatus, particular a domestic appliance, wherein
    the electric and/or electronic apparatus includes at least one
    touch switch and/or at least one control device mentioned above.
    Further features, embodiments and advantages of the present in
25  vention are set forth in the appended claims.
    The present invention will be described in further detail with
    reference to the drawings, in which

              switches of a control device according to the preferred
             embodiment of the present invention.
    FIG 1 illustrates a schematic sectional side view of a touch
 0  switch 10 according to a preferred embodiment of the present in
    vention. The touch switch 10 may form a part of a control device
    of an electric and/or electronic apparatus. For example, the
    touch switch 10 and/or the control device are provided for a do
    mestic appliance.
 .5
    The touch switch 10 comprises a touch sensor 12, a non conduc
    tive layer 14 and a metallic layer 16. The non conductive layer
    14 is made of an electrically non-conductive material. The touch
    sensor 12 is arranged at a bottom side or at a rear side of the
 .0 non conductive layer 14.     The metallic layer 16 is arranged at a
    top side or a front side of the transparent or non transparent
    layer 14.     In FIG 1 the non conductive layer 14 and the metallic
    layer 16 extend in a horizontal plane, so that the touch sensor
    12 is arranged at the bottom side and the metallic layer 16 is
25  arranged at the top side of the non conductive layer 14. In an
    other embodiment the non conductive layer 14 and the metallic
    layer 16 may extend in a vertical plane, so that the touch sen
    sor 12 would be arranged at the rear side and the metallic layer
    16 at the front side of the non conductive layer 14.
30
    The metallic layer 16 includes a cut-out 18 arranged opposite to
    the touch sensor 12.     The cut-out 18 may be optionally filled
    with a transparent or not transparent but non conductive materi
    al in order to obtain a smooth surface on the outer side or
                                        5

       WO 20151007437                                 PCT/EP2014/062323
    front side of the metallic layer 14. Further, a light source el
    ement 20 may be optionally arranged below or behind the touch
    sensor 12. For example, the light source element 20 is a bulb or
    a light emitting diode  (LED).
 5
    The metallic layer 16 is connected to a first ground connection
    22. Above the cut-out 18 a finger 24 of a user is shown. Since
    the human body of the user is usually connected to the floor,
    the finger 24 is factually connected to a second ground connec
 0  tion 26. The connection of the metallic layer to the first
    ground connection 22 allows that the finger 24 of the user and
    the metallic layer 16 have the same electric potential.
    The touch sensor 12 reacts to the finger 24,  if said finger 24
 ,5 is close to the touch sensor 12. For example, the touch sensor
    12 may be a capacitive or an inductive sensor. In general, the
    touch sensor 12 changes its physical and/or electric properties,
    when the finger 24 approaches said touch sensor 12. The touch
    sensor 12 is transparent or partially transparent or non trans
 .0 parent, so that the light from the light source element 20 can
    pass the touch sensor 12,  the non conductive layer 14 and as the
    case may be the transparent material within the cut-out 18.
    Thus, the light from the light source element 20 can shine to
    the top side or front side of the touch switch 10, while the
25  touch sensor 12 is able to detect the presence of the finger 24.
    For example, the touch sensor 12 may be a capacitive sensor and
    includes two or more electrodes, wherein said electrodes of the
    capacitor are arranged below or behind, respectively, the non
30  conductive layer 14.
    In another example, the touch sensor 12 may be a part of a ca
    pacitive sensor and forms a first electrode, wherein the metal
    lic layer forms a second electrode. In this case, the electrodes
                                     6

      WO 20151007437                                 PCT/EP2014/062323
    of the capacitor are arranged at both sides of the non conduc
    tive layer 14.
    Further, the touch sensor 12 may be an inductive sensor, an op
 5  tical sensor or an infrared sensor.
    In general, the touch sensor 12 works with an electromagnetic
    field and/or electromagnetic radiation. The non conductive layer
    14 and the cut-out 18 are permeable for electromagnetic fields
 0  and/or electromagnetic radiation.
    FIG 2 illustrates a schematic top view of the touch switch 10
    according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
 ,5 The touch switch 10 includes the touch sensor 12 and a first
    cut-out 28. In this example, the first cut-out 28 is formed as a
    plus sign. The touch sensor 12 is arranged at the bottom side or
    rear side, respectively, of the non conductive layer 14. The
    first cut-out 28 is formed in the metallic layer 16,  so that
 .0 there is no metal inside, above and upon said first cut-out 28.
    Thus, an electric field of the touch sensor 12 can pass through
    the non conductive layer 14 and the first cut-out 28 in the me
    tallic layer 16. The touch sensor 12 is able to detect the prox
    imity of the finger 24, even if said finger 24 touches the me
25  tallic layer 16 around the first cut-out 28. The first cut-out
    28 may be optionally filled with the transparent or intranspar
    ant but non-conductive material in order to obtain the smooth
    surface on the outer side or front side, respectively, of the
    metallic layer 14.
30
    For example, the conductive material of the touch sensor 12 is
    made of copper. The ratio between the cut out 18 of the metalic
    layer and the touch sensor 12 should be such the touch system is
    able to detect the presence of the finger by measuring the in

    sensor system that

 5  neighboured touch switches 10 of a control device according to
    the preferred embodiment of the present invention.
    The control device comprises at least two neighboured touch
    switches 10. Each touch switch 10 includes a touch sensor 12.
 o  The touch switch 10 on the right hand side includes the first
    cut-out 28. In a similar way, the touch switch 10 on the left
    hand side includes a second cut-out 30. The first cut-out 28 is
    formed as the plus sign, while the second cut-out 30 is form as
    a minus sign. Further, the control device comprises three iden
 .5 tification marks 32 indicating the areas, which have to be
    touched by the user in order to actuate the touch switches 10 on
    the left hand side and right hand side, respectively. In this
    example, the identification marks 32 are boundary lines. The
    identification marks 32 may be made by laser cutting.
 .0
    The touch switch 10 according to the present invention has the
    advantage that the metallic layer 16 of the whole control device
    can be formed as a single-piece part. There is no need for any
    insulating elements on the front side of the touch switch 10 and
25  control device.
