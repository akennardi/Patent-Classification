                                                ORAL CARE IMPLEMENT
                                                     BACKGROUND
   [0001] A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the
 5 tooth surfaces.                 Conventional toothbrushes having a flat bristle trim are limited in their
   ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas
   between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line.
   Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the
   teeth.       During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of
10 bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the
   dentifrice is often spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact
   of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.
   [0002] While substantial efforts have been made to modify the cleaning elements of
   toothbrushes to improve the efficiency of the oral cleaning process, the industry continues
15 to pursue arrangements of cleaning elements that will improve upon the existing
   technology.                In typical oral care implements, bristles having circular transverse cross
   sectional profiles are bundled together in a bristle tuft and mounted within tuft holes
   having circular transverse cross-sectional profiles. However, such a configuration results
   in gaps being present between adjacent bristles in the tuft and between the bristles of the
20 tuft and the walls of the tuft holes, thereby resulting in a looser packing of the tuft hole and
   a less than optimal packing factor. These gaps can also reduce the effectiveness of the oral
   care implement and can cause the oral care implement to effectuate an uncomfortable
   feeling during brushing. Therefore, a need exists for an oral care implement having an
   improved arrangement of bristles.
25                                                 BRIEF SUMMARY
   [0003] The present invention is directed to an oral care implement that includes a handle

   by a continuous wall of bristles. The conical tuft has an inner surface that defines a cavity.
30 The cavity has a transverse cross-sectional area that increases with distance from the front
   surface of the head. A central cleaning element may also be located within the cavity. The
   conical tuft may have an annular top surface that undulates in height relative to the front

 5 Accordingly,                the invention expressly     should not be limited to such exemplary
   embodiments illustrating some possible non-limiting combination of features that may
   exist alone or in other combinations of features; the scope of the invention being defined
   by the claims appended hereto.
   [0022] As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every
10 value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus
   of the range. In addition, all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in
   their entireties. In the event of a conflict in a definition in the present disclosure and that
   of a cited reference, the present disclosure controls.
   [0023] Referring first to FIGS. 1-3 concurrently, an oral care implement 100 is illustrated
15 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.                       In the exemplified
   embodiment, the oral care implement 100 is in the form of a manual toothbrush. However,
   in certain other embodiments the oral care implement 100 can take on other forms such as
   being a powered toothbrush, a tongue scraper, a gum and soft tissue cleanser, a water pick,
   an interdental device, a tooth polisher, a specially designed ansate implement having tooth
20 engaging elements or any other type of implement that is commonly used for oral care.
   Thus, it is to be understood that the inventive concepts discussed herein can be applied to
   any type of oral care implement unless a specific type of oral care implement is specified
   in the claims.
   [0024] The oral care implement extends from a proximal end 101 to a distal end 102 along
25 a longitudinal axis A-A. The oral care implement 100 generally comprises a head 110 and
   a handle 120. The handle 120 is an elongated structure that provides the mechanism by
   which the user can hold and manipulate the oral care implement 100 during use. In the
   exemplified embodiment, the handle 120 is generically depicted having various contours
   for user comfort.                 Of course, the invention is not to be limited by the specific shape
30 illustrated for the handle 120 in all embodiments and in certain other embodiments the
   handle 120 can take on a wide variety of shapes, contours, and configurations, none of
   which are limiting of the present invention unless so specified in the claims.
   [0025] In the exemplified embodiment, the handle 120 is formed of a rigid plastic
   material, such as for example without limitation polymers and copolymers of ethylene,
                                                             4
   9050105_1 (GHMatters) P103699.PCT

   propylene, butadiene, vinyl compounds, and polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate.
   Of course, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and the handle 120 may
   include a resilient material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer, as a grip cover that is
   molded over portions of or the entirety of the handle 120 to enhance the gripability of the
 5 handle 120 during use. For example, portions of the handle 120 that are typically gripped
   by a user's palm during use may be overmolded with a thermoplastic elastomer or other
   resilient material to further increase comfort to a user. Furthermore, materials other than
   those noted above can be used including metal, wood or any other desired material that has
   sufficient structural rigidity to permit a user to grip the handle 120 and manipulate the oral
10 care implement 100 during toothbrushing.
   [0026] The head 110 of the oral care implement 100 is coupled to the handle 120 and
   comprises a front surface 111 and an opposing rear surface 112.                    In the exemplified
   embodiment, the head 110 is formed integrally with the handle 120 as a single unitary
   structure using a molding, milling, machining, or other suitable process.                However, in
15 other embodiments the handle 120 and the head 110 may be formed as separate
   components which are operably connected at a later stage of the manufacturing process by
   any suitable technique known in the art, including without limitation thermal or ultrasonic
   welding, a tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, threaded engagement, adhesion, or
   fasteners. Thus the head 110 may, in certain embodiments, be formed of any of the rigid
20 plastic materials described above as being used for forming the handle 120, although the
   invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and other materials that are commonly
   used during toothbrush head manufacture may also be used.
   [0027] The oral care implement 100 also comprises a plurality of tooth cleaning elements
   115 extending from the front surface 111 of the head 110. The details of certain ones of
25 the plurality of tooth cleaning elements 115 will be discussed below, including specific
   details with regard to structure, pattern, orientation, and material of such tooth cleaning
   elements 115.                  However, where it does not conflict with the other disclosure provided
   herein, it should be appreciated that the term "tooth cleaning elements" may be used in a
   generic sense to refer to any structure that can be used to clean, polish, or wipe the teeth
30 and/or soft oral tissue (e.g. tongue, cheek, gums, etc.) through relative surface contact.
   Common examples of "tooth cleaning elements" include, without limitation, bristle tufts,
   filament bristles, fiber bristles, nylon bristles, spiral bristles, rubber bristles, elastomeric
   protrusions,              flexible polymer    protrusions, combinations    thereof and/or   structures
   containing such materials or combinations. Thus, any combination of these tooth cleaning
                                                            5
   9050105_1 (GHMatters) P103699.PCT

   elements may be used within the tooth cleaning elements 115 in some embodiments.
   However, as described herein below, in certain embodiments one or more of the tooth
   cleaning elements 115 may be formed as tufts of bristles.
   [0028] In embodiments that use elastomeric elements as one or more of the tooth cleaning
 5 elements 115, suitable elastomeric materials may include any biocompatible resilient
   material suitable for uses in an oral hygiene apparatus. To provide optimum comfort as
   well as cleaning benefits, the elastomeric material of any such tooth or soft tissue engaging
   elements may have a hardness property in the range of A8 to A25 Shore hardness. One
   suitable elastomeric material is styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS)
10 manufactured                  by  GLS     Corporation.    Nevertheless,  SEBS   material  from    other
   manufacturers or other materials within and outside the noted hardness range could be
   used.
   [0029] Referring to FIGS. 1-7 concurrently, one manner in which the tooth cleaning
   elements 115 are secured to the head 110 will be described.                       Specifically, in the
15 exemplified embodiment the tooth cleaning elements 115 are formed as a cleaning element
   assembly on a head plate 140 such that one or more of the tooth cleaning elements 115 are
   mounted onto the head plate 140 and then the head plate 140 is coupled to the head 110.
   In such an embodiment, the head plate 140 is a separate and distinct component from the
   head 110 of the oral care implement 100. However, the head plate 140 is connected to the
20 head 110 at a later stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in
   the art, including without limitation thermal or ultrasonic welding, any fusion techniques
   such as thermal fusion, melting, a tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, threaded
   engagement, adhesion, or fasteners.                   Thus, the head plate 140 and the head 110 are
   separately formed components that are secured together during manufacture of the oral
25 care implement 100.
   [0030] In certain embodiments, the head plate 140 may comprise a plurality of holes 141
   formed therethrough, and the tooth cleaning elements 115 may be mounted to the head
   plate 140 within the holes 141. This type of technique for mounting the tooth cleaning
   elements 115 to the head 110 via the head plate 140 is generally known as anchor free
30 tufting (AFT).                 Specifically, in AFT a plate or membrane (i.e., the head plate 140) is
   created separately from the head 110. The tooth cleaning elements 115 (such as bristles,
   elastomeric elements, and combinations thereof) are positioned into the head plate 140 so
   as to extend through the holes 141 of the head plate 140.                  The free ends of the tooth
   cleaning elements 115 on one side of the head plate 140 perform the cleaning function.
                                                             6
   9050105_1 (GHMatters) P103699.PCT

   The ends of the tooth cleaning elements 115 on the other side of the head plate 140 are
   melted together by heat to be anchored in place. As the tooth cleaning elements 105 are
   melted together, a melt matte 106 is formed. After the tooth cleaning elements 115 are
   secured to the head plate 140, the head plate 140 is secured to the head 110 such as by
 5 ultrasonic welding. When the head plate 140 is coupled to the head 110, the melt matte
   106 is located between a lower surface 142 of the head plate 140 and a floor 107 of a basin
   108 of the head 110 in which the head plate 140 is disposed. The melt matte 106, which is
   coupled directly to and in fact forms a part of the tooth cleaning elements 115, prevents the
   tooth cleaning elements 115 from being pulled through the holes 141 in the head plate 140
10 thus ensuring that the tooth cleaning elements 105 remain attached to the head plate 140
   during use of the oral care implement 100.
   [0031] Of course, techniques other than AFT can be used for mounting the tooth cleaning
   elements 115 to the head 110, such as widely known and used stapling techniques or the
   like.       In such embodiments the head plate 140 may be omitted and the tooth cleaning
15 elements 115 may be coupled directly to the head 110. Furthermore, in a modified version
   of the AFT process discussed above, the head plate 140 may be formed by positioning the
   tooth cleaning elements 115 within a mold, and then molding the head plate 140 around
   the tooth cleaning elements 115 via an injection molding process.
   [0032] Although                   described herein  above    with regard   to using   AFT, in certain
20 embodiments any suitable form of cleaning elements and attachment may be used in the
   broad practice of this invention.                 Specifically, the tooth cleaning elements 115 of the
   present invention can be connected to the head 110 in any manner known in the art. For
   example, staples/anchors or in-mold tufting (IMT) could be used to mount the cleaning
   elements/tooth engaging elements. In certain embodiments, the invention can be practiced
25 with various combinations of stapled, IMT or AFT bristles.                      Alternatively, the tooth
   cleaning elements 115 could be mounted to tuft blocks or sections by extending through
   suitable openings in the tuft blocks so that the base of the tooth cleaning elements 115 is
   mounted within or below the tuft block.
   [0033] Although not illustrated herein, in certain embodiments the head 110 may also
30 include a soft tissue cleanser coupled to or positioned on its rear surface 112. An example
   of a suitable soft tissue cleanser that may be used with the present invention and positioned
   on the rear surface of the head 110 is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,143,462, issued
   December 5, 2006 to the assignee of the present application, the entirety of which is
   hereby incorporated by reference. In certain other embodiments, the soft tissue cleanser
                                                              7
   9050105_1 (GHMatters) P103699.PCT

   may include protuberances, which can take the form of elongated ridges, nubs, or
   combinations thereof. Of course, the invention is not to be so limited and in certain
   embodiments the oral care implement 100 may not include any soft tissue cleanser.
   [0034] With continued reference to FIGS. 1-7, the oral care implement 100, and
 5 specifically the tooth cleaning elements 115 of the oral care implement 100, will be further
   described.             In the exemplified embodiment, the plurality of tooth cleaning elements 115
   comprises a conical tuft 130. The conical tuft 130 is a tuft or grouping of bristles that are
   arranged together into a tuft and then secured into a single tuft hole within the head 110 (or
   within the head plate 140). The conical tuft 130 is described herein as being conical due to
10 the conical tuft 130 having a conical shape. More specifically, as can best be seen in FIG.
   6, the conical tuft 130 is in the shape of a truncated cone wherein the portion of the conical
   tuft 130 that is positioned within the head 110 is the truncated (i.e., cut off) portion of the
   cone such that the conical tuft 130 is in the shape of an inverted truncated cone.
   [0035] The conical tuft 130 comprises a continuous bristle wall 135 having an inner
15 surface 131 and an outer surface 136. The inner surface 131 of the continuous bristle wall
   135 of the conical tuft 130 defines a cavity 132 that extends along a cavity axis C-C. The
   conical tuft 130 extends in a 360" manner about the cavity axis C-C. The cavity 132 of the
   conical tuft 130 has an open top end and is bounded by the inner surface 131 of the
   continuous bristle wall 135 and by the front surface 111 of the head 110. As noted above,
20 the conical tuft 130 in the exemplified embodiment is formed by a plurality of bristles.
   Specifically, in the exemplified embodiment the plurality of bristles are clumped together
   and positioned collectively into a single tuft hole so that the plurality of bristles
   collectively form the conical tuft 130 having no gaps in the continuous bristle wall 135 for
   its entire 3600 extension about the cavity axis C-C. Thus, the term continuous bristle wall
25 135 is intended to mean that the conical tuft 130 is a single tuft of bristles that are clumped
   together into a single tuft hole in a non-spaced apart manner.
   [0036] Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the conical tuft 130 is a single bristle tuft
   formed from a plurality of individual bristles that are positioned together within a single
   tuft hole. As a result, the conical tuft 130 has the continuous bristle wall 135 that extends
30 without discontinuity about the cavity axis C-C.            Thus, in the exemplified embodiment
   there are no gaps formed into the outer surface 136 of the conical tuft 130. Of course, in
   other embodiments the conical tuft 130 may have small gaps therein as desired while still
   being a single tuft positioned within a single tuft hole. Such gaps in the bristle wall may
   prevent dentifrice from being trapped within the cavity 132 of the conical tuft 130 by
                                                        8

   providing means of egress from the cavity 132. In such embodiments, the bristle wall 135
   of the conical tuft 130 may not be continuous.
   [0037] Due to the conical shape of the conical tuft 130, and more specifically, the inverted
   conical shape of the conical tuft 130, the cavity 132 of the conical tuft 130 has a transverse
 5 cross-sectional area that increases with distance from the front surface 111 of the head 110.
   Specifically, the transverse cross-sectional area of the cavity 132 of the conical tuft 130
   only increases and never decreases with distance from the front surface 111 of the head
   110. Thus, the greater the distance between a particular axial location within the cavity
   132 of the conical tuft 130 and the front surface 111 of the head 110, the greater the
10 transverse cross-sectional area of the cavity 132 at that particular axial location.
   [0038] In addition to the conical tuft 130, in the exemplified embodiment the oral care
   implement 100 comprises a central cleaning element 150 that is located within the cavity
   132 of the conical tuft 130.         Thus, the conical tuft 130 surrounds the central cleaning
   element 150. Of course, the central cleaning element 150 may be omitted in certain other
15 embodiments if desired.           However, using the conical tuft 130 in conjunction with the
   central cleaning element 150 may enhance cleaning by enabling the conical tuft 130 to
   surround a user's tooth while the central cleaning element 150 cleans in the interproximal
   areas and the spaces between the teeth and gums.           In the exemplified embodiment, the
   central cleaning element 150 is a bristle tuft, although the invention is not to be so limited
20 in all embodiments and in certain other embodiments the central cleaning element 150 may
   be an elastomeric element or the like as discussed above.             Furthermore, the central
   cleaning element 150 may be formed with tapered bristles, rounded/non-tapered bristles,
   spiral bristles, or combinations thereof.          As discussed above, in the exemplified
   embodiment the conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 are secured to the
25 head 110 by anchor free tufting. Specifically, the ends of the bristles that form the conical
   tuft 130 and the ends of the bristles that form the central cleaning element 150 are melted
   together to form at least a portion of the melt matte 106 as discussed above.
   [0039] In the exemplified embodiment the conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning
   element 150 extend from a single tuft hole 134. Of course, the invention is not to be so
30 limited in all embodiments and in certain other embodiments the conical tuft 130 and the
   central cleaning element 150 may extend from different tuft holes that are spaced apart
   from one another such that the tuft hole of the conical tuft 130 may substantially (or
   concentrically) surround the tuft hole of the central cleaning element 150. Furthermore, in
   the exemplified embodiment the central cleaning element 150 and the conical tuft 130
                                                    9

   extend substantially the same distance from the front surface 111 of the head 110. Of
   course, the invention is not to be so limited and in certain other embodiments the central
   cleaning element 150 may have a height that is greater than a height of the conical tuft 130
   or the conical tuft 130 may have a height that is greater than the height of the central
 5 cleaning element 150.
   [0040] In the exemplified embodiment, the central cleaning element 150 is aligned along
   the cavity axis C-C and the central cleaning element 150 is circumferentially spaced apart
   from the inner surface 131 of the conical tuft 130 by an annular gap 133.             In the
   exemplified embodiment, the central cleaning element 150 is centrally positioned within
10 the cavity 132. However, due to the conical shape of the conical tuft 130, the width of the
   annular gap 133 increases with distance from the front surface 111 of the head 110. Thus,
   the width of the annular gap 133 (or the distance between the inner surface 131 of the
   conical tuft 130 and the outer surface of the central cleaning element 150) is greater at the
   terminal ends or cleaning ends of the conical tuft 130 and central cleaning element 150
15 than at the front surface 111 of the head 110.
   [0041] The conical tuft 130 circumferentially surrounds the central cleaning element 150
   in a spaced apart manner for at least the portion of the conical tuft 130 and the central
   cleaning element 150 that extend above the front surface 111 of the head 110. However,
   as best seen in FIGS. 4 and 6, the central cleaning element 150 converges with the
20 continuous bristle wall 135 of the conical tuft 130 at a position that is below the front
   surface 111 of the head 110. Specifically, the central cleaning element 150 and the conical
   tuft 130 converge into contact with one another at a location below the front surface 111 of
   the head 110 to form the melt matte 106 as discussed above.
   [0042] Thus, the annular gap 133 formed between the inner surface 131 of the conical tuft
25 130 and the central cleaning element 150 extends to below the front surface 111 of the
   head 110. Stated another way, the annular gap 133 exists between the inner surface 131 of
   the conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 for the entire portion of the
   conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 that extends from or protrudes
   beyond the front surface 111 of the head 110. Due to the annular gap 133 extending to
30 below the front surface 111 of the head 110, independent movement of the conical tuft 130
   and the central cleaning element 150 is enhanced or improved. Specifically, because the
   conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 converges at the very bottom portion
   of those bristle tufts, the conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 are spaced
   apart along their lengths to enable independent movement thereof. This better enables the
                                                  10

   conical tuft 130 to surround a user's teeth individually during tooth brushing due to the
   increased flexibility of the conical tuft 130.
   [0043] The head 110 extends along a longitudinal axis B-B along its length.             In the
   exemplified embodiment, the conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 are
 5 aligned on the longitudinal axis. Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment the conical
   tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 are also aligned along a transverse axis that
   is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis B-B and that divides the head 110 into two equal
   halves. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning
   element 150 are centrally located on the head 110. Of course, in other embodiments the
10 conical tuft 130 and the central cleaning element 150 can be positioned at other located on
   the head 110 as desired.
   [0044] The plurality of tooth cleaning elements 115 also include a plurality of arcuate
   cleaning elements 170a-d that are arranged in a spaced apart manner about a loop L that
   surrounds the conical tuft 130. In the exemplified embodiment, the plurality of arcuate
15 cleaning elements 170a-d are depicted as tufts of bristles.        However, the plurality of
   arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d can be formed from an elastomeric material in other
   embodiments as desired. Furthermore, the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d
   are positioned adjacent to the conical tuft 130 such that there are no other cleaning element
   structures intervening in the spaces between the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements
20  170a-d and the conical tuft 130. Thus, each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements
   170a-d is positioned adjacent to the conical tuft 130 in a spaced apart manner such that the
   space between the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d and the conical tuft 130 is
   devoid of cleaning elements.
   [0045] The loop L is a reference loop that is delineated in dotted lines in FIG. 2 for
25 reference. The loop L has a center point CP that is located along the cavity axis C-C. The
   center point CP is also the point of intersection between the longitudinal axis B-B and the
   transverse axis discussed above that divides the head 110 into two equal halves. Thus, the
   loop L and the conical tuft 130 are arranged concentrically about the cavity axis C-C with
   the loop L having a greater diameter than the conical tuft 130. The plurality of arcuate
30 cleaning elements 170a-d include a first arcuate cleaning element 170a, a second arcuate
   cleaning element 170b, a third arcuate cleaning element 170c, and a fourth arcuate
   cleaning element 170d. The first arcuate cleaning element 170a is positioned adjacent to
   and spaced apart from each of the second and fourth arcuate cleaning elements 170b, 170d.
   The second arcuate cleaning element 170b is positioned adjacent to and spaced apart from
                                                  11
   9050105_1 (GHMatters) P1 03699.PCT

   each of the first and third arcuate cleaning elements 170a, 170c. The third arcuate cleaning
   element 170c is positioned adjacent to and spaced apart from each of the second and fourth
   arcuate cleaning elements 170b, 170d.          The fourth arcuate cleaning element 170d is
   positioned adjacent to and spaced apart from each of the first and third arcuate cleaning
 5 elements 170a, 170c.
   [0046] Each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d is an elongated bristle
   wall. Specifically, the first and third arcuate cleaning elements 170a, c are elongated in a
   direction transverse to the longitudinal axis B-B of the head 110 and the second and fourth
   arcuate cleaning elements 170b, d are elongated in a direction parallel to the longitudinal
10 axis B-B. Each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d is formed from a
   plurality of individual bristles that are arranged together into a single tuft hole to form the
   elongated bristle wall. In certain embodiments each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning
   elements 170a-d extends from a separate single tuft hole and the conical tuft 130 extends
   from a separate single tuft hole.      Thus, each of the arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d
15 extends from a different tuft hole than each of the other arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d
   and from the conical tuft 130. Each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d
   includes a concave surface 171 and an opposing convex surface 172. Furthermore, in the
   exemplified embodiment the concave surfaces 171 of each of the plurality of arcuate
   cleaning elements 170a-d is facing or positioned adjacent to the conical tuft 130 and the
20 convex surface 172 of each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d is facing
   away from or is non-adjacent to the conical tuft 130. In some embodiments the radius of
   curvature of the concave surfaces 171 of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d
   is the same as that of the conical tuft 130.
   [0047] Referring briefly to FIGS. 4 and 6, the outer surface 136 of the conical tuft 130
25 forms a first acute angle 01 with the front surface 111 of the head 110. Furthermore, the
   convex surface 172 of each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d (which
   also forms the outer surface of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d) forms a
   second acute angle 02 with the front surface 111 of the head 110. In certain embodiments,
   the first acute angle 01 is different from the second acute angle 02. Furthermore, in some
30 embodiments the second acute angle 02 is greater than the first acute angle 01.             For
   example, in one embodiment the first acute angle 81 is between 80' and 85", more
   specifically between 830 and 840, and still more specifically approximately 83.5.        In one
   embodiment the second acute angle 02 is between 850 and 89', more specifically between
   87' and 880, and still more specifically approximately 87.50.

   [0048] The conical tuft 130 is spaced apart from each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning
   elements 170a-d by a gap.                      Furthermore, because in the exemplified embodiment the
   second angle              02    is greater than the first angle 01, the gap between the outer surface 136 of
   the conical tuft 130 and the inner or concave surfaces 171 of each of the plurality of
 5 arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d decreases with distance from the front surface 111 of the
   head 110. Specifically, because the conical tuft 130 is oriented at a greater angle relative
   to the front surface 111 of the head 110 than the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements
   170a-d, the conical tuft 130 becomes closer to each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning
   elements 170a-d the further away the conical tuft 130 and the plurality of arcuate cleaning
10 elements 170a-d are from the front surface 111 of the head 110. Stated another way, the
   outer surface 136 of the conical tuft 130 is spaced apart from the concave surfaces 171 of
   each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d by a first distance D1 at the front
   surface 111 of the head 110. The outer surface 136 of the conical tufts 130 is spaced apart
   from the concave surfaces 171 of each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d
15 by a second distance D2 at the terminal or free ends of the conical tuft 130 and of the
   plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d. Furthermore, the first distance D, is greater
   than the second distance D2 . Thus, even though both the conical tuft 130 and the plurality
   of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d are oriented at an angle relative to the front surface
   111 of the head 110, the conical tuft 130 leans outwardly away from the cavity axis C-C
20 and towards each of the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d.
   [0049] As noted above, in the exemplified embodiment the ends of the bristles are melted
   together to form the melt matte 106 that becomes trapped between the lower surface 142 of
   the head plate 140 and the floor 107 of the basin 108 within which the head plate 140 is
   positioned.              This melt matte 106 includes melted ends of all of the different bristles
25 discussed herein. Thus, ends of each of the conical tuft 130 and the plurality of arcuate
   cleaning elements 170a-d are melted together to form a portion of the melt matte 106.
   Furthermore, in embodiments that include the central cleaning element 150, the ends of the
   central cleaning element 150 are also melted together to form a portion of the melt matte
   106. Of course, all of the other cleaning elements including those described below may be
30 melted to form a portion of the melt matte 106 as has been described herein.
   [0050] In addition to the conical tuft 130, the central cleaning element 150, and the
   plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d, the tooth cleaning elements 115 also
   comprise many other additional cleaning elements on the head 110. Specifically, the tooth
   cleaning elements 115 include an outer loop of cleaning elements that includes the second
                                                                 13

   and fourth arcuate cleaning elements 170b, 170d and an inner row of cleaning elements
   that includes the first and third arcuate cleaning elements 170a, 170c, the conical tuft 130
   and the central cleaning element 150.
   [0051] The outer loop of cleaning elements comprises a grouping of cleaning elements
 5 that are arranged so that the outer loop is symmetric about a longitudinal axis B-B of the
   head 110 and about a transverse axis that intersects the cavity axis C-C, the center point
   CP and is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis B-B. In the exemplified embodiment, the
   entirety of the tooth cleaning elements are arranged so as to be symmetric about the
   longitudinal axis B-B and the transverse axis.        Specifically, the outer loop of cleaning
10 elements includes proximal cleaning elements 160 located at a proximal region of the head
    110 and distal cleaning elements 161 located at a distal region of the head 110.        Each of
   the proximal cleaning elements 160 is an arcuate cleaning element located on opposing
   sides of the longitudinal axis B-B. Similarly, each of the distal cleaning elements 161 is an
   arcuate cleaning element located on opposing sides of the longitudinal axis B-B.
15 [0052] Starting from the proximal cleaning element 160 and working upwardly towards
   the distal cleaning elements 161, the left side of the head 110 (when viewed from the front
   as depicted in FIG. 2) has a first bristle wall 162, a first bristle tuft 163, the second arcuate
   cleaning element 170b, a second bristle tuft 164, and a second bristle wall 165. Starting
   from the proximal cleaning element 160 and working upwardly towards the distal cleaning
20 elements 161, the right side of the head 110 has a third bristle wall 166, a third bristle tuft
   167, the fourth arcuate cleaning element 170d, a fourth bristle tuft 168, and a fourth bristle
   wall 169. Each of these bristle tufts and bristle walls is in its own tuft hole and is spaced
   apart from adjacent ones of the bristle tufts and bristle walls. The first bristle wall 162 is
   longitudinally aligned with the third bristle wall 166 on opposing lateral sides of the head
25 110, the second bristle wall 165 is longitudinally aligned with the fourth bristle wall 169
   on opposing lateral sides of the head, the first bristle tuft 163 is longitudinally aligned with
   the third bristle tuft 167 on opposing lateral sides of the head, and the second bristle tuft
   164 is longitudinally aligned with the fourth bristle tuft 168 on opposing lateral sides of the
   head.
30 [0053] Furthermore, the first bristle tuft 163 is at least partially located within the space
   between the first arcuate cleaning element 170a and the second arcuate cleaning element
   170b, the second bristle tuft 164 is at least partially located within the space between the
   second arcuate cleaning element 170b and the third arcuate cleaning element 170c, the
   third bristle tuft 167 is at least partially located within the space between the first arcuate

   cleaning element 170 and the fourth arcuate cleaning element 170d, and the fourth bristle
   tuft 168 is at least partially located within the space between the third arcuate cleaning
   element 170c and the fourth arcuate cleaning element 170d.                  In the exemplified
   embodiment the first, second, third, and fourth bristle tufts 163, 164, 167, 168 are located
 5 outside of the loop L, but they are still adjacent to and positioned in between the plurality
   of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d as noted herein above.
   [0054] Similarly, working upwardly from the proximal cleaning elements 160 to the distal
   cleaning elements 161, the inner row of cleaning elements comprise a fifth bristle wall
   180, a fifth bristle tuft 181, the first arcuate cleaning element 170a, the conical tuft 130 and
10 the central cleaning element 150, the third arcuate cleaning element 170c, a sixth bristle
   tuft 182, and a sixth bristle wall 183. Any of the bristle tufts (or the individual bristles that
   form the bristle tufts) can be tapered, non-tapered, rounded, spiral, or the like.
   Furthermore, the fifth and sixth bristle walls 180, 183 are arcuate and have a smaller radius
   of curvature than the plurality of arcuate cleaning elements 170a-d. The concave surfaces
15 of the fifth and sixth bristle walls 180, 183 are facing each other and the conical tuft 130.
   The proximal and distal cleaning elements 160, 161 are also arcuate in the exemplified
   embodiment. The first, second, third, and fourth bristle walls 162, 165, 167, 169 are not
   arcuate in the exemplified embodiment, but are simply elongated bristle walls, although
   they could be arcuate in other embodiments.
20 [0055] Referring now to FIG. 8, an oral care implement 200 will be described in
   accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The oral care implement
   200 is similar to the oral care implement 100 and thus much of the description above with
   regard to the oral care implement 100 is applicable to the oral care implement 200, except
   where the description of the oral care implement 100 above is contradictory to a specific
25 description of the oral care implement 200 provided below.           Features of the oral care
   implement 200 that are similar to features of the oral care implement 100 described above
   will be similarly numbered except that the 200-series of numbers will be used. Certain
   features of the oral care implement 200 may be labeled but not described, in which case
   the description of the similar feature from the oral care implement 100 applies.
30 Furthermore, certain features of the oral care implement 200 may not be labeled, it being
   understood that the description of the similar feature from the oral care implement 100
   applies.
   [0056] The oral care implement 200 generally comprises a handle 220 and a head 210,
   which have the same structures, features, materials of construction, and the like as
                                                     15

   described above with regard to the oral care implement 100. Furthermore, a plurality of
   tooth cleaning elements 215 are positioned on and extend from a front surface 211 of the
   head 210. The plurality of tooth cleaning elements 215 include a conical tuft 230, a central
   cleaning element 250, and many additional cleaning elements that will not be described in
 5 detail herein. Specifically, although a specific configuration and pattern of the additional
   cleaning elements is provided in the drawings, the invention is not to be so limited. In
   certain embodiments, the conical tuft 230 can be used with any arrangement of additional
   cleaning elements, including the arrangement depicted in FIGS. 1-7.            Thus, in certain
   embodiments the invention may be the arrangement of cleaning elements achieved by
10 swapping out the conical tuft 130 and replacing it with the conical tuft 230. Thus, the only
   component of FIG. 8 that will be discussed in detail herein is the conical tuft 230, it being
   understood that the description of the other features above may be used with the conical
   tuft 230.
   [0057] The conical tuft 230 is in the shape of an inverted truncated cone much like the
15 conical tuft 130 described above.         The conical tuft 230 has a first end that is inserted
   within a tuft hole in the head 210 (or in a head plate as discussed above), and the conical
   tuft 230 extends from the front surface 211 of the head 210 and terminates in an annular
   top surface 231. In this embodiment, the annular top surface 231 of the conical tuft 230 is
   an undulating or wavy surface.          Thus, the side profile of the annular top surface 231
20 conical tuft 230 is wavy.         Despite this undulating surface, the conical tuft 230 is still
   conical such that it has a circular or spherical transverse cross-sectional              shape.
   Furthermore, in this embodiment the annular top surface 231 of the conical tuft 230
   comprises sinusoidal-shaped undulations. Specifically, the annular top surface 231 of the
   conical tuft 230 undulates in height relative to the front surface 211 of the head 210. In
25 that regard, the annular top surface 231 of the conical tuft 230 comprises a plurality of
   peaks 232 and a plurality of valleys 233. The plurality of peaks 232 are located at a first
   distance from the front surface 211 of the head 210 and the plurality of valleys 233 are
   located at a second distance from the front surface 211 of the head 210, the first distance
   being greater than the second distance. The conical tuft 230 can have any number of peaks
30 and valleys as desired.
   [0058] In this embodiment, the conical tuft 230 has a continuous bristle wall that extends
   360' about an axis as discussed above with the conical tuft 130. Furthermore, the outer
   surface of the conical tuft 230 has a continuous cone-like shape.         The undulations are
   formed by having some of the bristles in the conical tuft 230 having a greater height than
                                                    16

   others of the bristles in the conical tuft 230. By varying the height of the bristles within
   the conical tuft 230, the various peaks 232 and valleys 233 noted herein above can be
   formed. The conical tuft 230 can be positioned at orientations other than that depicted in
   FIG. 8 by rotating the conical tuft 230 relative to the head 210 so that the location of the
 5 peaks 232 and valleys 233 can be other than that which is depicted in FIG. 8.
   [0059] Referring now to FIG. 9, an oral care implement 300 will be described in
   accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention.               The oral care
   implement 300 is similar to the oral care implement 100 and thus much of the description
   above with regard to the oral care implement 100 is applicable to the oral care implement
10 300, except where the description of the oral care implement 100 above is contradictory to
   a specific description of the oral care implement 300 provided below. Features of the oral
   care implement 300 that are similar to features of the oral care implement 100 described
   above will be similarly numbered except that the 300-series of numbers will be used.
   Certain features of the oral care implement 300 may be labeled but not described, in which
15 case the description of the similar feature from the oral care implement 100 or from the
   oral care implement 200 applies. Furthermore, certain features of the oral care implement
   300 may not be labeled, it being understood that the description of the similar feature from
   the oral care implement 100 applies.
   [0060] The oral care implement 300 generally comprises a handle 320 and a head 310,
20 which have the same structures, features, materials of construction, and the like as
   described above with regard to the oral care implement 100. Furthermore, a plurality of
   tooth cleaning elements 315 are positioned on and extend from a front surface 311 of the
   head 310. The plurality of tooth cleaning elements 315 include a conical tuft 330, a central
   cleaning element 350, and many additional cleaning elements that will not be described in
25 detail herein. Specifically, although a specific configuration and pattern of the additional
   cleaning elements is provided in the drawings, the invention is not to be so limited. In
   certain embodiments, the conical tuft 330 can be used with any arrangement of cleaning
   elements, including the arrangement depicted in FIGS. 1-7. Thus, in certain embodiments
   the invention may be the arrangement of cleaning elements achieved by replacing the
30 conical tuft 130 with the conical tuft 330. Thus, the only components of FIG. 9 that will
   be discussed in detail herein is the conical tuft 330 and the central cleaning element 350, it
   being understood that the description of the other features above may be used with this
   conical tuft 330.
                                                  17
   9050105_1 (GHMatters) P103699.PCT

   [0061] In this embodiment, the head 310 of the oral care implement extends from a
   proximal end 313 to a distal end 314 along a longitudinal axis D-D. The conical tuft 330 is
   positioned on the front surface 311 of the head 310 in a similar manner, location, and
   orientation as the conical tuft 130 discussed above. The conical tuft 330 terminates in an
 5 annular top surface 331 that undulates in height relative to the front surface 311 of the
   head. Specifically, the annular top surface 311 of the conical tuft 330 comprises a first
   peak portion 332, a second peak portion 334, a first valley portion 333., and a second valley
   portion 335. The first and second peak portions 332, 334 extend a greater height from the
   front surface 311 of the head 310 than the first and second valley portions 333, 335.
10 Furthermore, although in the exemplified embodiment the first and second peak portions
   332, 334 extend the same height from the front surface 311 of the head 310 and the first
   and second valley portions 333, 335 extend the same height from the front surface 311 of
   the head 310, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and each peak
   portion and each valley portion may extend different heights from the front surface 311 of
15 the head 310 in other embodiments. Differently from the conical tuft 230, the annular top
   surface 331 of the conical tuft 330 comprises V-shaped undulations, although they can be
   sinusoidal shaped or otherwise shaped as desired in other embodiments.
   [0062] In this embodiment, a longitudinal reference plane LRP1 that is substantially
   parallel to the longitudinal axis D-D and perpendicular to the front surface 311 of the head
20 310 intersects the first and second peak portions 332, 334 of the annular top surface 331 of
   the conical tuft 330. Furthermore, a transverse reference plane TRP1 that is substantially
   perpendicular to the longitudinal axis D-D and to the front surface 311 of the head 310
   intersects both of the first and second valley portions 333, 335 of the annular top surface
   331 of the conical tuft 330. Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment of FIG. 9 the
25 longitudinal reference plane LRP1 and the transverse reference plane TRP1 intersect along
   the cavity axis C-C. Thus, the first and second peak portions 332, 334 of the annular top
   surface 331 of the conical tuft 310 are transversely aligned along the longitudinal reference
   plane LRPI and the first and second valley portions 333, 335 of the annular top surface
   331 of the conical tuft 310 are longitudinally aligned along the transverse reference plane
30 TRP1. Thus, due to the locations of the peak and valley portions 332, 333, 334, 335, when
   viewed from the transverse reference plane TRPI the annular top surface 331 of the
   conical tuft 330 has a V-shaped or concave side profile and when viewed from the
   longitudinal reference plane LRP1 the annular top surface 331 of the conical tuft 330 has a
   convex side profile.
                                                 18
   9050105_1 (GHMatters) P!03699.PCT

   [0063] As noted above, the plurality of tooth cleaning elements 315 include the conical
   tuft 330 and the central cleaning element 350. The central cleaning element 350 is located
   within the cavity that is defined by the inner surface of the conical tuft 330 in the same
   manner as discussed above with regard to the oral care implement 100 and FIGS. 1-7. In
 5 the exemplified embodiment, the valley portions 333, 335 of the annular top surface 331
   extend a first height HI above the front surface 311 of the head 310, the peak portions 332,
   334 of the annular top surface 331 extend a second height H2 above the front surface 311
   of the head 310, and the central cleaning element 350 terminates in a free end 351 that is
   located at a third height H3 above the front surface 311 of the head 310.         In certain
10 embodiments the first height HI is less than the second height H2. Furthermore, in the
   exemplified embodiment the third height H3 is less than the second height H2 and the third
   height H3 is greater than the first height HI. Of course, in other embodiments the third
   height H3 may be equal to or less than the second height H2 and greater than the first
   height HI. In still other embodiments, the third height H3 may be equal to or less than the
15 first height HI.
   [0064] Referring now to FIG. 10, an oral care implement 400 will be described in
   accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention.             The oral care
   implement 400 is similar to the oral care implement 300 and to the oral care implement
   100, and thus much of the description above with regard to the oral care implement 100
20 and the oral care implement 300 is applicable to the oral care implement 400, except where
   the description of the oral care implements 100, 300 above is contradictory to a specific
   description of the oral care implement 400 provided below.         Features of the oral care
   implement 400 that are similar to features of the oral care implements 100, 300 described
   above will be similarly numbered except that the 400-series of numbers will be used.
25 Certain features of the oral care implement 400 may be labeled but not described, in which
   case the description of the similar feature from the oral care implement 100, 300 applies.
   Furthermore, certain features of the oral care implement 400 may not be labeled, it being
   understood that the description of the similar feature from the oral care implement 100,
   300 applies.
30 [0065] The oral care implement 400 is identical to the oral care implement 300 except that
   the conical tuft 430 has been rotated ninety degrees relative to the head 410. Thus, in the
   oral care implement 300 the peaks 332, 334 were aligned along the longitudinal axis D-D
   of the head 310, but in the oral acre implement 430 the valley portions 433, 435 are
   aligned along the longitudinal axis D-D of the head 410. Thus, in this embodiment, a
                                                 19

   longitudinal reference plane LRP2 that is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis D-D
   and perpendicular to the front surface 411 of the head 410 intersects the first and second
   valley portions 433, 435 of the annular top surface 431 of the conical tuft 430 and a
   transverse reference plane TRP2 that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis
 5 D-D and perpendicular to the front surface 411 of the head 410 intersects the first and
   second peak portions 432, 434 of the annular top surface 431 of the conical tuft 430. In
   this embodiment, the annular top surface 431 has a convex side profile when viewed from
   the transverse reference plane TRP2 and a concave (or V-shaped) side profile when
   viewed from the longitudinal reference plane LRP2.
10 [0066] In either of the embodiments of FIGS. 9 and 10, the central tooth cleaning element
   350, 450 may be shorter than the valley portions of the conical tufts 330, 430, the same
   height as the valley portions of the conical tufts 330, 430, taller than the valley portions of
   the conical tufts 330, 430 but shorter than the peak portions of the conical tufts 330, 430,
   the same height as the peak portions of the conical tufts 330, 430, or taller than the peak
15 portions of the conical tufts 330, 430 as desired to achieve a particular cleaning result.
   Furthermore, as discussed previously the central tooth cleaning elements 350, 450 may
   also be omitted in some embodiments.
   [0067] While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including
   presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will
20 appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described
   systems and techniques. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and
   structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of
   the present invention. Thus, the spirit and scope of the invention should be construed
   broadly as set forth in the appended claims.
