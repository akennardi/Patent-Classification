                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]       This disclosure relates to process of preparing compounds useful for modulating
protein kinase enzymatic activity. More specifically, this disclosure relates to a process for
preparing compounds useful for modulating cellular activities such as proliferation,
differentiation, programmed cell death, migration, and chemoinvasion.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]       Modulation (particularly inhibition) of cell proliferation and angiogenesis, two
key cellular processes needed for tumor growth and survival (Matter A. Drug Disc Technol
2001 6, 1005-1024) is an attractive goal for development of small-molecule drugs. Anti
angiogenic therapy represents a potentially important approach for the treatment of solid
tumors and other diseases associated with dysregulated vascularization, including ischemic
coronary artery disease, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. As well, cell
antiproliferative agents are desirable to slow or stop the growth of tumors.
10004]       One such target for small-molecule modulation of antiangiogenic and
antiproliferative activity is c-Met. The kinase c-Met, is the prototypic member of a subfamily
of heterodimeric receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which include Met, Ron and Sea.
Expression of c-Met occurs in a wide variety of cell types including epithelial, endothelial,
and mesenchymal cells where activation of the receptor induces cell migration, invasion,
proliferation and other biological activities associated with "invasive cell growth." As such,
signal transduction through c-Met receptor activation is responsible for many of the
characteristics of tumor cells.

                                                  1

dicarboxamide are two small molecule inhibitors of c-Met that are currently undergoing
clinical investigation as treatments for a range of cancers. There is accordingly an ongoing
need for new and efficient processes for making these two promising cancer therapies.

10012]        The mono-amidation process disclosed and claimed herein presents several
significant processing advantages. Prior approaches to making Compound A required mixing
1,1-cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid with triethyl amine, and then adding thionyl chloride
followed by the aniline. The reaction was typically and undesirably exothermic. The
inventors found that the exotherm was eliminated by reordering the sequence of reagent
additions. Reaction times were significantly reduced, and the resulting product does not
require additional purification. Moreover, the invention process as disclosed herein is highly
selective for formation of the mono-amidation product Compound A:

of symmetric dicarboxylic acids using an array of primary or secondary amines. Thus, in
another aspect, the invention provides a process for making a mono-amide from the
corresponding dicarboxylic acid, comprising:
         (a)      contacting a dicarboxylic acid with thionyl chloride in a polar aprotic solvent;
and
         (b)      adding a primary amine and a tertiary amine base to the resulting mixture.

otherwise, all carbons are assumed to have hydrogen substitution to conform to a valence of
four. For example, in the structure on the left-hand side of the schematic below there are nine
hydrogens implied. The nine hydrogens are depicted in the right-hand structure. Sometimes a
particular atom in a structure is described in textual formula as having a hydrogen or
hydrogens as substitution (expressly defined hydrogen), for example, -CH 2CH 2-. It is
understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned descriptive techniques
are common in the chemical arts to provide brevity and simplicity to description of otherwise
complex structures.

formula:

assuming replacement of a depicted, implied, or expressly defined hydrogen from one of the
ring atoms, so long as a stable structure is formed.
[0019]      If a group "R" is depicted as floating on a fused ring system, as for example in the

then, unless otherwise defined, a substituent "R" may reside on any atom of the fused ring
system, assuming replacement of a depicted hydrogen (for example the -NH- in the formula
above), implied hydrogen (for example as in the formula above, where the hydrogens are not
shown but understood to be present), or expressly defined hydrogen (for example where in

is formed. In the example depicted, the "R" group may reside on either the 5-membered or
the 6-membered ring of the fused ring system. When a group "R" is depicted as existing on a
ring system containing saturated carbons, as for example in the formula:
                                          (R)y
where, in this example, "y" can be more than one, assuming each replaces a currently
depicted, implied, or expressly defined hydrogen on the ring; then, unless otherwise defined,
where the resulting structure is stable, two "R's" may reside on the same carbon. A simple
example is when R is a methyl group; there can exist a geminal dimethyl on a carbon of the
depicted ring (an "annular" carbon). In another example, two R's on the same carbon,
including that carbon, may form a ring, thus creating a spirocyclic ring (a "spirocyclyl"
group) structure with the depicted ring as for example in the formula.

ring atoms being carbon. One or two ring carbon atoms may be replaced by a -C(O)-, -C(S)-,
or -C(=NH)- group. Fused bicyclic radical includes bridged ring systems. Unless otherwise
stated, the valency of the group may be located on any atom of any ring within the radical,

Process
[00301      In one aspect, this disclosure relates to a process for preparing a compound of
Formula A:
                                                  11

                                      OO
                                   HO            N           (R2)o
                                                  A
        wherein R 2 is H, F, Cl, or Br;
comprising
        (a)      contacting 1,1 -cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid with thionyl chloride in a polar
aprotic solvent; and
                         H2 N" QC
        (b)      adding               (R2)0-2 and a tertiary amine base to the mixture of step (a).
10031]       In the process, 1,1-cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid is combined with a polar aprotic
solvent to form a mixture. In one embodiment, the polar aprotic solvent is selected from the
group consisting of dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate,
acetone, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, and dimethylsulfoxide, or combinations thereof In
another embodiment, the polar aprotic solvent is selected form the group consisting of
dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, acetone,
dimethylformamide, and acetonitrile, or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the
polar aprotic solvent is selected form the group consisting of dichloromethane,
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, and isopropyl acetate, or combinations thereof. In one
embodiment, the polar aprotic solvent is isopropyl acetate.
10032]       The volume of polar aprotic solvent used will vary depending on the reaction
scale. Typically, approximately 5-10 volumes of polar aprotic solvent are used relative to the
volume of 1,1 -cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid that is used. More typically, 6-9 volumes of
polar aprotic solvent are used. More typically, 7.5-8.5 volumes of polar aprotic solvent are
used. Preferably, approximately 8 volumes of the polar aprotic solvent are used.
10033]       Next, thionyl chloride is added to the mixture comprising 1,1
cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid and the polar aprotic solvent. A molar excess of thionyl
chloride is used relative to the number of moles of 1,1 -ccyclopropanedicarboxylic acid that is
used. Typically, approximately 1.01 to 1.5 molar equivalents of thionyl chloride are used
relative to the number of moles of 1,1-cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid that are used. More
typically, approximately 1.01 to 1.2 molar equivalents of thionyl chloride are used. More
typically, approximately 1.01 to 1.1 molar equivalents of thionyl chloride are used. More
typically, approximately 1.05 molar equivalents of thionyl chloride are used.
                                                 12

10034]      The mixture comprising 1,1 -cyclopropoanedicarboxylic acid, thionyl chloride, and
the polar aprotic solvent is stirred or otherwise agitated for 2 to 24 hours. "Ambient
temperature" generally means that no external heating device, such as a heating jacket,
heating mantle, or the like, is employed to increase the temperature of the mixture.
Typically, the temperature is approximately 23 to 27 'C. More typically, the temperature is
approximately 24 to 26 'C. Typically, the temperature is approximately 25 'C. The stirring
at room temperature typically continues for approximately 6 to 16 hours. More typically, the
stirring continues for approximately 13-15 hours at approximately 25 'C.
                                                                    H2 NQ        2)0_
10035]      Next, a mixture of an optionally substituted aniline               (R2)o-2 and a
tertiary amine base in a polar aprotic solvent is added to the mixture. Typically, the optionally
substituted aniline is 4-fluoroaniline.
[0036]      A molar excess of aniline is used relative to the number of moles of 1,1
cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid. Typically, approximately 1.01 to 1.5 molar equivalents of
aniline are used relative to the number of moles of 1,1 -cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid that are
used. More typically, approximately 1.01 to 1.2 molar equivalents of aniline are used. More
typically, approximately 1.05 to 1.15 molar equivalents of aniline are used. More typically,
approximately 1.1 molar equivalents of aniline are used.
[0037]      The tertiary amine base is typically a trialkyl amine, wherein the alkyl groups are
the same or different and may be linear or branched. The use of trialkyl amine bases is well
known to the skilled artisan, and many are commercially available such as triethylamine, di
isopropylethyl amine, or the like. Typically the tertiary amine base is triethyl amine. A
molar excess of tertiary amine base is used relative to the number of moles of 1,1
cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid. Typically, approximately 1.01 to 1.5 molar equivalents of
tertiary amine base are used relative to the number of moles of 1,1-cyclopropanedicarboxylic
acid that are used. More typically, approximately 1.01 to 1.2 molar equivalents of tertiary
amine base are used. More typically, approximately 1.05 to 1.15 molar equivalents of aniline
are used. More typically, approximately 1.1 molar equivalents of tertiary amine base are
used.
10038]      The optionally substituted aniline and tertiary amine base are typically combined
in a polar aprotic solvent before they are added to the 1,1 -cyclopropanedicarboxylic
acid/thionyl chloride/isopropyl acetate mixture. The polar aprotic solvent that is used is
typically the same as the solvent that is used to form the 1,1 -cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid
                                                 13

mixture, and is selected form the group consisting of dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl
acetate, isopropyl acetate, acetone, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, and dimethylsulfoxide,
or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the polar aprotic solvent is selected form
the group consisting of dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate,
acetone, dimethylformamide, and acetonitrile, or combinations thereof. In another
embodiment, the polar aprotic solvent is selected form the group consisting of
dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, and isopropyl acetate, or combinations
thereof. In one embodiment, the polar aprotic solvent is isopropyl acetate.
10039]      The volume of polar aprotic solvent used to form the aniline/tertiary amine base
mixture will vary depending on the reaction scale. Typically, approximately 1-5 volumes of
polar aprotic solvent are relative to volume of optionally substituted aniline that are used.
More typically, 1.5-3 volumes of polar aprotic solvent are used. More typically,
approximately 2 volumes of polar aprotic solvent are used.
10040]      The resulting combined mixture is allowed to mix at ambient temperature for 0.5
to 5 hours, and more preferably from 1 to 3 hours. More typically the mixture is allowed to
mix for 2 hours.
[0041]      The mixture, which at this point is typically a slurry comprising Compound A, is
then quenched, by treating with a concentrated aqueous base such as 5N aqueous NaOH,
KOH, or K 3PO 4 , or the like. In one embodiment, the base is NaOH. The amount of aqueous
base employed to quench the reaction will vary depending the on the reaction scale. For the
scale described above, typically approximately 4-6 volumes of 5N NaOH are used. The
organic phase of the resulting biphasic mixture is then subsequently extracted with multiple
washes of 0.5N NaOH and the aqueous phases are combined. The combined basic extracts
are back extracted with an aprotic solvent such as heptane. The combined aqueous phases are
then subsequently acidified with an aqueous mineral acid such as HCl, H 2SO 4 , or the like.
Typically the acid used is 30 percent HCI in water. The acid is added to the combined
aqueous phases to fonn a slurry. Compound A is then isolated by filtration.

[00501         As described herein, reaction of thionyl chloride with 1,1
cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid in a polar aprotic solvent as described herein offers a
significant advantage over previous processes in that the reaction is not exothermic. A
previous reaction variant wherein SOCl 2 was added to a mixture of 1,1
cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid and Et 3N in tetrahydrofuran was very exothermic. The
invention process as described herein is noteworthy because carboxylic acids do not normally
convert to the corresponding acyl chlorides when treated with SOCl 2 at ambient temperature.
[00511         The invention process as disclosed herein is highly selective for formation of the
mono-amidation product Compound A over the bis-amide:
                            0   oF,                              0                     F

Typically, less than 5 percent, or more typically less than 1 percent, of the bis-amide is
formed via the process as claimed herein as evidenced by HPLC analysis of in process
control samples. Moreover, the bis-amide, if present, is normally completely removed using
the isolation conditions.
[00521         Advantageously, the described process also considerably shortens the time taken
for the production of a batch of Compound A. Currently, the process for large scale
production of Compound A requires several days and subsequent purification by
recrystallization. Using the improved process, the typical production time is expected to take
one-two days and does not require additional recrystallization.

Experimental Procedures
10053]       The invention is illustrated further by the following examples in Scheme 1 and the
description thereof, which are not to be construed as limiting the invention in scope or spirit
to the specific procedures described in them. Those having skill in the art will recognize that
the starting materials may be varied and additional steps employed to produce compounds
encompassed by the invention, as demonstrated by the following examples. Those skilled in
the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to utilize different solvents or reagents to
achieve some of the above transformations.
10054]       Unless otherwise specified, all reagents and solvents are of standard commercial
grade and are used without further purification.         The appropriate atmosphere to run the
reaction under, for example, air, nitrogen, argon, and the like, will be apparent to those
skilled in the art.

10055]       The starting 1,1 -cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid was treated with thionyl chloride
(1.05 equivalents) in approximately 8 volumes of isopropyl acetate at 25 'C for 5 hours. The
resulting mixture was then treated with a solution of 4-fluoroaniline (1 .1 equivalents) and
triethylamine (1.1 equivalents) in isopropyl acetate (2 volumes) over 1 hour. The product
slurry was quenched with 5N NaOH solution (5 volumes) and the aqueous phase is discarded.
The organic phase was extracted with 0.5N NaOH solution (10 volumes) and the basic
extract was washed with heptane (5 volumes) and subsequently acidified with 30% HCl
solution to give a slurry. Compound A-I was isolated by filtration.
[0056]       Compound A-I was prepared on a 1.00 kg scale using 1,1
cyclopropanedicarboxylic acid as the limiting reagent to furnish 1.32 kg of Compound A-1
(77% isolated yield; 84% mass balance) with 99.92% purity (HPLC) and 100.3% assay.

Preparation of Compound 2 Hydrate Form
10086]      The hydrate of Compound 2 was prepared by adding 4.9614 g of Compound I and
50 mL of n-propanol to a 250 mL beaker. The suspension was heated to 90 'C with stirring
via a magnetic stir bar at 200 rpm. After 2 hours, the solids were fully dissolved in an amber
solution. At the 1 hour and 2 hour timepoints, 10 mL of n-propanol was added to account
for evaporative effects and return the volume of the solution to 50 mL. The solution was
then hot-filtered through a 1.6 pm glass fiber filter. The solution was then allowed to dry
overnight in the beaker to a powder, which was then redissolved in 150 mL of a 1:1 mixture
of acetone and water, and slurried overnight (16 hours) with a foil lid to prevent evaporation.
The slurried solids were then collected by vacuum filtration. The final weight recovered was
3.7324 g (75% yield). This batch was stored at ambient conditions for several days prior to
analysis.
10087]      Karl Fisher water content determinations were performed using a standard
procedure. Water content was measured with a Brinkmann KFIV4 Metrohm 756
Coulometer equipped with a 703 Ti stirrer and using Hydranal Coulomat AG reagent.
Samples were introduced into the vessel as solids. Approx 30-35 mg of sample was used per
titration. A sample of crystalline Compound (1) prepared in Example 1.1.2 was measured in
duplicate and was found to have an average water content be 2.5% w/w, with each replicate
agreeing to within 0.1%.
10088]      A gravimetric vapor sorption (GVS) study was run using a standard procedure.
Samples were run on a dynamic vapor sorption analyzer (Surface Measurement Systems)
running DVSCFR software. Sample sizes were typically 10 mg. A moisture adsorption
desorption isotherm was performed as outlined below. The standard isotherm experiment,
performed at 25 'C, is a two-cycle run, starting at 40% RH (relative humidity), increasing
humidity to 90% RH, decreasing humidity to 0% RH, increasing humidity again to 90% RH,
and finally decreasing humidity to 0% RH in 10% RH intervals. The crystalline Compound 1
prepared in Example 1.1.1 showed a 2.50%weight gain at 25 'C and 90% humidity. The GVS
sorption and desorption curves showed evidence that the hydrate behaves as an isomorphic

10089]       The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of Compound 1 crystalline hydrate prepared
above was acquired using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer. The sample was gently
flattened onto a zero-background silicon insert sample holder. A continuous 20 scan range of
20 to 500 was used with a CuKc radiation source and a generator power of 40 kV and 45 mA.
A 20 step size of 0.017 degrees/step with a step time of 40.7 seconds was used. Samples
were rotated at 30 rpm. Experiments were performed at room temperature and at ambient
humidity. WO 2011/112896, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by
reference, shows the XRPD pattern for N-[3-fluoro-4-({6-(methyloxy)-7-[(3-morpholin-4

identification of crystalline pharmaceutical forms. The entire list of peaks, or a subset
thereof, may be sufficient to characterize the hydrate of Compound 1.
10090]       DSC thermograms were acquired using a TA Instruments Q2000 differential
scanning calorimeter. A sample mass of 2.1500 mg of Compound 1 crystalline hydrate was
weighed out directly into an aluminum DSC pan. The pan was sealed by applying pressure
by hand and pushing each part the pan together (also known as a loose lid configuration).
The temperature was ramped from 25 'C to 225 'C at 10 0C/minute. A peak melting
temperature of 137.4 'C and a heat flow of 44.2 J/g was measured for the melting endotherm.
After the melting event, reciystallization occurs to an anhydrous form, which then melts at
 194.1 0C.
[0091]       TGA thermograms were acquired using a TA Instruments Q500
Thermogravimetric Analyzer. The sample pan was tared, and 9.9760 milligrams of
Compound (1) crystalline hydrate was placed in the pan. The temperature was ramped from
25 'C to 300 'C at 10 'C/minute. A weight loss of 2.97% was observed up to 160 'C, with an
additional weight loss beyond 200 'C from decomposition.
Preparation of Compound 2 Crystalline Hydrate with Different Hydration States.
[0092]       Five 150 mg aliquots were taken from the crystalline hydrate batch prepared
above and were placed in 10 mL screw-top vials. With the vial tops removed, these aliquots
                                                 35

saturated lithium bromide (6% RH), saturated lithium chloride (11% RH), saturated
magnesium chloride (33% RH), and saturated sodium chloride (75% RH). The samples were
removed after 2 weeks and immediately sealed with a cap for analysis and characterized.
