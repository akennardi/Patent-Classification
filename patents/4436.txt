 5 Back2round of Invention
   Current practices and technologies yield poor agrochemical use efficiency by plants due to over
   application (up to 50%) (Shaviv and Mikkelsen 1993). Excessive application of agrochemicals has
   adverse effects on the environment and is costly for farmers (Shaviv and Mikkelsen 1993).
   Additionally, many soils and climates are not suitable for growing crops (Habarurema and Steiner,
 0 1997; Nicholson and Farrar, 1994).
   New practices and technologies are needed for efficient application of fertilizers and other
   agrochemicals for improving plant growth.

   The term "controlled release" when used to refer to an agrochemical zone means that the
   agrochemical zone is formulated to release the one or more agrochemicals of the agrochemical zone
   gradually over time. In some embodiments, the agrochemical zones are formulated to release the at
   least one agrochemical into the root development zones over a period of at least about one week when
 0 the root development zones are hydrated. In some embodiments, the agrochemical zones are
   formulated to release the at least one agrochemical into the root development zones over a period
   greater than one week when the root development zones are hydrated.                 "Controlled release" is
   interchangeable with the term "slow release" ("SR").
 5 "DAP" means days after planting.
   Unless required otherwise by context, a "unit" refers to a unit for delivery of agrochemicals to the
   roots of a plant as described herein. A "fertilizer unit" refers to a unit for delivery of agrochemicals to

   unaccompanied by the agrochemical zone component. In some embodiments, an empty unit has the
   same shape and/or dimensions as the corresponding unit of the invention.
 5 A "root development zone" is a component of a unit of the invention which, when hydrated, can be
   penetrated by a growing root. In some embodiments, the growing root can grow and develop within
   the root development zone of a unit. In some embodiments, a root development zone is a super
   absorbent polymer (SAP). In some embodiments, the root development zone is an aerogel, a
   geotextile, or a sponge. In some embodiments, the root development zone will take up water from the
30 surrounding environment when, for example, the unit is placed in soil which is subsequently irrigated.
   In some embodiments, the hydrated root development zones create a artificial environment in which a
   growing root can uptake water and nutrients. In some embodiments, the root development zones of a
   unit are formulated to contain one or more agrochemicals which are the same or different than the
   agrochemicals of the agrochemical zones of the unit. While the invention described herein is not
35 limited to any particular mechanism of action, it is believed that a growing root is attracted to the root
   development zones of a unit because of the presence of water and/or agrochemicals (e.g. minerals) in
   the root development zones. It is believed that roots can continue to grow and develop within the root

   Unless stated otherwise or required otherwise by context, "swelled" means that a material has an
   absorbed amount of water which is at least about 1% of the amount of water that would be absorbed
   by the material if placed in deionized water for 24 hours at 21'C. When the material is a hydrogel, a
   "swelled" hydrogel can be referred to as a "hydrated" hydrogel. In some embodiments, a swelled
 5 material has an absorbed amount of water which is at least about 2% of the amount of water that
   would be absorbed by the material if placed in deionized water for 24 hours at 21'C. In some
   embodiments, a swelled material has an absorbed amount of water which is at least about 3% of the
   amount of water that would be absorbed by the material if placed in deionized water for 24 hours at
   21'C. In some embodiments, a swelled material has an absorbed amount of water which is at least
 0 about 4% of the amount of water that would be absorbed by the material if placed in deionized water
   for 24 hours at 21'C. In some embodiments, a swelled material has an absorbed amount of water
   which is at least about 5% of the amount of water that would be absorbed by the material if placed in
   deionized water for 24 hours at 21 C.
25 Unless stated otherwise or required otherwise by context, "hydrated" means at least about 1%

   As used herein, an artificial environment means a media located within the root zone of an
35 agricultural field or a garden plant loaded with at least one agrochemical, encourages root growth and
   uptake activity within its internal periphery. Non-limiting examples of agrochemicals include
                                                       40

   WO 2014/140918                                                               PCT/IB/2014/001194
   pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Agrochemicals may also include natural
   and synthetic fertilizers, hormones and other chemical growth agents.
   In some embodiments, the medium may comprise multiple sub-zones, such as:
 5 i)       an agrochemical zone (for example, an Internal Zone); and
   ii)      a root development zone (for example, an External Zone).
   In some embodiments, the agrochemical zone is formulated to release the at least one agrochemical
   into the root development zone over a period of at least about one week when the hydrogel of the root
 0 development zone is hydrated. In some embodiments, the agrochemical zone is formulated to release
   the at least one agrochemical into the root development zone over a period of at least about 2, 3, 4, 5,
   6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 weeks when the hydrogel of the root
   development zone is hydrated. The agrochemical zone may be formulated to control the release of the
   at least one agrochemical into the root development zone by a variety of means described herein. For
 5 example, the at least one agrochemical may be incorporated into a dense polymer in the core of the
   agrochemical zone, from which the at least one agrochemical diffuses when root development zone is
   hydrated. Additionally, the core may be coated with a compound or compounds that slow the rate of
   the at least one agrochemical's diffusion into the root development zone. In some embodiments, the
   coat compound may diffuse into the root development zone when the root development zone is
 0 hydrated, thereby slowing the rate of the at least one agrochemical's diffusion into and/or through the
   root development zone. In some embodiments, the core comprises a filler comprising the at least one
   agrochemical, from which the at least one agrochemical diffuses. In some embodiments, the at least
   one agrochemical diffuses from the core or the filler at a linear rate. The filler may slow the rate of the
   at least one agrochemical from the core. In some embodiments filler may has a physical structure,
25 such as a beehive-like structure, into which the at least one agrochemical is incorporated, and from
   which the at least one agrochemical slowly diffuses. Bentonite is a non-limiting example of a filler
   having a beehive-like structure that is useful in embodiments of the present invention.
   The agrochemical zone may contain the input (fertilizer or other agrochemical) in a structure that
30 controls its release into the root development zone.       The release rate is designed to meet plant
   demands throughout the growing season. In some embodiments, no input residuals remain at the end
   of a predetermined action period.
   In some embodiments, the agrochemical zone comprises one or more fertilizers and/or other
35 agrochemicals such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, fungicide, insecticide, etc., in a beehive like
   structure made from highly cross linked polymer coated with silica or highly cross linked poly acrylic
                                                       41

   WO 2014/140918                                                              PCT/IB/2014/001194
   acid/poly sugar with a clay filler. In some embodiments, the agrochemical zone comprises fertilizer
   and/or at least one other agrochemical in a beehive like structure with or without an external coating.
   In some embodiments, the root development zone is a super absorbent polymer (SAP) in contact with
 5 or surrounding the agrochemical zone, which attracts the growth and uptake activity of plant roots. In
   some embodiments, the root development zone is a super absorbent polymer- made from CMC-g
   poly(acrylic acid)/celite composite system or modified corn starch cross linked poly (acrylic acid). A
   root development zone which surrounds an agrochemical zone may be referred to herein as a "shell."
 0 Root development zones of the present invention are sustainable in soils, and encourage root
   penetration, uptake activity, and growth and/or development in the root development zone. In some
   embodiments, a super absorbent polymer may serve as the root development zone since during
   watering it can absorb soil moisture, swell and maintain its high water content over long period of
   time. These features establish a zone where gradual transition of chemical concentration exists
 5 between the agrochemical zone to the periphery of the root development zone allowing root uptake
   activity during the unit of the invention's life cycle. In some embodiments, the root development zone
   has features such as mechanical resistance (in order to maintain its shape and geometry in the soil);
   swelling cycle capability (capable of repeated hydration and dehydration in response to soil water
   content); oxygen permeability- (maintaining sufficient oxygen level to support root activity, such as
 0 root development); and root penetration (allowing the growth of roots into it).
   Materials that may be used in the present invention include but are not limited to: 1) clay 2) zeolite 3)
   tuff 4) fly ash 5) hydrogel 6) foam.
25 In some embodiments, an artificial environment of the present invention serves as a buffer for soil
   type and pH to provide universal root growth environment. In some embodiments, an artificial
   environment of the present invention contains needed materials and nutrients in the desired conditions,
   such as but not limited to water, fertilizers, drugs, and other additives.
30 Oxygen Permeability
   Aspects of the present invention relate to root development zones having SAPs that are permeable to
   oxygen when hydrated. Roots use oxygen for growth and development (Drew, 1997; Hopkins 1950).
   Therefore, the oxygen permeability of a SAP is an important factor in determining whether it will
   support root growth and development within a root development zone that comprises the SAP.
35
   Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, since hydrogels of the present invention supply
   water, nutrients and weak resistance, the data hereinbelow show that provided the gas diffusion is high
                                                         42

   WO 2014/140918                                                              PCT/IB/2014/001194
   enough, roots will develop in most types of small-volume hydrogels and hydrogel containing units,
   installed in a field soil. For example, alginate hydrogel, which is suitably permeable to oxygen,
   encourages root development, whereas starch hydrogel, which is poorly permeable to oxygen does not
   encourage root development. Additionally, semi-synthetic CMC is also suitably permeable to oxygen.
 5 The ability of oxygen to diffuse into root development zones of the present invention is important for
   root development within them.
   Aspects of the present invention relate to the selection of SAPs, such as hydrogels, that are
   sufficiently permeable to oxygen when hydrated. Oxygen permeability may be measured to determine
 0 whether a hydrated SAP is sufficiently permeable to oxygen for use in embodiments of the present
   invention. In some embodiments, the SAP is permeable to oxygen such that it supports root growth
   and/or development. In some embodiments, the SAP when hydrated is at least about 70, 75, 80, 85, 90,
   95, or 100% as permeable to oxygen as hydrated alginate. In some embodiments, the SAP when
   hydrated is at least about 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100% as permeable to oxygen as hydrated semi
 5 synthetic CMC.
   Oxygen permeability may be measured according to assays that are well known in the art. Non
   limiting examples of methods that may be useful for measuring oxygen permeability of SAPs of the
   invention are described in Aiba et al. (1968) "Rapid Determination of Oxygen Permeability of
 0 Polymer Membranes" Ind. Eng. Chem. Fundamen., 7(3), pp 497-502; Yasuda and Stone (1962)

   Mechanical Resistance
   In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the root development zones of a unit of the
   invention are both i) sufficiently permeable to oxygen to encourage root growth, and ii) do not
35 disintegrate in soil. In especially preferred embodiments, the root development zones of a unit of the
   invention are mechanically resistant, i.e., are capable of repeated swelling cycles in soil without
                                                       43

   fragmenting in the soil. In particularly preferred embodiments, all of the SAP of the root development
   zones remains part of the root development zones after repeated swelling cycles.
   Despite alginate's permeability to oxygen, root development zones consisting of alginate are not
 5 suitable in preferred embodiments of the invention because alginate tends to disintegrate in soil.
   However, semi-synthetic CMC, which does not tend to disintegrate and is capable of repeated
   swelling cycles without fragmenting in soil (i.e., is mechanically resistant), is suitable for use in root
   development zones in preferred embodiments the invention.
 o Implementation of Artificial Environments
   Some embodiments of the present invention comprise the following phases:
   Phase 1: Banding and incorporating into the upper soil profile.
 5 Phase 2: Following watering (rainfall and/or irrigation) the root development zones (comprising, e.g.
   a SAP) absorbs moisture from the soil and swells; water penetrates the coating (if present) and
   dissolves the fertilizer and/or other agrochemical(s) which then diffuse into the root development
   zones (e.g. towards the periphery of a bead).
 o Phase 3: Roots grow, develop, and remain in the root development zones where uptake lasts a
   predetermined period.
   Methods for Testing PropertiesofRoot Development Zones
   The following is a non-limiting example of a method that may be used to test the properties of root
25 development zones (e.g. bead shells).
   - Distribute empty units (e.g. shells) of different sies in a pot. In some embodiments, empty units of
   three sizes are used. The shells may have a dry radius of, e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2. 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5 cm
   or a length of, e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2. 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 cm. In some embodiments a 10,
30 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, or 30 liter pot is used. In some embodiments the empty units are distributed

 5 phase) in a transparent cell. In some embodiments, the cell is made of Perspex- and is 60 X 2 X 30 cm).
   In some embodiments, the empty units are distributed with soil. In some embodiments, the soil is sandy
   soil.
   - Monitoring root location and empty unit status. Insome embodiments, root location and empty status
   is monitored by photography or/and scanning.
 0 - Repeat with units with/without nutrients.
   - Monitoring roots location to conclude ifroots attract by nutrients or water.
   - Altering watering frequency over time (e.g., from hah- few times per day to low- once a week).
   Methods for Testing Propertiesof Units of the Invention
 5 The following is a non-limiting example of a method that may be used to test the properties of root
   development zones (e.g. bead shells).
   - Growing a plant in a pot. In some embodiments, the pot is a 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, or 30 liter
   pot.
 0 - Installing filter paper cups to monitor concentrations in the root zone and drainage over time.

   embodiments, the soil is sandy soil.
   - Add dying agents to units which are sensitive to envionmental conditions (e.g., pH, Salinity, or N, P,
25 and K).
   - Altering watering frequency over time (e.g. from hah- few times per day to low- once a week).

    Mechanicalresistance was tested by flushing water throughout a container filled with SAP and sand
    soil. Initial, final weights and dimensions were recorded. A pass mark was accepted for SAP that
    maintains a single element and didn't wash away or split into several parts. Three groups of SAP were
    synthesized and tested:

    1) Poly sugar:
20       16 gr of sodium alginate was dissolved in 800 ml distilled water at 50 4C using mechanical stirrer
         (1000 RPM). Then 20 gr from the alginate solution was added in to 50 ml beaker, then 10 gr of

       0.1 M solution of CaCl 2, was added in to the beaker (CaCl 2 served as the cross-linking agent). The
       beads were left in the solution for 12 hr.
   2) CMC-g-poly (acrylic acid)/Celite
 5     Various amounts of CMC (Carboxymethyl cellulose sodium Salt) (0.5-2 g) were dissolved in 25
       ml distilled water and were added to a 100 ml beaker with magnetic stirrer. The beaker was
       immersed in a temperature controlled water bath preset at 80'C. After complete dissolution of
       CMC, various amounts of Celite powder (0.3-0.6 g in 5 ml water) were added (if any) to the
       solution and allowed to stir for 10 min. Then, certain amounts of AA (Acrylic Acid) (2-3 ml) and
 0     MBA (N-N methylene bis acrylamide) (0.025-0.1 g in 5 ml water) were added to the reaction
       mixture and allowed to stir for 5 min. Then the initiator solution (0.07 g APS (Ammonium
       persulfate) in 5 ml water) was added to the mixture, the mixture was placed immersed in a
       temperature controlled water bath preset at 85'C for 40 minutes to complete polymerization. To
       neutralize (0-100%) acrylic groups, appropriate amount of NaOH (0-1 gr in 5 ml water) was
 5     added. The obtained gel was poured to excess nonsolvent ethanol (80 ml) and remained for 1 h.
   3) k-Carrageenan (kC) cross-linked-poly(acrylic acid)
       0.5-1 gr of kC (k-Carrageenan) was dissolved in 25 mL of distilled water, which was under
       vigorous stirring in a 100 ml beaker with a magnetic stirrer. The flask was immersed in a
 0     temperature controlled water bath at       80 0C . After complete dissolution of kC to form a
       homogeneous solution, certain amounts of AA (Acrylic Acid), and MBA (N-N methylene bis
       acrylamide) simultaneously added to the reaction mixture. Afterward, the solution was stirred
       and purged with nitrogen for 2 min to remove the dissolved oxygen. Then, a definite amount of
       APS(Ammonium persulfate) solution was added dropwise to the reaction flask under continuous
 5     stirring to generate free radicals. The reaction maintained at this temperature for 1 h to complete
       polymerization.
   4) Fully synthetic system (a sample for AAm):
       AAm (Acrylamide) (10 g) was mix with 25 ml distilled water at room temperature in a 50 ml
30     beaker equipped with magnetic stirrer. Then MBA (N-N methylene bis acrylamide) (0.008gr)
       was added into the mixture and allowed to stir for 10min. Then an initiator solution was added
       (0.07 g SPS (Sodium persulfate)). The mixture was placed into 5 ml template (4 gr solution each)
       and placed in a convention furnace (85 C) for 20 min. The product was washed overnight with
       ethanol (80 ml) to obtain the polymerized shell.

   Starch systems - sample for non- growing media
   1) modified starch cross-linked poly(acrylic acid)

   WO 2014/140918                                                               PCT/IB/2014/001194
        1-2.5 gr of Corn starch dissolved in deionized 20 ml water in 100 ml beaker at room temperature.
        The combination was mixed until a uniform mixture was formed. 2-3 gr AA (Acrylic acid) was
        added to the cooled mixture and the resulting mixture was stirred for five minutes. Next, 1-3 gr
        AAm (acrylamide) was added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred for five
 5      minutes. Then 0.005-0.01 gr of MBA (N-N methylene bis acrylamide)              dissolved in 5 ml of
        deionized water was added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred for five minutes.
        Lastly, 0.005 gr of APS ( ammonium persulfate) dissolved in 0.5 ml of deionized water; was
        added to the mixture and the resulting mixture was stirred while being heated to 80 0C The
        mixture was held at that temperature and stirred for approximately 15 minutes. Because the
 0      resulting viscous mass was acidic, the mixture was neutralized by titration with 45% potassium
        hydroxide (KOH) at room temperature. Titration continued until a pH of 7.0 was reached, which
        required addition of between about 0.2-16 g 45% KOH.
   2) Similar process to the CMC-AA system.
 5       (Exchanging CMC with corn-starch):
        1 gr of corn Starch was dissolved in 25 ml distilled water and were added to a 100 ml beaker with
        magnetic stirrer. The beaker was immersed in a temperature controlled water bath preset at 80'C.
        Then 2 ml of AA (Acrylic Acid) and MBA (N-N methylene bis acrylamide) (0.015 g in 5 ml
        water) were added to the reaction mixture and allowed to stir for 5 min. Then the initiator solution
 0      (0.07 g APS (Ammonium persulfate) in 5 ml water) was added to the mixture, the mixture was
        placed immersed in a temperature controlled water bath preset at 85'C for 40 minutes to complete
        polymerization. NaOH (0.5 gr in 5 ml water) was added in order to neutralize acrylic groups. The
        obtained gel was poured to excess nonsolvent ethanol (80 ml) and remained for 1 h.
25 Swelling cycles of selected formulations in water and two types of soil were tested. The ability of the
   SAPs to absorb water in relatively short time is an important physical property that allows
   maintaining its functionality in the soil throughout its life cycle. The following graphs present the
   swelling behavior of the different SAPs upon hydration-dehydration cycles in water. The ES of the
   investigated SAPs stay constant during three cycles, meaning good mechanical properties.
30
   The water content of several SAPs in sandy silica soil was measured following watering over a time
   period that is a typical watering cycle of crops and plants. The various SAPs gain water from the soil
   in the first 24 hours following by a mild decrease/increase over the next 125 hours. When SAPs were
   introduced to air dry less soil, initially it went under rapid de hydration, yet watering the soil reverse
35 the process and water were absorbed from the soil the soil recovery percentage were 99 and 50. The
   results indicate that all groups of SAPs can maintain their moisture in the sandy soil over a watering
   cycle and that CMC base SAPs can fully recovery from extreme dry condition in soil.

   Oxygen permeability of the SAPs was studied by measuring dissolved oxygen in water that was
   exposed to oxygen saturated water across a SAP. Altering dissolved oxygen level was done by
   bubbling nitrogen or oxygen gases into the water reservoir located opposite the sensor. SAPs made
 5 from Alginate and CMC showed an order magnitude more oxygen permeability than SAP of k
   carrageenan (Fig. 4).
   Dissolved Oxygen Test:
   Oxygen electrode place into a pre-swelled hydrogel in a 100 ml beaker. The dissolved oxygen inside
 0 the hydrogel was measured during N 2 bubbling or   02 bubbling (~0.5 liter per minute) as a function of
   time.
   The  02 measurements made by Lutron WA2017SD Analyzer with dissolved oxygen probe 0-20 mg/L,
   0-50 0C. The Dissolved Oxygen System is shown in Figure 13.

   Example 2. The Internal zone
   Three mechanisms were developed and evaluated to address the criteria of i) release rate of
   agrochemicals from the internal zone over a growing season, and ii) that no input residuals remain at
25 the end of a predetermined action period. All the three, are based on integrating the input into a very

   dense polymer as the basic mechanism to slow down diffusion, in conjunction to a secondary
   mechanism that will additionally decrease the diffusion rate:
         1)           Highly Cross Linked Polymer with silicon coating (xLP-Si);
         2)           Highly Cross linked Poly Acrylic/poly sugar with filler (xLP-F); and
 5       3)           Hybrid system (SiCLP -).
   The first mechanism is based on precipitation of silica, originated from silica water, on the surface of
   the polymer (Figure 4).
 o The second mechanism is based on filler, made from bentonite, integrated into the polymer and
   decreases sharply its diffusion properties (Figure 6).
   The third mechanism is to mix the silica with the acrylic while synthesizing the polymer in order to
   alter its diffusion coefficient (Figure 7).
 5
   The reduction in diffusion properties by each mechanism was experimentally tested. The internal zone
   was located in a free water reservoir where the concentration of a certain input (Nitrogen or
   Phosphorus) was measured over time.
 0 The release of nitrate from cornstarch internal zone with (blue) and without (red) silica coating is
   presented in Figure 7. A reduction of diffused nitrate was measured in the first 24 hours.
   Alternatively, the mixed silica mechanism yielded release of nitrate and phosphorus in the scale of
   weeks, as well.

   Experimentalsetup
   The experiment took place at the Southern Arava R&D station. A 125 square meters field plot,
 0 divided to 4 beds x 15 m long was served to test 3 application methods, six types and three sizes of
   hydrogels. Root penetration was studied in plot D.
   The experimental setup is shown in Figure 14.
 5 The three application conditions for plots A-C were:
   i) Uniform application in loose soil - to mimic conventional beds for vegetable crops;
   ii) Uniform application in compacted soil - to mimic conventional beds for vegetable crops, with
   compaction; and
   iii) Application in a furrow - to mimic a furrow in field row crops.
30
   A one square meter or one linear meter sub plots (50 cm apart) were used to apply 27 units of each
   hydrogel (plots A-C). The units were uniformly distributed on the soil surface and incorporated into
   the upper 15 cm of the soil profile. Similarly, a 20 cm deep furrow was dug and 27 units were
   distributed along one meter. Water was applied through a solid sprinkler set without fertilizer (1m3 =
35 8mm).

    The roots penetration plot (plot D) consisted of a 15 m long bed, where 25 hydrogels from each type
    were applied along a 1 m furrow of 20 cm deep. Maize was sown above the hydrogels at the same day
    and was irrigated with a solid set of sprinklers without fertilizes, that was switched after germination
    to a drip line (25 cm spacing, 2 1/h) with Idit liquid fertilizer (100 mg/l N). Irrigation was shut off on
 5  day 31 and was opened again one day before soil excavation. Visual dimensional measurements and
    qualitative information on root penetration were collected on day 50.
    Measurements included individual weight, dimension and tension of 3 units. Timing of water
    application to plots A-C and measurements are shown in Table 4 below:

    Resultsfor Plots A-C
    Changes in weight for each hydrogel type and size versus time are shown in Figure 16. The variable
    soil moisture was derived by the irrigation events (vertical bars). During the wetting phase,
    comprising of four consecutive irrigations (day-12), most of the hydrogels gained weight by
20  absorbing soil water. The poly sugar Alginate was the only type to lose weight throughout the
    experiment, although soil moisture fluctuated between very wet to mild dry soil. While medium and
    large hydrogels multiplied their own weight (equal to the amount of absorbed soil water) by 5-11
    times, the small hydrogel grew by 18 times. During the 16 days drying phase, hydrogels lost weight
    by 2-4 times (of the original weight) to the drying soil. No correlation between CMC percentage and

   water absorbance was found. This may imply that local conditions are more dominant than chemical
   composition.
   The final surface area derived from the volume and the geometry of the hydrogels is shown in Figure
                                                                          2
 5 17. Initial areas ranged between 25-30 cm 2 for medium size, 35 cm       for large size and 10 cm 2 for
   small size. Most medium hydrogels experienced a minor increase, up to 35 cm 2 , while Alginate
   decreased sharply and Semisynthetic CMC 50% AA (no. 5) increased dramatically to 60 cm 2 . The
   two large sizes increased to over 50 cm2 . Surface area of hydrogel units versus time is shown in
   Figure 18.
 0
   The ratio between surface areas to volume was constant to most hydrogels at the value of 2.5-3. The
   poly sugar Alginate and both small size hydrogels had high ratio due to their relatively small
   dimensions. Surface area to volume ratios for the hydrogels are shown in Figure 19.
 5 The distance between a chemical (positioned inside the hydrogel) and the adjacent soil determines the
   diffusion rates towards the soil. The minimal distance stands for the smallest edge of the hydrogel
   geometry. Moreover, the same value describes the potential zone for root growth. The initial minimal
   distance was in the range of 1-2 cm and final values increased to 1.5-2.5 cm. This entails that a
   chemical will need to diffuse 1-2 cm prior to reaching the soil. The poly sugar Alginate shrunk over
 0 time, reaching 0.5 cm in width. The small size hydrogel was difficult to follow, yet it stretched to 0.75
   cm. Final minimal distances of the hydrogels are shown in Figure 20. Figure 21 shows the minimal
   distance of hydrogel units versus time.
   Stiffness is an important parameter related to the potential of roots to penetrate the media and the
 5 potential of water to be absorbed. Measurements of stiffness were achieved by using a penetrometer
   gauge and a metal disc. The values shown in Figure 22 and 23 are in relative scale, representing the
   force that was required to push the disc on the surface of the hydrogel. No differences between
   medium and large sizes were found. The poly sugar Alginate was consistently very stiff throughout
   the experiments, contrary to the fully synthetic, which was relatively flexible. A negative trend
30 between CMC content and level of stiffness was observed.
   A photo of each hydrogel at the end of the experiment is shown in Figure 24. The Fully synthetic,
   Semisynthetic CMC 6% AAm, Semisynthetic CMC 25% AA maintained the original box shape.
   Similarly, Semisynthetic     CMC 6% AAm-Large,          Semisynthetic CMC 50% AA-Large                and

   from Semisynthetic CMC 6% AA, disintegrated into small particles. Semisynthetic CMC 50% AA

   into small particles. Semisynthetic CMC 50% AA lost its original box geometry and turned into an
   undefined geometry. All types of hydrogel experienced shrinkage relative to its maximum volume
   measured in the bare soil plots. Roots penetrated into all types of hydrogels. While course roots
   penetrated into the Fully synthetic, Semisynthetic CMC 25% AA and Semisynthetic CMC 50% AA
 5 hydrogels, only fine roots were found in the Semisynthetic CMC 6% AAm, Semisynthetic CMC 6%
   AA and Semisynthetic CMC 6% AAm-Large.
   Summary
   Six types and three sizes of hydrogels were tested in a field plot during wetting and drying periods.
 o Most of them were in accordance with soil moisture, absorbing water (up to 10 times their initial
   weight) in the first period and releasing water in the second one. Final surface area was 30-50 cm2
   The minimal dimension of the medium and large hydrogels was 1.5-2.5 cm, allowing sufficient
   volume for root penetration. Small hydrogels expanded to less than 1 cm, which would constrain the
   amount of chemicals which could be encapsulated within the hydrogel. Stiffness was evaluated and a
 5 major difference was found between hydrogel types. While most types maintained their original 3D
   geometry, a few disintegrated or deformed.
   Six types and three sizes of hydrogels were evaluated in a field plot for root penetration. Most types
   maintained their original 3D geometry, yet a few disintegrated, deformed or flushed away. Roots
30 penetrated into all hydrogels, but a few types had only fine roots while others had fine and course
   roots. The amount of root penetration and development observed in the different size hydrogels
   suggests that a minimum volume of hydrogel is required for root penetration and development.

   directly to roots. Current practices to deliver fertilizers to the plant roots mostly involve application of
   fertilizers to the soil, a highly variable media (physically, chemically and biologically). Such practices
   yield low efficiency of fertilizer uptake.
 5 Objective
   The primary objective was to study the effectiveness of hydrogels loaded with fertilizer (fertilizer
   units) to supply plant uptake requirements throughout the growing season. The secondary objective
   was to test the development of fine roots, dominant in mineral uptake, within the hydrogel.

   ExperimentalSetup
L5 The experiment took place at the Southern Arava R&D station. Twenty three rotating weighing
   lysimeters (Figure 26) served to test the fertilizer units versus fertigation (Fert.) and slow release
   fertilizer (SR, Osmocote@ Start 6 Weeks, Everris). The system allowed accurate monitoring of
   quantity and quality of irrigation and drainage water and plant water uptake. Fertilizer units,
   containing 0.625 g of the slow release fertilizer (N:P:K ratio by weight was 12:4.8:14.1 +
20 micronutrients), were distributed evenly at three depths: 30, 20 and 10 cm (Figure 27). Total weight of
   each unit during application was 6-7g.
   Sunflowers were used as a model plant. Two sunflowers were grown in each lysimeter. The
   lysimeters were irrigated daily (clay soil-twice a week) at an average rate of 200% of measured actual

   The sunflowers were sown on day 0 and harvested on day 33. Dune sand was selected due to its
   inerratic properties, minimizing adsorption to clay minerals and precipitation due to low bicarbonate
   content. Application dose of N, P and K per plant for each treatment is depicted in Figure 28. Plant
   height, no. of leaves, Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) values and NPK in drainage water

   and NPK content of the whole plant. Following harvest, the fertilizer units were excavated and NPK
   content was quantified.

   Stage 2
   The sunflowers were sown on day 0 and harvested on day 36. Application dose of N, P and K per
   plant for each treatment was half of the values depicted in Figure 28. Plant height, no. of leaves,
 5 SPAD values were recorded at points during the growing season. Final yield was evaluated as wet
   biomass.
   Results
 0 Stage 1
   Plant height, number of leaves and its N content, represented by SPAD values, throughout the
   growing season are presented in Figure 29.
   Differences in height and leaves between the fertilizer units and SR started from the beginning of the
 5 growing season and continued till the end (see Figure 35). SPAD values were higher during the main
   nutrient application period (DAP 20-45). The lower SPAD values measured at the end of the growing
   season for fertilizer unit treatment were attributed to earlier maturity, where nutrients are being
   transferred from the leaves to the seeds.
 o Plant dry matter, absolute NPK uptake amount and its efficiency are presented in Figure 30. The
   fertilizer units yielded larger plants and NPK uptake versus the Slow Release fertilizer. Within the
   fertilizer unit treatment, the full fertilization achieved higher plants and uptake, yet the efficiency was
   equal. The greatest fertilizer use efficiency of the fertilizer unit demonstrates the advantage of the new
   technology over current best practices.
25
   Relative residuals of NPK in the fertilizer units are depicted in Figure 31. The lower values, less than
   6%, indicate that most of the fertilizer was taken up by the plant or diffused to the soil.
   Stage 2
30 The dune sand, used in stage 1, has a low water holding capacity and high hydraulic conductivity,
   meaning that daily irrigation may not optimize day time plant water availability. The hydrogel's shell
   has the potential to improve water availability by absorbing water during irrigation and release it later
   at dry periods. Therefore, it was possible that the significant differences found in stage 1 could relate
   to two factors, namely fertilizers and water availability. Therefore, a comparison between fertilizer
35 units and empty fertilizer units installed in the root zone & fertigation (Empty units +Fert.) was
   conducted in stage 2.

   Plant height, no. of leaves, SPAD value along the growing season and wet biomass from each
   treatment are presented in Figure 32. Plants exposed to fertilizer units were advantageous over empty
   units + Fert. at all parameters (see Figure 35), suggesting that water availability plays a minor role
   relative to fertilizer supply under the experimental conditions. Plants which were fertilized by
 5 fertilizer units exhibited faster growth and enhanced biomass production.
   Stage 3
   The main drawbacks the invention overcomes in soils are:
        *    Diminishing leaching, adsorption and precipitation of ions.
 o      e    Maintaining high diffusion rate at variable moisture conditions.
        *    Minimizing root growth resistance.
        *    Allowing continuous biological activity.
        " Improving water holding capacity.
 5 These drawbacks can be overcome by replacing the soil with growing media, which is considered to
   provide the best conditions for plant growth. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the fertilizer
   units, SR and Fert. fertilization methods. The performance of fertilizer units in heavy clayey soil was
   tested at the 3rd stage.
 o Plant height, no. of leaves, SPAD value along the growing season and wet biomass for each treatment
   are presented in Figure 33. No significant differences were measured between treatments (see Figure
   35), suggesting that growing media generates similar properties as fertilizer units.
   Plant height, no. of leaves, SPAD value along the growing season and wet biomass for each treatment
25 are presented in Figure 34. Visual results of Example 4 are shown in Figure 35. Fertilizer units
   improved plant growth compared to SR (see Figure 35), demonstrating that fertilizer units are
   advantageous in various soil types.
   Summary
30 The study demonstrated the ability of the fertilizer units to deliver nutrients to plants throughout the
   growing season in various soils. Moreover, fertilizer units enhanced plant growth and final yield. The
   higher fertilizer use efficiency over current practice was due to various reasons:
        0    Extensive growth of active roots adjacent to the fertilizer source (See Figure 35).
35      e    Limited leaching from the fertilizer unit due to lack of mass flow across it.

            Maintaining high diffusion rates within the fertilizer unit in drying soil due to steady high
            moisture levels (unlike soil).
   Since the release rate of the fertilizer in this experiment was temperature dependent, the extreme high
 5 temperature which existed in the soil (average max. soil temp of 45.3 C) enhanced the diffusion rate
   and therefore the absolute efficiency values were relatively low (Figure 30).
   Roots did not penetrate empty units, probably due to a lack of fertilizer within the hydrogel and
   sufficient moisture for plant uptake.
 0
   The uptake efficiency shown in Figure 30 represents the ratio between the amount of fertilizer applied
   to the amount taken up by the plant. The higher uptake efficiency values observed for the fertilizer
   units compared to traditional SR fertilizer (Figure 30) suggests that less leaching of fertilizer towards
   groundwater occurs when fertilizer is applied using fertilizer units.

   ExperimentalSetup
 5 The experiment took place in a field plot located in the Western Galilee in Israel (N 33, E55). The site
   is characterized with heavy alluvial soil, rich in clay minerals, which induces high cation exchange
   capacity (-50 meq/100 g), high pH (-8) and intermediate salinity salinity (EC of saturated paste
   0.5dS/m). Dry weather conditions with mostly clear skies (average direct radiation- 670 W/m 2) were
   prevalent throughout the experiment. Maximum and minimum air and soil temperatures, midday
30 relative humidity and day time during the trial are presented in Table 7:

  A 150 square meter plot was divided into subplots based on randomized block design (Figure 36). To
  ensure initial low levels of soil nitrogen (N), millet was grown on the field plot without
  complementary fertilization for 30 days prior to trial initiation. The fertilizer units were compared to
  fertigation (Fert.- Urea based) and to slow released fertilizer application (SR, Osmocote@ Start 6
5 Weeks, Everris). Equal irrigation and N quantities were applied to all treatments. Nitrogen application
  rates were based on literature values, where cabbage was reported to utilize 3.6 g of N per plant and
  sunflower was reported to utilize 3g of N per plant. Plants were irrigated twice a week based on ET
  measurements and literature values for plant cover coefficient. Irrigation of sunflowers was ceased
  two weeks prior harvesting. The crops were planted on day 0 with planting densities of 40,000 plants
0 per hectare. The cabbage was harvested on day 70 and sunflower was harvested on day 89.
  The monitoring plan (Table 8) included plant development parameters throughout the growing season
  and final yield analysis. Data was collected from pre-marked plants, six plants in the middle row
  (cabbage) and 6-10 plants which exhibited similar development stage after two weeks (sunflower).

   Final yield analysis of cabbage biomass and N uptake for fertilizer unit versus conventional fertilizer
   application methods is shown in Figure 40. Significant differences were measured between the
   fertilizer unit and fertigation treatments, implying that nutrients are less available for plant uptake
 5 using conventional fertilizing methods.
   The final yield analysis of sunflower showed similar grain yield and N uptake by plants fertilized by
   the fertilizer unit application method relative to conventional fertilizer application methods (Figure
   41). Although no significant difference was measured, plants exposed to fertilizer units uptake more
 0 N than plants exposed to conventional fertilizing methods.
   Residuals of NPK in 10 fertilizer units from each plot are depicted in Figure 42. Nitrogen residuals
   were less than 2%, P less than 8% and K Less than 2.5%. These values indicate that most of the
   fertilizer was taken up by the plants or diffused into the soil.

   Residuals of N in the root zone (upper 30 cm of soil profile) of each crop are presented in Figure 43.
   Nitrogen accumulation in the root zone was tenfold higher in the sunflower plots and 4 times higher in
   the cabbage plots.
 o Nitrogen mass balance was calculated in the root zones of cabbage and sunflower (Figure 44).
   Fertilizer units exhibited higher N uptake efficiency over conventional fertilizing techniques,
   suggesting enhanced availability of fertilizers to plant uptake within the fertilizer units.
   Summary
 5 This study demonstrated the ability of the fertilizer units to deliver nutrients to plants throughout the
   growing season under normal field conditions. Moreover, fertilizer units enhanced plant growth
   (sunflower and cabbage) and increased the final yield (especially cabbage) compared to current
   practice. The higher N use efficiency over current practices is attributed to the following reasons:
             1. Extensive growth of active roots adjacent to the fertilizer source (determined visually).
30           2. Limited leaching from the fertilizer units due to lack of water flow across it.
             3. Maintaining high diffusion-dispersion rates within the fertilizer units in drying soil due to
             steady high moisture levels over time (unlike soil).

   The fertilizer units are made in two polymerization steps. In the first step, a bowl-like hydrogel
   structure is made by adding 4 ml of the monomer solution to a beads pattern using a multi-tip dosing
   devise. The beads pattern is then covered with a cones matrix and placed in a furnace at 85'C for 60
   minutes, thereby forming the bowl-like hydrogel structure. 1 g of Osmocote@ beads are then added to
30 the bowl-like structures. In the second polymerization step, an additional 3.5 ml of monomer solution is
   added to the beads pattern using the multi-tip dosing device. The beads pattern is then placed in a
   furnace at 85'C for 60 minutes, thereby forming the complete fertilizer unit.
   The fertilizer units are removed from the beads pattern and washed with ethanol for 10 minutes (50
35 beads in 1 L ethanol). The fertilizer units are then washed with water for 10 minutes (50 beads in 1 L
   ethanol). The fertilizer units are then dried at room temperature to a final weight of 3.5-4 g. Beads
   produced using the above process are shown in Figure 46.

   Example 8. Fertilizer units as fertilizer source for plants in volcanic origin soil and tropical climate.
   A field trial was conducted in Cartago, Costa-Rica (N9.862039, W83.898665). Local soil is classified
 5 as Andisol, a volcanic origin soil with graded soil particle distribution (Sand-50%, Silt- 20% and Clay
   30%), low pH (5.5), low salinity level (electrical conductivity-0.1mS/cm), low CEC (13.5meq/L) and
   high organic matter (3.1%). The climate is defined as tropical with a high annual precipitation rate
   (400-600cm per year), high humidity and steady high temperatures (26-1 10 C).
 o Celery and Lettuce seedlings, representative leafy crops, were transplanted on Day 0. The crops were
   fertilized by fertilizer units similar to the type described in Example 6 or solid commercial fertilizer
   (YaraMila TM Hydrocomplex 12:11:18+Mg+Micro).
   Amounts of fertilizer units and solid commercial fertilizer were calculated so that all plants received
 5 equal amounts of nitrogen: 2.5 and 3g of N per plant for celery and lettuce, respectively. Thirty three
   fertilizer units per meter at 25cm deep and 66 fertilizer units per meter at 15cm deep were applied in the
   celery plot. Eighty three fertilizer units per meter at 15 cm deep were applied in the lettuce plot. Solid
   fertilizer was applied after plant transplantation.
 o Marketable yield of each crop was evaluated on Day 45. Figure 48 presents the combined marketable
   yield of celery and lettuce. Data is presented as cumulative percentage of yield relative to control
   median of each treatment. Plants fertilized with fertilizer units were significantly larger compared to
   plants fertilized with the commercial solid fertilizer.
 5 Example 9. Microbial examination of fertilizer units
   A laboratory analysis of microbial colonies on the surface and inside fertilizer units was conducted to
   measure the transport of microbial communities from the soil to the fertilizer unit surface and into the
   internal zone.
30
   Microbial activity is required in controlling urea mineralization and enhancing biodegradability of the
   product. Fertilizer units were collected from the root zone of the experiments described in examples 5
   and 7. The number of microbial colonies was measured on the fertilizer unit surface and within the
   internal zone after roots penetrated and developed within it. A control group included new fertilizer
35 units that were not in contact with soil and plant roots. High concentration of microbial colonies was
   found on the surface and within the internal zone for both soil types and experimental conditions.
   Surface concentrations for fertilizer units ranged between 2.2x 104 to 2.9x 105 CFU/cm 2. Internal zone

  concentrations for fertilizer units ranged between 3.5x0        to 1.3x10    CFU/0.lg. Internal zone
  concentrations for new fertilizer units (control) were below 10 CFU/lg. The results suggested
  unrestricted transport of microbial communities from the soil towards the fertilizer unit surface and its
  inner zone.
5
  Materials and Methods
  The outside of the fertilizer units were washed with running tap water for about one minute and then
  washed with sterile water. Each washed sample was placed into a sterile bag containing 100 mL of
0 sterile water and manually shaken for about 3 minutes. The rinsing liquid in appropriate dilutions was
  examined for microbial count. The fertilizer unit samples were then aseptically cut and about 0.1 g of
  inner contents was removed, transferred to a tube with 10 mL of sterile water and vortexed for
  extraction of microorganisms. The extract was diluted and examined for microbial count. Microbial
  count was determined using the pour plate method with tryptic soy broth and incubation at 30-35'C for
5 two days. After incubation the number of microbial colonies was counted.

   Discussion
   High rates of inefficient agrochemical use are attributed to unknown root distribution, spatial
   variability in soil structure and texture (i.e. mineral and organic matter content), temporal variability
   of soil conditions (i.e. temperature, moisture, pH, aeration and salinity), temporal changes in plant
 5 demands of fertilizers and agrochemicals (i.e. species, development stage, root morphology), and
   climatic fluctuations throughout the growing season (i.e. rainfall, temperature, humidity, radiation and
   wind).
   Soil-less medium, where optimal conditions for efficient uptake by roots are maintained, is
 0 implemented solely in small scale containers in greenhouses. This practice is not feasible as a solution
   for large scale fields.
   An overall goal of the present invention is supplying fertilizers and other agrochemicals (e.g. nitrogen,
   phosphorus, potassium, fungicides, insecticides, etc.) directly to plant roots at required amounts and
 5 timing regardless of soil and crop types and conditions.
   Availability and uptake of fertilizer from commercial products are dramatically affected by soil due to
   the pH and reactions with various cations. The present invention relates to universal additives and
   formulations that are not affected by soil type or pH, due to the formation of an artificial environment.
 0
   A problem with the additions of small SAP beads (super absorbent polymer with diameter of 1 cm) is
   a fast diffusion of the additives into the soil. In contrast to the SAP beads that are currently used, the
   unit for delivery of agrochemicals to the roots of a plant of the present invention have a bigger size (in
   some embodiments, a fully hydrated volume greater than 600 ml), which prevents this problem.
 5 Aspects of the present invention also prevent properties from changing due to salts entering the soil.
   Furthermore, the concepts herein based on the formation of an artificial environment in the field, in
   contrast to other technology that use hydrogels as a solid replacement.
   The an artificial environment formed by the units of the present invention encourages root growth and
30 development within the unit, which enhances and promotes efficient nutrient uptake. Thus, plants
   fertilized using the units of the present invention can grow faster and/or produce a greater yield than
   crops fertilized by traditional methods. The artificial environment formed by the units of the present
   invention mitigates the effects of suboptimal soil conditions by, for example, providing a root
   development zone which minimizes root growth resistance, provides nutrients, maintains moisture
35 levels, and protects from the effects of low ambient temperature.

   Aspects of the present invention that are advantageous and unique over current technologies and
   practices include but are not limited to:
        -   Universality - embodiments of the present invention are not dependant on temporal and
            spatial variations of soil, crop and weather.
 5      -   Simplicity - embodiments of the present invention relate to a single application using
            conventional equipment.
        -   Economy - embodiments of the present invention save labor and the amount of agrochemical
            input (fertilizers and otheragrochemicals, and energy) for the farmer.
        -   Sustainability- embodiments of the present invention protect the environment (water bodies
 0          and atmosphere) from contamination as a result of leaching, runoff and volatilization of
            agrochemicals.
        -   Yield - embodiments of the present invention enhance plant growth rates and yield.
   The present invention provides artificial environments that encourage or promote root growth or
 5 development in different soil types. Root growth and development are a function of moisture, oxygen,
   nutrients and mechanical resistance. The data herein showed that alginate preformed markedly well
   with respect to root development. However, additional formulations (semi-synthetic CMC and fully
   synthetic- acrylic acid and acrylamide) show root growth as well. Aspects of the present invention
   relate to artificial environments that provide, moisture and nutrients, while being mechanically resistant
 0 and permeable to oxygen. The data herein described herein demonstrated the ability of the units of the
   invention to deliver water and nutrients to plants throughout the growing season leading to enhanced
   plant growth. The data described herein further demonstrated that the units of the invention can be used
   to successfully deliver nutrients to plants in variable soil types and variable climate conditions.
