      A towing mirror including: a mount adapted to be mounted to
a vehicle cabin;    an extension component including a first member
or  portion    extending    from    said   mount   and  a    second     member
operatively    connected    to   said    first   member   or     portion      for
movement   relative    thereto    from    a  retracted    position      to     an
extended position;     and a mirror component operatively connected
to  said  second   member   for   pivoting   movement   relative      thereto
about a generally horizontal       axis extending substantially         in    the
intended direction of travel of         the vehicle cabin to which the
mirror is   to be mounted.

                                             VEHICLE MIRRORS
             This invention relates                 to vehicle mirrors               and in    particular
  mirrors of the type which are mounted outside the cabin and more
  particularly those mirrors known as "towing mirrors".
5            Towing mirrors            are typically          fitted     to vehicles when towing
  caravans,           fifth       wheelers      or    other       vehicles       in    order    to     extend
  the rearward line of                   sight of         the driver beyond the caravan                     or
  other        vehicle         being    towed.      Towing vehicles              may    be  a   two      wheel
  drive vehicle such as a sedan but in                             recent years with the advent
0 of larger caravans and off-road destinations, the towing vehicle
  is    typically            a  large    four-wheel-drive              vehicle       such    as    a   Toyota
  Landcruiser,              Nissan Patrol,          Ford F250 or the like               and the caravan
  is typically significantly wider than the towing vehicle.
             Historically,            the    caravanning            public      temporarily          mounted
5 towing mirrors to the driver side door of the towing vehicle for
  the      journey          to  a    holiday     destination          so   that      the   driver        could
  see following traffic and then removed them when the destination
  was reached so that the vehicle could be used at the destination
  or     left      them on        if   the vehicle           was    not  needed.        If   the mirrors
0 were        removed          upon    reaching        the      destination           they    had       to  be
  refitted for the return journey which might be some two or three
  weeks later. However, nowadays, people seem to holiday by way of
  continual travel so that the caravan might be unhitched for only
  one      or    two days         in   many    cases       and    the   towing vehicle            used     for
5 local        sightseeing.            Consequently           the     temporary         towing       mirrors
  have to be removed and replaced much more often and consequently
  the         older         style      temporary           towing       mirrors         are      generally
  unsatisfactory.                 Moreover,        nowadays        there     is     considerably          more
  traffic          on      the    roads    travelling           at    a  greater         speed      than    in
0 earlier years and towing mirrors need to be more stable and more
  structurally sound.

                                                      2
         In    recent         years,      permanent           towing      mirrors         have    been
  developed which allow the mirror to be easily moved from a non
  towing position            to  a   towing       position        and   vice    versa.       However,
  while   such mirrors provide easier movement of the mirror,                                     they
5 generally          do      not    meet         the       requirements          of       government
  authorities.
         In that        respect,      Government authorities                in    some countries
  specify the maximum extent of a towing mirror beyond the cabin
  of the towing vehicle             for the case when the vehicle is                      not towing
0 and when      it    is    towing.     For     example,        the maximum        extent      of  the
  mirror beyond the widest part of the cabin might be 150 mm when
  the vehicle is            not towing       anything and 390 mm when the vehicle
  is  towing a        caravan      which      might be        necessary      in    order      to give
  the driver        vision beyond           the     caravan being         towed.     However,      the
5 permanent        towing mirrors           which       are   presently      available         do  not
  meet the specifications and provide the necessary vision.
         In this        specification, the               term "permanent towing mirror"
  is  to   be    understood        as    referring          to   a   towing    mirror       which   is
  movable     from       a   non-towing        position        to    a  towing     position       even
0 though it may be removed entirely from the vehicle and replaced
  by the vehicle' s own factory mirror when the vehicle is                                  no longer
  being used to tow a caravan or the like.
         The     present        invention          is     aimed     at   providing         permanent
  towing mirrors which are adjustable from a non-towing                                  (or stowed)
5 position in which the mirror is closer to the vehicle cabin and
  a towing     (or extended)          position         in   which the mirror provides the
  desired rearward vision.
        With       the     foregoing      in     view,      the    invention      in     one   aspect
  resides broadly in a towing mirror including:
0        a mount adapted to be mounted to a vehicle cabin;

                                     3
       an extension component including a first member or portion
  extending  from   said   mount   and  a   second   member     operatively
  connected to said first member or portion for movement relative
  thereto from a retracted position to an extended position; and
5      a  mirror  component    operatively   connected     to   said  second
  member for pivoting movement relative thereto about a generally
  horizontal   axis    extending    substantially     in     the    intended
  direction of travel of the vehicle cabin to which the mirror is
  to be mounted.
0      Suitably, the extension component is relatively short when
  in the retracted position and substantially longer when in the
  extended position.
       In another aspect,    the invention resides broadly in a towing
  mirror including:
5      a mount adapted to be mounted to a vehicle cabin;
       an extension component including a first       member operatively
  connected at one end to said mount for pivoting movement relative
  thereto  about  a  generally    vertical   axis  and   a   second   member
  operatively connected to said first      member for movement relative
0 thereto from a retracted position to an extended position; and
       a  mirror  component    operatively   connected     to   said  second
  member for pivoting movement relative thereto about a generally
  horizontal   axis    extending    substantially     in     the    intended
  direction of travel of the vehicle cabin to which the mirror is
5 to be mounted and spaced from said vertical axis.
       Suitably, the extension component is relatively short when
  in the retracted position and substantially longer when in the
  extended position. That is to say, when the extension component
  is retracted it does not extend as far outwards from the side of
0 the vehicle cabin as it does when in the extended position. In
  a  preferred   form,   the   extension   component   in     the   extended

                                                          4
  position         is     approximately            twice        the     length        of    the     extension
  component in the retracted position.
            Preferably            the       mirror           component              is       substantially
  rectangular in form and is operatively connected to said second
5 component for pivoting movement about a pivot axis adjacent one
  end whereby           it     can move        through       an     arc of      up     to    180'or       even  a
  full      circle       such     that     in     one    position          at   least        a  substantial
  part of         the mirror component                 can     overlie said second member of
  the extension component and in                        another position                is   substantially
0 beyond        said      second       member.        Accordingly,             the     pivoting          of   the
  mirror        component         provides         further         extension          outward        from     the
  vehicle         whereby       the    driver        of    the     vehicle        is     afforded        a   view
  through the mirror further back than in either the retracted or
  overlying          positions         of     the    extension            component         and/or        mirror
5 component          respectively. For convenience,                           the position            at which
  the      mirror       component          overlies          the      second       component           will    be
  referred to as the overlying position and the position where the
  mirror        component          is   pivoted         substantially              beyond        the      second
  component will be referred to as the outlying position.
0           In one such preferred form where the horizontal pivot axis
  is     adjacent         one     corner        of    the     mirror         component,          the      mirror
  component moves through an                       arc of        900    with the          result that         the
  mirror component               is    substantially above and outside beyond the
  pivot        axis.       Advantageously,               such       arrangement             optimises         the
5 extension          of     the   mirror        component          laterally          from      the     vehicle
  cabin       and     optimises        the     mount       position          on   the      cabin     by     being
  lower on the cabin wall where the wall is structurally stronger
  or at least has room for in wall reinforcing members.
            Preferably          the    mirror       component          is    mounted        to   the      second
0 member such that the mirror component                                is rearward of the second
  member;         that     is   to say,       the second component                   is    forward of         the
  mirror component in the direction of vehicle travelling forward

                                          5
  and does not      interfere    with  the driver's         vision in       the mirror
  component. Moreover, such arrangement allows the first member in
  the second member to be constructed in a manner whereby they can
  be shaped to withstand wind forces without interfering with the
5 driver's vision.
        In a further preferred form, lighting means is provided on
  an outer upper forward portion of the mirror component when in
  the overlying position.         The  lighting means          is  suitably of      the
  kind which drivers would use to indicate a change of direction,
0 such as    turning    or changing    lanes.      In   such form,       the lighting
  means   has a lens     arranged    for visibility         from a wide        range of
  angles, including from behind as well as from on top so that the
  indicator is visible from the side when the mirror component is
  in either the overlying position or the outlying position.
5       In   one preferred      form,   the   second      member     is   arranged   to
  slide longitudinally relative to the first member or portion to
  thereby     move    from   the   retracted       position       to    the    extended
  position. In such form, it is preferred that the first member or
  portion      and   the   second    member     are      constructed        so   as  to
0 incorporate      keying     means   which     prevent        the    second     member
  rotating relative to the first member or portion through an arc
  about the longitudinal axis of the first member or portion. In
  one preferred form, the first member or portion and the second
  member    have   complementary      noncircular        cross-sectional         shapes
5 such   as   rectangular     whereby   one   can     slide    tightly     inside   the
  other    without    any   relative   rotational         movement.       However,   in
  another    form,   one or more protrusions           or a single longitudinal
  protrusion and a complementary longitudinal recess are provided
  respectively on the first        member or portion and the second member
0 respectively        to     prevent      relative         rotational          movement
  therebetween.

                                        6
        In    this     specification,      the    terms    "vertical"       and
  "horizontal"    have   been   used   to  differentiate    two    degrees   of
  freedom or two general modes        of movement.    However,   those terms
  are intended only to express         a general   orientation      to achieve
5 rotational    movement    forwards     and   backwards   in   the     general
  direction    of  travel   and   inwards    and  outwards   away     from  the
  vehicle   cabin   and upwards    and downwards    to achieve      rotational
  movement towards and away from the vehicle cabin and are not to
  be   construed    as   limiting    the   invention    to  any     particular
0 orientation.

       Fig. 34 is an exploded plan view from above of yet another
       towing     mirror       according        to    the   invention      adapted     to be
       mounted to the right-hand side of the vehicle and showing
       parts making up the various components of the towing mirror.
0       The towing mirror or mirror assembly 10 illustrated                         in Figs.
  1 to 30   includes a mount 11 adapted to be mounted to the outer
  skin   of  the      door     of    a    vehicle,      an   extension       component    12
  connected at one end to the mount 11 by a vertical pivot pin 13,
  and a mirror or mirror component 14 connected to the other end
5 of the extension component                by a horizontal          pivot pin     16 which
  can be more clearly seen in Fig 15.
       Advantageously,            the     extension       component      12    comprises    a
  first member 18 to which the vertical pivot pin 13 is                             fixed at
  its  proximal       or    inner     end     and   a   second      member    19   which  is
0 slidably    mounted         on    the      first     component       for    longitudinal
  movement   relative        thereto       along    a horizontal        axis   20  shown in

                                                     10
  Fig. 1, that is,          towards and away from the mount 11 as required.
  Notably,     the      pivot    pin      13    is    engaged       in     a     complementary          bore
  provided in       the mount and secured therein                      by a circlip             or similar
  means    (not    shown)      for     pivoting movement                relative            to   the mount
5 about     a  vertical         axis       21.     Notably,         the        first        member     is   a
  substantially           rectangular            in     outer     shape           and       slides     in   a
  complementary          rectangular          shaped       cavity       in      the      second     member,
  the rectangular shape of both being such as to prevent relative
  rotation between the two components about the longitudinal axis
0 20.
         The mirror component 14                   in turn is mounted to the outer or
  distal     end   of    the   second        member       19  of     the      extension          component
  for pivoting movement               about a horizontal                 axis        23 which extends
  generally in the direction of travel of the vehicle to which the
5 mount 11     is to be secured.
         It will be appreciated that the mirror is in the retracted
  position shown in Figs.                1 to 6 for normal non-towing driving of
  the vehicle. In that position, the mirror is relatively close to
  the    vehicle       cabin     to      which       the     mount        is       secured        with    the
0 extension      component         fully       retracted        with         the      first      extension
  member almost fully encompassed by the                             second extension member
  while    the mirror component                 is   disposed almost                 fully behind the
  extension component,              that     is,     in   a position             most distal         to   the
  vehicle cabin.
5        It will      also be        appreciated that             the mirror is                in a first
  extended position shown in Figs.                        7 to    14 whereby the extension
  component      12     is   a   fully       extended,         that        is,       with      the   second
  extension member drawn along the first extension member so that
  the mirror component is in a middle disposition further from the
0 vehicle cabin but in the same attitude as shown in Figs. 1 to 6.

                                                             11
            Further, it will also be appreciated that the mirror is in
  a    second     or    fully       extended            position            shown       in     Figs.     15    to     22
  whereby the extension component 12 is fully extended as in Figs.
  7 to 14 but in the fully extended position the mirror component
5 has been rotated            through 900              in    a clockwise direction                   when viewed
  from the rear of the vehicle thereby placing the mirror component
  further       from     the     vehicle.           This         is      achieved        by     the   horizontal
  pivot      pin    16 being        mounted           in      corner        portion         31   of   the mirror
  component, that corner portion being the outermost portion when
0 in    the retracted         position         and then becoming the innermost portion
  when in the extended disposition.
            As can be more clearly                  seen in           Fig.    31,     the horizontal pivot
  pin     16   extends       from a        lower         outermost            corner        41   of   the     second
  extension member or portion 19                               and is        arranged so           that it         fits
5 into a recess 42 provided in the first extension member when the
  extension         component          is     fully           retracted.            Advantageously,                such
  arrangement          allows       the      extension              component           12    to maximise           its
  slidable       length       while        at     the       same       time     maximises         the     vertical
  and     horizontal         extent        to which             the      mirror       component         can pivot
0 about the horizontal                 axis 16 thereby maximising the extension of
  the      towing     mirror.         It     will         be     appreciated             that     selection           of
  different         shaped      mirrors           provides              for    higher         or  wider      vision
  depending         on    the    circumstances                   but       the    minimum         width      of     the
  retracted        mirror       assembly             is      substantially               determined         by      the
5 width      of   the    mirror         when       in      the       fully      retracted         position          and
  that width determines the height of                                     the mirror when             in the        90
  arc position          as    shown       in    Fig.         15     or the       1800      arc position            (not
  shown).
            Various positions of the extension component can be set by
0 way of       a spring-loaded detent                        in one component                  engaging with a
  mating seat in           the other component.                       Thus,     the extension component
  might have an            inner position seat,                         and outer position seat                     and

                                              12
  one or two        intermediate seats        so that       any desired one of those
  positions can be selected. Similarly, a spring-loaded detent can
  be provided in the mirror component to engage with a 0                                arc seat
  in    the    outer   extension   member,       a    900   arc       seat   and   a   1800    arc
5 seat if desired to achieve the desired purpose.
            The  towing   mirror   110   illustrated             in    Figs.    32   and    33  is
  similar to the towing mirror 10 illustrated in Figs.                              1 to 31 in
  many respects and consequently, corresponding reference numbers
  are used to reference corresponding features except prefaced by
0 a "1".      The main difference is          that the extension component                     112
  is not pivotally mounted to the mount                    111.       It still comprises a
  first      extension    member   118    and     a    second        extension     member      119
  which is slidably mounted on extension member 118, but extension
  member 118 is        immovably fixed to the mount                   111.  That is to say,
5 whereas       the   extension     member       18     in    mirror       assembly        10   is
  pivotally       mounted to mount 11,       in   this    particular         mirror assembly
  110,      there is no pivot action provided for between the extension
  member      118   and the mount     111.     However,        the     extension      component
  112     comprising     the   inner   member       118    and      the   outer    member      119
0 operates       in   much   the  same    manner        as    in      the  previous        mirror
  assembly described and the mirror component                           114 pivots        about a
  horizontal axis relative to the extension member 119 in much the
  same manner as the previous mirror assembly.
            The towing mirror 210 illustrated in Fig. 34                       is   similar in
5 many respects to the towing mirror 10                    illustrated in Figs.               1 to
  31 and consequently, corresponding reference numbers are used to
  reference       corresponding     features        except prefaced            by a     "2".   The
  towing mirror 210 is illustrated in Fig. 34 with more detail in
  respect of the         components making up the various parts,                          but the
0 reference numerals still commence with a "2"                          for consistency.
            The extension component 212 is shown above the dotted line
  225     and   the   mirror    component       214    below        the   dotted     line     224,

                                                  13
  except     for      a  part    covering        the    line   and   one   of    the  parts
  described later.          The first    member 218 forms part of the extension
  component       embraced      by the     double-dot        dashed   line    226   and  the
  remaining parts of the extension component 212 form the second
5 member 219.
        The     first     member has       a main part        232   covered    by a first
  forward      cover     233   and    a   first       rearward    cover   234    which   are
  clipped together by mating parts or otherwise fastened together
  by fasteners such as screws or nuts and bolts. The first covers
0 each have a proximal expanded portion 236 and an elongate distal
  portion 237 and each cover mates with the other to substantially
  encapsulate the main part. The man part has a pivot assembly 235
  for the pivot 213.
        The second member has a forward part 241 and rear part 242
5 which are fastened together by clips of fasteners to enclose the
  distal     portion        of   the    first      member     for   sliding     engagement
  therewith. A second forward cover 243 and a second rearward cover
  244  are formed         to clip together            to cover    the forward      and rear
  parts,   all    being parts of the second member.                The clip arrangement
0 for  fastening         the   covers     together       are   arranged    internally     to
  provide an outside           surface free          from screw heads and the like.
  The rear part has a protuberance 245 extending rearwardly from
  the distal       end to provide a accommodate a pivot pin                   (not shown).
        The mirror component has a mirror cowling 250 which forms
5 the main structural part, being pivoted to the distal end of the
  second     component       by way of        the pivot      pin associated       with   the
  protuberance 245, the location of the pivot being obstructed by
  another      part     described     below.       A    mirror   support    frame    252  is
  mounted inside the mirror cowling and is operatively associated
0 with a mirror cradle 253.             A mirror        (not shown)   is  mounted to the
  rear side of the mirror cradle and a 2-dimensional pivot assembly
  254  is    mounted       intermediate         the mirror      cradle   and    the mirror

                                                             14
  support         frame       to     provide        the       aforesaid        operative           association
  between the mirror cradle and the mirror support                                             frame. The           2
  dimensional           pivot        assembly         provided         for    up     and     down      and      side
  to-side        rotation          of    the     mirror         cradle     about        one     or     two      pivot
5 points forward of the mirror cradle.
            A lamp assembly 260 is mounted to the upper outer corner of
  the      mirror      cowling,          an     aperture         261    being provided               therein        to
  accommodate            same.       The      lamp      assembly         has     forward        and      rearward
  facing        lamps       providing            multidirectional                 indicator           lights        as
0 hereinbefore             described.           This      is    the part        mentioned          above which
  in     the     illustration               covers         the     dotted       line       and      the       second
  rearward cover 244.
            In  use,      two towing mirrors                  are provided for a motor vehicle
  according         to     the     invention,            each      being     opposite          handed        to    the
5 other.       The      towing         mirrors         are      normally         left       in    their         fully
  retracted position when the vehicle                                  is  not      towing anything. If
  a small towed vehicle is hitched to the towing vehicle, such as
  a    trailer        or    small        boat,        one      or    both    towing         mirrors         may     be
  extended         to    their        partially           extended        position          by    sliding          the
0 second       member       out      from the          first       member.       The     first       and      second
  members        have       a    spring         loaded        arrangement           locking          the      second
  member       in    either         the     retracted           or    the    extended          position          with
  respect        to    the     first        member        so    that     the    towing         mirror        is   not
  inadvertently or unintentionally moved between positions such as
5 by wind action against the towing mirrors when the vehicle is in
  motion.
            For    towing larger               vehicles,          such    as    caravans,          large        boats
  or     other     equipment,           the      towing mirrors             may      be    extended          to    the
  full      extent by pivoting the mirror outward,                                 again against spring
0 loading which locks the mirror component in either the overlying
  position         (retracted) or the outlying position                                 (extended).
