                                      ABSTRACT
A trailer has a container with top doors having a frame and weatherproof
thermoplastic inserts. Sealing flaps are provided at edges of the top doors to make
sealing contact with sidewall top rails or top edges of end walls and tailgate. The top
doors have angled extensions with grooves for ball gaskets to overlap in hand-in
hand fashion to form a reliable seal where the top doors come together. The system
provides a weatherproof means to enclose the container to prevent or deter entry of
water.

                                    WATERPROOF TOP DOOR FOR TRAILER
[0001] This disclosure accompanies a divisional application of AU<removed-apn>, the
contents of which are incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
FIELD
[0002]                     The present disclosure relates generally to top-loadable cargo trailers.
BACKGROUND
[0003]                     Trailers are widely used to transport various materials. For example,
tipper trailers and walking floor trailers are widely used to transport particulate bulk
material such as gravel, stone, grain, and road salt. Dump trailers are also used for
transporting such material, as well as other material such as garbage.
[0004]                     Some trailers have a top opening for loading of materials into the trailer.
Such trailers may loaded from through a top opening of the trailer using a loader or
directly from a feed source such as an overhead chute. A tarp or other sheet covering
is commonly used to cover the top opening of the trailer while the trailer is towed to
its destination. Tie-downs such as bungees, ropes, or straps are commonly used to
tie down the tarp to secure it in place while the trailer is in motion.
[0005]                      Some common problems with the use of tarps in this way is that they
are subject to damage by puncturing or otherwise by contact with the contents of the
trailer, they may become loose and shift out of a desired covering position, and they
are cumbersome and time-consuming to mount and unmount from the trailer.
[0006]                     Alternatively, a trailer may be provided with one or more top doors
which may be closed to protect the loaded material from contamination or from being
disturbed or blown about or out of the trailer during transport. Each top door is
typically mounted to the container along an adjoining upper edge of a sidewall of the
container by means of a number of hinges.
                                                        1
10354549_1 (GHMatters) P106920.AU.1

[0007]                     When a trailer is provided with top doors, however, it is desirable for the
top doors to be weatherproof such that the top doors are resilient to varying weather
conditions, and moreover prevent water from entering the trailer container.
[0008]                      In general, it is desirable for trailers to have a construction and to be
made of materials which are both durable and as light as possible to provide both
longevity against rough handling as well as optimal fuel economy. Given the tight
turnaround times typically faced in cargo hauling using trailers, it is desirable to be
able to repair any damage as quickly as possible.
[0009]                     There is therefore a material value in addressing the above deficiencies
of conventional open-top trailers and tarp tie-down methods.

DESCRIPTION
[0019]                     An open-top trailer with weatherproof top doors is shown in FIG's 1-7.
[0020]                     The open-top trailer has one or more top doors openable to expose a
top opening of a container of the trailer to enable loading or unloading of bulk
materials from the container, and closeable to conceal and protect the bulk material
from weather and contaminants.
[0021]                      In one embodiment, the trailer is similar to a trailer as disclosed in
World              Intellectual        Property   Organization     International  Application   No.
PCT/CA2015/050439                    ("the PCT Application"), the entirety of which is incorporated
herein by reference.
[0022]                      In the present description, the relative terms inner, outer, upper, and
lower, and related or derivative terms such as inward, outward, upward, and
downward, or inside, outside, above, and below, respectively, are defined relative to
a trailer in its usual, upright orientation, as follows. The trailer is characterized by a
longitude being its longest dimension and the general rolling direction of the wheels
of its wheeled suspension, and a transverse being the horizontal dimension
orthogonal to the longitude. The term inner and its derivatives means at, about,
toward, or relatively proximate a transverse center of the trailer. The term outer and
its derivatives means at, about, toward, or relatively proximate a transverse extremity
at a sidewall of the container of the trailer. The term upper and its derivatives means
at, about, toward, or relatively proximate a vertical top of the trailer. The term lower
and its derivatives means at, about, toward, or relatively proximate a vertical bottom
of the trailer.
[0023]                     With reference to FIG's 1 & 2, a trailer 10 has a container 20 supported
by a wheeled suspension 30. The container 20 has two opposing sidewalls 40 and
                                                         3
10354549_1 (GHMatters) P106920.AU.1

two top doors 70 for selectively closing a top opening 80 of the container 20. The
container 20 may further have a front wall (not shown), an end wall 50, and a floor
60. The floor 60 may be a walking floor, or another other suitable type of trailer floor
including a bare floor. Each top door 70 is hingedly mounted at an outer edge 90 of
the top door 70, which may be at an upper rail 100 of a corresponding sidewall 40.
Each top door 70 may be mounted using any suitable hinged mounts 105 which may
include the double, or compound                     hinge assemblies, described in the PCT
Application. The top doors 70 may be similarly automatically opened and closed
using a top door opening mechanism as disclosed therein. The top doors 70 may be
formed of any desired material. In one embodiment, the top doors 70 are formed of
sheet aluminum. In general, the top doors 70 disclosed herein may be used in place
of the top doors disclosed in the PCT Application, but otherwise the remainder of the
teachings of the PCT Application may be applied.
[0024]                      In some embodiments, best shown in FIG's 3-7, each top door 70 may
have an outer door rail 110, an inner door rail 120, a plurality of lower cross struts
130 (shown best in FIG. 4), a plurality of upper cross struts 140 (shown best in FIG's
2 & 3), at least one door panel 150, door panel fasteners 160, and an end rail 170.
[0025]                     The outer door rail 110 may extend along a length of the top door 70 at
the outer edge 90 of the top door 70. The outer door rail 110 may have an inward
face 180 (best seen in FIG. 6), a retaining lip 190 at an upward face 200 defining an
inward slot 210, and a lower slot 220 at a downward face 230. The lower slot 220
may slidingly receive a sidewall seal, such as a sidewall flap 240, for sealingly
contacting an opposing upper surface of the corresponding sidewall 40, such as an
outwardly-sloping upper surface 250 of the upper rail 100 when the top door 70 is
closed. Such sealing contact may prevent entry of water into the container 20, and
moreover the outwardly-sloping upper surface 250 may urge any water or moisture to
flow downward and out of the container. The sidewall flaps 240 may be particularly
suitable where the top door 70 is configured to open 2700, as when the compound
                                                       4
10354549_1 (GHMatters) P106920.AU.1

hinge assemblies taught in the PCT Application are used, as they repeatedly move
and form a seal at the top rail when the top door is opened and closed.
[0026]                     The inner door rail 120 may extend along the length of the top door 70
substantially parallel to the outer door rail 110 and proximate to a transverse center
260 of the container 20. The inner door rail 120 may have an outward face 270 (best
seen in FIG. 7), and a retaining lip 280 at an upward face 290 of the inner door rail
120 defining an outward slot 300. The inner door rail 120 may have a closure bracket
310 comprising an arm 320 comprising an inwardly projecting upper arm 330 ending
at an elbow 340 and a forearm 350 projecting vertically from the elbow 340. The
closure bracket 310 may support an inner seal mounted in an inner seal slot, which
may be include the forearm 350 ending in a gasket slot 360 slidingly to receive a
gasket 370, which may be any suitable seal including a ball seal. When the top doors
70 are closed, the gasket 370 of the closure bracket 310 may sealingly contact an
opposing surface 380 of the closure bracket 310 of the other top door 70, which may
be an opposing surface 380 of the upper arm 330 of the closure bracket 310 of the
other top door 70. For example, the forearm 351 of a first top door 71 may project
upwardly, a sealing surface 371 of the inner seal or gasket 372 of the first top door
71 may face upwardly, and the opposing surface 382 of the upper arm 332 of the
closure bracket 312 of the second top door 72 may face downwardly sealingly to
contact the sealing surface 371 of the gasket 372 when the top doors 70 are closed.
Similarly, the forearm 352 of the second top door 72 may project downwardly, a
sealing surface 373 of the inner seal or gasket 374 of the second top door 72 may
face downwardly, and the opposing surface 381 of the upper arm 331 of the closure
bracket 311 of the first top door 71 may face upwardly sealingly to contact the sealing
surface 373 of the gasket 374 when the top doors 70 are closed. When the top doors
70 are closed, the respective closure brackets 310 of the top doors 70 may be
engaged in a hand-in-hand arrangement, and thus form a double seal. In some
embodiments, additional plastic material, such as thermoplastic or thermoplastic
                                                      5
10354549_1 (GHMatters) P106920.AU.1

composites as noted above, or flexible and curable sealant, may be used to provide
a seal at or along the grooves.
[0027]                     The upper cross struts 140 and the lower cross struts 130 may
transversely bridge the inner door rail 120 and the outer door rail 110. Each lower
cross strut 130 may be affixed at respective opposite ends 390 of the lower cross
strut 130, which may be by fasteners, which may be welds, at joints 400 with the
inward face 180 of the outer door rail 110 and the outward face 270 of the inner door
rail 120. The joint 400 with the outer door rail 110 may include flanges 410.
[0028]                     The outer door rails 110, inner door rails 120, lower cross struts 130,
and upper cross struts 140 may be formed of any suitable materials, which in some
embodiments includes aluminum, which may be extruded aluminum.
[0029]                     The door panel 150 may be sandwiched between the lower cross struts
130 and upper cross struts 140. Respective opposite edges 420 of the door panel
150 (shown in FIG. 5) may be slidingly received in the inward slot 210 of the outer
door rail 110 (shown best in FIG. 6) and the outward slot 300 of the inner door rail
120 (shown best in FIG. 7). The door panel 150 may have sufficient flexibility and
rigidity that it may be bowed slightly and inserted at the opposite edges 420 in the
inward slot 210 and outward slot 300. When released, the door panel 150 may cease
to bow, or bow less, and flatten, at least partially, such that the opposite edges 420
slide into the inward slot 210 and outward slot 300. Clamping means, such as
fasteners 160, which may be screws or bolts, may be provided and extend through
corresponding openings in the upper cross struts 140 and the door panel 150 to the
lower cross struts 130 to clamp the door panel 150 between the upper cross struts
140 and lower cross struts 130. Doing so may cause the door panel 150 to flatten
further, causing a lateral dimension to increase, and for contact to be made at the
opposite edges 420 of the door panel 150 to respective opposing surfaces of the
inward slot 210 and outward slot 300. Pressure between these opposing surfaces
and the opposite edges 420 of the door panel 150 may be sufficient to form a seal.

10354549_1 (GHMatters) P106920.AU.1

Alternatively, sealing means may be sandwiched between these surfaces, such as a
gasket or sealant of any suitable material. The upper cross struts 140 have a length
sufficient to bridge the outer door rail 110 and the inner door rail 120, and further to
overlap the upward face 200 of the outer door rail 110 inside of the of the retaining lip
190 and the upward face 290 of the inner door rail 120 outside of the retaining lip
280, and include openings to receive fasteners to fasten the upper cross struts 140 to
the outer door rail 110 and inner door rail 120. The fasteners 160 and upper cross
struts 140 may be removable to remove and replace the door panel 150. The upper
cross struts 140 may be hingedly mounted to one or the other of the outer door rail
110 or the inner door rail 120 rails to facilitate unfastening and removal of the door
panel 150. Alternatively, the upper cross struts may be affixed to the outer door rail
110 and inner door rail 120, which may be by welding.
[0030]                      In some embodiments, the top doors 70 each comprise multiple door
panels 150 sized and dimension together to span the top doors 70. The door panels
150 may be formed of any desired material. In some embodiments, the door panels
150 are formed of plastic material, which may be thermoplastic material, which may
be thermoplastic composite, which may be polypropylene resin reinforced with
continuous woven glass fibers, which may be BulitexTM available from US Liner
Company of 19 Leonberg Road, Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, 16066, United
States of America.
[0031]                     As shown in FIG's 1 & 8, the container 20 may further have an end rail
170, which may be disposed at an upper edge of the end wall 50, and transversely
bridging the inner door rail 120 and the outer door rail 110 adjacent the end wall 50.
The end rail 170 may have a lower slot 470 slidingly to receive an end wall seal,
which may be an end wall flap 440, for sealingly contacting an opposing upward
surface of the end wall 50, which may be a rearwardly-sloping upward surface 450 of
the end wall 50, when the top door 70 is closed. Such sealing contact may prevent
entry of water into the container 20, and moreover the rearwardly-sloping upward
                                                       7

surface 450 may urge any water or moisture to flow downward and out of the
container.
[0032]                     The components of the trailer 10 may be formed of any suitable
materials using any suitable constructions. In particular, the sidewalls 40 of the
container 20 may be formed of extruded aluminum panels.
[0033]                     The container sidewalls and top rail may be formed of any suitable
material and construction, and in some embodiments comprises extruded aluminum
panels. The top door frame may be formed of any suitable material and construction,
and in some embodiments comprises extruded aluminum bars.
