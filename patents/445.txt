BACKGROUND
        1. Technical Field
[0002]      This disclosure relates generally to the field of optics, and in particular but not
exclusively, relates to contact lenses.
        2. Background Art
[0003]      Accommodation is a process by which the eye adjusts its focal distance to maintain
focus on objects of varying distance. Accommodation is a reflex action, but can be consciously
manipulated. Accommodation is controlled by contractions of the ciliary muscle. The ciliary
muscle encircles the eye's elastic lens and applies a force on the elastic lens during muscle
contractions that change the focal point of the elastic lens.
[0004]      As an individual ages, the effectiveness of the ciliary muscle degrades. Presbyopia is
a progressive age-related loss of accommodative or focusing strength of the eye, which results in
increased blur at near distances. This loss of accommodative strength with age has been well
studied and is relatively consistent and predictable. Presbyopia affects nearly 1.7 billion people
worldwide today (110 million in the United States alone) and that number is expected to
substantially rise as the world's population ages. Techniques and devices that can help
individuals offset the effects of Presbyopia are increasingly in demand.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0015]      Embodiments of a system, apparatus, and method of fabrication for an eye-mountable
device (or "EMD") including an accommodation actuator are described herein. In the following
description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the
embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the techniques
described herein may be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other
methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or
operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring certain aspects.
[0016]      Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment"
means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the
embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the
appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various places
throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.
14515548 1

                                                   3
Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any
suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
[0017]      Described herein is a smart contact lens or other eye-mountable device that comprises
an electrically activated lens including an accommodation actuator for adjusting the focal
distance of the contact lens. In some embodiments, the accommodation is automatically adjusted
in real-time based upon a user's gazing direction. The accommodation actuator is disposed in a
center region of the smart contact lens (e.g., covering at least the foveal vision). As such, it is
desirable that structures and/or fabrication processes aid in the positioning of an accommodation
actuator - e.g., relative to electrodes and/or other circuitry that is to support operation of the
accommodation actuator.
[0018]      The accommodation actuator may be implemented with a layer of liquid crystal (LC)
material, and may require electrodes to electronically control the accommodation actuator.
Accordingly, electrical, structural and/or other isolation may need to be provided - e.g., between
the electrodes or between the liquid crystal and control circuitry of the EMD. Embodiments of
the instant disclosure mitigate drawbacks that, for example, are associated with fabrication of an
accommodation actuator separately from other lens structures. Certain embodiments variously
allow for an accommodation actuator (e.g., including a LC material and adjoining layers or
polyimide or other alignment material) to be built up, by successive processing steps, on an
enclosure layer that, for example, is to form at least part of an exterior of a lens enclosure. Such
an enclosure layer may be subsequently sealed to another enclosure layer to form the lens
enclosure, where the accommodation actuator is surrounded by, and sealed with, a pinch-off
region of the lens enclosure.
[0019]      Embodiments of the eye-mountable device may include a power supply, control
electronics, an accommodation actuator, a gaze direction sensor system, and an antenna all
embedded within a lens enclosure formed to be contact mounted to an eye (e.g., shaped to be
removeably mounted to a comea and allow eyelid motion to open and close). In one
embodiment, the control electronics are coupled to monitor the sensor system to identify gaze
direction/focal distance, manipulate the accommodation actuator to control the optical power of
the eye-mountable device, and provide wireless communications with an external reader. In
some embodiments, the power supply may include charging circuitry for controlling inductive
wireless charging of an embedded battery.
[0020]      The lens enclosure may be fabricated of a variety of materials compatible for direct
contact with a human eye, such as a polymeric material, a hydrogel, PMMA, silicone based
polymers (e.g., fluoro-silicon acrylate), or otherwise. The electronics may be disposed upon a
14515548 1

                                                    4
substrate - e.g., having a ring shape - embedded within the lens enclosure near its periphery to
avoid interference with incident light received closer to the central region of the cornea. The
sensor system may be arranged on the substrate to face outward towards the eyelids to detect the
gaze direction/focal distance based upon the amount and position of eyelid coverage over the
sensor system. As the eyelids cover different portions of the sensor system, this changes a
characteristic (e.g., its capacitance), which may be measured to determine gaze direction and/or
focal distance.
[0021]      In some embodiments, the gaze direction/focal distance information may then be used
to determine the amount of accommodation to be applied via a see-through accommodation
actuator positioned in a central portion of the lens enclosure. The accommodation actuator is
coupled to the controller to be electrically manipulated thereby via the application of a voltage
across a pair of electrodes. For example, the accommodation actuator maybe implemented with
a LC cell that changes its index of refraction in response to an applied electrical bias signal
across the electrodes. In other embodiments, the accommodation actuator may be implemented
using other types of electro-active materials such as electro-optic materials that vary refractive
index in the presence of an applied electric field or electro-mechanical structures that change the
shape of a deformable lens. Other example structures that may be used to implement the
accommodation actuator include electro-wetting optics, micro-electro-mechanical systems, or
otherwise.
[0022]      Features of various embodiments are described herein in the context of a flexible eye
mountable accommodating lens device including an accommodation actuator comprising a LC
layer, wherein an optical strength (e.g., corresponding to a particular focal length) of the device
may be changed based on capacitive gaze tracking mechanisms. However, such description may
be extended to additionally or alternatively apply to any of a variety of other accommodating
optical devices that may operate in or on an eye of a user. For example, certain embodiments are
not limited with respect to a particular flexibility/rigidity of the eye-mountable device and/or a
particular mechanism (e.g., LC element or other) by which an accommodation actuator changes
an optical strength of the device. Furthermore, some embodiments are not limited with respect
to a capacitive gaze tracking, photodetector gaze tracking of other technique that may be used to
determine whether a change in optical strength is to take place.
[0023]      FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an eye-mountable device (EMD) 100 with
gaze tracking for auto-accommodation along with an external reader 105, in accordance with an
embodiment of the disclosure. The exposed portion of EMD 100 is a flexible lens enclosure 110
formed to be contact-mounted to a comeal surface of an eye. A substrate 115 is embedded
14515548 1

                                                    5
within or surrounded by flexible lens enclosure 110 to provide a mounting surface for a power
supply 120, a controller 125, a sensor system 135, an antenna 140, and various interconnects 145
and 150. An accommodation actuator 130 is embedded within flexible lens enclosure 110 and
coupled to controller 125 to provide auto-accommodation to the wearer of EMD 100. The
illustrated embodiment of power supply 120 includes an energy harvesting antenna 155,
charging circuitry 160, and a battery 165. The illustrated embodiment of controller 125 includes
control logic 170, accommodation logic 175, and communication logic 180. The illustrated
embodiment of reader 105 includes a processor 182, an antenna 184, and memory 186.
[0024]        Controller 125 is coupled to receive feedback control signals from sensor system 135
and further coupled to operate accommodation actuator 130. Power supply 120 supplies
operating voltages to the controller 125 and/or the accommodation actuator 130. Antenna 140 is
operated by the controller 125 to communicate information to and/or from EMD 100. In one
embodiment, antenna 140, controller 125, power supply 120, and sensor system 135 are all
situated on the embedded substrate 115. In one embodiment, accommodation actuator 130 is
embedded within a center region of flexible lens enclosure 110, but is not disposed on substrate
115. Because EMD 100 includes electronics and is configured to be contact-mounted to an eye,
it is also referred to herein as an ophthalmic electronics platform, a contact lens, or a smart
contact lens.
[0025]        To facilitate contact-mounting, the flexible lens enclosure 110 may have a concave
surface configured to adhere ("mount") to a moistened corneal surface (e.g., by capillary forces
with a tear film coating the corneal surface). Additionally or alternatively, the EMD 100 may be
adhered by a vacuum force between the corneal surface and flexible lens enclosure 110 due to
the concave curvature. While mounted with the concave surface against the eye, the outward
facing surface of flexible lens enclosure 110 may have a convex curvature that is formed to not
interfere with eye-lid motion while the EMD 100 is mounted to the eye. For example, flexible
lens enclosure 110 may be a substantially transparent curved disk shaped similarly to a contact
lens.
[0026]        Flexible lens enclosure 110 may include one or more biocompatible materials, such
as those employed for use in contact lenses or other ophthalmic applications involving direct
contact with the comeal surface. Flexible lens enclosure 110 may optionally be formed in part
from such biocompatible materials or may include an outer coating with such biocompatible
materials. Flexible lens enclosure 110 may include materials configured to moisturize the
corneal surface, such as hydrogels and the like. Flexible lens enclosure 110 is a deformable
("non-rigid") material to enhance wearer comfort. In some instances, flexible lens enclosure 110
14515548 1

                                                    6
may be shaped to provide a predetermined, vision-correcting optical power, such as can be
provided by a contact lens. Flexible lens enclosure 110 may be fabricated of various materials
including a polymeric material, a hydrogel, PMMA, silicone based polymers (e.g., fluoro-silicon
acrylate), or otherwise.
[0027]       Substrate 115 includes one or more surfaces suitable for mounting sensor system 135,
controller 125, power supply 120, and antenna 140. Substrate 115 may be employed both as a
mounting platform for chip-based circuitry (e.g., by flip-chip mounting) and/or as a platform for
patterning conductive materials (e.g., gold, platinum, palladium, titanium, copper, aluminum,
silver, metals, other conductive materials, combinations of these, etc.) to create electrodes,
interconnects, antennae, etc. In some embodiments, substantially transparent conductive
materials (e.g., indium tin oxide or the flexible conductive materials discussed below) may be
patterned on substrate 115 to form circuitry, electrodes, etc. For example, antenna 140 may be
formed by depositing a pattern of gold or another conductive material on substrate 115.
Similarly, interconnects 145 and 150 may be formed by depositing suitable patterns of
conductive materials on substrate 115. A combination of resists, masks, and deposition
techniques may be employed to pattern materials on substrate 115. Substrate 115 may be a
relatively rigid material, such as polyethylene terephithalate ("PET") or another material
sufficient to structurally support the circuitry and/or electronics within enclosure material 110.
EMD 100 may alternatively be arranged with a group of unconnected substrates rather than a
single substrate. For example, controller 125 and power supply 120 may be mounted to one
substrate, while antenna 140 and sensor system 135 are mounted to another substrate and the two
may be electrically connected via interconnects.
[0028]       Although certain embodiments are not limited in this regard, substrate 115 may be
shaped as a flattened ring with a radial width dimension sufficient to provide a mounting
platform for the embedded electronics components. Substrate 115 may have a thickness
sufficiently small to allow the substrate to be embedded in flexible lens enclosure 110 without
adversely influencing the profile of EMD 100. Substrate 115 may have a thickness sufficiently
large to provide structural stability suitable for supporting the electronics mounted thereon. For
example, substrate 115 may be shaped as a ring with a diameter of about 10 millimeters, a radial
width of about 1 millimeter (e.g., an outer radius 1 millimeter larger than an inner radius), and a
thickness of about 50 micrometers. Substrate 115 may optionally be aligned with the curvature
of the eye-mounting surface of EMD 100 (e.g., convex surface). For example, substrate 115
may be shaped along the surface of an imaginary cone between two circular segments that define
an inner radius and an outer radius. In such an example, the surface of substrate 115 along the
14515548 1

                                                  7
surface of the imaginary cone defines an inclined surface that is approximately aligned with the
curvature of the eye mounting surface at that radius.
[0029]      In some embodiments, power supply 120 and controller 125 (and the substrate 115)
may be positioned away from the center of EMD 100 and thereby avoid interference with light
transmission to the eye through the center of EMD 110. In contrast, accommodation actuator
130 may be centrally positioned to apply optical accommodation to the light transmitted to the
eye through the center of enclosure material 110. For example, where EMD 100 is shaped as a
concave-curved disk, substrate 115 may be embedded around the periphery (e.g., near the outer
circumference) of the disk. In some embodiments, sensor system 135 includes one or more
discrete capacitance sensors that are peripherally distributed to sense the eyelid overlap.
[0030]      In the illustrated embodiment, power supply 120 includes a battery 165 to power the
various embedded electronics, including controller 125. Battery 165 may be inductively charged
by charging circuitry 160 and energy harvesting antenna 155. In one embodiment, antenna 140
and energy harvesting antenna 155 are independent antennae, which serve their respective
functions of energy harvesting and communications. In another embodiment, energy harvesting
antenna 155 and antenna 140 are the same physical antenna that are time shared for their
respective functions of inductive charging and wireless communications with reader 105.
Charging circuitry 160 may include a rectifier/regulator to condition the captured energy for
charging battery 165 or directly power controller 125 without battery 165. Charging circuitry
160 may also include one or more energy storage devices to mitigate high frequency variations
in energy harvesting antenna 155. For example, one or more energy storage devices (e.g., a
capacitor, an inductor, etc.) may be connected to function as a low-pass filter.
[0031]      Controller 125 contains logic to choreograph the operation of the other embedded
components. Control logic 170 controls the general operation of EMD 100, including providing
a logical user interface, power control functionality, etc. Accommodation logic 175 includes
logic for monitoring feedback signals from sensor system 135, determining the current gaze
direction or focal distance of the user, and manipulating accommodation actuator 130 in
response to provide the appropriate accommodation. The auto-accommodation may be
implemented in real-time based upon feedback from the gaze tracking, or permit user control to
select specific accommodation regimes (e.g., near-field accommodation for reading, far-field
accommodation for regular activities, etc.). Communication logic 180 provides communication
protocols for wireless communication with reader 105 via antenna 140. In one embodiment,
communication logic 180 provides backscatter communication via antenna 140 when in the
presence of an electromagnetic field 171 output from reader 105. In one embodiment,
14515548 1

                                                 8
communication logic 180 operates as a smart wireless radio-frequency identification ("RFID")
tag that modulates the impedance of antenna 140 for backscatter wireless communications. The
various logic modules of controller 125 may be implemented in software/firmware executed on a
general purpose microprocessor, in hardware (e.g., application specific integrated circuit), or a
combination of both.
[0032]       EMD 100 may include various other embedded electronics and logic modules. For
example, a light source or pixel array may be included to provide visible feedback to the user.
An accelerometer or gyroscope may be included to provide positional, rotational, directional or
acceleration feedback information to controller 125.
[0033]       FIGs. 2A and 2B illustrate two views of an EMD 200, in accordance with an
embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 2A is a top view of EMD 200 while FIG. 2B is a
perspective view of the same. EMD 200 is one possible implementation of EMD 100 illustrated
in FIG. 1. The illustrated embodiment of EMD 200 includes a flexible lens enclosure 210, a ring
substrate 215, a power supply 220, a controller 225, an accommodation actuator 230, a
capacitive sensor system 235, and an antenna 240. It should be appreciated that FIGs. 2A and
2B are not necessarily drawn to scale, but have been illustrated for purposes of explanation only
in describing the arrangement of the example EMD 200.
[0034]       Flexible lens enclosure 210 of EMD 200 is shaped as a curved disk. Flexible lens
enclosure 210 is formed with one side having a concave surface 211 suitable to fit over a comeal
surface of an eye. The opposite side of the disk has a convex surface 212 that does not interfere
with eyelid motion while EMD 200 is mounted to the eye. In the illustrated embodiment, a
circular or oval outer side edge 213 connects the concave surface 211 and convex surface 212.
[0035]       EMD 200 may have dimensions similar to a vision correction and/or cosmetic contact
lenses, such as a diameter of approximately 1 centimeter, and a thickness of about 0.1 to about
0.5 millimeters. However, the diameter and thickness values are provided for explanatory
purposes only. In some embodiments, the dimensions of EMD 200 are selected according to the
size and/or shape of the corneal surface of the wearer's eye. Flexible lens enclosure 210 may be
formed with a curved shape in a variety of ways. For example, techniques similar to those
employed to form vision-correction contact lenses, such as heat molding, injection molding, spin
casting, etc. may be employed to form flexible lens enclosure 210.
[0036]       Ring substrate 215 is embedded within flexible lens enclosure 210. Ring substrate
215 may be embedded to be situated along the outer periphery of flexible lens enclosure 210,
away from the central region where accommodation actuator 230 is positioned. In the illustrated
embodiment, ring substrate 215 encircles accommodation actuator 230. Ring substrate 215 does
14515548 1

                                                    9
not interfere with vision because it is too close to the eye to be in focus and is positioned away
from the central region where incident light is transmitted to the light-sensing portions of the
eye. In some embodiments, ring substrate 215 may optionally be formed of a transparent
material to further mitigate effects on visual perception. Ring substrate 215 may be shaped as a
flat, circular ring (e.g., a disk with a centered hole). The flat surface of ring substrate 215 (e.g.,
along the radial width) is a platform for mounting electronics and for patterning conductive
materials to form electrodes, antenna(e), and/or interconnections.
[0037]       Capacitive sensor system 235 is distributed about EMD 200 to sense eyelid overlap in
a manner similar to capacitive touch screens. By monitoring the amount and position of eyelid
overlap, feedback signals from capacitive sensor system 235 may be measured by controller 225
to determine the approximate gaze direction and/or focal distance. In the illustrated
embodiment, capacitive sensor sytem 235 is formed by a series of parallel coupled discrete
capacitive elements. Other implementations may be used.
[0038]       Accommodation actuator 230 is centrally positioned within flexible lens enclosure
210 to affect the optical power of EMD 200 in the user's center of vision. A pinch-off region
232 may be disposed between accommodation actuator 230 and ring substrate 215 to provide
electrical isolation from at least some circuitry of ring substrate 215. In various embodiments,
accommodation actuator 230 includes an element that changes its index of refraction under the
influence of flexible conductive electrodes manipulated by controller 225. By changing its
refractive index, the net optical power of the curved surfaces of EMD 200 is altered, thereby
applying controllable accommodation. Accommodation actuator 230 may be implemented using
a variety of different optoelectronic elements. For example, accommodation actuator 230 may
be implemented using a layer of liquid crystal (e.g., a LC cell) disposed in the center of flexible
lens enclosure 210. In other embodiments, accommodation actuator 230 may be implemented
using other types of electro-active optical materials such as electro-optic materials that vary
refractive index in the presence of an applied electric field. Accommodation actuator 230 may
be a distinct device embedded within enclosure material 210 (e.g., LC cell), or a bulk material
having a controllable refractive index. In yet another embodiment, accommodation actuator 230
may be implemented using a deformable lens structure that changes shape under the influence of
an electrical signal. Accordingly, the optical power of EMD 200 is controlled by controller 225
with the application of electric signals via one or more electrodes extending from controller 225
to accommodation actuator 230.
[0039]       FIG. 3 is an explode perspective view illustrating an EMD 300, in accordance with an
embodiment of the disclosure. EMD 300 is one possible implementation of EMDs 100 or 200,
14515548 1

                                                  10
but the exploded perspective illustration shows additional details of various components. The
illustrated embodiment of EMD 300 includes a flexible lens enclosure including an anterior layer
305 and a posterior layer 310, an anterior flexible conductive electrode (ANT) 315, a posterior
flexible conductive electrode (POST) 320, a liquid crystal layer 325, a ring substrate 330, a
power supply 335, a controller circuit 340, an anterior contact pad 345, and a posterior contact
pad 350 (hidden in FIG. 3). Collectively, the ANT 315, LC layer 325, and POST 320 form an
accommodation actuator that is manipulated under the influence of controller circuit 340. The
illustrated embodiment of ANT 315 includes a connection tab 360 and the illustrated
embodiment of POST 320 includes a connection tab 365.
[0040]       ANT 315 and POST 320 are transparent electrodes that electrically manipulate LC
layer 325 via the application of a voltage across the electrodes. ANT 315 and POST 320 are
flexible conductors that substantially maintain their conductivity even in the presence of cyclical
mechanical stressing including folding and bending. ANT 315 and POST 320 are formed from a
liquid conductor material that is cured onto, and therefore conform to, the curved surfaces of
anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310, respectively. ANT 315 and POST 320 may be
applied to anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310, respectively, using a variety of techniques.
For example, a liquid conductor material including conductive epoxy, conductive polymer,
conductive silicon, evaporated metal or other conductive material may be spray coated, stamped,
shadow masked or otherwise disposed to form electrode structures to operate an accommodation
actuator. In one embodiment, the liquid conductor material is spray coated on the inside concave
surface of anterior layer 305 using a conforming concave stencil and is also spray coated on the
inside convex surface of posterior layer 310 using a conforming convex stencil. In other
embodiments, the spray coating may be actively controlled without use of stencils, or applied
after application of a temporary mask. In yet other embodiments, the liquid conductor material
is coated onto a stamp with a conforming shaped surface that is then pressed to anterior layer 305
or posterior layer 310 to transfer the liquid conductor material. Other application techniques
may also be used to form and position ANT 315 and POST 320 onto anterior layer 305 and
posterior layer 310, respectively. In one embodiment, ANT 315 and POST 320 are formed to
achieve a desired total sheet resistance. Target sheet resistances may range between 100
ohms/square to 2000 ohms/square (e.g., 190 ohms/square). Of course, other target sheet
resistances outside this range may also be used.
[0041]       LC layer 325 may be disposed between anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 in a
central region of the EMD 300. Formation of LC layer 325 may include spraying, spinning,
masking, stamping, stenciling, and/or other operations adapted from conventional fabrication
14515548 1

                                                   11
techniques. LC layer 325 may comprise, for example, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
:poly(styrenesulfonate) (or PEDOT:PSS) or any of various other liquid crystals that provide for
variable refractive index characteristics. In an embodiment, LC layer 325 is isolated electrically
from at least some circuitry of ring substrate 325. Additionally or alternatively, LC layer 325
may be disposed between ANT 315 and POST 320 in the central region of EMD 300.
[0042]      FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a process 400 for fabricating an EMD - e.g., one of
eye-mountable devices 100, 200, or 300 - in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure.
The order in which some or all of the process blocks appear in process 400 should not be deemed
limiting. Rather, one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure will
understand that some of the process blocks may be executed in a variety of orders not illustrated,
or even in parallel. Features of process 400 are described herein with reference to fabrication of
EMD 300. However, such description may be extended to additionally or alternatively apply to
fabrication of any of various other EMDs having features set forth herein.
[0043]      In process blocks 405 and 410, anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 are formed
as separate layers of a lens enclosure. Anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 may be formed
using molds that are spray coated or injected with a flexible, transparent material. The flexible,
transparent material may include any of a polymeric material, a hydrogel, PMMA, silicone based
polymers (e.g., fluoro-silicon acrylate), or otherwise.
[0044]      Although certain embodiments are not limited in this regard, anterior layer 305 and/or
posterior layer 310 may be treated to form reactive surfaces for improved bonding to the ANT
315 and POST 320. For example, anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 may be plasma
treated in a highly ionizing environment that causes the inside surfaces of anterior layer 305 and
posterior layer 310 to be chemically reactive.
[0045]      In a process block 415, conductor material that forms ANT 315 and POST 320 is
deposited onto the concave surface of anterior layer 305 and deposited onto the convex surface
of posterior layer 310. In one embodiment, the deposition of the liquid conductor material may
be spray coated over stencils that conform to the concave and convex surfaces. In yet another
embodiment, the liquid conductive material is applied to stamps with curved surfaces that
conform to the concave and convex surfaces of anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310,
respectively. The coated stamps are then pressed against the inside surfaces of anterior layer 305
and posterior layer 310 to transfer the ink pattern thereto. After application of the liquid
conductor material, it may be cured and/or annealed - e.g., with heat.
[0046]      The conductor material may include a conductive epoxy (e.g., any of various
conductive silicones), evaporated metal (gold, aluminum), a colloidal solution of conductive
14515548 1

                                                    12
particles (e.g., nanotubes or nanowires) and/or the like. Deposition of the conductor material
may include forming any of a variety of conductive structures including, but not limited to, one
or more gold wires, silver nanowires, an indium tin oxide thin film, etc. In some embodiments,
various solvents (e.g., alcohol), surfactants, or dilutants may be added to the liquid conductor
material to improve the uniform coating and adhesion of ANT 315 and POST 320 to anterior
layer 305 and posterior layer 310, respectively.
[0047]       Next, ring substrate 330, including power supply 335 and controller circuit 340, are
positioned between the anterior layer 305 and the posterior layer 310 - e.g., including
positioning the substrate over the convex surface of posterior layer 310 (process block 420).
Before or during the positioning at 420, a conductive adhesive may be applied to contact pads on
ring substrate 330 in preparation for electrical coupling of ring substrate 330 to one or both of
ANT 315 and POST 320. The positioning at 420 may include aligning connection tabs 360, 365
each with a respective contact pad of ring substrate 330 - e.g., where connection tabs 360, 365
are radially offset from one another.
[0048]       In a process block 425, an accommodation actuator structure is disposed between the
anterior layer and the posterior layer. For example, a liquid crystal material may be dispensed
around (e.g., including dispensing on) the center region of the concave surface of anterior layer
305 and covers over ANT 315. In one embodiment, the LC material is dispensed over a larger
area such that LC layer 325 covers a greater area than either ANT 315 or POST 320.
[0049]       In a process block 430, the two halves (anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310) of
the lens enclosure are pressed together and sealed. For example, an amount of enclosure
material may be added between anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 in a region around a
circumference of the LC material. Curing of this material between the anterior and posterior
layers may result in a pinch-off region being formed around the LC material. In one
embodiment, more enclosure material is also added to the bottom edge or rim of the mated
anterior layer 305 and posterior layer 310 to form the seal. Curing of this additional enclosure
material may seal the substrate in a peripheral region between anterior layer 305 and posterior
layer 310. Finally, the eye-mountable device or smart contact lens is packaged into a sealed
container of lens solution for distribution (process block 435).
[0050]       It will be appreciated that the particular order of the operations shown for method 400
is not limiting on some embodiments. By way of illustration and not limitation, some or all
portions of an accommodation actuator, electrode structures and/or a ring substrate may be
variously fabricated and combined with one another, according to different embodiments, as a
14515548 1

                                                   13
separate component prior to assembly of such a component with one or both lens enclosure
layers.
[0051]       FIG. 5 illustrates cross-sectional detail views of processing to fabricate an eye
mountable device according to an embodiment. Fabrication processes represented in FIG. 5 may
include some or all of the features of operation 400, for example. Detail view 500 illustrates
formation of a posterior layer 504 (e.g., layer 310) on a mold 502, and detail view 510 illustrates
formation of an anterior layer 514 (e.g., layer 305) on a mold 512.
[0052]       One or each of layers 504, 510 may be comprised of one of a silicone, silicone
hydrogel, hydrogel, rigid gas permeable (RGP) material, rigid plastic (e.g., polycarbonate),
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polymerized acrylate. Although certain embodiments are
not limited in this regard, layers 504, 510 may be flexible, in some embodiments. In one
illustrative embodiment, one or each of layers 504, 510 have a diameter between 11 and 14 mm
in size. Alternatively or in addition, one or each of layers 504, 510 is between 20 microns and
150 microns (e.g., between 20 microns and 100 microns) thick. However, such dimensions may
vary in different embodiments according to implementation specific details.
[0053]       Formation of layers 504, 514 may include some or all of the features of the forming at
405, 410, for example. In an embodiment, a recess (not shown) - e.g., 0.1 to 50 um deep - is
shaped in a concave side 534 of anterior layer 514, or in a recess in a convex side 524 of
posterior layer 504, to aid in the formation of a LC layer of an accommodation actuator element.
The shaping of such a recess may include pressing and curing between two molds the enclosure
material of one of layers 504, 514.
[0054]       Detail view 520 illustrates a flexible electrode 522 (e.g., electrode 320) deposited on
convex surface 524 of posterior layer 504, and detail view 530 illustrates a flexible electrode 532
(e.g., electrode 315) deposited on concave surface 534 of posterior layer 514. Formation of one
or each of electrodes 522, 532 may including spraying, stamping, shadow masking, evaporating
or otherwise depositing a conductive epoxy (e.g., a conductive silicone), a metal (e.g., gold,
aluminum, silver, etc.) or other conductive material. The resulting electrodes 522, 532 may
include metal wires, nanowires, indium tin oxide thin films or other such conductive structures to
operate an accommodation actuator. In an embodiment, one or each of flexible electrodes 522,
532 has a thickness between 10 nm and 10 microns and a diameter between 2 mm and 3 mm.
However, such thicknesses may vary according to implementation specific details. In some
embodiments, a flexible electrode has a main body portion and a tab portion (not shown),
extending from the main body portion, where the main body portion is to be aligned with a LC
layer of an accommodation actuator, and the tab portion is to extend through a pinch-off region
14515548 1

                                                    14
that separates the LC layer from a substrate having integrated circuitry disposed therein and/or
thereon.
[0055]      Detail view 540 illustrates placement of such a substrate (e.g., ring substrate 330)
e.g., including the illustrative control circuitry 542 and antenna 544 - on posterior layer 504. In
another embodiment, the substrate may instead be initially placed on surface 534. Detail view
550 shows deposition of a LC layer 554 on a concave side of anterior layer 514. Deposition of
the LC layer 554 may be including operations adapted from conventional shadow mask,
stamping or other fabrication techniques. In an embodiment, an accommodation actuator
structure (e.g., a LC layer) comprises, or adjoins, isolation layers providing at least some
isolation that prevents or limits one or more conductive paths between a pinch-off region and
electrode structures. For example, at least partially dielectric alignment layers (not shown) of the
accommodation actuator may be disposed on opposite sides of LC layer 554. The LC layer 554
may have a thickness of between 0.1 um and 50 um and/or a diameter of between 4 mm and 10
mm. However, such dimensions are merely illustrative and not limiting on certain embodiments.
[0056]      Detail view 560 shows respective structures represented in detail views 540, 550
having been aligned and brought into contact with each other. In some embodiments, one or
both of surfaces 524, 534 may be pretreated - e.g., with a plasma - to improve adhesion between
the two. Layers 504, 514 may then be sealed to form a flexible enclosure, where an
accommodation actuator 562 is located within a central region of the flexible enclosure. A
perimeter of the central region may be defined at least in part by a pinch-off region 564 where
layers 504, 514 are adjacent to (e.g., physically contact) one another.
[0057]      For example, an additional amount of contact lens material - e.g., a silicone
elastomer, a silicone hydrogel or the like - may be disposed around LC layer 554 to aid in
adhering layers 504, 514. Curing of such additional material (e.g., by heat or ultraviolet light)
may result in a sealing of the accommodation actuator within the central region around which
pinch-off region 564 is disposed. In some embodiments, contact lens material may also be
applied at an edge region around one of layers 504, 514, where this additional material is also
cured to seal the ring substrate in a region of the lens enclosure between pinch-off region 564
and the respective edges of layers 504, 514.
[0058]      The electrodes 522, 532 may be separated from one another in pinch-off region 564.
For example, in one illustrative embodiment, conductive layers 522, 532 have a 6 mm diameter,
and the pinch-off region has a 7 mm diameter, where the LC layer 554 provides for separation of
the conductive layers 522, 532 in the central region around which pinch-off region 564 is
formed.

[0059]       FIG. 6 show cross-sectional detail views 600, 650 of eye-mountable devices each
according to a respective embodiment. For example, detail view 600 shows a posterior
encapsulation layer 610 sealed with an anterior encapsulation layer 620 to form a flexible lens
enclosure. A central region of the flexible lens enclosure is defined at least in part by a pinch-off
region 625 that extends around a perimeter of the central region. The pinch-off region 625 may
serve as a seal to hold an accommodation actuator 615 within the central region. In some
embodiments, a peripheral region 630 is located around a periphery of pinch-off region 625
e.g., where peripheral region 630 extends from pinch-off region 625 to the respective
circumferential edges of encapsulation layers 610, 620. Peripheral region 630 may include a
contact lens material that is disposed and cured to aid in sealing of encapsulation layers 610, 620
with one another. A substrate 635, having integrated circuitry disposed thereon, may be
disposed between encapsulation layers 610, 620 within peripheral region 630.
[0060]       In detail view 600, a recess is formed in a concave surface of anterior encapsulation
layer 620 to aid in the positioning of accommodation actuator 615 during fabrication processing
(e.g., according to method 400). In another embodiment, an encapsulation layer may
additionally or alternatively be deformed to aid in the formation of a pinch-off region. By way
of illustration and not limitation, detail view 650 shows a posterior encapsulation layer 660
sealed with an anterior encapsulation layer 670 to form a flexible lens enclosure, wherein an
accommodation actuator is disposed between encapsulation layers 660, 670 within a central
region of the eye-mountable device. Respective portions of the encapsulation layers 660, 670
may adjoin one another to form a pinch-off region 680 that defines at least in part a perimeter of
the central region. A pinch-off region such as region 680 may be formed at least in part by a
layer of a lens material, the thickness of which extends from a flexible conductor to an exterior
surface of the EMD. For example, a pinch-off region may be formed by anterior and posterior
layers of lens material that each extend from a respective flexible conductor to a different
respective exterior side of the EMD. The exterior surface of one such layer of lens material may
be deformed in an area over the pinch-off region. As illustrated in detail view 650, a pinch-off
region 680 may be formed at least in part by a flat or convex portion of an otherwise concave
surface (e.g., the posterior surface) of an anterior encapsulation layer such as layer 670.
[0061]       The pinch-off region 680 may separate a LC layer 665 from circuitry 685 (e.g., of
ring substrate 330) that is disposed between encapsulation layers 660, 670 in a peripheral region
of the flexible lens enclosure. As shown in detail view 650, the central region formed by
encapsulation layers 660, 670 may taper in a direction extending toward pinch-off region 680.
14515548 1

                                                  16
Alternatively or in addition, the peripheral region including integrated circuitry 685 may taper in
a direction extending toward pinch-off region 680.
[0062]      The accommodation actuator may comprise, or adjoin, isolation layers disposed
between respective portions of an accommodation actuator structure (e.g., a liquid crystal layer)
and a flexible conductor. For example, the accommodation actuator may include alignment
layers 674a, 674b and LC layer 665. One or each of alignment layers 674a, 674b may have a
thickness of 10 nm to 10 microns, although certain embodiments are not limited in this regard.
Flexible, transparent electrodes 672a, 672b (e.g., electrodes 315, 320) may be disposed on
opposite sides of the accommodation actuator - e.g., where alignment layers 674a, 674b provide
at least some isolation to prevent one or more conductive paths between pinch-off region 680
and transparent electrodes 672a, 672b. Under control of circuitry 685, electrodes 672a, 672b
may apply a voltage differential across the accommodation actuator. Alignment layers 672a,
672b may comprise polyimide or other suitable material to provide for changing an alignment of
liquid crystal molecules to change a refractive index of LC layer 665. In one embodiment, an
unpowered state of the LC layer 665 allows for distance viewing - e.g., where any non-zero
voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer shortens a focal distance of the eye-mountable
device (as compared to a focal distance of the eye-mountable device without any such voltage
applied).
[0063]      FIGs. 7A-7C illustrate example orientations of an anterior flexible conductive
electrode (ANT) 705 and a posterior flexible conductive electrode (POST) 732 within an eye
mountable device 700, in accordance with an embodiment. FIG. 7A illustrates ANT 705 formed
onto the concave surface of an anterior layer 705, FIG. 7B illustrates POST 732 formed onto the
convex surface of a posterior layer 710, and FIG. 7C is a plan view illustration of a fully
assembled eye-mountable device 700. FIG. 8 is a profile illustration of a portion of ring
substrate 730 that forms electrical connections to a connection tab 760 of ANT 715 and a
connection tab 765 of POST 732, in accordance with an embodiment.
[0064]      In the illustrated embodiment, ANT 715 includes connection tab 760 for electrically
connecting to anterior contact pad 745 disposed on the front side of ring substrate 730.
Correspondingly, POST 732 includes connection tab 765 for electrically connecting to posterior
contact pad 750 disposed on the backside of ring substrate 730. FIG. 8 illustrates the use of
conductive adhesive 785 to improve the electrically connections between connection tabs 760
and 765 and contact pads 745 and 750, respectively. Conductive adhesive 785 may be
implemented using a variety of different materials, such as, silver loaded epoxies, silicon, or
polyurethane, or otherwise. Conductive adhesive 785 provides flexible, conductive adhesion
14515548 1

                                                    17
that maintains electrical connection when the smart contact lens is bent or folded despite the
different flexibility characteristics of the various constituent parts of eye-mountable device 700.
[0065]       In the illustrated embodiment, connection tabs 760 and 765 are rotationally offset
relative to each other to make room for a through-substrate via for one or both of contact pads
745, 765. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, power supply 735 and controller circuit
740 are disposed on the front side of ring substrate 730, thus posterior contact pad 750 is
connected to controller circuit 740 using a through substrate via.
[0066]       FIG. 7C further illustrates the contour 712 of a LC layer between ANT 715 and
POST 732. The LC layer may separate ANT 715 and POST 732 from one another, and may be
actuated by voltages applied across these electrodes by controller circuit 740. In the illustrated
embodiment, the LC layer extends across a larger portion of the center region to ensure that ANT
715 and POST 732 do not short circuit to each other. In one embodiment, transparent insulating
layers (e.g., polyimide) may be further applied each to separate the LC layer from a respective
one of ANT 715 and POST 732, while in other embodiments ANT 715 and POST 732 may form
direct contact with the LC layer. Both LC layer 720 and respective portions of ANT 715 and
POST 732 - e.g., other than connection tabs 760, 765 - may be contained within the inner radius
of ring substrate 730 and may not contact the inner edge of ring substrate 730. In one
embodiment, ANT 715 and POST 732 have a diameter of approximately 6 mm, LC layer 725
has a diameter of approximately 7 mm, and the inner edge of ring substrate 730, which defines
the center region, has a diameter of 9 mm. Of course, other dimensions may be implemented.
Anterior layer 705 and posterior layer 710 may come in contact with one another to form a
pinch-off region 720 between diameter of contour 712 and a larger diameter of the inner edge of
ring substrate 730. Pinch-off region 720 may variously prevent shorting of the liquid crystal
layer, ANT 715 and/or POST 732 to at least some circuitry of ring substrate 730.

mountable device are described herein. Some portions of the detailed description herein are
