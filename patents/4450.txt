                  CLAMP FOR SPRINKLER SUPPORT ASSEMBLY
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn>, filed on 27 June 2016, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in their
entirety.
[0002] The invention relates to a clamp used in a fire protection sprinkler head support system.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] A typical automatic fire sprinkler system includes a network of pipes that carry a fire
suppression fluid, e.g., water, to each room in a building. Conduit sections carry the fluid from
the pipes to sprinkler heads strategically located in different rooms. The position and orientation
of each sprinkler head is typically maintained in place by a support assembly. When the room
reaches an elevated temperature due to a fire, the sprinkler head is activated allowing a stream of
fire suppression fluid to be directed over the intended area of coverage. During operation, the
fluid pressure at the sprinkler head can reach as high as 175 psi, generating significant back
pressure on the sprinkler head's support system. The support assembly is used to hold the
sprinkler head securely in place during operation.
[0004] Some known sprinkler support assemblies are designed to be secured to a ceiling
structure by fasteners such as screws or bolts which must be tightened using special tools in a
time consuming process.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0041] With reference to Fig. 1, a fire sprinkler system 100 includes several sprinkler support
assemblies 302 mounted within a ceiling 104 having a ceiling support structure 106 formed of
an array of rectangular frame sections 108 (one frame section 108 is shown with cross hatch).
The ceiling support structure 106 can be a suspended ceiling for supporting a decorative panel
(not shown) within each rectangular frame section 108. For example, the ceiling support
structure may consist of T-bar beams 202 suspended from an overlying building structure using,
for example, flexible wire, and may be configured according to ASTM International standards.
The standards may include, but are not limited to, those set forth in one or more of designations
C635, C636 and E580, which are each incorporated herein by reference. In order to protect the
room from fire, the fire sprinkler system 100 is most commonly located above the ceiling
support structure, but can also reside in a floor or in one or more walls.
[0042] The fire sprinkler system 100 can include supply pipes 110 as part of a fire suppression
fluid delivery system. The fluid delivery system can be dedicated to fire suppression, or can also
deliver water to other functions (e.g., within the building). The fire sprinkler system 100 also
includes a flexible sprinkler assemblage 112 that carries the fire suppression fluid, e.g. water,
from the supply pipes 110 to the fire sprinkler head 114. For example, the flexible sprinkler
assemblage 112 can include an inlet fitting 116 which connects the assemblage 112 to the
supply pipe 110, and a flexible conduit 118 which extends between the inlet fitting 116 and one
end of a rigid sprinkler head fitting 120. The flexible conduit 118 may be formed of corrugated
metal with a braided metal covering, and welded to both the inlet fitting 116 and sprinkler head
fitting 120, or may be formed of corrugated metal and joined to both the inlet fitting and
sprinkler head fitting 120 using screw connectors. The assemblage 112 can further include the
sprinkler head 114 which is connected to another end of the sprinkler head fitting 120. When the

                                                   9
room reaches elevated temperatures, fire sprinkler head 114 is activated and a stream of fire
suppression fluid is directed into the room to extinguish the fire.
[0043] Each sprinkler support assembly 302 secures a sprinkler head 114 at a predetermined
position within an associated one of rectangular ceiling frame sections 108. In order to function
effectively, fire sprinkler head 114 must be held firmly in place during operation. Due to the
significant back pressure of the fluid flowing therethrough, fire sprinkler head 114 is subjected
to tremendous side, rotational, and torsional forces, which are capable of changing the position
of the fire sprinkler head 114, thereby causing the fluid to be directed away from the intended
target. The sprinkler support assembly 302 is configured to resist movement of fire sprinkler
head 114 by distributing the forces to spaced-apart points along the periphery of one of the
rectangular frame sections 108.
[0044] Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, an exemplary embodiment of a sprinkler support assembly
302 is mounted within a ceiling support structure 106, which, in this example, is a T-bar grid.
[0045] The sprinkler support assembly 302 includes a leg 304 including a cross portion 305, and
levered clamp assemblies 308 and seating frames 320 positioned at opposing ends of the cross
portion 305. The support assembly 302 is rigidly secured to the ceiling support structure 106 by
the levered clamp assemblies 308 and stabilized by the seating frames 320. The levered clamp
assemblies 308 are configured to engage with a beam 202 of a ceiling support structure 106 and
secure the sprinkler support assembly 302 to the beam 202, as discussed further below.
[0046] The cross portion 305 of the leg 304 extends generally parallel to the ceiling support
structure 106 and is dimensioned to extend across a pair of adjacent parallel T-bar beams 202.
The levered clamp assemblies 308 and the seating frames 320, provided at opposed ends of the
cross portion 305, make contact with the beam 202 at several points ensuring that the forces on
the sprinkler support assembly 302 are distributed along a portion of the ceiling frame section
108. As a result, stability of the sprinkler support assembly 302 is ensured and the sprinkler head
114 is prevented from moving or rotating in any direction during operation.
[0047] The cross portion 305 of the leg 304 includes a central slot 310 that is sized to receive
the sprinkler head fitting 120, and is elongated in a direction transverse to the width of the leg
304 to permit adjustment of the position of the sprinkler head fitting 120 within the ceiling
frame section 108. The cross portion 305 also includes lateral slots 312 sized to receive a hub

                                                  10
assembly mounting screw 314. The lateral slots 312 are disposed between the central slot 310
and lateral sides 316, 318 of the leg 304, and are elongated in a direction transverse to the width
of the leg 304 to permit adjustment of the location of the screws within the leg 304. The
adjustment of the position of the sprinkler head fitting 120 within the frame section 108 is
unlimited.
[0048] In the illustrated embodiment, a hub assembly 306 is used to secure the sprinkler head
fitting 120 to the sprinkler support assembly 302. The hub assembly 306 includes a primary
support 1102 which mounts on the leg 304 of the support assembly 302, and a secondary
support 1202 that is rotatably connected to the primary support 1102, as described in co-pending
US application 12/784,286, which is incorporated here by reference. The secondary support
1202 rotates relative to the primary support 1102 about a pin 1106 between an open position
(not shown) and a closed position (shown). The primary support 1102 and secondary support
1202 are each formed having cut out portions 1104, 1204, so that when the secondary support
1202 is in the closed position relative to the primary support 1102, the cut out 1104 formed in
the primary support 1102 cooperates with the cut out 1204 formed in the secondary support
1202 to define a hub opening 1150 configured to receive and securely retain the sprinkler head
fitting 120. When the hub assembly 306 is secured to the leg 304, the hub opening 1150
coincides with the central slot 310. In addition, the hub assembly 306 includes a locking
mechanism 1108 that selectively connects the primary support 1102 to the secondary support
1202, and an adjustment mechanism 1110 provided on the primary support 1102 is used to
secure the position of the sprinkler head fitting 120 within the hub opening 1150.
[0049] Referring to Fig. 4, an exploded view of the levered clamp assembly 308 is shown. The
levered clamp assembly 308 is the portion of the leg 304 that connects to the ceiling support
structure 106 and may be fixed to the ceiling support structure 106 by clamping two plates 404,
406 together about the beam 202. The levered clamp assembly 308 includes a first plate 404, a
second plate 406, and a lever assembly 408 that connects the first plate 404 to the second plate
406, and determines their relative positions, as described further below.
[0050] In this embodiment, the first plate 404 extends integrally from and is generally
perpendicular to the cross portion 305 of the leg 304 of the sprinkler support assembly 302 and
has a flat, rectangular shape. The first plate 404 includes a rod opening 412 which is disposed
between an attached edge 402 and a free edge 428 of the first plate 404. The rod opening 412 is

                                                   11
unthreaded and is of slightly larger diameter than the outer diameter of the rod 410. The first
plate 404 includes a tongue opening 422 which is disposed between the attached edge 402 of the
first plate 404 and the rod opening 412. In addition, triangular shaped pointed protrusions 424
extend inward toward the second plate 406 from the free edge 428. For example, a protrusion
424 may be provided adjacent respective side edges 427, 429 of the first plate 404. The pointed
protrusions 424 extend generally parallel to the cross portion 305 of the leg 304 and are
configured to engage the corresponding beam 202 when the levered clamp assembly 308 is
actuated.
[0051] The second plate 406 is hinged to and extends from the first plate 404. The second plate
406 is not permanently affixed to the sprinkler support assembly 302, such that it is separable
from the levered clamp assembly 308. The second plate 406 includes a hinge edge 438 at one
end, and a free edge 434 at the opposed end. A tongue 430 extends from the hinge edge 438.
The tongue 430 is a curved member and is configured to be received within the tongue opening
422 to provide the hinged connection between the second plate 406 and the first plate 404. In
particular, the second plate 406 rotates on the curved surface of the tongue 430 relative to the
first plate 404. In addition, its curved shape retains the tongue 430 in the tongue opening 422.
[0052] In some embodiments, the second plate 406 can include stiffening ridges 432. The
stiffening ridges 432 extend perpendicular to and between the free edges 438, 434 of the second
plate 406 to ensure that the second plate 406 does not flex when the levered clamp assembly 308
is secured to the beam 202. Alternatively, the second plate 406 can be configured to have
sufficient thickness to prevent flexion when the levered clamp assembly 308 is secured to the
beam 202.
[0053] In addition, the second plate 406 includes a threaded rod opening 413 and a protrusion
426. The protrusion 426 is located between the middle portion of the plate and the free edge
434, and extends inward toward the first plate 404 along the width of the free edge 434 of the
plate 406. The protrusion 426 engages the beam 202 when the levered clamp assembly 308 is
actuated. In some embodiments, the second plate 406 can include additional protrusions similar
to the triangular shaped pointed protrusions 424 included on the first plate 404.
[0054] The lever assembly 408 includes a threaded rod 410 that passes through corresponding
rod openings 412, 413 in each plate 404, 406, and a lever 418. The lever 418 includes a cam

                                                  12
surface 420. The lever 418 is pivotally connected to the end of the rod 410 by a pin 436 and the
rotational axis 437 of the lever 418 is eccentric relative to the periphery of the cam surface 420.
The cam surface 420 of the lever 418 has a generally semi-circular peripheral shape. When the
levered clamp assembly 308 is assembled, the cam surface 420 abuts the outward-facing surface
440 of the first plate 404. The lever 418 rotates about the pin 436 between an open position and
a closed position, as discussed further below.
[0055] The rod 410 extends through both the rod opening 412 of the first plate 404 and the rod
opening 413 of the second plate 406. The threads of the rod 410 are configured to engage the
threads of the rod opening 413 of the second plate 406. By rotating the threaded rod 410, the
amount of space between the plates 404, 406 can be adjusted to make the clamp connection
more secure.
[0056] Referring to Fig. 5a, although the cam surface 420 is generally semi circular, it can be
seen in the figure that the periphery of the cam surface 420 actually deviates from the circular
shape. In particular, the cam surface 420 is formed of different sections: the section between
points a and b (a-b), the section between points b and c (b-c), and the section between points c
and d (c-d). Each section is shaped to perform a specific function during actuation of the levered
clamp assembly 408.
[0057] Section a-b of the cam surface 420 has a generally flat shape and ensures that the lever
418 is freely movable and adjustable when the levered clamp assembly 408 is in the open
position as in Fig. 5a.
[0058] When the lever assembly 408 is actuated, the cam surface 420 of the lever 418 rotates
about the eccentric rotational axis 437 and creates a camming action against the first plate 404.
The camming action is facilitated by the shape of section b-c of the cam surface 420. During
actuation of the lever assembly 408, section b-c gradually increases the distance between the
abutment of the cam surface 420 and the outward-facing surface 440 of the first plate 404 and
the eccentric rotational axis 437 of the lever 418. This camming action pulls the rod 410 toward
the lever 418 along the axis A, thereby reducing the spacing between the plates 404, 406 by
pulling the second plate 406 toward the first plate 404. The extent of the camming action is
determined by the combination of the distance between the periphery of section b-c-d of the cam

                                                    13
surface 420 and the location of the pin 436. The reduction in spacing causes the plates 404, 406
and their corresponding protrusions 424, 426 to engage the beam 202.
[0059] The distance between the periphery of section c-d of the cam surface 420 and the
eccentric rotational axis 437 is designed to be slightly less than that of section b-c. Rotating the
lever 418 so that section c-d abuts the outward-facing surface 440 of the first plate 404 causes
the distance between the abutment of the cam surface 420 and the outward-facing surface 440 of
the first plate 404 to slightly decrease relative to the eccentric rotational axis 437. Decreasing
this distance locks the lever 418 in place. In this way, the sprinkler support assembly 302 is
secured to a ceiling support structure 106.
[0060] Again, referring to Fig. 4, the seating frame 320 is shown. The seating frame 320
provides lateral stability to the sprinkler support assembly 302 and determines the height 210 of
the levered clamp assembly 308 relative to the beam 202. The seating frame 320 is generally U
shaped and includes a first seating frame member 444 and a second seating frame member 446,
each including a corresponding protrusion 448, 450, corresponding attached edges 458, 460 and
corresponding free edges 462, 464. A connecting member 452 extends from an inside edge 454
of the first seating frame member 444 to an inside edge 456 of the second seating frame member
446 whereby the overall width of the seating frame 320 corresponds to the width of the leg 304.
As viewed in the direction of arrow A, the seating frame 320 generally surrounds a periphery of
the first plate 404.
[0061] In this embodiment, the first seating frame member 444 and the second seating frame
member 446 both extend integrally from, and in a direction generally normal to the cross portion
305 of the leg 304 of the sprinkler support assembly 302 so as to be generally parallel to the first
plate 404. However, the first seating frame member 444 and the second seating frame member
446 are not coplanar with the first plate 404 but instead are inwardly offset relative to the first
plate 404. The first and second seating frame members 444,446 are positioned adjacent to
opposing lateral sides 316, 318 of the cross portion 305 of the leg 304 of the sprinkler support
assembly 302.
[0062] Protrusions 448, 450 are disposed in the middle portion of each of the seating frame
members 444, 446 between the attached edges 458, 460 and the free edges 462, 464. The
protrusions 448, 450 extend away from and perpendicular to the cross portion 305 of the leg

                                                    14
304. The protrusions 448, 450 also extend along the width of the corresponding free edges 462,
464. When the sprinkler support assembly 302 is positioned about the beam 202, the protrusions
448, 450 engage the beam 202 on the side of the beam 202 opposite the first plate 404.
[0063] The connecting member 452 extends between the inside edge 454, 456 of each of the
seating frame members 444, 446. The connecting member 452 provides rigidity to the seating
frame 320. When in use, the connecting member 452 and the seating frame members 444, 446
rest on the beam, determining the height 210 of the levered clamp assembly 308 relative to the
beam 202.
[0064] During deployment of the sprinkler system 100, the seating frame members 444, 446 and
the connecting member 452 of the seating frame 320 interact with the beam 202 to secure the
sprinkler support assembly 302 to the beam 202 and to maintain the alignment of the sprinkler
head fitting 120 by preventing the sprinkler support assembly 302 from rotating about the
levered clamp assembly 308.
[0065] Referring to Fig. 5a, the levered clamp assembly 308 is shown in the open position. In
the open position, the cam surface 420 of the lever 418 is not engaged with the first plate 404
and the distance between the rotational axis 437 of the pin 436 and the surface of the lever 418
closest to the first plate 404 is relatively small. Thus, the rod 410 has not been pulled toward the
lever 418 through the rod opening 412 of the first plate 404. The distance between the lever 418
and the second plate 406 can be adjusted by rotation of the rod 410 about its longitudinal axis
within the opening 413. Depending on the adjustment of the rod 410 within the opening 413 of
the second plate 406, a space is provided between the first and second plates 404, 406 and the
levered clamp assembly 308 can be positioned relative to or removed from the beam 202 if
desired.
[0066] Referring to Fig. 5b, the levered clamp assembly 308 is shown in the closed position. In
the closed position, the cammed surface 420 of the lever 418 is engaged with the first plate 404
and the distance between the rotational axis 437 of the pin 436 and the cam surface 420 is
relatively large. Thus, the rod 410 is pulled toward the lever 418 through the rod opening 412 of
the first plate 404. The rod 410 pulls the second plate 406 toward the first plate 404, thus
reducing the spacing between the first and second plates 404, 406 and securing the levered
clamp assembly 308 to the beam 202.

                                                   15
[0067] The above described sprinkler support assembly 302 is secured within a ceiling structure
106 using a quick release-type levered clamp 308 that enables sprinkler system installers to
quickly install, position, and uninstall sprinkler support assemblies 302. The amount of time and
labor required to install or modify a fire sprinkler support assembly 302 will thus be reduced
relative to some prior art support assemblies that are secured to a ceiling structure 106 by screws
or bolts.
[0068] The levered clamps 308 are designed to hold a sprinkler head 114 firmly in place during
operation by resisting side, rotational, and torsional forces. The clamping force of the levered
clamps 308 in combination with both the contact surface afforded by use of plates 404, 406 and
protrusions 424, 426 which grip beams 202 are sufficient to prevent unintended release of the
sprinkler support assembly 302. Additionally, the seating frame 320 ensures that the sprinkler
support assembly 302, and thus the sprinkler head fitting 120 remains aligned and stable during
operation of the sprinkler system 100.
[0069] Although the first and second plates 404, 406 are disclosed as being two separate
members, the levered clamp assembly 308 is not limited to this configuration. For example, in
an alternative embodiment (not shown), the second plate 406 may be formed as a partial cut out
portion of the first plate 404 that is folded back over a portion of the first plate 404. Instead of
being hinged to the first plate 404 as described above, the second plate 406 extends integrally
from the first plate 404 and can rotate relative to the first plate 404 about an attached edge due to
the flexibility of the material from which the plate is fabricated.
[0070] Referring to Fig. 6 and 7, an alternative embodiment of a sprinkler support assembly 602
is mounted within a ceiling support structure 106, which, in this example is a T-bar grid.
[0071] The sprinkler support assembly 602 includes a leg 604 and a hub assembly 606.
Opposed ends of the leg 604 include levered clamp assemblies 608 through which the cross
portion 605 of the leg 604 is supported. The support assembly 602 is rigidly secured to the
ceiling support structure 106 by the levered clamp assemblies 608. The levered clamp
assemblies 608 are configured to engage with a beam 202 of a ceiling support structure 106 and
secure the sprinkler support assembly 602 to the beam 202, as discussed further below.
[0072] The cross portion 605 of the leg 604 is in the form of a bar that extends generally parallel
to the ceiling support structure 106. The cross portion 605 of the leg 604 is also dimensioned to

                                                  16
extend across a pair of adjacent parallel T-bar beams 202. The leg 604 of the sprinkler support
assembly 602, including the levered clamp assemblies 608, is configured to resist the forces
imparted to sprinkler head 114 during its operation. As a result, stability of the sprinkler support
assembly 602 is ensured and the sprinkler head 114 is prevented from moving or rotating in any
direction during operation.
[0073] The leg 604 supports a hub assembly 606 which is similar in form and operation to that
of previously described hub assembly 306.
[0074] Referring to Fig. 8, an exploded view of the levered clamp assembly 608 is shown. The
levered clamp assembly 608 includes a base 702, a first plate 704 and a second plate 706. The
base 702 extends generally parallel to the cross portion 605 of the leg 604. Each plate 704,706
extends from opposed ends of and generally perpendicular to the base 702, forming aU-shaped
member. The levered clamp assembly 608 also includes a lever assembly 708. The lever
assembly 708 includes a threaded rod 710 that passes through corresponding rod openings 712,
713 in each plate 704, 706, and a lever 714 pivotally connected to one end of the rod 710. The
lever 714 includes a cam surface 716 that is in contact with the first plate 704. Additionally, the
first plate 704 and the second plate 706 each include a leg opening 738 that accepts the cross
portion 605 of the leg 604 of the sprinkler support assembly 602.
[0075] The first plate 704 includes a base end 721 joined to the base 702, and a free end 724
that is opposed to the base end 721. A leg opening 738 is disposed near the base 702 end of the
plate 704 and configured to accommodate the size and shape of the cross portion 605 of the leg
604 of the sprinkler support assembly 602. In addition, the first plate 704 includes a rod opening
712 disposed between the leg opening 738 and the free edge 724. The rod opening 712 is
unthreaded and is of larger diameter than the outer diameter of the rod 710.
[0076] The first plate 704 also includes a protrusion 720 disposed on the free edge 724 of the
plate 704. The protrusion 720 extends inwards toward the second plate 706 and along the entire
width of the first plate 704. The protrusion 720 extends generally perpendicular to the first plate
704. The first plate 704 can also include stiffening ridges that extend perpendicular to the base
702 along the length of the first plate 704 between the base end 721 and the free end 724 and are
configured to prevent the plate 704 from flexing. Alternatively, the first plate 704 can be
configured to have sufficient thickness to prevent flexion when the levered clamp assembly 608

                                                   17
is secured to the beam 202. The second plate 706 is substantially a mirror image of the first plate
704. In particular, the second plate 706 includes a leg opening 738 disposed near the base 702
end of the plate 706 and configured to accommodate the cross portion 605 of the leg 604 of the
sprinkler support assembly 602. In addition, the second plate 706 includes a rod opening 713
disposed between the leg opening 738 and the free edge 730. However, the second plate 706
differs from the first plate 704 in that the opening 713 is threaded, the threads configured to
engage with the threads of the rod 710. The second plate 706 also includes a protrusion 722
disposed on the free edge 730 of the plate 706. The protrusion 722 extends inwards toward the
first plate 704 and along the entire width of the second plate 706. The protrusion 722 extends
generally perpendicular to the second plate 706. The second plate 706 can also include stiffening
ridges 728 that extend perpendicular to the base 702 along the length of the second plate 706
between the base and the free ends 729, 730, and are configured to prevent the plate 706 from
flexing. Alternatively, the second plate 706 can be configured to have sufficient thickness to
prevent flexion when the levered clamp assembly 608 is secured to the beam 202.
[0077] The lever assembly further includes a lever 714 disposed on one end of the rod 710. The
lever 714 is pivotally connected to the end of the rod 710 by a pin 732 and the rotational axis
737 of the lever 714 is eccentric relative to the periphery of the cam surface 716. The cam
surface 716 of the lever 714 has a semi-circular peripheral shape. When the levered clamp
assembly 608 is assembled, the cam surface 420 abuts the outward-facing surface 740 of the
first plate 704. The lever 714 rotates about the pin 732 between an open position and a closed
position, as described above with respect to Figs. 5a and 5b.
[0078] The rod 710 extends through both the rod opening 712 of the first plate 704 and the
threaded rod opening 713 of the second plate 706. The threads of the rod 710 are configured to
engage the threads of the threaded rod opening 713 of the second plate 706. By rotating the
threaded rod 710, the amount of space between the plates 704, 706 can be adjusted to make the
clamp connection more secure.
[0079] The cam surface 716 of the lever 714 has the same shape and functionality as the cam
surface 420 described in the first embodiment.
[0080] When the lever assembly 708 is actuated, the cam surface 716 of the lever 714 rotates
about the eccentric rotational axis 737 and creates a camming action against the first plate 704.

                                                   18
The camming action reduces the spacing between the first plate 704 and the second plate 706 by
pulling the second plate 706 toward the first plate 704. The reduction in spacing causes the
plates 704, 706 and their corresponding protrusions 720, 722 to engage the beam 202. In this
way, the levered clamp assembly 708 is secured to a ceiling support structure 106.
[0081] The U-shaped member including the base 702, first plate 704, and second plate 706 of
the levered clamp assembly 608 is secured to the cross portion 605 of the leg 604 by a fastener
such as a positioning screw 734 that is received in a positioning screw opening 736 in the base
702. The positioning screw opening 736 is generally centrally located on the base 702. The
levered clamp assembly 608 can be positioned along the length of the cross portion 605 of the
leg 604 by loosening the positioning screw 734 and sliding the levered clamp assembly 608
along the length of the cross portion 605 of the leg 604 in the desired direction. The levered
clamp assembly 608 is maintained in the desired position on the cross portion 605 of the leg 604
by rotation of the positioning screw 734 to an extent that an end of the screw 734 is urged
against a surface of the cross portion 605 of the leg 604.
[0082] The above described sprinkler support assembly 602 is secured within a ceiling structure
106 using a quick release-type levered clamp 608 that enables sprinkler system installers to
quickly install, position, and uninstall sprinkler support assemblies 602. The amount of time and
labor required to install or modify a fire sprinkler support assembly 602 will thus be reduced
relative to some prior art support assemblies that are secured to a ceiling structure 106 by screws
or bolts.
[0083] The levered clamps 608 are designed to hold a sprinkler head 114 firmly in place during
operation by resisting side, rotational, and torsional forces. The clamping force of the levered
clamps 608 in combination with both the contact surface afforded by use of plates 704, 706 and
the protrusions 720, 722 which grip beams 202 are sufficient to prevent unintended release of
the sprinkler support assembly 602.
[0084] Referring to Figs. 3-5, the method of mounting a sprinkler support assembly 302 to a
ceiling support structure 106 will be described. The ceiling support structure 106 may consist of
T-bar beams 202. First, a person installing the fire sprinkler system 100 rotates the lever 418 of
each of the levered clamp assemblies 308 to the open position as is shown in Fig. 5a.

                                                  19
[0085] With the levered clamp assemblies 308 in the open position, the levered clamp
assemblies 308 of the sprinkler support assembly 302 are fitted onto the corresponding beams
202 of the ceiling support structure 106. Fitting the levered clamp assemblies 308 onto the
beams 202 may include manually spreading the plates 404, 406 of the levered clamp assemblies
308 by rotating the second plate 406 on the tongue 430 to obtain adequate spacing to accept the
beam 202.
[0086] When the sprinkler support assembly 302 is in the desired location within the ceiling
support structure 106, the spacing between the plates may be adjusted by rotation of the
threaded rod 410. Then the lever 418 is rotated into the closed position as is shown in Fig. 5b.
[0087] Closing the levered clamp assembly 308 causes a camming action between the cam
surface 420 and the first plate 404. The camming action pulls the rod 410 in the direction of the
lever 418, thereby pulling the second plate 406 toward the first plate 404. As the plates 404, 406
are pulled together the protrusions 424, 426 engage the beam, securing the sprinkler support
assembly 302 to the ceiling support structure 106.
[0088] The alternative embodiment of the sprinkler support assembly 602 is generally used in
the same way. However, the position of the levered clamp assemblies 608 can be adjusted along
the length of the cross portion 605 of the leg 604 before they are fitted onto the beams 202. This
adjustment is accomplished by loosening the positioning screw 734 and sliding the levered
clamp assembly 608 along the length of cross portion 605 of the leg 604 in the desired direction.
The levered clamp assembly 608 is maintained in the desired location on the cross portion 605
of the leg 604 by rotation of the positioning screw 734 to an extent that the end of the screw 734
is urged against a surface of the cross portion 605 of the leg 604.
[0089] A selected illustrative embodiment of the invention is described above in some detail. It
should be understood that only structures considered necessary for clarifying the present
invention have been described herein. Other conventional structures, and those of ancillary and
auxiliary components of the system, are assumed to be known and understood by those skilled
in the art. Moreover, while a working example of the present invention has been described
above, the present invention is not limited to the working example described above, but
various design alterations may be carried out without departing from the present invention as
described herein.
