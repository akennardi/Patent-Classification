                                 GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT

                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003] The present invention relates to the field of therapeutics for neuromuscular disorders.
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004] Botulinum neurotoxins are a family of bacterial toxins, including seven major
serotypes (BoNT/A-G) 1. These toxins act by blocking neurotransmitter release from neurons,
thus paralyzing animals and humans. In recent years, BoNTs have been widely used to treat a
growing list of medical conditions: local injections of minute amount of toxins can attenuate
neuronal activity in targeted regions, which can be beneficial in many medical conditions as
                                2-4
well as for cosmetic purposes
[00051 BoNT/A and BoNT/B are the only two BoNTs that are currently FDA-approved for
use in humans -4.These are toxins purified from bacteria without any sequence modifications
(defined as wild type, WT). As the application of BoNTs grows, limitations and adverse
effects have been reported. The major limitation is the generation of neutralizing antibodies
in patients, which renders future treatment ineffective '. Termination of BoNT usage often
leaves patients with no other effective ways to treat/relieve their disorders. The possibility of
antibody responses is directly related to both toxin doses and the frequency of injection '.
Therefore, this limitation mainly occurs in treating muscle spasms, which involves relatively
high doses of toxins. Consistently, antibody responses have not been observed in cosmetic
applications, which use extremely low toxin doses 5.
                                                  1

    WO 2013/180799                                                            PCT/US2013/030737
[0006] The major adverse effects are also often associated with treating muscle spasms, but
not cosmetic applications. This is because the adverse effects are largely due to diffusion of
toxins to other regions of the body and the possibility of toxin diffusion is directly related to
injected doses. The adverse effects ranges from transient non-serious events such as ptosis
and diplopia to life-threatening events even death 67. In a petition letter filed in 2008 by Dr.
Sidney Wolfe to FDA, a total of 180 serious adverse events, including 16 deaths have been
documented. As a result, FDA now requires the "Black box warning" on all BoNT products,
highlighting the risk of the spread of toxins, following similar warnings issued by the
European Union.
[0007] Because both the generation of neutralizing antibodies and toxin diffusion are directly
related to injected doses, lowering toxin doses (while maintaining the same levels of toxin
activity) is highly desired, which means the efficacy of individual toxin molecules has to be
enhanced. Such modified BoNTs with improved specificity for neurons will also reduce any
potential off-target effects due to non-specific entry into other cell types.
[0008] BoNTs target and enter neurons by binding to their specific receptors through their
receptor binding domains, which are well-defined in the literature (BoNT-Hc, Fig. 1A, B)
Receptor binding dictates the efficacy and specificity of BoNTs to recognize neurons.
Improving the receptor binding ability of BoNTs will enhance their efficacy and specificity to
target neurons. The receptors for most BoNTs have been identified (Fig. 1 C). BoNT/B, D-C,
and G share two homologous synaptic vesicle proteins synaptotagmin I and II (Syt 1/11) as
their receptors -13, while BoNT/A, E, D, and F use another synaptic vesicle protein SV2 9-14
18. In addition to protein receptors, all BoNTs require lipid co-receptor gangliosides (Fig.
ID), which are abundant on neuronal surfaces 19. Among the two Syt isoforms in rodents and
likely in most mammals, Syt II has - 0-fold higher binding affinity for BoNT/B than Syt I
and is also the dominant isoform expressed in motor nerve terminals, which are the targeted
neurons for BoNTs (Fig. 2A)     2      . Therefore, in rodents (on which most research has been
conducted), Syt II is considered the major toxin receptor, while Syt I is a minor toxin receptor
at motor nerve terminals.
[0009] One may argue that BoNTs already have high specificity to neurons, is it possible to
further improve their binding to neurons? The answer is a "Yes" for humans, because it was
recently discovered that the human Syt II has greatly diminished binding and function as the
receptor for BoNT/B due to a unique amino acid change from rodent (rat/mouse) Syt II
                               13,22
within the toxin binding site        . This is a change from phenylalanine (F) to leucine (L) at
position 54 (mouse Syt II sequence) (Fig. 2B). Sequence alignments have revealed that
                                                    2

    WO 2013/180799                                                         PCT/US2013/030737
phenylalanine at this position is highly conserved in both Syt I and Syt II across vertebrates,
including platypus, fish, rodents, and monkeys 2. Only human and chimpanzee Syt II
contains leucine at this position. As a result of this residue change, human and chimpanzee
Syt II has greatly diminished binding to BoNT/B, D-C, and G (Fig. 2C) and is significantly
less efficient in mediating the entry of BoNT/B (Fig. 2D), as compared to mouse Syt II. Since
human and chimpanzee Syt I still contains phenylalanine at the same position and can bind
BoNT/B, D-C, and G (Fig. 2E), the high affinity receptor for BoNT/B, D-C, and G in
humans is restricted to the minor receptor Syt I. These findings provide an explanation for the
clinical observations that a much higher dose of BoNT/B than BoNT/A (which binds a
                                                                                            24,25
different receptor) is needed to achieve the same levels of therapeutic effects in patients
Previously these observations were attributed to other reasons, such as the percentage of
active neurontoxin in the preparations used. The recent observations of such binding
differences of BoNT/B and human Syt II versus Syt II of other species suggests that different
residues of BoNT/B may be involved in binding to human Syt II. As such, sequence
modification to BoNT/B that is expected to affect binding to rodent SytII may have
unpredictable affects on BoNT/B binding to human Syt II.

[0025] Figure 1A- Figure ID shows schematic models for how BoNTs target neurons (A),
their overall protein structure ( B), a list of identified receptors (C), and the structural model
for BoNT/B binding to its receptors Syt and gangliosides (D). Figure 1A) A schematic view
of BoNT actions: BoNTs recognize neurons by binding to their specific receptors (step 1),
enter neurons via receptor-mediated endocytosis (step 2), the light chains of BoNTs then
translocate across endosomal membranes into the cytosol (step 3), where these light chains
act as proteases to cleave target host proteins (step 4). Panel A is adapted from Amon, S. et
al, JAMA, 285:1059, 2001     3.   Figure IB: BoNTs are composed of a light chain and a heavy
chain, connected via a disulfide bond. The heavy chain can be further divided into two
domains: the translocation domain (HN) and the receptor binding domain (HC). These
functional domains are well-defined and switchable between different BoNTs           1 This suggests
that the modified BoNT/B-Hc can be used to replace BoNT/A-Hc to generate chimeric
toxins. Figure IC) A list of identified toxin receptors. Figure ID) A structural model

[0026] Figure 2A - Figure 2G show prior data adapted from published literatures showing
(1) human Syt II is not an effective receptor for BoNT/B, D-C, and G; (2) residue changes in
the receptor binding domain of BoNT/B can significantly change the binding affinity to Syt II
and the potency of toxins; (3) key residues within the receptor binding domain of BoNT/B
that have been hypothesized to contribute to binding Syt II. Figure 2A) The comparison
between rodent Syt I and Syt II indicates that Syt II is the major toxin receptor, while syt I is
a minor toxin receptor in rodent motor neurons. Figure 2B) Human Syt II differs from
mouse/rat Syt II by a single residue within the toxin binding site (residue 54 in mouse Syt II,
51 in human Syt II). Figure 2C) Glutathione S-transferase (GST) tagged recombinant mouse
Syt 111-87 (m-Syt II) and a mouse Syt 111-87 mutant mimicking human Syt II (F54L, herein
referred to as h-Syt II) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and were used to
pull down BoNT/B, BoNT/D-C, or BoNT/G, with or without the presence of ganglioside
(Gangl). All three toxins bind to m-Syt 111-87, but not h-Syt II in the pull-down assays.
Figure 2D) Cultured rat hippocampal neurons only express Syt I but not Syt I 8. Therefore,
knocking down (KD) Syt I generates neurons with no endogenous toxin receptors. Full
length m-Syt II and h-Syt II were then expressed in Syt I KD hippocampal neurons, and these
neurons were exposed to BoNT/B (20 nM, 5 min exposure, 24 hrs incubation). It has been
found that h-Syt II was significantly less efficient than m-Syt II in mediating the entry of
BoNT/B, BoNT/D-C, and BoNT/G into Syt I KD neurons, as evidenced by the degrees of
cleavage of toxin substrate synaptobrevin (Syb). Figure 2E) Rat Syt I 1-83 and human Syt I
1-80 were used to pull down BoNT/B, BoNT/D-C, and BoNT/G, as described in panel C.
Human Syt I mediated similar levels of toxin binding as rat Syt I did for all three toxins.

using the receptor binding domain of BoNT/B 1 and B2 (right panel) to compete the binding
of 125I labeled BoNT/BI on recombinant Syt II (left panel). The IC50 (which reflect the
binding affinity) is 0.48 nM for BoNT/BI, and 2 nM for BoNT/B2, ~ 4-fold difference. This
affinity difference is due to the C-terminal of the receptor binding domain (residue 1028
129 1), because exchanging this region between BoNT/BI and BoNT/B2 (right panel)
virtually switches their binding affinity (right panel). Figure 2G) List of residues that are

binding to m-Syt II and h-Syt II. Figure 3A) WT BoNT/B-Hc and indicated BoNT/B-Hc
mutants were expressed as recombinant proteins in E. Coli. Bacterial lysates were harvested
and incubated with immobilized m-Syt 11 (1-87) or h-Syt 11 (1-87). Bound pellets were
analyzed by immunoblot assays, detecting BoNT/B-Hc using the HA antibody. "Input"

for their binding to Syt I and Syt II. Figure 4A) BoNT/B-Hc WT and indicated mutants were
expressed in E.Coli. Harvested bacterial lysates were incubated with immobilized GST
tagged human Syt I (1-80), with or without the presence of gangliosides. Bound materials
were analyzed by immunoblot assays detecting BoNT/B-Hc. E1191M significantly enhanced
binding of BoNT/B-Hc to human Syt I, whereas V1 18M has reduced binding to human Syt I
than WT BoNT/B-Hc. Figure 4B) WT BoNT/B-Hc and E1191M mutant were purified as
His6-tagged recombinant proteins and were incubated with immobilized GST-tagged m-Syt
11 (1-87) or h-Syt 11 (1-87), with or without the presence of lipid co-receptor gangliosides
(Gangl). BoNT/B-Hc cannot bind to h-Syt II without gangliosides and only displays a weak
binding in the presence of gangliosides. Purified E1 191M mutant binds h-Syt II without
gangliosides, and the binding is further enhanced in the presence of gangliosides.
[0029] Figure 5A- Figure 5B show that binding to human Syt I/II can be further enhanced by
combining selected single residue substitutions. Figure 5A) Selected double mutants that
combine two mutation sites as indicated were tested for their ability to bind m-Syt II and h
Syt II in pull-down assays as described in Fig. 3A. Combinations of two sites, E1191M or
E 1191Q with S1199L or S1199Y or S1199F (marked by arrows) displayed robust binding to
h-Syt II. Figure 5B) Binding of selected double mutants to human Syt I was analyzed in pull

were expressed in E.Coli and purified as His6-tagged recombinant proteins. Equal amounts of
these proteins (100 nM) were incubated with immobilized GST-tagged m-Syt 11 (1-87) or h
Syt 11 (1-87) as indicated, with or without the presence of gangliosides (Gangl). Bound
materials were subjected to immunoblot analysis. "Input" represents the purified recombinant
proteins in following orders: WT, E1191M, E1191M/S1 199Y. WT BoNT/B-Hc cannot bind
to h-Syt II without gangliosides and only displays a weak binding in the presence of
gangliosides (lane 4, 5). E1 191M mutant binds h-Syt II without gangliosides, and binding is
further enhanced in the presence of gangliosides (lane 6,7). E1191M/S1 199Y significantly
enhanced binding to h-Syt II as compared to E1 191M (lane 8, 9). Binding of
E1191M/S1 199Y to both h-syt II (lane 8,9) and m-Syt II (lane 10,11) are at similar levels as
WT BoNT/B-HC binding to m-Syt II (lane 13,14). Figure 6B) Equal amounts of BoNT/B-Hc
WT, E1191M, and E1191M/S1 199Y mutants were incubated with GST tagged h-Syt I.
Bound materials were subjected to immunoblot analysis. E1191M and E1191M/S1 199Y both
significantly enhanced binding to h-Syt I as compared to WT BoNT/B-Hc. Figure 6C)
Titrations (nM) of purified WT BoNT/B-HC were incubated with m-Syt II, while titrations of
purified El 191M/S1 199Y were incubated with h-Syt II, as indicated. Bound materials were
subjected to immunoblot analysis. Binding of E1191M/S1199Y to h-Syt II is at similar
levels as binding of WT BoNT/B-Hc to m-Syt II. Figure 6D) Binding affinity between
E 1191 M/S 1199Y and h-Syt II was estimated based on quantifying the immunoblot results
obtained in panel C. The Kd is estimated to be 19 +/- 3 nM for E1191M/S1 199Y binding to
h-Syt II, whereas the Kd for WT BoNT/B binding to m-Syt II is 68 +/- 12 nM. Therefore,
binding of E1191M/S1 199Y to h-Syt II is ~ 3.5 fold higher than WT BoNT/B binding to m
Syt II.
[0031] Figure 7 shows that BoNT/B-Hc E1191M/S1 199Y mutant can bind to h-Syt II
expressed on surface of neurons. Cultured rat hippocampal neurons express only Syt I, but
not Syt II. Therefore, knocking-down (KD) Syt I expression via lentiviral infection created
neurons without any endogenous Syt and that abolished the binding of WT and
El 191M/S1 199Y BoNT/B-Hc (the second frame from the left). M-Syt II, m-Syt II (F54L),
and h-Syt II were then expressed in these neurons via lentiviral infection. WT BoNT/B-Hc
can bind to m-Syt II, but not m-Syt II (F54L) or h-Syt II. El 191M/S1 199Y mutant can bind

                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0041] Aspects of the invention relate to the generation of C. botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)
polypeptide which has improved binding to its human receptors through the incorporation of
a modified receptor binding domain. From these findings, a new generation of therapeutic
BoNTs can be created by utilizing the modified receptor binding domain identified herein,
with improved efficacy and specificity to target human neurons than the currently utilized
WT BoNTs.
Definitions
[0042] As used herein, the term "binding affinity" means how strong a molecule's binding
activity is for a particular receptor system. In general, high binding affinity results from
                                                 11

    WO 2013/180799                                                            PCT/US2013/030737
greater intermolecular force between a binding domain and its receptor system while low
binding affinity involves less intermolecular force between the ligand and its receptor. High
binding affinity involves a longer residence time for the binding domain at its receptor
binding site than is the case for low binding affinity. As such, a molecule with a high binding
affinity means a lower concentration of that molecule is required to maximally occupy the
binding sites of a receptor system and trigger a physiological response. Conversely, low
binding affinity means a relatively high concentration of a molecule is required before the
receptor binding sites of a receptor system is maximally occupied and the maximum
physiological response is achieved. Thus, a botulinum neurotoxin of the present invention
with increased binding activity due to high binding affinity will allow administration of
reduced doses of the toxin, thereby reducing or preventing unwanted side-effects associated
with toxin dispersal into non-targeted areas.
[0043] As the term is used herein, "significantly enhanced binding" when used to describe
the binding affinity of a C. botulinum neurotoxin molecule of the present invention to a
specific receptor, refers to an increase in binding affinity for a specific receptor that is
substantially increased (e.g., by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the
binding affinity of the wild type molecule) as compared to the non-substituted version of the
molecule. In one embodiment, the enhanced binding is an order of magnitude or more higher
than the Kd of the non-substituted neurotoxin (e.g., the neurotoxin with a naturally occurring
BoNT Hc molecule). The term "significantly enhanced binding" when used to describe the
binding affinity of a BoNT/B-Hc binding fragment produced by the point mutations
described herein refers to an increase in binding affinity of the modified binding domain
(expressed as an isolated fragment of the entire BoNT protein) to a specific receptor that is
substantially increased (e.g., by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the
binding affinity) as compared to the binding of the non-substituted version of the molecule.
In one embodiment, the enhanced binding is significantly higher (e.g., 1.5X, 2.OX, 2.5X,
3.OX, etc.) than the Kd of the non-substituted fragment.
[0044] As used herein, the term "botulinum neurotoxin" means any polypeptide that can
execute the overall cellular mechanism whereby a C. botulinum toxin enters a neuron and
inhibits neurotransmitter release and encompasses the binding of a C. botulinum toxin to a
low or high affinity receptor complex, the internalization of the toxin, the translocation of the
toxin light chain into the cytoplasm and the enzymatic modification of a C. botulinum toxin
substrate.

[0045] A "modified receptor binding domain" or "modified Hc", as the term is used herein,
facilitates the binding of the C. botulinum neurotoxin molecule in which it is comprised, to a
receptor for C. botulinum neurotoxin located on the surface of a target cell. Such a molecule
is typically generated through genetic recombination technology. The modified Hc has a
binding activity for the receptor for C. botulinum neurotoxin located on the surface of a target
cell. As used herein, the term "binding activity" means that one molecule is directly or
indirectly contacting another molecule via at least one intermolecular or intramolecular force,
including, without limitation, a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a metallic bond, a hydrogen
bond, a hydrophobic interaction, a van der Waals interaction, and the like, or any
combination thereof. "Bound" and "bind" are considered terms for binding.
[0046] As used herein, the term "C. botulinum toxin protease domain" means a C. botulinum
toxin domain that can execute the enzymatic target modification step of the intoxication
process. Thus, a C. botulinum toxin protease domain specifically targets a C. botulinum toxin
substrate and encompasses the proteolytic cleavage of a C. botulinum toxin substrate, such as,
e.g., SNARE proteins like a SNAP-25 substrate, a VAMP substrate and a Syntaxin substrate.
[0047] Non-limiting examples of C. botulinum toxin protease domains are provided in Table
l and 2.
[0048] As used herein, the term "C. botulinum toxin translocation domain" or "HN" means a
C. botulinum toxin domain that can execute the translocation step of the intoxication process
that mediates C. botulinum toxin light chain translocation. Thus, a HN facilitates the
movement of a C. botulinum toxin light chain across a membrane and encompasses the
movement of a C. botulinum toxin light chain through the membrane an intracellular vesicle
into the cytoplasm of a cell. Non-limiting examples of a HN include a BoNT/A HN, a BoNT/B
HN, a BoNT/C 1 HN, a BoNT/D HN, a BoNT/E HN, a BoNT/F HN, and a BoNT/G HN, the
amino acid sequences of which are provided in Table 1 and Figures 10-16.
[0049] As used herein, the term "C. botulinum receptor-binding domain" is synonomous with
"Hc domain" and means any naturally occurring C. botulinum receptor binding domain that
can execute the cell binding step of the intoxication process, including, e.g., the binding of
the C. botulinum toxin to a C. botulinum toxin-specific receptor system located on the plasma
membrane surface of a target cell. It is envisioned that replacement of the binding activity
can be achieved by, e.g., replacing the entire C. botulinum Hc domain with a modified (e.g.,
enhanced) Hc domain.
[0050] As used herein, the term "C. botulinum toxin target cell" means a cell that is a
naturally occurring cell that a naturally occurring C. botulinum toxin is capable of
                                                13

intoxicating, including, without limitation, motor neurons; sensory neurons; autonomic
neurons; such as, e.g., sympathetic neurons and parasympathetic neurons; non-petidergic
neurons, such as, e.g., cholinergic neurons, adrenergic neurons, noradrenergic neurons,
serotonergic neurons, GABAergic neurons; and peptidergic neurons, such as, e.g., Substance
P neurons, Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide neurons, vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons,
Neuropeptide Y neurons, cholecystokinin neurons.
[0051] By "isolated" is meant a material that is free to varying degrees from components
which normally accompany it as found in its native state. "Isolate" denotes a degree of
separation from original source or surroundings, e.g. from flanking DNA or from the natural
source of the DNA.
[0052] The term "purified" is used to refer to a substance such as a polypeptide that is
"substantially pure", with respect to other components of a preparation (e.g., other
polyepeptides). It can refer to a polypeptide that is at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, or 75%,
preferably at least about 85%, more preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably at
least about 95% pure, with respect to other components. Recast, the terms "substantially
pure" or "essentially purified", with regard to a polypeptide, refers to a preparation that
contains fewer than about 20%, more preferably fewer than about 15%, 10%, 8%, 7%, most
preferably fewer than about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less than 1%, of one or more other
components (e.g., other polypeptides or cellular components).
[0053] The term "conservative" or "conservative substitution mutation" as used herein refers
to a mutation where an amino acid is substituted for another amino acid that has similar
properties, such that one skilled in the art of peptide chemistry would expect the secondary
structure, chemical properties, and/or hydropathic nature of the polypeptide to be
substantially unchanged. The following groups of amino acids have been historically
substituted for one another as conservative changes: (1) ala, pro, gly, glu, asp, gln, asn, ser,
thr; (2) cys, ser, try, thr; (3) val, ile, leu, met, ala, phe; (4) lys, arg, his; and (5) phe, tyr, trp,
his. Other commonly accepted conservative substitutions are listed below:

[0054] The term "substitution mutation" without the reference to a specific amino acid, may
include any amino acid other than the wild type residue normally found at that position. Such
subsitutions may be replacement with non-polar (hydrophobic ) amino acids, such as glycine,
alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and proline.
Substitutions may be replacement with polar (hydrophyllic) amino acids such as serine,
threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. Substitutions may be replacement
with electrically charged amino acids e.g,. negatively electrically charged amino acids such
as aspartic acid and glutamic acid and positively electrically charged amino acids such as
lysine, arginine, and histidine.
[0055] The substitution mutations described herein will typically be replacement with a
different naturally occurring amino acid residue, but in some cases non-naturally occurring
amino acid residues may also be substituted. Non-natural amino acids, as the term is used
herein, are non-proteinogenic (i.e., non-protein coding) amino acids that either occur
naturally or are chemically synthesized. Examples include but are not limited to n-amino
acids (03 and p2), homo-amino acids, proline and pyruvic acid derivatives, 3-substituted
alanine derivatives, glycine derivatives, ring-substituted phenylalanine and tyrosine
derivatives, linear core amino acids, diamino acids, D-amino acids, and N-methyl amino
acids. In some embodiments, the amino acid can be substituted or unsubstituted. The
substituted amino acid or substituent can be a halogenated aromatic or aliphatic amino acid, a
halogenated aliphatic or aromatic modification on the hydrophobic side chain, or an aliphatic
or aromatic modification.

[0056] The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount that is sufficient to
effect a therapeutically significant reduction in one or more symptoms of the condition when
administered to a typical subject who has the condition. A therapeutically significant
reduction in a symptom is, e.g. about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%,
about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 100%, or more as compared to a
control or non-treated subject.
[0057] The term "treat" or "treatment" refers to therapeutic treatment wherein the object is to
eliminate or lessen symptoms. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not
limited to, elimination of symptoms, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of
condition, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of condition, delay or slowing of progression
of the condition.
[0058] As used herein, a "subject" refers to a human or animal. Usually the animal is a
vertebrate such as a primate, rodent, domestic animal or game animal. Primates include
chimpanzees, cynomologous monkeys, spider monkeys, and macaques, e.g., Rhesus.
Rodents include mice, rats, woodchucks, ferrets, rabbits and hamsters. Domestic and game
animals include cows, horses, pigs, deer, bison, buffalo, feline species, e.g., domestic cat,
canine species, e.g., dog, fox, wolf, avian species, e.g., chicken, emu, ostrich, and fish, e.g.,
trout, catfish and salmon. Patient or subject includes any subset of the foregoing, e.g., all of
the above, but excluding one or more groups or species such as humans, primates or rodents.
In certain embodiments of the aspects described herein, the subject is a mammal, e.g., a
primate, e.g., a human. The terms, "patient" and "subject" are used interchangeably herein.
A subject can be male or female. A subject can be a fully developed subject (e.g., an adult)
or a subject undergoing the developmental process (e.g., a child, infant or fetus).
[0059] Preferably, the subject is a mammal. The mammal can be a human, non-human
primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, horse, or cow, but are not limited to these examples. Mammals
other than humans can be advantageously used as subjects that represent animal models of
disorders associated with unwanted neuronal activity. In addition, the methods and
compositions described herein can be used to treat domesticated animals and/or pets.
Embodiments
[0060] The observation that BoNT/B is less specific and potent in humans due to its inability
to bind human Syt II, may explain why comparatively higher doses are required than
BoNT/A. Higher BoNT/B doses correspond to increased chances for triggering antibody
responses and for serious side-effects to occur. Therefore, improved binding of BoNT/B to
                                                16

the human receptor Syt II, to increase its efficacy and specificity to target human neurons
should allow a reduced amount of the toxin doses used in therapeutic applications.
[0061] Aspects of the invention arise from the finding that modifying the protein sequence of
BoNT/B-Hc modifies binding of the fragment containing the receptor binding domain, to the
human Syt II receptor. Specific modifications have been identified that enhance binding,
thereby generating a domain that binds human Syt II with high-affinity. The modified
BoNT/B-Hc, when in the context of a full length BoNT protein, retains these binding
properties. Incorporation of a modified receptor binding domain with enhanced binding, into
a molecule comprising the other BoNT domains, thereby generates a full length BoNT
molecule with similarly enhanced receptor bindings. As such, new versions of BoNT with
high-affinity binding to human Syt II are generated. BoNT with significantly enhanced
binding can be used in similar therapies, albeit at lower doses than presently available BoNT
molecules, thus providing safer methods of treatment.
[0062] The BoNT polypeptides, including full-length BoNT polypeptides and BoNT
polypeptide fragments or domains described herein, and nucleic acid molecules which encode
them, are explicitly encompassed in the invention. These polypeptides and nucleic acid
molecules can be generated by recombinant DNA procedures known in the art. Such
polypeptides are typically referred to as "recombinant polypeptides" or "recombinant nucleic
acids".
[0063] BoNT has the overall structure shown in Figure 1B. BoNT is comprised of three
domains, each domain having a specific and independent function: a protease domain (also
referred to as the light chain), a translocation domain (HN), and a receptor-binding domain
(Hc). Domains of the various strains of C. botulinum neurotoxin have been shown to be
largely interchangeable (as demonstrated by naturally occurred chimeric toxins such as
BoNT/CD, which is composed of the light chain and HN of BoNT/C, with the Hc of BoNT/D
3  , in U.S. Patent 8,052,979). The protein can be in single chain form or di-chain form. The
di-chain form results from the naturally occurring protease processing of a protease cleavage
site located between the protease domain and the translocation domain. The protein is
maintained in the Di-chain form following protease processing by the presence of a di-sulfide
bond.
[0064] One aspect of the invention relates to a botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) comprising a
protease domain, a translocation domain, and a modified receptor binding domain of
Clostridial botulinum serotype B, as described herein, and a protease cleavage site. Typically
these are arranged in a linear amino-to-carboxyl single polypeptide order of the protease

domain, the protease cleavage site, the translocation domain and the modified receptor
binding domain. However, different arrangements of the various domains are expected to
function adequately. In one embodiment, the modified receptor binding domain comprises
one or more substitution mutations which lead to significantly enhanced binding to the
human Syt I receptor and/or the human Syt II receptor.
[0065] Strains of Clostridia botulinum produce seven antigenically-distinct types of
Botulinum toxins (BoNTs), which have been identified by investigating botulism outbreaks
in man (BoNT/A, /B, /E and /F), animals (BoNT/C 1 and /D), or isolated from soil (BoNT/G).
While all seven BoNT serotypes have similar structure and pharmacological properties, each
also displays heterogeneous bacteriological characteristics. The genetic diversity of the C.
botulinum strains is described in detail in Hill et al. (Journal of Bacteriology, Vol. 189, No. 3,
p. 818-832 (2007))   3,  the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0066] Toxins from the various C. botulinum strains share the same functional domain
organization and overall structural architecture. C. botulinum toxins are each translated as a
single chain polypeptide of approximately 150 kDa that is subsequently cleaved by
proteolytic scission within a disulfide loop by a naturally-occurring protease, such as, e.g., an
endogenous C. botulinum toxin protease or a naturally-occurring proteases produced in the
environment. This posttranslational processing yields a di-chain molecule comprising an
approximately 50 kDa light chain (LC) and an approximately 100 kDa heavy chain (HC) held
together by a single disulfide bond and noncovalent interactions. Each mature di-chain
molecule comprises three functionally distinct domains: 1) a proteolytic domain located in
the LC that includes a metalloprotease region containing a zinc-dependent endopeptidase
activity which specifically targets core components of the neurotransmitter release apparatus;
2) a translocation domain contained within the amino-terminal half of the HC (HN) that
facilitates release of the LC from intracellular vesicles into the cytoplasm of the target cell;
and 3) a binding domain found within the carboxyl-terminal half of the HC that determines
the binding activity and binding specificity of the toxin to the receptor complex located at the
surface of the target cell. The locations of the specific domains within the toxin are provided
in Table 1:

[0067] Complete amino acid sequences of the toxins are provided in Figures 10-16.
[0068] The binding, translocation and protease activity of these three functional domains are
all necessary for toxicity. The overall cellular intoxication mechanism whereby C. botulinum
toxins enter a neuron and inhibit neurotransmitter release is similar, regardless of serotype or
subtype. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the intoxication mechanism involves at least
four steps: 1) receptor binding, 2) complex internalization, 3) light chain translocation, and 4)
protease target modification. The process is initiated when the Hc domain of a C. botulinum
toxin binds to a toxin-specific receptor located on the plasma membrane surface of a target
cell. The binding specificity of a receptor complex is thought to be achieved, in part, by
specific combinations of gangliosides and protein receptors. Once bound, the toxin/receptor
complexes are internalized by endocytosis and the internalized vesicles are sorted to specific
intracellular routes. The translocation step is triggered by the acidification of the vesicle
compartment. Once translocated, light chain endopeptidase of the toxin is released from the
intracellular vesicle into the cytosol where it specifically targets one of three proteins known
as the core components of the neurotransmitter release apparatus (vesicle-associated
membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin, synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa
(SNAP-25) and Syntaxin). These core components are necessary for synaptic vesicle docking
and fusion at the nerve terminal and constitute members of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide
sensitive factor-attachment protein-receptor (SNARE) family. BoNT/A and BoNT/E cleave
SNAP-25 in the carboxyl-terminal region, releasing a nine or twenty-six amino acid segment,
respectively, and BoNT/CI also cleaves SNAP-25 near the carboxyl-terminus. The botulinum
serotypes BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F and BoNT/G, and tetanus toxin, act on the conserved
central portion of VAMP, and release the amino-terminal portion of VAMP into the cytosol.
BoNT/CI cleaves syntaxin at a single site near the cytosolic plasma membrane surface. The
selective proteolysis of synaptic SNAREs accounts for the block of neurotransmitter release
caused by C. botulinum toxins in vivo. The SNARE protein targets of C. botulinum toxins are
common to exocytosis in a variety of non-neuronal types; in these cells, as in neurons, light

[0069] The botulinum neurotoxin of the present invention comprises a modified receptor
binding domain. The modified receptor binding domain exhibits significantly enhanced
binding to one or more human receptors typically bound and utilized by one or more C.
botulinum toxin strains.     Examples of specific modified receptor binding domains are
provided herein. The isolated modified receptor binding domain polypeptide described
herein is also encompassed by the present invention, as is the isolated nucleic acid molecule
by which it is encoded.
[0070] The botulinum neurotoxin of the present invention also comprises a protease domain,
also referred to in the art as a light chain variant. The light chain variant may be a naturally
occurring light chain variant, such as, e.g., C. botulinum toxin light chain isoforms and C.
botulinum toxin light chain subtypes; or a non-naturally occurring C. botulinum toxin light
chain variant, such as, e.g., conservative substitution C. botulinum toxin light chain variants.
[0071] The botulinum neurotoxin of the present invention also comprises a toxin
translocation domain   (HN).
[0072] The various domains described herein (e.g., HN, He, or protease domain) include,
without limitation, naturally occurring variants, such as, e.g., isoforms and subtypes; non
naturally occurring variants, such as, e.g., conservative substitution mutations. Non
naturally-occurring variants, refers to a domain that has at least one amino acid change from
the corresponding region of the reference sequences (e.g., from Table 1 or Figures 10-16) and
can be described in percent identity to the corresponding region of that reference sequence.
[0073] It is recognized by those of skill in the art that within each serotype of C. botulinum
toxin there can be naturally occurring C. botulinum domain variants that differ somewhat in
their amino acid sequence, and also in the nucleic acids encoding these proteins. A naturally
occurring C. botulinum toxin domain (e.g., light chain,     HN  or Hc) variant envisioned for use
in the generation of the BoNT of the present invention can function in substantially the same
manner as the reference C. botulinum toxin domain on which the naturally occurring C.
botulinum domain variant is based, and can be substituted for the reference C. botulinum
toxin domain in any aspect of the present invention.

   WO 2013/180799                                                         PCT/US2013/030737
[0074] A non-limiting example of a naturally occurring C. botulinum toxin domain variant is
a C. botulinum toxin domain isoform such as, e.g., a BoNT/A domain isoform, a BoNT/B
domain isoform, a BoNT/C 1 domain isoform, a BoNT/D domain isoform, a BoNT/E domain
isoform, a BoNT/F domain isoform, and a BoNT/G domain isoform. A C. botulinum toxin
domain isoform can function in substantially the same manner as the reference C. botulinum
toxin domain on which the C. botulinum toxin domain isoform is based, and can be
substituted for the reference C. botulinum toxin domain in any aspect of the present
invention.
[0075] Another non-limiting example of a naturally occurring C. botulinum toxin domain
variant is a C. botulinum toxin domain subtype such as, e.g., a domain from subtype
BoNT/Al, BoNT/A2,BoNT/A3, BoNT/A4, BoNT/A5; a domain from subtype BoNT/BI,
BoNT/B2, BoNT/B3, BoNT/B4, BoNT/B5, BoNT/B6, BoNT/B7; a domain from subtype
BoNT/Cl-1, BoNT/C1-2, BoNT/D-C; a domain from subtype BoNT/E l, BoNT/E2,
BoNT/E3, BoNT/E4, BoNT/E5, BoNT/E6, BoNT/E7, BoNT/E8; and a domain from subtype
BoNT/F1, BoNT/F2, BoNT/F3, BoNT/F4, BoNT/F5, BoNT/F6, BoNT/F7. A C. botulinum
toxin domain subtype can function in substantially the same manner as the reference C.
botulinum toxin domain on which the C. botulinum toxin domain subtype is based, and can
be substituted for the reference C. botulinum toxin domain in any aspect of the present
invention.
[0076] As used herein, the term "non-naturally occurring variant" (e.g., C. botulinum toxin
light chain variant, Hc and HN ) means a C. botulinum domain produced with the aid of
human manipulation, including, without limitation, domains produced by genetic engineering
using random mutagenesis or rational design and C. botulinum domains produced by
chemical synthesis. Non-limiting examples of non-naturally occurring C. botulinum domain
variants include, e.g., conservative C. botulinum domain variants. As used herein, the term
"conservative C. botulinum domain variant" means a C. botulinum domain that has at least
one amino acid substituted by another amino acid or an amino acid analog that has at least
one property similar to that of the original amino acid from the reference C. botulinum
domain sequence (e.g., Table 1 and Figures 10-16). The variant may have one, two, three,
four, five or more conservative amino acid substitutions compared to the reference domain
sequence. Examples of properties include, without limitation, similar size, topography,
charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, lipophilicity, covalent-bonding capacity, hydrogen
bonding capacity, a physicochemical property, of the like, or any combination thereof. A
conservative C. botulinum domain variant can function in substantially the same manner as
                                               21

    WO 2013/180799                                                          PCT/US2013/030737
the reference C. botulinum toxin domain on which the conservative C. botulinum toxin
domain variant is based, and can be substituted for the reference C. botulinum domain in any
aspect of the present invention.
[0077] A non-naturally occurring C. botulinum toxin domain variant may substitute one or
more amino acids (e.g., one, two, three, four, five or more) from the reference C. botulinum
toxin domain on which the naturally occurring C. botulinum toxin domain is based. A non
naturally occurring C. botulinum toxin domain variant can also possess 95% or more (e.g.,
96%, 97%, 98% or 99%) amino acid identity to the reference C. botulinum toxin domain on
which the naturally occurring C. botulinum domain variant is based.
[0078] Various non-naturally occurring C. botulinum neurotoxins or specific domains
thereof, are described in International Patent Publications W095/32738, W096/33273,
W098/07864 and W099/17806, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0079] The C. botulinum neurotoxin or specific domain thereof described herein will
typically contain naturally occurring amino acid residues, but in some cases non-naturally
occurring amino acid residues may also be present. Therefore, so-called "peptide mimetics"
and "peptide analogues", which may include non-amino acid chemical structures that mimic
the structure of a particular amino acid or peptide, may also be used within the context of the
invention. Such mimetics or analogues are characterised generally as exhibiting similar
physical characteristics such as size, charge or hydrophobicity, and the appropriate spatial
orientation that is found in their natural peptide counterparts. A specific example of a peptide
mimetic compound is a compound in which the amide bond between one or more of the
amino acids is replaced by, for example, a carbon-carbon bond or other non-amide bond, as is
well known in the art (see, for example Sawyer, in Peptide Based Drug Design, pp. 378-422,
ACS, Washington D.C. 1995).
[0080] In one aspect of the invention, the botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) of the present
invention comprises a modified receptor binding domain of C. botulinum serotype B
(BoNT/B-Hc). The modified BoNT/B-Hc comprises one or more substitution mutations
which lead to significantly enhanced binding to the human Syt I receptor and/or the human
Syt II receptor. In one embodiment, the BoNT/B-He is from BoNT/BI (GenBank access No.:
AB232927.1).      The amino acid sequence of BoNT/B1-Hc Okra strain, used as the reference
template in the present invention is shown in Figure 8. The generation of B-He from other
strains by substitution of the amino acids that correspond to the specified position(s) in B 1
described herein is also envisioned. Also encompassed in the invention is an isolated,
purified modified receptor binding domain polypeptide described herein. The present

   WO 2013/180799                                                             PCT/US2013/030737
invention also encompasses a polypeptide comprising a modified receptor binding domain
described herein. The invention also encompasses a nucleic acid molecule which encodes
such a polypeptide. In one embodiment, the modified receptor binding domain is BoNT/B
Hc (e.g., from BoNT/B 1).
[0081] Modification of the BoNT/B-Hc protein sequence can be performed by either targeted
mutagenesis (site-directed mutagenesis) or random mutagenesis of each amino acid residue
within the region known for binding Syt I/II. These Syt binding regions are well defined by
previous studies relatingto mouse or rate Syt receptors  1,29,3631,32 but have not been clearly
determined for interactions between BoNT/B-He and human Syt receptors. Different
subtypes of BoNT/B can be used as the template to create the same or similar mutations by
generating corresponding mutations described herein for B 1-Hc. The corresponding position
for selected residues to be mutated can be readily identified by sequence alignment with the
B 1 subtype. The resulting polypeptide products are encompasses by the instant invention, as
are polypeptides comprising said products and nucleic acid molecules encoding said
polypeptides and products.
[0082] Amino acid sequence modifications to produce the modified receptor binding domain
can be mutation of a single residue to a different amino acid (single site substitution),
mutation of multiple residues at the same time (multiple sites substitution), deletion of one or
more residues (deletion), and insertion of one or more residues (insertion), as well as
combinations thereof. Methods for mutating proteins are well-known in the art (e.g., targeted
single site and multiple sites substitutions on the DNA encoding the BoNT/B-Hc sequence).
[0083] In one embodiment, one or more residues in BoNT/B-Hc that either contact rodent
Syt II or the surrounding regions, based on previous literatures on BoNT/B receptor binding
domain   29 and reported BoNT/B-Syt II structure (PDB ID: 2NM1) 31,32 are modified. These
include, without limitation those positions that correspond to position Y1 181, P1197, Al 196,
F1204, F1194, P1117, W1178, Y1183, V1118, S1116, K1113, K1192, S1199, S1201, E1191,
E1245, Yl256 ofBoNT/B-Bl. In one embodiment, one or more of these residues is
modified to a hydrophobic amino acid (e.g., V, I, L, M, F, W, C). In one embodiment, one or
more of these residues is modified to a less hydrophobic amino acid (e.g., A, Y, H, T, S, P,    Q,
N and G). Combinations of various modifications are also envisioned, including, without
limitation, mutations of two or more recited positions, to any variety of the herein recited
various amino acids.
[0084] In one embodiment, the BoNT/B-Hc has one or more substitution mutation (e.g., at
positions which correspond to positions El 191, Si 199, S1201, V1118, P1117, Y1 183,

A 1196, and Y 1181 of B1) that enhances binding to human Syt II as compared to WT
BoNT/B-Hc. In one embodiment, the mutation comprises one or more mutations that
correspond to El 191M/I/T/L/Q (El 191M, El 1911, El 191T, El 191L, or El 191Q), VI 118M,
S1199Y/L/F (S1199Y, S1199L, or S1199F), S1201V, P1117S/M/Y (P1117S,P1117M, or
P1117Y), Y1183M, Y1181M, A1196Y of B1, or combinations thereof (Fig. 3A, B). Suitably
the mutations are selected form the above mutations at positions 1118, 1191 and 1199 or
combinations thereof. In particular, mutations selected from one or more of V1 18M,
E1191M/Q/I and S1199Y may be beneficial. More particularly, the mutation that
corresponds to position E 1191 M or E 1191Q of B 1 is envisioned, since they display the
strongest enhancement for binding h-Syt II. The mutations corresponding to E1191M or
E1191Q of B1 also significantly enhanced binding of BoNT/B-Hc to human Syt I as
compared to WT BoNT/B-Hc (Fig. 4A). In one embodiment, the BoNT/B-Hc has two
substitution mutations.
[0085] Multiple site substitutions can also be generated by combining mutations in these
identified key residues. Such multiple site substitution mutants have further enhanced
binding to human Syt I and h-Syt II (Fig. 5). As a non-limiting example, mutations that
combine two single site substitutions such as those corresponding to E1191M or E1191Q
with S1 199L, S1 199Y or S1 199F of B1 displayed significantly enhanced binding to both
human Syt I and h-Syt II (Fig. 5). The enhancement in binding strength was surprising given
the relatively modest enhancement in bidning activity achieved by mutations at the 1199
position alone.
[0086] In one embodiment substitution of a residue corresponding to position E 1191, S 1199,
S1201, V1118, P1117, Al 196, Y1 181, and Y1 183 of BoNT/B- BI is envisioned, since it will
yield a BoNT/B-Hc mutant with enhanced binding to human Syt II. Additional combination
substitutions at positions including, but not limited to those that correspond to E1191, S1199,
S1201, V1118, P1117, Y1 181, Y1 183, and Al 196 of B1 yield BoNT/B-Hc mutants with
enhanced binding to human Syt II.
[0087] Accordingly, the invention encompasses polypeptides comprising BoNT/B-Hc with
modified amino acid sequence relative to the sequence of WT BoNT/B-Hc, wherein the
modified BoNT/B-Hc has significantly enhanced binding to human Syt I and II as compared
to WT BoNT/B-Hc. The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules encoding
such polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment, the modified BoNT/B-Hc mutants contain
amino acids substitutions at one or combinations of the amino acid residues corresponding to
V1118, E1191, S1199, S1201, P1117, Y1181, Y1183, and A1196 of BI. Inone

embodiment, these modifications include mutations corresponding to E1191M or E1191Q in
combination with S1199L, S1199Y or S1199F of Bl.
[0088] The present invention also encompass mutant full-length BoNT/B that contain the
same amino acid substitutions in B-He as described above for therapeutic applications in
humans. In a preferred embodiment, the full-length BoNT/B mutants contain amino acids
substitutions at one or combinations of the amino acid residues corresponding to position
E1191, V1118, S1199, S1201, P1117, Y1181, Y1183, and A1196 of Bl. Inone
embodiment, the modifications include combinations of E1191M or E 1191Q with Si 199L,
S1 199Y or S1 199F. The mutations can be made in the same manner as disclosed above for
BoNT/B-Hc, using any one of BoNT/B subtypes as templates. These mutant BoNT/B toxins
have significantly enhanced binding to both human Syt II and human Syt I, therefore will
achieve higher efficacy and specificity to target human neurons than WT BoNT/B.
[0089] Toxin diffusion and generation of neutralization antibodies are not limited to
BoNT/B, but also observed for BoNT/A, indicating that the binding affinity of BoNT/A to its
receptor SV2 also needs to be improved. Because BoNT/B binding to Syt 1/11 has much

higher affinity than BoNT/A binding to SV2                 , a modified BoNT/B receptor binding
domain (BoNT/B-Hc) with the ability to bind human Syt II can also be used to replace
BoNT/A-Hc to generate a modified chimeric BoNT/A with greater efficacy and specificity
for human neurons than WT BoNT/A. 28 29 30
[0090] It is further envisioned that the modified BoNT/B-Hc described above can be utilized
to replace the Hc of all other BoNTs. The Hc regions of each BoNTs are well defined and
their replacement can be performed via standard PCR fusion of DNA encoding BoNT/B-Hc
with the HN-LC of other BoNTs, which has been well-established in the art. In addition, these
replacements may also be performed using the C-terminal part of BoNT/B-Hc (designated as
Hcc), which is the region containing the binding site for protein receptors and gangliosides in
each BoNT. The resulting chimeric toxins will have the ability to target human neurons via
binding to human Syt I/II. As a non-limiting example, modified BoNT/B-Hc can be used to
replace the Hc of BoNT/A. The resulting polypeptides are encompassed by the instant
invention. These chimeric toxin will have a higher efficacy and specificity targeting human
neurons than WT BoNT/A. Such a chimeric BoNT/A toxin can be used for therapeutic
applications in humans and offers significant improvements over WT BoNT/A.
[0091] Another aspect of the invention relates to an isolated nucleic acid molecule
comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes the polypeptides described herein (e.g.,
modified receptor binding domain or the botulinum neurotoxin comprising the modified

comprises the nucleic acid sequence shown in in Figure 9. Such nucleic acid molecules can
be produced by recombinant DNA techniques.
[0092] Another aspect of the invention relates to a nucleic acid vector comprising the nucleic
acid molecule described herein. In one embodiment the vector is an expression vector. Such
an expression vector is referred to herein as an expression construct, and comprises a nucleic
acid molecule disclosed herein operably-linked to the expression vector useful for expressing
the nucleic acid molecule in a cell or cell-free extract. A wide variety of expression vectors
can be employed for expressing a nucleic acid molecule encoding a C. botulinum neurotoxin
of the present invention including, without limitation, a viral expression vector; a prokaryotic
expression vector; eukaryotic expression vectors, such as, e.g., a yeast expression vector, an
insect expression vector and a mammalian expression vector; and a cell-free extract
expression vector. It is further understood that expression vectors useful to practice aspects of
these methods may include those which express the C. botulinum neurotoxin under control of
a constitutive, tissue-specific, cell-specific or inducible promoter element, enhancer element
or both. Non-limiting examples of expression vectors, along with well-established reagents
and conditions for making and using an expression construct from such expression vectors
are readily available from commercial vendors that include, without limitation, BD
Biosciences-Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.; BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.;
Invitrogen, Inc, Carlsbad, Calif.; EMD Biosciences-Novagen, Madison, Wis.; QIAGEN, Inc.,
Valencia, Calif.; and Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif. The selection, making and use of an
appropriate expression vector are routine procedures well within the scope of one skilled in
the art and from the teachings herein.
[0093] Another aspect of the invention relates to a cell comprising the nucleic acid molecule
or expression construct described herein. The cell can be for propagation of the nucleic acid
or for expression of the nucleic acid, or both. Such cells include, without limitation,
prokaryotic cells including, without limitation, strains of aerobic, microaerophilic,
capnophilic, facultative, anaerobic, gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells such as
those derived from, e.g., Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis,
Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridia perfringens, Clostridia difficile, Caulobacter crescentus,
Lactococcus lactis, Methylobacterium extorquens, Neisseria meningirulls, Neisseria
meningitidis, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Salmonella typhimurium; and eukaryotic cells
including, without limitation, yeast strains, such as, e.g., those derived from Pichia pastoris,
Pichia methanolica, Pichia angusta, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae

and Yarrowia lipolytica; insect cells and cell lines derived from insects, such as, e.g., those
derived from Spodoptera frugiperda, Trichoplusia ni, Drosophila melanogaster and Manduca
sexta; and mammalian cells and cell lines derived from mammalian cells, such as, e.g., those
derived from mouse, rat, hamster, porcine, bovine, equine, primate and human. Cell lines
may be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, European Collection of Cell
Cultures and the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. Non-limiting
examples of specific protocols for selecting, making and using an appropriate cell line are
described in e.g., INSECT CELL CULTURE ENGINEERING (Mattheus F. A. Goosen et al.
eds., Marcel Dekker, 1993); INSECT CELL CULTURES: FUNDAMENTAL AND
APPLIED ASPECTS (J. M. Vlak et al. eds., Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996); Maureen

MANUAL, supra, (2001); BASIC CELL CULTURE: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (John
M. Davis, Oxford Press, 2.sup.nd ed. 2002); and CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN
MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, supra, (2004). These protocols are routine procedures within the
scope of one skilled in the art and from the teaching herein.
[0094] It is also envisioned that the modified BoNT/B-Hc described here can be utilized as a
delivery tool to target neurons in humans. For example, the modified BoNT/B-Hc can be
linked to other therapeutic agents, covalently or non-covalently, and acts as the targeting
vehicle to deliver the therapeutic agents to neurons in humans by binding to human Syt I/II.
As such, another aspect of the invention relates to a chimeric polypeptide molecule
comprising a first portion that is a modified receptor binding domain of C.botulinum serotype
B, comprising one or more substitution mutations which leads to significantly enhanced
binding to the human Syt I receptor and/or the human Syt II receptor, linked to a second
portion. The second portion of the molecule can be a bioactive molecule such as a
therapeutic agent (e.g., a polypeptide or drug). Linkage of the first and second portions of the
molecule can be covalent (e.g., in the form of a fusion protein) or non-covalent. Methods of
such linkage are known in the art and can readily be applied by the skilled practitioner.
[0095] Another aspect of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition
comprising the C. botulinum neurotoxin, or chimeric molecule described herein. In one
                                               27

    WO 2013/180799                                                          PCT/US2013/030737
embodiment, the polypeptide described herein is an active ingredient in a composition
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (referred to herein as a pharmaceutical
composition). A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means any pharmaceutically
acceptable means to mix and/or deliver the targeted delivery composition to a subject. The
term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein means a pharmaceutically
acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient,
solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject agents from
one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must
be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the
composition and is compatible with administration to a subject, for example a human. Such
compositions can be specifically formulated for administration via one or more of a number
of routes, such as the routes of administration described herein. Supplementary active
ingredients also can be incorporated into the compositions. When an agent, formulation or
pharmaceutical composition described herein, is administered to a subject, preferably, a
therapeutically effective amount is administered. As used herein, the term "therapeutically
effective amount" refers to an amount that results in an improvement or remediation of the
condition. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for
administration by injection. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition involves
the botulinum neurotoxin encapsulated in microspheres. In one embodiment, the
pharmaceutical composition involves the botulinum neurotoxin formulated for slow release.
[0096] In one embodiment, the botulinum neurotoxin, polypeptide, or chimeric molecule of
the present invention is in the form of a controlled release formula. Such compositions and
methods for adminstration are provides in U.S. Patent publication No. 2007/0020295, the
contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.
[0097] Botulinum neurotoxin can be obtained by establishing and growing cultures of
Clostridium botulinum in a fermenter and then harvesting and purifying the fermented
mixture in accordance with known procedures. All the botulinum toxin serotypes are initially
synthesized as inactive single chain proteins which must be cleaved or nicked by proteases to
become neuroactive. The bacterial strains that make botulinum toxin serotypes A and G
possess endogenous proteases and serotypes A and G can therefore be recovered from
bacterial cultures in predominantly their active form. In contrast, botulinum toxin serotypes
C1, D and E are synthesized by nonproteolytic strains and are therefore typically unactivated
when recovered from culture. Serotypes B and F are produced by both proteolytic and
nonproteolytic strains and therefore can be recovered in either the active or inactive form.
                                               28

    WO 2013/180799                                                         PCT/US2013/030737
The proteolytic strains that produce, for example, the botulinum toxin type B serotype may
only cleave a portion of the toxin produced. The exact proportion of nicked to unnicked
molecules depends on the length of incubation and the temperature of the culture. Therefore,
a certain percentage of a preparation of, for example, the botulinum toxin type B toxin may
be inactive. In one embodiment, the neurotoxin of the present invention is in an active state.
In one embodiment, the neurotoxin is in an inactive state. In one embodiment, a combination
of active and inactive neurotoxin is envisioned.
[0098] Also encompassed in the present invention is a kit comprising the pharmaceutical
composition described herein. The kit may further comprise a delivery tool or device for the
therapeutic administration of the composition, and/or instructions for therapeutic
administration.
[0099] Another aspect of the invention relates to a delivery tool or device for administration
of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein, pre-loaded with the pharmaceutical
composition (e.g., for single use). Such devices may be a syringe or a microneedle device for
delivery of the compositions. The syringe may be a single use syringe pre-loaded with an
effective amount of the composition. The microneedle device may comprise one or more
microneedles coated with the composition described herein, such as is described in U.S.
Patent Publication 2010/0196445, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their
entirety.
Methods of Treatment
[00100]          The present invention also includes methods for treating a condition typically
treated with a neurotoxin (e.g, skeletal muscle conditions, smooth muscle conditions,
glandular conditions, a neuromuscular disorder, an autonomic disorder, pain, or an
aesthetic/cosmetic condition). Such conditions are associated with unwanted neuronal
activity, as determined by the skilled practitioner. The method comprises the step of
administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition described
herein (e.g., containing a botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) or a chimeric molecule) to the
appropriate location in the mammal to reduce the unwanted neuronal activity, to thereby treat
the condition. Adminstration is by a route that contacts an effective amount of the
composition to neurons exhibiting the unwanted activity.
[00101]          Specific conditions envisioned for treatment by the methods discussed herein
include, without limitation, spasmodic dysphonia, spasmodic torticollis, laryngeal dystonia,
oromandibular dysphonia, lingual dystonia, cervical dystonia, focal hand dystonia,
                                                29

    WO 2013/180799                                                         PCT/US2013/030737
blepharospasm, strabismus, hemifacial spasm, eyelid disorder, cerebral palsy, focal spasticity
and other voice disorders, spasmodic colitis, neurogenic bladder, anismus, limb spasticity,
tics, tremors, bruxism, anal fissure, achalasia, dysphagia and other muscle tone disorders and
other disorders characterized by involuntary movements of muscle groups, lacrimation,
hyperhydrosis, excessive salivation, excessive gastrointestinal secretions as well as other
secretory disorders, pain from muscle spasms, headache pain. In addition, the present
invention can be used to treat dermatological or aesthetic/cosmetic conditions, for example,
reduction of brow furrows, reduction of skin wrinkles. The present invention can also be used
in the treatment of sports injuries.
[00102]          Borodic U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,005 discloses methods for treating juvenile spinal
curvature, i.e. scoliosis, using botulinum type A. The disclosure of Borodic is incorporated in
its entirety herein by reference. In one embodiment, using substantially similar methods as
disclosed by Borodic, a modified neurotoxin can be administered to a mammal, preferably a
human, to treat spinal curvature. In a suitable embodiment, a modified neurotoxin comprising
botulinum type E fused with a leucine-based motif is administered. Even more preferably, a
modified neurotoxin comprising botulinum type A-E with a leucine-based motif fused to the
carboxyl terminal of its light chain is administered to the mammal, preferably a human, to
treat spinal curvature.
[00103]          In addition, the modified neurotoxin can be administered to treat other
neuromuscular disorders using well known techniques that are commonly performed with
botulinum type A. For example, the present invention can be used to treat pain, for example,
headache pain, pain from muscle spasms and various forms of inflammatory pain. For
example, Aoki U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,215 and Aoki U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,915 disclose methods of
using botulinum toxin type A for treating pain. The disclosure of these two patents is
incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
[00104]          Autonomic nervous system disorders can also be treated with a modified
neurotoxin. For example, glandular malfunctioning is an autonomic nervous system disorder.
Glandular malfunctioning includes excessive sweating and excessive salivation. Respiratory
malfunctioning is another example of an autonomic nervous system disorder. Respiratory
malfunctioning includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Sanders et al.
disclose methods for treating the autonomic nervous system; for example, treating autonomic
nervous system disorders such as excessive sweating, excessive salivation, asthma, etc., using
naturally existing botulinum toxins. The disclosure of Sander et al. is incorporated in its
entirety by reference herein. In one embodiment, substantially similar methods to that of
                                                30

    WO 2013/180799                                                            PCT/US2013/030737
Sanders et al. can be employed, but using a modified neurotoxin, to treat autonomic nervous
system disorders such as the ones discussed above. For example, a modified neurotoxin can
be locally applied to the nasal cavity of the mammal in an amount sufficient to degenerate
cholinergic neurons of the autonomic nervous system that control the mucous secretion in the
nasal cavity.
[001051          Pain that can be treated by a modified neurotoxin includes pain caused by
muscle tension, or spasm, or pain that is not associated with muscle spasm. For example,
Binder in U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,468 discloses that headache caused by vascular disturbances,
muscular tension, neuralgia and neuropathy can be treated with a naturally occurring
botulinum toxin, for example Botulinum type A. The disclosures of Binder are incorporated
in its entirety herein by reference. In one embodiment, substantially similar methods to that of
Binder can be employed, but using a modified neurotoxin, to treat headache, especially the
ones caused by vascular disturbances, muscular tension, neuralgia and neuropathy. Pain
caused by muscle spasm can also be treated by an administration of a modified neurotoxin.
For example, a botulinum type E fused with a leucine-based motif, preferably at the carboxyl
terminal of the botulinum type E light chain, can be administered intramuscularly at the
pain/spasm location to alleviate pain.
[00106]          Furthermore, a modified neurotoxin can be administered to a mammal to treat
pain that is not associated with a muscular disorder, such as spasm. In one broad
embodiment, methods of the present invention to treat non-spasm related pain include central
administration or peripheral administration of the modified neurotoxin.
[001071          For example, Foster et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,545 discloses that a
botulinum toxin conjugated with a targeting moiety can be administered centrally
(intrathecally) to alleviate pain. The disclosures of Foster et al. are incorporated in its entirety
by reference herein. In one embodiment, substantially similar methods to that of Foster et al.
can be employed, but using the compositions described herein to treat pain. The pain to be
treated can be an acute pain or chronic pain.
[00108]          An acute or chronic pain that is not associated with a muscle spasm can also
be alleviated with a local, peripheral administration of the modified neurotoxin to an actual or
a perceived pain location on the mammal. In one embodiment, the modified neurotoxin is
administered subcutaneously at or near the location of pain, for example, at or near a cut. In
some embodiments, the modified neurotoxin is administered intramuscularly at or near the
location of pain, for example, at or near a bruise location on the mammal. In some
embodiments, the modified neurotoxin is injected directly into a joint of a mammal, for
                                                31

treating or alleviating pain caused by arthritic conditions. Also, frequent repeated injection or
infusion of the modified neurotoxin to a peripheral pain location is within the scope of the
present invention
[00109]          Routes of administration for such methods are known in the art and easily
adapted to the methods described herei by the skilled practitioner (e.g., see for example,
Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (1998), edited by Anthony Fauci et al., 14.sup.th
edition, published by McGraw Hill). By way of non-limiting example, the treatment of a
neuromuscular disorder can comprise a step of locally administering an effective amount of
the molecule to a muscle or a group of muscles, the treatment of an autonomic disorder can
comprise a step of locally administering an effective of the molecule to a gland or glands, and
the treatment of pain can comprise a step of administering an effective amount of the
molecule the site of the pain. In addition, the treatment of pain can comprise a step of
administering an effective amount of a modified neurotoxin to the spinal cord.

[001171          The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which should
not be construed as further limiting.
EXAMPLES
[00118]          The following experiments were performed to determine if it is possible to
change the binding affinity of BoNT/B to human Syt II by modifying the BoNT/B receptor
binding domain. The hypothesis is based on a series of previous studies: (1) It has been
shown in 1998 that a naturally occurring BoNT/B subtype toxin, BoNT/B2, exhibits ~4 fold
                                                   28
lower binding affinity to Syt II than BoNT/B          (also defined as BoNT/BI, Fig. 2F). This
affinity difference was demonstrated to be due to a few amino acid differences within their
receptor binding domains in 2003       29(Fig. 2F, G), demonstrating for the first time that
changing residues within the receptor binding domain of BoNT/B can change the binding
affinity to Syt II. These studies also identified key residues that influence binding affinity to
Syt II (Fig. 2G). (2) It has been reported in 2004 that single residue mutations within the
receptor binding domain of BoNT/A and BoNT/B can dramatically change the toxicity and
potency of these toxins (Fig. 2H), demonstrating that changes in receptor-binding affinity can
translate into changes of toxicity and potency of toxins       30. (3) The co-crystal structure of
BoNT/B bound to rat Syt II has been solved        31,32, and key residues that form the binding site
                               31 32
for Syt II have been resolved-       . These previous studies all utilized the rodent Syt II, but not
human Syt II.
[00119]          Target residues for engineering BoNT/B receptor binding domain to change its
binding affinity to human Syt II were identified from all these previous studies with rodent
Syt II binding.
[00120]          The receptor binding domain of BoNT/B is well defined 1. Previous studies
established that changing residues within the receptor binding domain of BoNT/B can
modulate the binding affinity of BoNT/B to rat or mouse Syt II          29,30. Co-crystal structure of
BoNT/B bound to rat Syt II has also been solved by two studies in 2006             ,32. The residue
                                                   41

    WO 2013/180799                                                          PCT/US2013/030737
change in human Syt II is a relatively conservative change from F to L, both are hydrophobic
residues. However, the difference in the binding affinity of BoNT/B for rodent Syt II is
significantly higher than for human Syt II. Furthermore, it is not obvious how the binding
interaction between BoNT/B and human Syt II might be modified to compensate for the lack
of this phenylalanine residue in the middle of the binding site. Whereas positive binding
interactions can be envisaged (and visualized in published crystal structures) between WT
BoNT/B-Hc and rat or mouse Syt II, e.g. involving stacking or packing of hydrophobic rings,
or between a WT BoNT/B-Hc and a modified human Syt II in which the phenylalanine is
substituted into the sequence; such interactions may not be reproducible between a modified
BoNT/B-HC and a WT human Syt II protein. This suggests that changing a few or even one
residue in BoNT/B might not be able to restore/improve binding to human Syt II without
major changes in the global structure of BoNT/B-Syt II complexes.
[00121]          The conserved phenylalanine at position 54 forms multiple hydrophobic
contacts with BoNT/B. Because leucine (in humans) is also hydrophobic, disruption of
BoNT/B binding is likely due to size/shape differences between phenylalanine and leucine.
The key to the invention was therefore to identify possible changes in BoNT/B-Hc region that
may accommodate and compensate for the change from phenylalanine to leucine. The
approach was two-fold: to focus on residues directly contacting phenylalanine 54 in rodent
Syt II: or to focus on residues within the surrounding region of BoNT.B-Hc, which might
compensate for the lack of a positive binding interaction with phenylalanine at position 54.
These residues that are potentially within the corresponding binding region between BoNT/B
and human Syt II were judged by reference to the BoNT/ B-rat Syt II co-crystal structure
(Fig. 21), to possibly include Y1 181, P1197, Al 196, F1204, Fl 194, P1117, Wi 178, Y1 183,
VI 118, S 1116, Ki 113, Ki 192, S 1199, S1201, El 191, E1245, and Y1256. Residues 1117,
1191, and 1199 have also been shown to be among the list of residues that influence binding
of BoNT/B2 to rodent Syt II in an earlier study (Fig. 2G)29 . Because the precise effect from
residue substitutions is impossible to predict, a "trial-and-error" approach was employed. At
first, single residue substitutions were carried out, followed by selected combinations.
Specifically, each of the listed key residues were systematically substituted with
hydrophobic residues with different sizes - with the screen limited to hydrophobic residues in
order to ensure that important hydrophobic contacts were maintained. These hydrophobic
substitution residues include: V, I, L, M, F, W, C, and other less hydrophobic amino acids
including A, Y, H, T, S, P,   Q, N, and G.

    WO 2013/180799                                                         PCT/US2013/030737
[00122]         A key to the success of the invention was to develop a feasible and economical
way for screening mutants. The basic approach was to detect binding of soluble recombinant
BoNT/B-Hc to immobilized mouseSyt II (F54L) in pull-down assays as described in Fig. 2C.
However, it was not feasible to purify all mutants for pull-down assays. Therefore, whether it
was possible to pull down BoNT/B-Hc from a small amount of bacterial lysates directly with
Syt II, without the need for purification, was tested. The rationale was that the binding
affinity of BoNT/B-Syt II might be high enough for this approach (Kd ~ 0.23 nM)      20. Indeed,
it was found that immobilized rat Syt II could "affinity-purify" enough WT BoNT/B-Hc
directly from merely 6 ml of bacterial lysates (Fig. 3A). This newly developed method
greatly simplified the effort to screen a fairly large number of BoNT/B-Hc mutants. Using
this method, screening of BoNT/B-Hc mutants for their binding to both a mouse Syt 111-87
(m-Syt II) and a mutated mouse Syt II that mimicking human Syt II sequence (F54L, h-Syt
II) was tested. Bound materials were subjected to immunoblot analysis detecting BoNT/B
Hc using the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A).
[00123]          The majority of mutants were found to fall into two categories: (1) fail to bind
m-Syt II and h-Syt II, such as F1204L and V1 118W (Fig. 3B); (2) still bind m-Syt II, but fail
to bind h-Syt II, such as F1204W and El 191W (Fig. 3B). These binding results are largely
omitted here except a few examples illustrated in Fig. 3A.
[00124]         Among mutants screened, a few that bound both m-Syt II and h-Syt II,
including VI 118M, Si 199Y/L/F, Y1 183M, S1201V, El 191M/I/Q/T (Fig. 3B) were
identified. Thus, these residues were determined to be at key positions for accommodating
the L residues in human Syt II or for compensating for the lack of phenylalanine residue at
this position in human Syt II. Although human Syt I is expressed at significantly lower levels
in motor neurons than human Syt II, it is nevertheless an important and capable toxin
receptor, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of BoNT/B in patients. In order to achieve the
highest possible binding to human neurons, in some aspects the modified BoNT/B mutants
should desireably not adversely affect binding to human Syt I. Ideally, they may even
increase binding to Syt I. Therefore, the binding of selected BoNT/B mutants to immobilized
human Syt I, using the same small-scale pull-down assay (Fig. 4A) was further examined.
Because Syt I binding to BoNT/B has a lower affinity as compared to Syt II, it requires the
presence of lipid co-receptor gangliosides   1.     This need was addressed by adding purified
brain gangliosides into bacterial lysates in the pull-down assays. As indicated in Fig. 4A,
human Syt I fragment (1-80) containing the toxin binding site was purified as GST-tagged
proteins and immobilized on beads to pull down WT and mutant BoNT/B-HC, with and
                                                43

without the presence of gangliosides (Gangl). As expected, WT BoNT/B-HC binds Syt I only
in the presence of gangliosides. It was found that the mutants El 191M and El 191Q
significantly increased binding to Syt I: these mutants can even bind to human Syt I without
gangliosides (Fig.4A). Other mutants either reduced binding to Syt I (e.g. V 118M) or
maintained the similar levels of binding as compared to WT BoNT/B-Hc (e.g. S1201V).
This indicates that E 1191M and E 1191Q are mutants that both enable binding to human Syt
II and enhance binding to human Syt I.
[001251         Mutation VI 118M was also of interest as it binds to human Syt II, but not
human Syt I. Therefore, it has the potential to be used to create therapeutic toxins that are
more specific for neurons that express Syt II than the WT BoNT/B in humans, thus reducing
non-specific entry into Syt-I expressing cells in humans.
[00126]         Using E1191M as an example, its interactions with human Syt II were further
validated using purified recombinant proteins, which allows us to compare binding of equal
amounts of WT BoNT/B-Hc and the E1 191M mutant to m-Syt II and h-Syt II (Fig. 4B).
E1 191M was found to bind to both m-Syt II and h-Syt II without gangliosides, and adding
gangliosides further elevated the binding (Fig. 4B). These results confirmed that E1191M
gains the ability to bind human Syt II in the absence of gangliosides and can form high
affinity complexes with human Syt II in the presence of the lipid co-receptor gangliosides.
[001271         Using E1191M/Q as the backbone, experiments were performed to analyze
whether combining it with other residue substitutions may further enhance binding to human
Syt I/II. Combining Si 199L/Y/ or /F with E1191M/or      Q generated double mutants that
display significantly higher binding to human Syt II (Fig. 5A). For instance,
E 1191M/S 1i99Y achieved similar levels of binding to both m-Syt II and h-Syt II (Fig. 5A,
lane 5 and 6). This was a significant enhancement as compared to E 1191M alone, which
mediated less binding to h-Syt II than its binding to m-Syt II (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, all
selected double mutants displayed significantly higher binding to human Syt I than WT
BoNT/B-Hc (Fig. 5B).
[00128]         Using E1191M/SI199Y as an example, binding of WT, E1191M, and
E 119 1M/S 1199Y to h-Syt II were further compared using equal amounts of purified
recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 6A, WT BoNT/B-Hc could not bind to h-Syt II in the
absence of gangliosides under the current assay conditions. E 1191M showed a modest
binding to h-Syt II without gangliosides, while binding of E191M/S 1i99Y to h-Syt II was
significantly enhanced as compared to E 1191M alone, especially without gangliosides
                                               44

    WO 2013/180799                                                        PCT/US2013/030737
(comparing lanes 6 versus 8). Furthermore, both E1191M and E1191M/S1 199Y significantly
enhanced binding to human-Syt I as compared to WT BoNT/B-Hc (Fig. 6B).
[00129]         Binding of WT BoNT/B-Hc to m-Syt II is known to have a high affinity'.
Thus the binding between E1191M/S1 199Y to h-Syt II versus the "golden standard": WT
BoNT/B-HC binding to m-Syt II was compared. As shown in Fig. 6C, titration of BoNT/B
Hc concentrations revealed that E 1191 M/S 1199Y has similar levels of binding at all
concentrations as WT binding to m-Syt II. The Kd was estimated to be ~19 nM between
E1191M/S1199Y and h-Syt II, and ~ 68 nM for WT BoNT/B-Hc binding to m-Syt II under
this assay condition (Fig. 6D) This is a gigantic improvement for binding h-syt II as
compared to WT BoNT/B-Hc, which failed to bind h-Syt II in these assay conditions (Fig.
6A). In conclusion, combining E1191M with Si 199Y provided a synergistic improvement in
binding affinity, outweighing an additive improvement over the E1191M mutant and yielded
new BoNT/B-Hc mutants with high affinity binding to both human Syt I and Syt II. By
contrast, combinations of some other beneficial individual mutations did not result in further
improved double-mutant BoNT/B-Hc domains.
[00130]         Finally, whether E 191M/S1 199Y mutant can recover the binding to h-Syt II
on the neuron surface was examined. Cultured rat hippocampal neurons only express Syt I,
but not Syt II. Syt I was knocked down (KD) in these neurosn and then replaced with
exogenous m-Syt II, m-Syt II (F54L), and h-Syt II via lentiviral transduction. Binding of WT
BoNT/B-Hc and E1191M/S1 199Y to these neurons was then tested (Fig. 7). WT BoNT/B
Hc only bound to m-Syt II, whereas E1191M/S1 199Y bound to both m-Syt II (F54L) and h
Syt II on the neuron surface, demonstrating that E 1191 M/S 1199Y mutant can use h-Syt II as
a functional receptor in neurons.
Materials and Methods
[00131]         Antibodies and materials: The mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was
purchased from Covance (16B 12). Bovine mixed brain gangliosides were purchased from
Matreya LLC (Pleasant Gap, PA) and were reconstituted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20
mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl) as previously described 9. BoNT/B (Okra) was purified in E.
Johnson's lab (Madison, WI) from indicated strains.
[00132]         cDNA and constructs: DNA encoding BoNT/B-Hc (residue 856-1291, based
on GenBank access No:AB232927.1) was synthesized by Geneart Inc. and its codon has been
optimized for expression in E. Coli. DNA encoding BoNT/B-Hc was subcloned into pET28a
                                               45

    WO 2013/180799                                                        PCT/US2013/030737
vector, with both a His6 tag and a HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) fused to its N-terminus.
Mutations in BoNT/B-Hc were generated via PCR using Quickchange Site-directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, CA), following the manufacturer's manual. The
following DNA were generously provided by indicated groups: rat Syt I (T.C. Sudhof, Palo
Alto, CA), mouse Syt II (M. Fukuda, Ibaraki, Japan), human Syt I (R.B. Sutton, Lubbock,
TX). GST tagged Syt I/II fragments and Syt II mutations were described previously 10-13-14
All constructs were verified by sequencing.
[00133]         Protein expression andpurification: WT and mutants of BoNT/B-Hc were
expressed as His6 tagged recombinant proteins in E.Coli. Syt I/II fragments and mutants were
expressed as GST tagged recombinant proteins in E.Coli. Both GST-fusion and His 6 -fusion
proteins were purified as previously described 9, with the induction temperature at 20'C
overnight with 0.25 mM IPTG.
[00134]          GSTpull-down assays: Two types of pull-down assays were carried out. The
first series were used to screen binding of mutant BoNT/B-Hc to GST-tagged mouse Syt II
(m-Syt II) and a mutant mouse Syt II (F54L) that mimicking human Syt II sequence
(designated as h-Syt II in Examples I to 6). Briefly, 6 ml of E.Coli expressing BoNT/B-Hc
were spin down, re-suspended in 800 gl TBS, sonicated, and then incubated with 2% Triton
X-100 for 1 hr at 4'C. Samples were then spun down at maximal speed for 15 min in a
microcentrifuge at 4'C. The supernatants were collected and were used for pull-down assays
by incubating with 10 gg of Syt proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE
bioscience, Piscataway, NJ) at 4'C for 1 hr. Samples were washed three times in washing
buffer (TBS + 0.5% Triton), and analyzed by immunoblot assaysdetecting BoNT/B-Hc using
the anti-HA antibody. For mutants with enhanced binding to h-Syt II, further pull-down
assays were carried out by purifying these mutant BoNT/B-Hc as His6 tagged proteins as
described previously 9. Pull-down assays were then carried out using immobilized Syt
fragments in 100 gl TBS buffer plus 0.5% Triton X-100, with or without gangliosides (60
gg/ml), for 1 hr at 4 'C. Beads were washed three times using TBS buffer plus 0.5% Triton
X-100. Ten percent of bound materials were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblot analysis.
[001351         Immunostaining:Culture neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with 0.250%Triton X-100, and subjected to immunostaining analysis detecting
both BoNT/B-Hc (with an HA antibody) and synapsin. Images were collected using a
confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5; 40x oil objective).
