                                     VACUUM CLEANER
          The   disclosure           relates        to    a vacuum cleaner                  to be
   powered by different power sources.
 5        A conventional vacuum cleaner                       is   usually         powered by
     mains       electricity             through          electrical              connection
     between a power plug of the conventional                              vacuum cleaner
     and a power            socket.        A  conventional              cordless vacuum
     cleaner        is     usually         driven       by     a   motor        that       has     a
10   relatively low output power which adversely affects
     vacuuming performance of the cordless                               vacuum cleaner.
          Therefore,          an object        of the present               disclosure          is
   to    provide a vacuum cleaner                    capable of being driven                    by
   different         power        sources       and      including           a   motor       that
15 provides         a relatively high output power.

   operating          unit       and     a   control         unit.          The      motor      is
20 configured            to     be     driven         by     direct         current           (DC)
   electricity           and has an output power not less than 350
   watts.        The AC-to-DC converting                     unit      includes         a first
   power supply, a DC stabilizer, a                              second power supply
   and a rechargeable               battery.           The first         power supply is
25 configuredtobeelectricallyconnectedtoapower                                            socket
   to receive        mains electricity              and is configured to convert
   mains electricity into first                          DC electricity.                  The DC

                                                       2
   stabilizer            is    electrically            connected to the first                     power
   supply and the motor, and is                              configured to stabilize
   the first          DC electricity               received           from the first              power
   supply so as to output stabilized                                   DC electricity              with
 5 a current          value that            is  maintained at             a level       not larger
   than 20 amperes to the motor.                               The second power supply
   is   configured to be electrically                              connected to the power
   socket to receive                   mains electricity,                  and is     configured
   toconvertmainselectricityintosecondDCelectricity.
10 The rechargeable                   battery       is    electrically             connected to
   the second power supply and the motor, and is                                      configured
   to be charged by the second DC electricity                                     received         from
   the second power supply.                           The operating             unit       includes
   a switch for turning                     on the vacuum cleaner.                    The control
15 unitiselectricallyconnectedto                                  the firstpower             supply,
   the second power supply and the switch.                                    When the switch
   is    in    a   conductive             state     and the control                unit      detects
   that      the power socket provides mains electricity                                        to   the
   first        and second power                  supplies,             the   vacuum cleaner
20 operates           in      an     external         power         supply       mode.         In    the
   external          power supply mode,                  the control           unit      activates
   the first         power supply to convert mains electricity                                     into
   the      first        DC     electricity            so     that       the    DC     stabilizer
   outputs         the stabilized               DC electricity              to the motor,            and
25 activates            the       second        power       supply        to    convert           mains
   electricity              into      the second DC electricity                       so that        the
   rechargeable                 battery         is     charged           by   the       second          DC

   cleaner          according        to    an    embodiment              of    the      present
   disclosure;             and
          FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the vacuum
10 cleaner.
         Referring           to   FIGS.      1   and      2,     a    vacuum       cleaner      1
   according to an embodiment of this                          disclosure            is  shown.
   The vacuum cleaner               1 includes         a motor 2,           an alternating
   current to direct current                      (AC-to-DC) converting unit
15 3, an operating unit 4,                   a control unit                 6, a housing 7
   and a       tube 71.          The motor 2        is     to    be driven         by direct
   current          (DC) electricity and has an output power not
   less than 350 watts.                   In this embodiment, the motor 2
   is    driven by DC electricity                  with a voltage               value of 24
20 volts.          The housing 7 contains                the motor 2 therein.                The
   tube 71 is        in   fluid    communication with an opening formed
   in the housing 7,                and corresponds                in position to the
   motor        2 for vacuuming up               dust and dirt.
         The AC-to-DC converting                 unit      3 includes         a first      power
25 supply 31,           a DC stabilizer 32,                  a   second power supply
   33 and a rechargeable                battery         34.       In   this     embodiment,
   the      first       and     second     power        supplies           31   and      33  are

                                               4
   electrically           connected         to    a   power       socket    9   (e.g.,
   household electrical               outlet)       through a power plug (not
   shown) when the power plug is plugged into the power
   socket 9.          The first power supply 31 is configured to
 5 convert mains electricity                  from the power socket 9 into
   first DC electricity.                   In one embodiment, the                first
   power supply 31 outputs the first                        DC electricity        with
   a voltage value of 24 volts.                      The DC stabilizer 32 is
   electrically         connected to the first               power supply 31 and
10 the motor 2,         and is     configured to stabilize                 the first
   DC electricity           received from the first                 power supply 31
   so    as     to   output    stabilized           DC   electricity.          In one
   embodiment,         the DC stabilizer            32 outputs the stabilized
   DC electricity          with a current value that is                   maintained
15 at a level not larger than 20 amperes to the motor 2.
   The second power supply 33 is configured to convert mains
   electricity           into     second        DC     electricity.           In   one
   embodiment, the secondpower supply33 outputs the second
   DC electricity          with a voltage value ranging from 27 volts
20 to 28 volts and a current value of 3 amperes.                           Note that,
   in   this     embodiment,      the first        and second power supplies
   31,       33    are   commercially            available          AC-to-DC     power
   supplies provided with the function of electric                               power
   conversion,         and the DC stabilizer              32 includes a current
25 stabilizing         circuit      and the present disclosure is                  not
   limited in this aspect.
         The       rechargeable          battery         34      is    electrically

                                        5
   connected to the second power supply 33 and the motor
   2, and is to be charged by the second DC electricity
   received         from   the   second    power       supply     33.       The
   rechargeable battery 34 has a relatively               large capacity,
 5 e.g.,      larger than 6000mAh (milliAmpere-hour).                  In this
   embodiment,        the rechargeable battery 34 has a capacity
   of 8700 mAh.
         The operating unit 4 includes a switch 41 for turning
   on     the    vacuum   cleaner    1.    In    one    embodiment,         the
10 operating unit 4 is           a user interface accessible and
   operable by a user of the vacuum cleaner 1 and the switch
   41 is       a power switch for turning the vacuum cleaner 1
   on or off.        The control unit 6 is electrically           connected
   to the motor 2,         the first   power supply 31,         the second
15 power supply 33,          the rechargeable battery 34 and the
   switch 41.
         When the switch 41 is in a conductive state           for turning
   on the vacuum cleaner 1 and the control unit 6 detects
   that      the power socket 9 provides mains electricity                    to
20 the first       and second power supplies 31 and 33, the vacuum
   cleaner 1 operates in an external power supply mode.
   In the external power supply mode, the control unit 6
   activates the first power supply 31 to convert mains
   electricity        into the first     DC electricity        so that the
25 DC stabilizer        32 outputs the stabilized          DC electricity
   to the motor 2,        deactivates the second power supply 33
   for a predetermined time period and activates                 the second

                                      6
   power supply 33 to convert mains electricity                into the
   second DC electricity         for charging of the rechargeable
   battery34 uponelapsingofthe predeterminedtimeperiod.
   That is      to say,  in  the external power supply mode,            the
 5 motor 2 is      powered up by the stabilized       DC electricity
   converted from mains electricity           and the rechargeable
   battery34is        chargedby the second DCelectricity, which
   is   also converted from mains electricity,             at the same
   time.       The predetermined time period is        one second in
10 this       embodiment.      However,   the   predetermined          time
   period can be varied to any time period greater than
   zero      seconds   and   implementation     of the    same     is   not
   limited to the disclosure herein.             Note that   by virtue
   of the DC stabilizer         32 that outputs the stabilized           DC
15 electricity       with the current value not larger than 20
   amperes to the motor 2,        the motor 2 would not be damaged
   by inrush current as the vacuum cleaner 1 is                  powered
   up.      Further,   damage to the rechargeable battery 34 due
   to surge voltage resulting          from abrupt input of mains
20 electricity       to the second power supply 33 can also be
   prevented since activation of the second power supply
   33 is delayed for one second when the control unit 6
   detects        that   the   power   socket    9  provides          mains
   electricity       to the second power supply 33.        The control
25 unit 6 is     a processor in this    embodiment and the present
   disclosure is not limited in this aspect.
         When the switch 41 is in the conductive state for

                                             7
   turning on the vacuum cleaner 1 and the control unit
   6 detects that no mains electricity                     is   provided to the
   first       and second power supplies 31 and 33,                   the vacuum
   cleaner 1 operates in              a battery-powered mode.              In the
 5 battery-powered mode,               the control unit 6 controls the
   rechargeable battery 34 to provide electricity                          to the
   motor 2.        It   should be noted that          in the battery-powered
   mode,      the motor 2 also has an output power not less than
   350 watts.
10        When the switch 41 is           in   a non-conductive state         for
   turning off the vacuum cleaner 1 and the control unit
   6     detects      that   the     power      socket      9   provides    mains
   electricity         to at least      the second power supply 33,           the
   vacuum cleaner 1 operates in                  a battery-charging mode.
15 In    this    embodiment,      in    the battery-charging mode,            the
   power socket 9 provides mains electricity to both of
   the first        and second power supplies 31 and 33.                   In the
   battery-charging mode, the                   control unit 6 similarly
   deactivates           the   second        power      supply     33   for   the
20 predetermined           time     period,       i.e.,       one  second,    and
   activates        the second power supply 33 to convert mains
   electricity         into the second DC electricity              for charging
   the      rechargeable       battery         34    upon     elapsing    of  the
   predetermined time period.                   At this      time,  the motor 2
25 is     controlled by the control unit 6 to refrain from
   operation,         and the rechargeable battery 34 is                 charged
   by the second DC electricity.

          To sum up,         by virtue        of the first              and second power
   supplies          31 and 33,        the DC stabilizer                   32,    the control
   unit        6  and    the    rechargeable              battery          34,      the   vacuum
   cleaner         1 of this     disclosure          can operate            in   three    modes,
 5 i.e.,           the       external            power          supply            mode,       the
   battery-powered mode                    and the         battery-charging mode,
   based on whether mains electricity                               is     provided to the
   first        and second power supplies                     31 and 33,           and whether
   the       switch       41    is     in    the      conductive               state      or  the
10 non-conductivestate.                     In theexternalpowersupplymode,
   the motor 2 has a relatively                     large       output power not less
   than        350 watts.          Meanwhile,            since       the      stabilized       DC
   electricity           output by the DC stabilizer                         32 to     the motor
   2 has a current            value not larger              than 20 amperes,               damage
15 to the motor 2 by inrush                     current         caused at           the moment
   when the vacuum cleaner                  1 is   powered up can be prevented.
   In     the battery-powered mode,                        since       the      rechargeable
   battery         34 has a relatively               large       capacity,           e.g.,   8700
   mAh, the motor              2 that        is    driven by the                rechargeable
20 battery          34 also    has an output power not less                             than 350
   watts         and thus provides               a  relatively good vacuuming
   performance to the vacuum cleaner                                1.
