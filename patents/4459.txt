               SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MODULAR DATA CENTER
                  CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 5         [0001]        This application claims priority to U.S. Utility Application No.
   14/504,081, filed on October 1, 2014 and also claims the benefit of U.S.
   Provisional Application No. 61/886,402, filed on October 3, 2013.           The entire
   disclosures of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.
10                                         FIELD
           [0002]     The present disclosure relates to data center systems and
   methods for constructing data centers, and more particularly to a modular, pre
   fabricated data center structure that is able to be configured in a highly space
   efficient manner for shipping purposes and then easily deployed at a destination
15 site to form a data center, and further which is readily modularly expandable to
   meet changing data center needs at the destination site.
                                      BACKGROUND
           [0003]     The statements in this section merely provide background
20 information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.
           [0004]     As data center needs increase world-wide, there has been
   increasing interest in finding more cost effective ways to set up and construct
   data centers.     Additional concerns are consistent quality of the data center
   components and the time required to construct the data center. These concerns
25 are especially relevant when constructing data centers in countries other than
   the United States.    Traditionally data centers have been constructed in "stick
   building" fashion completely at the selected data center site.          This involves
   bringing all the raw materials out to the data center site, using large numbers of
   construction    workers    such   as   electrical contractors,    welders,    building
30 construction workers and other skilled tradesmen to construct the data center
   structure from the raw materials shipped to the site. As will be appreciated, this
   construction approach can be quite costly. Maintaining quality of the finished
                                             1

   data center structure can sometimes be challenging, typically requiring
   numerous inspections by various individuals as the construction process is on
   going. Construction delays may be encountered when specific subcomponents
   or raw materials being used to construct the data center are not received at the
 5 building site according to the planned construction timetable.          The need to
   separately ship independent building components (steel, cable trays, wall
   panels, etc.) to the site can also contribute significantly to the overall high cost of
   constructing a data center. Seasonal weather changes and delays brought on
   by inclement weather can also result in a lengthy and costly construction timeline
10 for a data center structure.
           [0005]     Additional concerns with data centers are the ability to easily
   and cost-effectively expand the data center as needs grow. With conventional
   data center structures that have been constructed using the "stick build"
   approach, expansion can sometimes be expensive and particularly time
15 consuming.
           [0006]     Accordingly, there is strong interest in reducing the cost of a
   data center structure as well as the time needed for its construction.
   Significantly reducing the overall construction cost of a data center structure and
   the time required to get a new data center up and running may make it feasible
20 to set up data centers in various parts of the world where the cost of constructing
   a data center with the conventional "stick build" approach would make the
   endeavor cost prohibitive.
           [0007]     Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles
   or the like which has been included in the present specification is not to be taken
25 as an admission that any or all of these matters form part of the prior art base or
   were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure
   as it existed before the priority date of each of the appended claims.
                                         SUMMARY
30         [0008]     Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations
   such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of
   a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not
                                              2

   the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements,
   integers or steps.
           [0009]     In one aspect the present disclosure relates to a modular data
   center.   The modular data center may comprise a plurality of unit structures
 5 arranged generally parallel to one another. A plurality of supports may be used
   for supporting the unit structures elevationally above a floor, and wherein
   adjacent ones of the unit structures form hot aisles therebetween through which
   hot air generated from data center components may be channeled. Each unit
   structure may form an elongated structure having a frame structure, a roof panel
10 supported by the frame structure, and a ceiling panel. The ceiling panel may be
   spaced apart from the roof panel to define a volume through which the hot air
   from one of the hot aisles may be received and channeled. The roof panel helps
   to form a cold aisle between adjacent rows of data center components disposed
   below the unit structure. The cold aisle may be configured for channeling cold
15 air between the data center components.
           [0010]     In another aspect the present disclosure relates to a method for
   forming a modular data center. The method may include providing a plurality of
   unit structures each having a frame, with each unit structure operating to help
   form a cold aisle through which cold air may be circulated, as well as a hot aisle
20 through which hot air maybe circulated. The unit structures may be supported
   above a floor to allow data center components to be positioned under each of
   the unit structures in two rows facing each other to help form the cold aisle. One
   row of each of the two rows of data center components from adjacent ones of
   the unit structures may be used to help form the hot aisle therebetween. The
25 method may further include configuring each of the unit structures to form a
   volume, defined at least in part by a ceiling panel and at least in part by a roof
   panel, through which the hot air from one of the hot aisles may be received and
   channeled. The method may further include using the roof panel to help form
   the cold aisle between adjacent rows of data center components disposed below
30 the unit structure, with the cold aisle being configured for channeling cold air
   between the data center components.
                                             3

           [0011]    In still another aspect the present disclosure relates to a
   modular unit structure configured to help form a modular data center.            The
   modular unit structure may include a frame forming an elongated structure, at
   least one roof panel supported by the frame, a plurality of supports for supporting
 5 the frame above a floor, and at least one ceiling panel supported by the frame in
   spaced apart relation to the roof panel to form a volume between the ceiling
   panel and the roof panel. The volume may operate as a channel for channeling
   hot air originating from data center components positioned below the unit
   structure, where the data center components are positioned in two rows facing
10 one another. The unit structure may further operate to help form a cold aisle
   between the two rows of data center components, through which cold air is
   circulated; and wherein additional ones of the unit structures may be disposed
   adjacent one another in a plurality of rows to form a modularly expandable data
   center.
15         [0012]    In another aspect, the present disclosure relates to a unit
   structure for use in forming a modular data center. The unit structure comprises
   an elongated frame structure forming a rectangular-like subsystem, and adapted
   to be supported above a floor surface and above a plurality of equipment racks
   by a plurality of vertical structural support columns.     At least one conduit is
20 integrated into the elongated frame structure for supplying a fluid into an internal
   area defined by the elongated frame structure. The conduit is supported above
   the equipment racks by the unit structure. A panel is coupled to and extends
   vertically adjacent to the elongated frame which helps to form a cold aisle on one
   side of the equipment racks and a hot aisle on an opposite side, along
25 substantially an entire length of the unit structure parallel to a length of the unit
   structure.
           [0013]    In another aspect, the present disclosure relates to a modular
   data center. The modular data center comprises a plurality of unit structures
   arranged generally parallel to one another, the unit structures each adapted to
30 be supported elevationally above a floor by support elements, and wherein
   adjacently positioned pairs of the unit structures form hot aisles therebetween
   through which hot air generated from data center components may be
                                             4

   channeled.     Each unit structure forms an elongated structure having a frame
   structure, a roof panel for helping to form a cold aisle elevationally below the roof
   panel, and at least one cable tray supported from the frame structure so as to be
   suspended from the unit structure, and wherein the cable tray is supported by a
 5 hanger, the hanger in turn being coupled to the frame structure. At least one
   integrated lighting fixture may be disposed within the frame structure.
           [0014]     In still another aspect, the present disclosure relates to a
   modular data center for housing a plurality of equipment racks along one another
   in a row.     The modular data center comprises a plurality of unit structures
10 arranged in rows generally parallel to one another and separated by a
   predetermined spacing, and supported above a floor surface by a plurality of
   vertically arranged support columns at perimeter portions of the unit structures.
   The unit structures define a volume forming a cold aisle on a first side of the
   equipment racks, and a hot aisle on an opposite side of the equipment racks,
15 wherein the hot aisle is formed by the predetermined spacing. Each one of the
   unit structures is supported elevationally above a floor by support elements.
   Each unit structure forms an elongated structure having a rectangular frame
   structure, and a built in lighting fixture.
           [0015]     In a further aspect, the present disclosure relates to a modular
20 unit structure configured to be used with an additional one or more of the
   modular unit structures to help form a modular data center. The modular unit
   structure includes a frame forming an elongated frame structure, at least one
   roof panel secured supported by the frame, a plurality of supports for supporting
   the frame above a floor, at least one ceiling panel supported by the frame in
25 spaced apart relation to the roof panel to form a volume between the ceiling
   panel and the roof panel, the volume operating to receive only hot air from at
   least two adjacently positioned ones of the unit structures, the hot air originating
   from a hot aisle formed between adjacently placed ones of the unit structures,
   where the hot air originates from data center components positioned below the
30 unit structure, and where the data center components are positioned in two rows
   facing one another, the unit structure further operating to help form a cold aisle
   between the two rows of data center components, through which cold air is
                                               5

   circulated, wherein additional ones of the unit structures are able to be disposed
   adjacent one another in a plurality of rows to form a modularly expandable data
   center, and a plurality of deployable panels supported from the frame for pivoting
   movement forming at least one of the hot aisles or at least one of the cold aisles
 5 when moved from a stowed position into a deployed position.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           [0045]     The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is
25 not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be
   understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals
   indicate like or corresponding parts and features.
           [0046]     Referring to Figure 1 there is shown a portion of a modular data
   center facility 10 incorporating a plurality of modular, collapsible data center unit
30 structures 12 (hereinafter simply "unit structures 12") for forming a rapidly
   deployable data center.        Each of the unit structures 12 forms an elongated
   structure which may be used to channel both cold air from one or more air
                                                 8

   conditioning systems through a cold aisle 15 which separates parallel rows of
   equipment racks 14, as well to help channel hot air from a hot aisle. Each unit
   structure 12 is adapted to be supported by structural support columns 16 at a
   predetermined height above a floor 18 of the data center facility 10.        Figure 1
 5 illustrates a plurality of the unit structures 12 positioned in side-by-side fashion.
   Adjacent ones of the unit structures 12 are further spaced apart a predetermined
   distance. This spacing forms hot aisles 17 between adjacent ones of the unit
   structures 12.
            [0047]     With further reference to Figure 1, the modular data center
10 facility 10 may also include one or more modular penthouse exhaust structures
   20 for receiving hot air from the hot aisles 17 and exhausting the hot air from the
   modular data center facility 10. The modular penthouse exhaust structures 20
   receive the hot air flow from the hot aisles 17 through openings 24 in ceiling
   panels 26 of the unit structures 12.       This feature will be explained in greater
15 detail in the following paragraphs. A plurality of bridging ceiling panels 26a are
   also used to bridge the spacing between adjacent ones of the unit structures 12,
   and thus ensure that hot air being drawn out from the hot aisles 17 is exhausted
   through the openings 24.
            [0048]     Referring to Figure 2, one of the unit structures 12 is shown in
20 greater detail. In addition to the ceiling panel 26, each unit structure 12 has a
   frame structure 28 that supports a plurality of the ceiling panels 26 to form a roof
   like structure. A perimeter frame structure 30 may be coupled to the structural
   support columns 16. The perimeter frame structure 30 may be used to support
   collapsible (i.e., foldable) panels 32 to help maintain cold air from air conditioning
25 systems within the cold aisles 15 between adjacent rows of equipment racks 14.
   The perimeter frame structure 30 also may include a plurality of pivotally secured
   hangers 34 and 36 that are supported from the frame structure 30. Hangers 34
   in this example are supported from separate cross members 33 and are able to
   pivot into the orientation shown in Figure 2 for use.       Hangers 34 may have a
30 plurality of cable trays 38 secured thereto and hangers 36 may likewise have a
   plurality of cable trays 40 secured thereto. Cable trays 38 and 40 may be used
   to support a variety of different types of cables such as network cables, power
                                               9

   cables, etc., that need to be routed through the data center facility 10 to
   equipment components mounted in the rows of equipment racks 14.            A roof
   panel 42 may also be secured to the perimeter frame structure 30. Roof panel
   42 forms a partition which further helps to channel cold air from one or more air
 5 conditioning systems through the cold aisle 15 formed between adjacent rows of
   equipment racks 14.
          [0049]     With brief reference to Figure 2a, a portion of one of the
   hangers 36 is shown. The hanger 36 may be representative of, or identical, to
   the construction used for the hangers 34. The ability of the hanger 36 to pivot is
10 achieved, in one example, by using a round, rigid, tubular, elongated support
   member 36a, which may be supported for rotational movement at its opposing
   ends by a saddle-like bracket 36b, where the saddle-like bracket 36b is fixedly
   secured to a portion of the perimeter frame structure 30 by suitable fasteners
   (not shown). The saddle like bracket 36b is also shown in Figure 2b. Of course
15 any other suitable hinge or hinge-like structures could be implemented to enable
   pivoting motion of the hanger 36.
          [0050]     Figure 2a also shows that the hanger 36 may include a plurality
   of depending structural members 36c which may support the cable trays 40.
   The depending structural members 36c may be fixedly secured to the elongated
20 support member 36a so as to be able to rotate with the elongated support
   member 36a, and thus be able to present the trays 40 in an operative position
   below the perimeter frame structure 30 or in a stowed orientation. One or more
   braces 36d may be used to brace the hanger 36 in its operative position. The
   braces 36d may each be secured at one end to the perimeter frame structure 30
25 by suitable brackets 36e that enable pivoting motion thereof, and at their
   opposite ends to the depending structural members 36c.          This enables the
   braces 36d to be pivoted upwardly into stowed configurations once detached
   from the structural members 36c. Still, the braces 36d are able to be quickly and
   easily secured to the structural members 36c of the hanger 36, to brace the
30 hanger 36 once the hanger 36 is lowered into its operative position. It will also
   be appreciated that the hangers 36, as well as the hangers 34, may be
   constructed from suitable structural supports and brackets to permit their easy
                                           10

   removal from the perimeter frame structure 30, instead of a folding motion.
   Depending on how many cable trays 38 and 40 are employed, and the overall
   dimensions of the unit structure 12, it may be helpful or necessary to have the
   hangers 34 and or 36 supported by structure that is removable completely from
 5 the perimeter frame structure 30 when the unit structure is prepared for shipping.
           [0051]    With reference to Figures 5, 6 and 6a, one of the modular
   penthouse exhaust structures 20 is shown from one end thereof.             It will be
   appreciated that, in practice, a plurality of the modular penthouse exhaust
   structures 20 will be used to form an elongated channel 46 into which hot air 17a
10 from the hot aisles 17 may be drawn into with the assistance of a plurality of
   opposing exhaust fans 44.         In one embodiment each modular penthouse
   exhaust structure 20 may include a total of six exhaust fans 44 arranged as two
   opposing rows of three fans. With further reference to Figure 1, the openings 24
   in the ceiling panels 26 may also have positioned therein modulated louver
15 assemblies 48 that may be electronically modulated to tailor the flow of hot air
   from the hot aisles 17 that may be drawn into the penthouse exhaust structures
   20. Suitable air flow and/or temperature control monitoring systems (not shown)
   may be provided for this purpose.
           [0052]     Referring to Figure 3, one of the unit structures 12 is shown in
20 its collapsed configuration.    The unit structure 12 has the hangers 34 and 36
   pivoted into a stowed position where they are held such that they do not protrude
   below panel portions 32a of panels 32. Panels 32 are also pivoted such that
   they extend parallel to the ceiling panels 26. In the collapsed configuration the
   unit structure 12 forms an elongated, relatively narrow configuration with the
25 hangers 34 and 36, as well as the cable trays 38 and 40, tucked up between the
   panel portions 32a.       This configuration also forms a highly space efficient
   configuration from a shipping and packaging standpoint. Any suitable locking
   structure may be used in connection with the panels 32 to hold the panels 32 in
   their collapsed configuration, such as elongated structural beams (not shown)
30 that may be physically connected to select portions of the panels 32 and the
   perimeter frame structure 30. Figure 4 illustrates a pair of the unit structures 12
   in their collapsed configurations positioned back-to-back.        Each of the unit
                                             11

   structures 12, when in its collapsed configuration, may have dimensions of
   approximately 12192mm (40.0 feet) in overall length by 3658mm (12.0 feet) in
   width and 2848mm (5 feet and 5.22 inches) in height.               The back-to-back
   positioned pair of unit structures 12 in Figure 4 may have overall dimensions of
 5 about 12192mm (40 feet) in length, 3658mm (12 feet) in width and 2848mm (9
   feet and 4.13 inches) in overall height. The collapsed configuration enables a
   pair of the unit structures 12 to be efficiently packaged for shipping.
           [0053]      Figure 7 illustrates a modular cooling unit 50 that may be used
   to help form the modular data center facility 10 of Figure 1. It will be noted that
10 the modular cooling 50 may have dimensions of about 13761mm (45 feet) in
   length, about 7315mm (24 feet) in width and about 3500mm (11 feet and 5.8
   inches) in overall height. As such, the cooling module unit 50 is very similar in
   overall dimensions to the back-to-back pair of unit structures 12 shown in Figure
   4, which again facilitates shipping in a standardized shipping container.
15         [0054]      In Figure 8 one modular cooling unit 50 can be seen arranged
   so that its major length extends perpendicular to the major length of the unit
   structures 12, and such that it is positioned adjacent one of the ends of the unit
   structures 12. This enables the modular cooling unit 50 to supply cold air to the
   cold aisles 15 formed by a plurality of the unit structures 12.
20         [0055]     With reference to Figures 9-11, each modular cooling unit 50, in
   one embodiment, may form an evaporative (i.e., adiabatic) cooling unit that
   includes a filter unit 52, a media unit 54, a fan unit 56, and may draw on the
   order of 900kW. Figures 12-14 further illustrate these components.          Each fan
   unit 56 may include a plurality of fans 56a, and in one embodiment a total of
25 twelve such fans 56a configured in three separate cabinets 56b as shown in
   Figure 15. Figure 15 further illustrates that the cabinets 56b each may have an
   isolated access through a door 56c.
           [0056]      Figure 16 illustrates that the media unit 54 may include three
   independent evaporative cooling modules 54a-54c having four cooling stages
30 each. A DX coil and dampers 60 may optionally be included. The filter unit 52
   may include a plurality of filters 52a, an electronically actuated return air damper
   52b for controlling a return air flow into the modular cooling unit 50, and an
                                              12

   electronically actuated outside air louver and damper 52c for controlling the flow
   of outside (ambient air) drawn into the modular cooling unit 50.         Figure 17
   illustrates how hot air 17a in the hot aisles 17 may be returned within an area 64
   formed between the ceiling panels 26, the bridging ceiling panels 26a, and the
 5 roof panels 42 of the unit structures 12 as "return" air through the return air
   dampers 52b to the modular cooling unit 50. Cool air 62 is supplied into each of
   the cold aisles 15 by the modular cooling units 50, which are able to draw in
   outside air 63.
            [0057]   Figure 18 illustrates one embodiment of a modular "power hall"
10 70 that may be used in connection with the unit structures 12 to form the
   modular data center facility 10. With additional reference to Figures 19-22, the
   modular power hall 70 may be made up of one or more modular power supply
   units 72 (Figure 19), one or more modular power cabinet units 74 (Figure 20),
   one or more modular UPS (uninterruptible power supply) units 76 and one or
15 more modular PDU (power distribution unit) units 78, as well as any other type of
   power component or subsystem. Figure 18 also shows a plurality of electrical
   bus bars 80 that may be used to connect the various components in each of the
   modular units 72-78 as needed to distribute power.
            [0058]   The modular power supply units 72 may each include a main
20 bus, for example a 5000A main bus for supplying 1OOkA at 480V. A plurality of
   main breakers and distributed breakers may also be included along with a
   suitable power control system and a power quality meter.
            [0059]   The modular power cabinet units 74 may each include a 1600A
   bus main bus for delivering 65kA at 480V.         Power breakers and distribution
25 breakers may be configured as needed for specific applications.
            [0060]   The    modular   UPS     units 76 may each      include parallel
   400kVA/400kW modules to provide 750kW of backup power. However, it will be
   appreciated that the UPS units 76 may be configured as needed to suit a specific
   application.
30          [0061]   Each of the modular PDU units 78 may be configured to provide
   300kVA 480/208/120V, or a different selected electrical output. Load distribution
                                             13

   breakers may also be mounted in cabinets (not shown) that are in turn mounted
   to the sides of a frame of each PDU contained in the modular PDU unit 78.
           [0062]     Each of the modular units 72-78 may have similar or identical
   dimensions. In one embodiment the dimensions of the modular units 72-78 are
 5 identical with a length of 12192mm (40 feet), a width of 3658mm (12 feet) and a
   height of 3500mm (11 feet and 5.8 inches). Obviously these dimensions may be
   varied slightly if needed.    In this example, the modular units 72-78 may have
   length and width dimensions that are the same as the unit structures 12. These
   dimensions enable shipping of the modular units 72-78 in conventional shipping
10 containers.
           [0063]     With brief reference to Figure 21, each of the modular units 72
   78 may include a frame structure 73 having one or more of components secured
   thereto such as a floor 73a and one or more wall portions 73b. The modular
   units 72-78 are also rapidly deployable when they are received at the destination
15 site. The modular configuration of the units 72-78 allows for easily expanding
   the power supply capabilities of the power hall 70 as data center needs grow.
           [0064]     Figure 23 shows an overhead view of one example of an
   implementation of the modular data center facility 10. The unit structures 12 are
   grouped into two halls, "Hall A" and "Hall B", separated by a modular
20 office/storage section area 80.       A modular water treatment section 82 may
   include water treatment equipment. Rows 84 of modular cooling units 50 may
   be arranged adjacent the rows of unit structures 12.            A row of modular
   penthouse exhaust structures 20 (not shown in Figure 23) may extend over a
   hallway area 86, perpendicularly to the unit structures 12, to interface with the
25 hot aisles 17 adjacent the unit structures 12.        A modular room 87 may be
   included for other data center or office equipment.
           [0065]     Referring to Figure 24, a unit structure 100 is shown in
   accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure.             The unit
   structure 100 is this example also has additional structural columns 102 that may
30 be used to help form a hot aisle with one or more doors at opposing ends of the
   unit structure 100.
                                             14

           [0066]     The unit structure 100 can also be seen in Figure 25 to include
   a central, elongated tray 104 that runs a substantial portion of a full length of the
   unit structure 100. The central, elongated tray 104 may include a pair of curving
   tray portions 106 that enable cables to be fed out from the central, elongated tray
 5 104. The central, elongated tray 104 and the curving tray portions 106 may each
   include a plurality of posts 108 to help retain cables within the trays 104 and 106.
           [0067]      It will be appreciated that the various embodiments of the
   present disclosure may incorporate built in lighting fixtures, as well as one or
   more lengths of built in conduit for the delivery of water or a different fire
10 suppression agent. The cable trays 38, 40 and 104 may be used to divide and
   route specific types of cabling (i.e., optical, power, network, etc.) depending on
   user requirements or preferences.
           [0068]     The various embodiments of the modular data center facility 10
   enable the various modular components that are used to form the data center to
15 be easily shipped to a destination site and constructed in a desired configuration.
   The modular components the data center facility 10 can be rapidly deployed so
   that a fully functioning data center can be constructed much more quickly than a
   conventional "stick built" data center structure.
           [0069]     While various embodiments have been described, those skilled
20 in the art will recognize modifications or variations which might be made without
   departing from the present disclosure. Any dimensions given on the drawings
   hereof are intended to be merely examples of suitable dimensions, and such
   may be modified as needed to meet the needs of specific applications.              The
