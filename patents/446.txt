   Description of an Embodiment of the  Invention
   The present gaming system operates such that during base
25 game play, a plurality of symbols are randomly selected
   from a set  of symbols and displayed in a corresponding
   plurality of display positions. The  symbols shown at the
   display positions are used to determine game outcomes by
   comparing the displayed  symbols with defined winning
30 combinations.
   In one conventional type of gaming machine, a display area
   including 15 display positions  is presented to a player
                                             10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 6
   with each display position including one   symbol.             The
   display positions are arranged in five vertically disposed
   reels, with each reel corresponding with a display
   position group, and each reel having three visible display
 5 positions.  After the reels are  spun and subsequently
   stopped, the display positions  show a random selection of
   symbols.
   Generally, with such games, a plurality of win patterns                      in
10 the form of win lines are defined which extend across the
   reels and include one display position from each reel.
   Typically the symbols that are disposed in a win line are
   compared with winning symbol combinations defined in a pay
   table so as to determine whether a player of the game
15 should receive an award.  For example, if winning symbol
   combinations are based on poker hands,  a particular prize
   would be awarded if the win line comprises     four aces.
   Other winning symbol combinations and corresponding prizes
   may also be defined.
20
   Such a game often comprises normal game mode and special
   game mode. During normal game mode, the displayed symbols
   are compared with base winning combinations defined in a
   pay table.
25
   With the present system, a plurality of base games are
   implemented and each game outcome is evaluated to
   determine whether a winning outcome exists.         If a winning
   outcome occurs in any of the base games, one or more
30 prizes are awarded to the player.
   Special game mode is triggered when a defined outcome
   occurs across the base games. For example, in an
                                            10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

   embodiment comprising two base games,   the defined outcome
   may be display of a defined symbol in any of a plurality
   of defined symbol positions of the first base game or a
   plurality of defined symbol positions of the second base
 5 game.
   During special  game mode, at least  one feature game is
   implemented, and in this example a plurality of feature
   games are available.
10
   Referring to the drawings, there is   shown a schematic
   block diagram of a gaming system 10 arranged to implement
   a probabilistic game of the type wherein several symbols
   from a set  of symbols are randomly displayed, and a game
15 outcome is determined on the basis of the displayed
   symbols.   The system is of the type  including multiple
   game modes, such as being operable in normal game mode
   wherein base games are  implemented and special           game mode
   wherein a feature game  is implemented.
20
   With some such probabilistic games, the set of symbols
   used during normal game mode include   standard symbols and
   function symbols, and the game outcome is determined on
   the basis of the displayed standard symbols and the
25 function associated with any displayed function symbol.
   For example, standard symbols may resemble fruit               such as
   apples, pears and bananas with a win outcome being
   determined when a predetermined number of the same                 fruit
   appear on a display along a win line, or are displayed
30 according to defined outcome patterns such as scattered,
   and so on.   The function associated with a function symbol
   may be for example a wild function wherein display of the
   function symbol is treated during consideration of the
                                              10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 8
   game outcome as any of the standard symbols.          A function
   symbol may be represented as the word "WILD", a star, or
   by any other suitable word or symbol.  Other functions are
   also envisaged such as scatter functions, multiplier
 5 functions, repeat win functions, jackpot functions and
   feature commencement functions.
   Referring to Figure 1, a schematic diagram of components
   of a gaming system 10 in accordance with the present
10 embodiment is shown.  The components comprise a player
   interface 30 and a game controller 32.  The player
   interface 30 is arranged to enable interaction between a
   player and the gaming system and for this purpose includes
   input/output components required for the player to enter
15 instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface 30 may vary but will
   typically include a credit mechanism 34 to enable a player
   to input credits and receive payouts, one or more displays
20 36 which may comprise a touch screen, and a game play
   mechanism 38 arranged to enable a player to input game
   play instructions.
   The game controller 32 is in data communication with the
25 player interface 30 and typically includes a processor 40
   arranged to process game play instructions and output game
   player outcomes to the display 36.  Typically, the game
   play instructions are stored as program code in a memory
   42 that can also be hardwired.  It will be understood that
30 in this specification the term "processor" is used to
   refer generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions and may include a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable logic device or other
                                            10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                                -  9
   computational device such as a personal computer or a
   server.
   A functional diagram illustrating operative components of
 5 the game controller 32   is shown in Figure 2.
   In this example, the components of the game controller 32
   are operable to implement   a first base game and a second
   base game, to determine game outcomes of the first and
10 second base games, to trigger special    game mode when a
   defined outcome occurs across both base games,             and to
   implement at  least one  feature game when special game mode
   is triggered.
15 The game controller 32   includes a first game         symbol
   selector 20 arranged to select several first           symbols from
   available symbols  14a associated with the      first game. Once
   selected, the  first selected symbols   are displayed to a
   player in a plurality of first display positions.
20
   In an embodiment, each of the plurality of first display
   positions is associated with one of a plurality              of first
   display position groups, and each first group comprises
   two or more first display positions.    In this example, the
25 plurality of first display position groups        are represented
   by reels, and the game   is played by spinning reels
   containing the  first symbols   and stopping the reels                so as
   to display at  least one  first symbol on each reel.
30 The game controller 32 also    comprises a second game symbol
   selector 22,  operable in a similar manner to the first
   symbol selector 20,  to select several   second symbols from
   available second symbols 14b associated with the second
                                               10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  10
   game, and display the selected second symbols            in second
   display positions.
   In an embodiment, each of the plurality of second display
 5 positions  is associated with one of a plurality              of second
   display position groups, and each second group comprises
   two or more second display positions. In this example, the
   plurality of second display position groups          are
   represented by reels, and the game is played by spinning
10 reels containing the second symbols and stopping the reels
   so as to display at least  one second symbol on each reel.
   In this example, the selection carried out by the symbol
   selectors  20 and 22 is made using one or more random
15 number generators  21 and 23.
   In an example, the  first base game and the       second base
   game have the  same number of reels   and present the                same
   number of symbols when the    reels stop spinning.              The       first
20 base game may be displayed adjacent the second base                    game.
   In another example, the  first and second base games may
   have the same number of reels, but may have          a different
   number of associated display positions and therefore a
   different number of displayed symbols when the reels                      stop
25 spinning.
   The memory  42a is associated with the first         game and is
   arranged to store  first symbols data   14a indicative of a
   plurality of first game  symbols. The memory 42a also
30 includes first game  functions 16a and game instruction
   data 18a indicative of first game instructions usable by
   the gaming machine  10 to control operation of the first
   game, including win lines  data indicative of available win
                                               10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  11
   lines  for the  first game.
   The memory  42b is associated with the second game and is
   arranged similarly to the memory    42a of the first game,
 5 with like components including second game symbols                  data
   14b,  second game functions   16b and second game
   instructions 18b.
   It will be appreciated that    instead of having separate
10 memory and components   for implementing the      first game and
   the  second game, the first and second games may share
   components including the symbol    selector and memory.
   It will be appreciated that each of the random number
15 generators 21 and 23 may be of a type which is arranged to
   generate pseudo random numbers based on a       seed number, and
   that  in this  specification the term "random" will be
   understood accordingly to mean truly random or pseudo
   random.
20
   In this embodiment, the game controller 32 also comprises
   a trigger determiner 44 arranged to determine whether a
   trigger condition exists in the plurality of base games.
   If a trigger condition exists,    special game mode commences
25 that may involve implementation of one or more feature
   games or award of a prize. In this    example, if the trigger
   condition is satisfied, special game mode is implemented
   by a special game mode implementer 24.    Special game mode
   may involve implementation of one or more feature games
30 and/or may involve   implementation of a selection game
   usable to determine which of a plurality of feature games
   to implement.
                                               10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 12
   The trigger determiner is in communication with both
   symbol selectors 20 and 22 and, in this example, the
   trigger condition is defined to occur when a special
   combination of symbols occurs across the selected first
 5 and second game symbols.
   The trigger condition may be for example based on a
   special symbol combination whereby at least one special
   symbol from either the first game or the second game is
10 displayed in defined reels of the first and second base
   games.
   The game controller 32 also comprises an outcome evaluator
   26. The outcome evaluator 26 determines separate game
15 outcomes of the first and second base games, and game
   outcomes of the feature games. Accordingly, the first base
   game may result in a winning outcome independently of the
   outcome of second base game, and vice versa.
20 The game controller 32 also comprises a prize allocator 46
   arranged to allocate a prize to a player when a winning
   outcome exists.
   In this example, the gaming system is operable in normal
25 game mode and special game mode. During normal game mode,
   the outcome evaluator 26 determines whether a standard
   winning symbol combination of either the first base game
   or the base second game  (or both) exists, and a prize is
   awarded to a player for a standard winning symbol
30 combination. During special game mode, a feature game is
   implemented by a feature game implementer.
   Special game mode is triggered based on game outcomes of
                                             10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049.AU.1 17/05/18

                              - 13
   the first and second base games. Special game mode may
   involve implementation of a simple picks game, wherein a
   plurality of feature symbols are displayed to the player
   for the player to choose, and each feature symbol
 5 corresponds to a feature game or directly to a prize. It
   will be understood that a number of different feature
   games may be provided in the picks game.
   In the embodiment described below, the symbol selectors 20
10 and 22, the special game mode implementer 24, the trigger
   determiner 44, the outcome evaluator 26, and the prize
   allocator 46 are at least partly implemented using the
   processor 40 and associated software although it will be
   understood that other implementations are envisaged.
15
   The gaming system 10 can take a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a player operable gaming device in the
   form of a stand-alone gaming machine is provided wherein
20 all or most components required for implementing the game
   are present in the gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
25 the game are present in a player operable gaming device
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming device.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
30 gaming terminal and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
                                            10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049.AU.1 17/05/18

                              - 14
   operable gaming terminal is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
 5 However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.   For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming device is networked to a device server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.       For example,
10 the gaming system may operate in stand-alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
15
   A gaming system in the form of a stand-alone gaming
   machine 50 is illustrated in Figure 3. The gaming machine
   50 includes a console 52 having a display 54 on which is
   displayed representations of a game 56 that can be played
20 by a player.   A mid-trim 60 of the gaming machine 50
   houses a bank of buttons 72 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   gameplay.  The mid-trim 60 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 64 which in this example includes a coin input
25 chute 64A and a bill collector 64B. Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.
30 A top box 66 may carry artwork 68,  including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game. Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
                                             10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

   panel 69 of the console 52.   A coin tray 70 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 69 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 50.
 5 The display 54 is in the form of a video display unit,
   particularly a cathode ray tube screen device.
   Alternatively, the display 54 may be a liquid crystal
   display, plasma screen, or any other suitable video
   display unit.  The top box 66 may also include a display,
10 for example a video display unit, which may be of the same
   type as the display 54,  or of a different type.               The
   display 54 may comprise a touch screen usable by a player
   to interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.
15
   The display 54 in this example is arranged to display
   representations of several reels, each reel of which has
   several associated symbols.     Typically 3, 4 or 5 reels are
   provided.  During operation of the game, the reels                  first
20 appear to rotate then stop with typically three symbols
   visible on each reel.   Game outcomes are determined on the
   basis of the visible symbols together with any special
   functions associated with the symbols.     During normal game
   mode, several base games are implemented and as such
25 multiple sets of reels are displayed.
   A player marketing module   (PMM) 72 having a display 74 is
   connected to the gaming machine 50.     The main purpose of
   the PMM 72 is to allow the player to interact with a
30 player loyalty system.   The PMM has a magnetic card reader
   for the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.     However other
   reading devices may be employed and the player tracking
                                               10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                               -  16
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.   In this example, the PMM 62 is             a Sentinel
   III  device produced by Aristocrat Technologies Pty Ltd.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a gaming device 100  which may be the   same as or different
   to the gaming machine shown in Figure 3.
10 The gaming machine  100  includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.    Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102    in accordance with the
   present invention are   stored in a memory    103 which is in
   data communication with the processor 102.
15
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will    include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
20
   Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory  103.   The memory  103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass   storage device 103C.                The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
25 execution by the processor 102 and related data.                  The
   EPROM  103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some  system or game related code.    The mass storage device
   103C  is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
30 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104        for purposes
                                               10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output  (I/O) interface 105               for
   communicating with a player interface 120 of the gaming
   machine 100, the player interface 120 having several
 5 peripheral devices.  The input/output interface 105 and/or
   the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.  A random number generator module 113
10 generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.
   In the example shown in Figure 4, the peripheral devices
   that communicate with the game controller 101 comprise one
   or more displays 106, a touch screen and/or bank of
15 buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.   Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100,        or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
20 implementation.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
25 information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
30 It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 may be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
                                             10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

   Figure  6 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.    The gaming system 200            includes a
   network 201, which  for example may be an Ethernet network,
 5 a LAN or a WAN.   In this example, three banks 203 of two
   gaming machines 202  are connected to the network 201.                         The
   gaming machines 202  provide a player operable interface
   and may be the  same as the gaming machines 40,100                  shown in
   Figures  3 and 4, or may have simplified functionality
10 depending on the requirements for implementing game play.
   While banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in
   Figure  6, banks of one,  three or more gaming machines are
   also envisaged.
15 One  or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.   The displays    204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
20 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment,     a game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
25 202  and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game            server 205
   and the gaming machine   202   implement part of the game,
   they  collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management  server 206 may manage    storage of game programs
30 and associated data  for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202  in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in                a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server   207 will be provided to monitor and
                                                10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

   carry out the Jackpot game.
   In a variation of the above thick client embodiment, the
   gaming machine 202  may implement the game, with the                   game
 5 server 205  functioning merely to   serve data indicative of
   a game to the gaming machine 202    for implementation.
   With this  implementation, a data   signal containing a
   computer program usable by the client terminal to
10 implement the gaming system may be transferred from the
   game server to the  client terminal,   for example            in
   response to a request by the client terminal.
   In a thin client embodiment, the game server 205
15 implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine  202 and the gaming machine 202
   essentially provides only the player interface.                 With this
   embodiment, the game server    205 provides the game
   controller. The gaming machine will    receive player
20 instructions, and pass the    instructions to the game server
   which will process them and return game play outcomes to
   the gaming machine  for display.    In a thin client
   embodiment, the gaming machines could be computer
   terminals,  e.g. PCs running software that provides a
25 player interface operable using standard computer input
   and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming system 200, including                   for
30 example a gaming floor management server 208 and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.     An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to monitor the
                                               10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks such as a corporate network,
 5 and/or a wide area network such as the Internet, for
   example through a firewall 211.
   A loyalty program server 212 may also be provided.
10 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.  For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
15 separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random number generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.
20 Examples of specific implementations of the gaming system
   will now be described in relation to a stand-alone gaming
   machine 50 although it will be understood that
   implementation may also be carried out using other gaming
   system architectures such as a network architecture of the
25 type shown in Figure 6.
   In this example, the gaming system implements first and
   second base games which may be implemented concurrently.
   It will be understood however that more than two games may
30 be implemented.  In addition, instead of implementing the
   base games concurrently, the base games may be implemented
   consecutively with, for example, the outcomes of both base
   games displayed together.
                                            10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049.AU.1 17/05/18

                              - 21
   Each reel corresponds to a display position group having
   an associated set of display positions for displaying
   symbols. In this example, the reels of the first base game
 5 include symbols unique to the first base game. Likewise,
   in this example the reels of the second base game include
   symbols unique to the second base game. The number of
   symbols displayed in the reels of the first game may be
   different to those of the second game. For instance, the
10 first game may be a 3 by 5 reel game  (5 reels and 3
   symbols displayed in each reel), while the second game may
   be a 4 by 5 reel game.
   The reels are arranged to display standard symbols and one
15 or more function symbols. Win outcomes are determined on
   the basis of the symbols visible at the display positions
   when the reels stop rotating.
   Typically, a player will purchase or otherwise obtain win
20 entitlements such as several win lines which are used in
   each base game to determine win outcomes.      If the
   displayed symbols on the reels have symbols associated
   with a winning combination such as a winning combination
   disposed on a win line, the player wins a prize.
25
   The number of win lines of the first base game may be
   different to the number of win lines of the second base
   game. For example, the first base game may have 25 win
   lines while the second base game may have 40 win lines.
30
   The gaming system is operable in normal game mode and
   special game mode and may be arranged to commence special
   game mode when a predetermined game outcome occurs.
                                            10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049.AU.1 17/05/18

                                - 22
   Special game mode may comprise one or more feature games.
   Special game mode commences automatically on the basis of
   a combined outcome of the first game and the second game
 5 satisfying a trigger condition.
   The gaming system 10 may also be arranged so as to
   determine eligibility for special game mode, for example
   based on the amount or type of bet placed, based on
10 particular time periods and so on.
   A specific example will now be described with reference to
   Figures 7 to 11. Figure 7 shows a flow diagram 250, which
   illustrates steps 252 to 266 of a method of gaming
15 implemented by the gaming system according to the present
   embodiment.
   Multiple base games are implemented, in this example a
   first base game 300 and a second base game 400 using
20 virtual reels, as shown in Figures 8 to 10.
   In a specific example shown in Figures 8 to 10,              five
   virtual reels 304,   306, 308, 310 and 312 are provided and
   displayed for the first base game on a graphical display
25 device 54 in a display area 290. Each reel 304,              306, 308,
   310 and 312 corresponds to a display position group, and
   each reel comprises three display positions 314 for
   displaying symbols 316. It will be understood that any
   number of reels may be provided. Similarly, in this
30 example, the second base game 400 also has five virtual
   reels 404,  406, 408,  410 and 412 that are displayed on the
   graphical display device 54 in a display area 390 above
   the first base game 300.
                                              10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049.AU.1 17/05/18

                              - 23
   During implementation of the first and second base games
   in step 254, the reels are spun in step 256, and
   subsequently stopped to show a plurality of first symbols
 5 316 in the display area 290 of the first base game 300 and
   a plurality of second symbols 416 in the display area 390
   of the second base game 400.
   The two base games may be played concurrently, as shown in
10 Figures 8 to 10, although other implementations are
   envisaged.  For example, the first base game may be
   implemented before the second base game and game outcomes
   for both base games displayed together.
15 In this example, the reels are aligned, such that reel 304
   is aligned with reel 404, reel 306 is aligned with reel
   406, reel 308 is aligned with reel 408, and so forth. The
   aligned reels may also be functionally paired in that a
   trigger condition may depend on defined symbols being
20 displayed in at least one display position of one or more
   pairs of reels P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5.
   When the reels of both the first base game 300 and second
   base game 400 are spun 262 and stopped, the displayed
25 symbols in the two base games are separately evaluated for
   any standard winning combinations and if any winning
   combinations exist in the separate base games a prize is
   awarded.
30 Determinations of winning combinations can be made by
   comparing the symbols displayed at the display positions
   with a pay table or similar.
                                            10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049.AU.1 17/05/18

                                -  24
   Standard winning symbol combinations may include                  common
   poker game winning combinations such as three of a kind,
   four of a kind, straights,     flushes etc. A    standard symbol
   winning combination may be achieved if symbols              that form
 5 part of the standard winning combination are displayed at
   defined display positions   on the reels.
   In a further embodiment, if a special     first       game symbol
   320  and a special  second game symbol are displayed in the
10 same  reel pairing, as  shown in Figure 10,      those symbols
   may be replaced with WILD symbols.     This may occur
   regardless of whether a trigger condition 270             is
   satisfied.
15 In the above example, each display position group is
   associated with a reel. However, it will be appreciated
   that the display position groups may be arranged in any
   suitable way, and need not be on the     same reel          or grouped
   sequentially.
20
   The trigger determiner 44 determines whether a trigger
   condition is defined in the game outcomes of the first and
   second base games, and in this example a trigger condition
   occurs when special   symbols are displayed in defined reel
25 pairings.
   In a specific example with reference to Figures                8 and 9,
   the trigger condition is based on at least         one of a
   special  first game  symbol 320 and a special second game
30 symbol 420  being displayed in at least    one display
   position in predetermined reel pairings P1,          P3     and P5.
   Accordingly, in this example, for the purpose of defining
                                                10282366_1 (GHMatters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                               -   25
   a trigger condition, the reel pairs include a first reel
   304 of the first base game 300 paired with a first reel
   404 of the second base game 400, a third reel 308 of the
   first base game 300 paired with a third reel 408 of the
 5 second base game 400, and a fifth reel 312 of the first
   base game 300 paired with a fifth reel 412 of the second
   base game 400.  In order to indicate to a player which
   reel pairings will be used to determine a trigger
   condition, indicators "S" are displayed between the first
10 game 300 and the second game 400 adjacent the designated
   reel pairs.
   In the present example, in order to satisfy the trigger
   condition, at least one special symbol 320 or 420 must be
15 displayed in each of the designated reel pairings P1, P3
   and P5. As illustrated in Figures 8 and 9, the trigger
   condition may be satisfied by display of special symbols,
   whether the special  symbols 320,   420 are displayed in the
   designated reels in one base game or both base games.
20 It will be understood that any combination or number of
   reel pairings may be defined for the purposes of the
   trigger condition.
   If the trigger condition based on a special combination of
25 first game symbols and second game symbols exists 270,
   special game mode is triggered.
   During special game mode, a defined feature game may be
   implemented, or a selection game may be implemented that
30 facilitates selection by a player or the gaming system of
   the feature game that is implemented.     One or more feature
   games may be implemented.     The outcome of the feature
   game(s) is then evaluated 274 and one or more prizes are
                                               10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                              -  26
   allocated to the player if applicable.
   As previously mentioned, if the trigger condition 270 does
   not exist, the outcome of the first game 300 and second
 5 game 400 is still evaluated for any standard winning
   combinations and one or more prizes allocated if
   applicable.
   It will be understood that different types of feature
10 games may be implemented. The type of feature game
   triggered may depend on the trigger condition satisfied or
   on the progress status of the particular player through
   one or more game sessions.
15 In an example, a feature game 500 as illustrated in Figure
   11 is implemented. In this feature game, a 3 by 6 reel
   arrangement 508 is implemented. Three targets 502, 504 and
   506 are displayed above the reels 508 and each target
   shows a number of elements 505 to be "collected" by
20 spinning the reels. Each element 505 is considered to be
   collected when a defined win line including a defined
   number of the element 505 occurs.
   In this specific example, the targets are represented by
25 recipes 502, 504, 506, and the elements are ingredients
   505 associated with each recipe. When a particular number
   of ingredient symbols  (in this example lemon) is displayed
   on a defined win line 510, an animated representation of
   the ingredient moves across the display in an animated
30 manner from the reels 508 towards the ingredient in the
   recipe 506, as shown by movement lines 512. When the
   ingredient reaches the target the ingredient is indicated
   as collected 514 on the recipe.
                                            10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                               -   27
   When all elements  505 in a recipe 502,   504     or 506 have
   been collected, the recipe    is considered to be completed
   and an associated prize is awarded.

   It will be appreciated that different    types of targets,
   elements and/or animated movement may be employed.
   Other  feature games may include   simple picks games wherein
10 items are displayed  for the player to choose, the items
   being associated with a prize or correspond to a feature
   game.  In one example, a picks game may involve touring
   through a virtual house or other virtual surroundings to
   find and pick items.
15
   Another example of a feature game involves one or more
   wheels that spin and stop to determine a feature game
   outcome.   Each wheel has a plurality of segments with each
   segment  containing information indicative of a potential
20 game outcome, and an indicator is provided for each wheel
   to indicate a selected segment of the wheel when the wheel
   stops.  In the present example, a plurality of vertically
   aligned wheels are provided. Each wheel    is spun by the
   player and eventually stops with the respective indicator
25 indicating a particular segment of the wheel. In one
   example, initially, only the bottom wheel is activated.
   However, the segment of the bottom wheel indicated by the
   respective indicator may confer an award or unlock another
   wheel,  such as the wheel immediately above the bottom
30 wheel.  In one example, newly unlocked wheels may spin
   immediately after being unlocked. The top wheel may offer
   awards of higher value than the other wheels.
                                               10282366_1 (GHMaters) P101049 AU.1 17/05118

                              - 28
   In another example, the feature game is a progressive game
   wherein a player is provided with the opportunity to win a
   prize amount from a jackpot pool that may be common to a
   plurality of gaming machines.
 5
   Either or both of the first base game 300 and the second
   base game 400 may be equipped with other features in
   addition to standard winning combinations and feature game
   triggers. For example, the base game(s) may have a growing
10 feature to increase the number of winning lines. In a
   situation where both the first and second base games are
   implemented, the number of winning lines may increase
   together so that one will not overtake the other.
