                             ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
        Method and system for treating a patient using a compressible, pressure-attenuating
device. According to one embodiment, the system is used to treat urinary tract disorders and
can include one or more of an access device, a delivery device, a pressure-attenuating device,
and a removal device.       The access device may be used to create a passageway to an
anatomical structure, such as the patient's bladder. The delivery device may be inserted
through the passageway created by the access device and may be used to deliver the pressure
attenuating device to the anatomical structure. The removal device may be inserted through
the passageway created by the access device and may be used to view the bladder and/or to
capture, to deflate and to remove the pressure-attenuating device.

    METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR PERFORMING A MEDICAL PROCEDURE
The entire disclosure in the complete specification of our Australian patent application
number 2013299521 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present specification.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
         [0001]      The present invention relates to methods and systems for performing
medical procedures on anatomical structures of the body. Such medical procedures may
involve, for example, attenuating transient pressure waves in anatomical structures of the
body, for example, by implanting a compressible pressure-attenuating             device in an
anatomical structure of the body that is subjected to such pressure waves.
Description of the Related Art
         [0002]      Pressure waves are known to propagate through incompressible fluids in
various anatomical structures of the body. These pressure waves may be caused by normally
occurring events within the body, such as a beating heart, breathing in the lungs, peristalsis
actions in the GI tract, and movement of the muscles of the body.          Alternatively, these
pressure waves may be caused by sudden events, such as coughing, laughing, external trauma
to the body, and movement of the body relative to gravity.           As the elasticity of the
surrounding tissues and organs, sometimes referred to as compliance, decreases, the
propagation of these pressure waves increases. These pressure waves have many undesirable
effects ranging from discomfort to stress on the organs and tissue to fluid leakage to renal
failure to stroke to heart attack to blindness.
         [0003]      Urinary tract disorders, such as frequency, urgency, incontinence, and
cystitis, are a widespread problem in the United States and throughout the world, affecting
people of all ages, both physiologically and psychologically. Urine is primarily composed of
water and is a virtually incompressible fluid in the typical pressure ranges that are present
within the human bladder. The relationship between the maximum urethral pressure and the
intravesical pressure for normal voiding of the bladder is well-defined.        During normal
voiding, relaxation of the urethra occurs before the detrusor muscle contracts to cause the
intravesical pressure to exceed the urethral pressure.
                                                -1-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
        [0004]      Intravesical  pressure   spikes   often   result from   volumetric   tissue
displacement in response to gravity, muscular activity or rapid acceleration.      The lack of
compliance of the bladder and the urine contained in the bladder with respect to events of high
frequency, high intensity and short wavelength results in minimal fluidic pressure attenuation
of the higher frequency pressure wave(s) and results in high intravesical pressures that are
directly transmitted to the bladder neck and urethra, which may or may not cause detrusor
contractions.   Under these conditions, the urethra may act as a volumetric pressure relief
mechanism, allowing a proportional volume of fluid to escape the bladder, thereby lowering
the intravesical pressure to a tolerable level. The urethra has a maximum urethral pressure
value, and when the intravesical pressure exceeds the maximum urethral pressure, fluid will
escape the bladder. Under these conditions, nerve receptors in the bladder and/or bladder
neck and/or trigone trigger a detrusor contraction that may lead to matriculation (frequency)
or may subside without matriculation (urgency) or may lead to the intravesical pressure
exceeding the maximum urethral pressure resulting in fluid escaping the bladder (stress
incontinence).
        [0005]      For the vast majority of patients suffering from problems of urinary tract
disorders, such as frequency, urgency, stress and urge incontinence and cystitis, the cause
and/or contributor to bladder dysfunction is a reduction of overall dynamic bladder
compliance, as opposed to a reduction of steady-state bladder compliance. These patients may
often have bladders that are compliant in steady-state conditions but that become non
dynamically compliant when subjected to external pressure events having a short duration of,
for example, less than 5 seconds or, in some cases, less than 0.5 seconds.        Reduction in
dynamic compliance of the bladder is often caused by aging, use, distention, childbirth and
trauma.    In addition, the anatomical structure of the bladder in relation to the diaphragm,
stomach, and uterus (for women) causes external pressure to be exerted on the bladder during
physical activities, such as talking, walking, laughing, sitting, moving, turning, and rolling
over. For a patient suffering from stress incontinence due to lack of dynamic compliance in
the bladder, when the intravesical pressure exceeds the maximum urethral pressure, leakage
occurs.

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
         [0006]     In light of the foregoing, a number of attempts have been made to combat
urinary tract disorders. One such attempt involves the use of an indwelling catheter connected
to a collection bag with a clamping device on the catheter.      Indwelling catheters, however,
have a number of drawbacks. For instance, there is an infection risk associated with indwelling
catheters, which provide a direct passage for bacteria or other microorganisms into the
bladder. Thus, indwelling catheters can only be used for relatively short-term situations. In
addition, indwelling catheters and associated collection bags are not cosmetically appealing to
most patients.
         [0007]     An approach that has been taken to address urinary incontinence involves
the use of prosthetic urethral valves. One known prosthetic urethral valve utilizes an inflatable
cuff that is inserted around the outside of the urethra. Prosthetic urethral valves also have
numerous disadvantages.       One disadvantage of these valves is that they typically require
surgery for installation, and some of these valves must be operated externally and, therefore,
are dependent on manual intervention.
         [0008]     The use of intra-urethral valves to address urinary tract disorders is also
known.     Typical intra-urethral valves also generally require manual intervention.     Another
problem associated with typical intra-urethral valves is that the valves may be displaced into
the bladder or expelled from the urethra. There is also an infection risk associated with many
such valves since they often extend into the meatus and/or have portions of the device external
to the urethra providing a passage for microorganisms into the bladder.
         [0009]     Electrical stimulation therapy, including rectal, intra-vaginal, and external
varieties, has been used to tone the muscles and to stimulate nerves supporting the bladder
and urethra. However, this type of therapy requires lengthy and numerous treatments, and
any benefits derived from the therapy typically diminish when the treatments are stopped.
         [0010]     Current    surgical  incontinence   procedures    typically  focus   on   the
augmentation of urethral flow resistance. Such surgical interventions typically include bladder
neck suspensions and bulk (collagen) injections. Although these procedures can be clinically
effective with certain patients, problems include widely variable clinical outcomes, relatively
high costs to perform, and potential complications related to surgery. Moreover, the effects
of such surgical procedures may be short-lived.
                                                -3-

 WO 2014/026028                                                            PCT/US2013/054185
         [0011]      Drug therapy also exists for a number of urinary tract conditions, including
overactive bladder.     These drugs include oral medications (systemic) and drugs delivered
directly into the bladder. Unfortunately, these drugs typically suffer from side effects, lack of
efficacy and high morbidity. In particular, oral medications typically do not provide immediate
relief of symptoms and include side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation.             Drugs
delivered directly into the bladder often require continuous or intermittent catheterization for
introduction of the therapeutic agents at the clinically appropriate time.
         [0012]      As can be appreciated, the treatment methods described above either focus
on the augmentation of urethral flow resistance, the temporary stoppage or absorption of all
urethral flow, or the relaxing of the detrusor muscles to minimize unwanted contractions. The
disadvantages and limitations of these treatment methods are numerous and include: an
excessively high level of patient interaction required to operate and/or to maintain the devices,
especially for elderly patients and for physically or mentally challenged patients; limited clinical
efficacy; restricted urine outflow; patient discomfort and side effects; urethral and bladder
infections related to the devices used; and relatively great expense as compared to non-clinical
solutions (diapers, pads, etc.).
         [0013]      Accordingly, an alternative approach to those described above has been to
implant a compressible, pressure-attenuating device in the bladder in order to lower the
intravesical pressure. This approach is disclosed, for example, in the following documents, all
of which are incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Patent No. 6,682,473, Matsuura et al.,
issued January 27, 2004; U.S. Patent No. 7,074,178, Connors et al., issued July 11, 2006; and
U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0222802, Gillespie, Jr. et al., published
September 2, 2010.       According to one aspect of the foregoing approach, a compressible
device is inserted, in a compacted state, into the bladder of a patient through the patient's
urethra, and, then, once in the bladder, the compressible device is expanded, for example, by
inflation with atmospheric air. A delivery system may be used to deliver the compressible
device through the urethra and into the bladder and also may be used to expand the
compressible device from its compacted state to its expanded state and to deploy the
compressible device, once expanded, from the delivery system. If removal or replacement of
                                                 -4-

the compressible device is desired, a removal system may be used to remove the
compressible device from the bladder through the urethra.
         [0014]      Although the above-described           implantable, compressible, pressure
attenuating device has had some success in treating urinary tract disorders, the present
inventors have identified certain areas of improvement relating to the device, its introduction
into a patient, its expansion and deployment within a patient, and its removal from a patient.
         [0014a]      The discussion of the background to the invention included herein
including reference to documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included to
explain the context of the present invention. This is not to be taken as an admission or a
suggestion that any of the material referred to was published, known or part of the common
general knowledge in Australia or in any other country as at the priority date of any of the
claims.
         [0014b]     Where the tens "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising"
are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the
presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence
of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereto.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         [0015]      It would be desirable to provide a method and system for performing a
medical procedure on an anatomical structure of a body. The medical procedure may be
performed, for example, to attenuate transient pressure waves in the anatomical structure and
may involve, for example, implanting a compressible pressure-attenuating device in the
anatomical structure subject to such pressure waves. Such a method and system may be used
in, but is not limited to use in, treating urinary tract disorders.
         [0016]      A system may comprise one or more of the following: an access device, a
therapeutic or diagnostic object, a delivery device, and a removal device. The access device
may be used to create a passageway to the anatomical structure, such as, for example, a trans
urethral passageway to a patient's bladder. The therapeutic or diagnostic object may be an
inflatable device and may be, for example, a pressure-attenuating device. The delivery device
may be used to deliver a therapeutic or diagnostic object to the anatomical structure. Such an
                                                  -5-

object may be, for example, a pressure-attenuating device, which may be delivered to the
anatomical structure in a compacted or deflated state and then inflated and released from the
delivery device.   The removal device may be used to view the anatomical structure.        In
addition, where an object delivered to the anatomical structure is an inflatable pressure
attenuating device, the removal device may also be used to capture, to deflate, and to remove
the pressure-attenuating device from the anatomical structure.
        [0017]     According to some embodiments, an access device can comprise a handle
comprising a fluid control system, an elongate, tubular body, a first tube and a second tube.
The elongate, tubular body can extend distally from the handle and have a proximal end, a
distal end, and a central lumen extending from a proximal opening at the proximal end to a
distal opening at the distal end, the central lumen configured to provide access to an
                                             -5a-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
anatomical structure.   The first and second tubes can be in communication with the lumen
without obstruction of the proximal or distal openings.      The fluid control system can be
operable to manually control fluid flow through the first and second tubes, the fluid control
system moveable between at least three positions to-1) simultaneously close the first and
second tubes, 2) close only the first tube, and 3) close only the second tube-without
obstruction of the central lumen.

management configured for single handed operation. The fluid control system can include a
lever on the handle configured for angular rotation with respect to the longitudinal axis
through an angular range sufficient to reach each of the three positions by a digit on the same
hand that is holding the handle.
         [0019]     According to some embodiments, an access device can have a locking

respect to the tubular body, the slide ring comprising at least one inwardly and distally
extending protrusion engaged with the tubular body and configured to restrain distal
movement of the slide ring relative to the tubular body while allowing proximal movement.
The everting sleeve can initially extend from the cannulation on the obturator around a distal
end of the tubular body and to the slide ring carried by the tubular body, wherein proximal
movement of the slide ring advances the everting sleeve out of the obturator and over the
outside of the tubular body.
         [0020]     In some embodiments, an access device can provide access to an
anatomical structure within a patient. The access device can comprise an elongated sheath or
cannula, the elongated sheath comprising a proximal end, a distal end, and a longitudinal

the access channel and/or body tissue in the patient. For example, in some embodiments, the
obturator can include a cavity, and the sleeve can be positionable in the cavity in a first
position and positionable outside of the cavity in a second position. The distal end of the
obturator may also be positionable distally beyond the distal end of an elongated sheath. In
some embodiments, a slide ring can be connected to the sleeve to move the sleeve between the
first and second positions.

elongated sheath, a first fluid conduit, a second fluid conduit, and a valve mechanism for
controlling fluid communication between the first fluid conduit and the elongated sheath and
between the second fluid conduit and the elongated sheath. The first fluid conduit may be
used to deliver fluid to the elongated sheath for delivery to the patient, and the second fluid
conduit may be used to drain fluid from the patient through the elongated sheath. The valve
mechanism may comprise a cam which may be positioned in a first position in which the first
fluid conduit is pinched shut by the cam and the second fluid conduit is kept open, a second
position in which the second fluid conduit is pinched shut by the cam and the first fluid

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
         [0197]      Medical devices, methods, and systems related thereto for use within the
body are disclosed.       The medical devices and medical systems can include pressurized
therapeutic devices, implants, implant delivery devices, implant retrieval devices, expandable
or compressible membrane enclosures or balloons, sponges, foams, attenuators, space
occupying members, and space creating devices, and therapeutic devices. Though urology and
use in the bladder will be primarily discussed, it will be understood that the systems and
methods can be used elsewhere. The medical devices and medical systems can be used for
many purposes and in many places within the body including, but not limited to, the following
systems of the human body: cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal/urological, gastrointestinal,
hepatic/biliary,   gynecological,       neurological,   musculoskeletal,  otorhinolaryngical and
ophthalmic, as well as in and around organs of the body, and in intra- and inter-organ spaces.
         [0198]      In one particular aspect, the disclosure relates generally to the field of
urology, and in particular to the treatment of disorders of the urinary tract caused by sudden
fluctuations of intravesical pressure. More specifically, in this aspect, methods, systems, and
devices are provided for the treatment of urinary disorders, such as incontinence, urgency,
frequency, interstitial cystitis, irritable bladder syndrome, and neurogenic bladders.
         [0199]      Some embodiments provide methods, systems, and devices for treating
and/or compensating for reduced dynamic compliance of the bladder. In one embodiment, a
device having a compressible element is placed within the human urinary bladder in a manner
that allows the compressible element to act as a pressure attenuator to attenuate transient
pressure events.    The term "attenuator" refers generally to devices that attenuate pressure,
force, or energy by dissipating or dampening the pressure, force, or energy. Gases, such as
atmospheric air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and certain perfluorocarbons (PFC), are very
compressible in the pressure ranges typically encountered in the human bladder and may be
used in attenuation devices inserted in the bladder.         Furthermore, when compared to the
                                                   -25-

  WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
tissues encompassing liquid, gases are significantly more compliant than the immediate
environment. The addition of a volume of gas can act as a low or variable rate spring in series
with the native fluidic circuit of the urinary tract.
        [0200]       In accordance with one embodiment, an attenuation device is placed within
the human urinary bladder.       The attenuation device can be a pressurized container with a
positive or negative pressure. The container can take many forms including a sphere. The
attenuation device may be untethered in the bladder and may remain in the bladder for
between several hours and one year. The attenuation device can be a small elastomeric gas
cell with a relaxed (unstretched) volume of between about 0.1 and 500 cc, more preferably
between about 1 and 180 cc, and more preferably still, between about 10 and 60 cc. The
attenuation device can be a unitary component or can comprise two or more subcomponents.
The attenuation device can be made with a seam or without a seam but preferably is made
without a seam. The attenuation device can have a substantially uniform wall thickness of
between about 0.25 inch to 0.0001 inch, more preferably between 0.0001 inch and 0.005 inch,
but could vary greatly in wall thickness and still perform the intended function.
        [0201]       In the embodiment described above, attenuation devices having gas cells
that are free-floating in the bladder have been described. In other embodiments, gas cells or
similar attenuation devices could be surgically affixed to the bladder wall through the use of
suture, staples or other accepted methods or could be placed submucosally or intramuscularly
within the bladder wall. Some embodiments could induce endothelial encapsulation.         Other
embodiments could also include attenuation devices with programmable, variable and
adjustable buoyancy by using ballasting, specific inflation/deflation solutions, alternative
materials of construction or by other means.
        [0202]       Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown a side view of components of a first
embodiment of a system for treating a patient, the treatment system being represented
generally by reference numeral 11. (For ease of illustration and understanding, certain aspects
of system 11 may not be shown in Fig. 1.)
        [0203]       System 11 may comprise an access device 13, a delivery device 15, a
pressure-attenuating device 17, and a removal device 19. The access device may be used to
create a trans-urethral passageway to a patient's bladder. The delivery device may be inserted
                                                 -26-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
through the passageway created by the access device and may be used to deliver the pressure
attenuating device to the bladder in a compacted state, then may be used to inflate the
pressure-attenuating device, and then may be used to release the inflated, pressure-attenuating
device.   The removal device may be inserted through the passageway created by the access
device and may be used to view the bladder and/or to capture, to deflate and to remove the
pressure-attenuating device.
        [0204]      Each of access device 13, delivery device 15, and pressure-attenuating
device 17 may be a single-use (i.e., disposable) device or a multiple-use (i.e., reusable) device,
but each is preferably a single-use device. Removal device 19 may be a single-use device or a
multiple-use device, but preferably is a multiple-use device.
Access Device
        [0205]      As has been mentioned, an access device may be used to create a
passageway into the body. For example, the passageway can be a trans-urethral passageway
to a patient's bladder. The access device may be used to drain fluid from the body, such as
from the bladder. The access device can be used to protect tissue between the access entry
location and the exit location within the body. The access device may further be used as a
positioning device to properly position other tools, such as the delivery device within the
body. For example, the access device can include a meatal stop, to properly position portions
of the delivery device within the bladder.
        [0206]      An access device may include one or more of a housing assembly, a sheath
assembly, and a fluid control system. A housing assembly can comprise one or more housing
structures that define a body of the access device.
        [0207]      A sheath assembly can comprise an elongated sheath or cannula, and a
longitudinal channel extending therethrough. In some embodiments, as will be discussed more
fully below, the sheath assembly may include a slide ring assembly that is slidably mounted
around the sheath, and it may include a protective sleeve. The slide ring assembly can be
moved between a distal position and a proximal position. In some embodiments the slide ring
assembly can have one or more mechanisms to secure the slide ring assembly in the distal

be coupled to the slide ring assembly. In some embodiments the access device can include an
obturator that can be removably mounted within the longitudinal channel of the sheath.
        [0208]       A fluid control system can control fluid communication between the
anatomical structure within the patient and the access device. For example, the fluid control
system can be used to drain the bladder of a patient. The fluid control system can have one or
more fluid conduits in fluid communication with the sheath. The fluid conduits can be used to
remove and/or deliver fluid to/from the patient. The fluid control system can have one or
more mechanisms to control the rate of fluid transfer through the access device. In some
embodiments the fluid control system can provide a fully open fluid conduit or a fully closed
fluid conduit.   In some embodiments, the fluid control system can have a mechanism to
provide a variable flow rate for each fluid conduit. In some embodiments the flow rate of
each fluid conduit can be controlled individually.

extension line 281.    In some embodiments, the access device 13 may simply comprise a
cannula, but may also include a valve assembly and an obturator. It will be understood that
other combinations of components could also be used. Each of the components will now be
discussed in detail.

         [0211]     Referring now to Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the hub 21 may comprise a unitary
structure, preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material.
Hub 21 may be shaped to include a first tubular member 23 and a second tubular member 25.
         [0212]     First tubular member 23 may comprise an open proximal end 27, an open
distal end 29, and a longitudinal channel 31 extending from proximal end 27 to distal end 29.
Member 23 may include a generally frusto-conical proximal portion 32-1 of comparatively
greater inside diameter, a generally cylindrical distal portion 32-2 of comparatively lesser
inside diameter, and a generally cylindrical intermediate portion 32-3 of intermediate inside
diameter.    Proximal portion 32-1 may be shaped to include an internal helical thread 33
extending distally a short distance from proximal end 27. Distal portion 32-2 and intermediate
portion 32-3 may be interconnected by a frusto-conical wall 35. The exterior of distal portion
32-2 may be shaped to include first and second circumferential ribs 37 and 39, respectively,
and first and second axial ribs 41 and 43, respectively.
         [0213]     Second    tubular   member      25,  which  may   be   oriented   generally
perpendicularly to first tubular member 23, may comprise an open proximal end 45, an open
distal end 47, and a longitudinal channel 49 that extends from proximal end 45 to distal end 47
and that tapers gradually in diameter from proximal end 45 to distal end 47. Proximal end 45
may be in the shape of a female luer lock connector. Distal end 47 may be positioned relative
to first tubular member 23 so that the distal end of channel 49 opens into channel 31 at a
location within intermediate portion 32-3.      A barb 51 may be formed on the exterior of
member 25 proximate to distal end 47 in such a way that barb 51 and distal end 47 jointly
define a waist 53 therebetween.
         [0214]     Hub 21 may further comprise a tab 55 disposed on the exterior of member
23.   Tab 55 may be positioned on the circumference of member 23 at a position generally
opposite to member 25 and may be oriented on member 23 to extend generally axially. Tab
55 may be shaped to include a transverse opening 57.
         [0215]     Access device 13 may also comprise a cannula or sheath 61 (see Figs. 2(a)
2(c)). Sheath 61, shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), may comprise a unitary structure, preferably
made of a medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material having columnar strength as
well as angular flexibility. Sheath 61, which may be a tubular member having a longitudinal

channel 62, may be shaped to include a proximal portion 61-1, a distal portion 61-2, and an
intermediate portion 61-3.    Proximal portion 61-1, which may have a frusto-conical shape
tapering inwardly from an open proximal end 63, may be fixedly secured by adhesive or other
suitable means to the hub 21.    This can be at the interior of member 23 along wall 35 of the
hub 21, with the remainder of sheath 61 extending distally therefrom. Distal portion 61-2 may
have a wall thickness that tapers distally to a distal end 64. Sheath 61 may be appropriately
dimensioned so that the exposed portion of sheath 61, i.e., the portion of sheath 61 that
extends distally from hub 21, has a length that is slightly greater than the length of a typical
female human urethra and additionally has an external diameter that permits the exposed
portion of sheath 61 to easily traverse a typical female human urethra.          For illustrative
purposes, sheath 61 may have a length of approximately 4.1 in and an external diameter of
about 24 Fr.
        [0216]      Access device 13 may further comprise a handle 71 (see Figs. 2(a)-2(c)).
Handle 71, shown in Figs. 5(a) through 5(c), may comprise a pair of identical, nearly identical,
or simply corresponding handle halves 73-1 and 73-2, each of which may be a unitary
structure preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material.
Half 73-1 (which is also shown separately in Fig. 6) and half 73-2 may be secured to one
another by suitable means (e.g., adhesive, welding, etc.) to form a tubular structure having a
longitudinal channel 75 and comprising a proximal portion 77-1 of comparatively greater
diameter, a distal portion 77-2 of comparatively lesser diameter, and an intermediate portion
77-3 of intermediate diameter. Proximal portion 77-1, which may be generally cylindrical in
shape, may include a proximal end 79 having an opening 81 and an internal circumferential
ridge 83 (seen best in Fig. 6) spaced distally a short distance from proximal end 79. Distal
portion 77-2, which may be generally cylindrical in shape, may be appropriately dimensioned
for insertion into proximal portion 32-1 of hub 21 and may include external helical threads 85
adapted to engage thread 33. In this manner, distal portion 77-2 of handle 71 may be screwed
into proximal portion 32-1 of hub 21.     (A sealing ring 86, shown in Fig. 2(b), which may be
made of silicone or a similarly suitable material, may be inserted around distal portion 77-2 of
handle 71 for providing a seal between hub 21 and handle 71.)         Intermediate portion 77-3
may have an exterior surface 87 that is appropriately contoured to permit being held by a

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
person, for example, using two fingers of one hand.           Intermediate portion 77-3 may
additionally include a pair of axial ribs 89-1 and 89-2, which may be used to receive
therebetween a proximal end 55-1 of tab 55 and, thereby, limit rotation of handle 71 relative
to hub 21.
         [0217]     Access device 13 may further comprise a valve assembly 91 (see Figs. 2(b)
2(c)), which may be disposed within handle 71. Any of a number of different valve assemblies
can be used.    Valve assembly 91, shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), may comprise a unitary
structure, preferably made of a medical-grade silicone or a similarly suitable material. Valve
assembly 91 may be shaped to include a proximal portion 92-1, a distal portion 92-2, and an
intermediate portion 92-3. Proximal portion 92-1 may be a generally tubular structure shaped
to include a proximal end 93, a distal end 95, and a circular side wall 97. Proximal end 93
may be shaped to include a central opening 93-1 leading to a longitudinal channel 94
extending from proximal end 93 to distal end 95. Channel 94 may include a proximal section
94-1, an intermediate section 94-2, and a distal section 94-3, with intermediate section 94-2
having a comparatively greater diameter, with distal section 94-3 having a comparatively
lesser diameter, and with proximal section 94-1 having an intermediate diameter.          Distal
portion 92-2 of valve assembly 91 may be a generally tubular structure shaped to include a
proximal end 101, a distal end 103, and a circular side wall 105. Distal end 103 may have a
central opening 103-1 leading to a longitudinal channel 107 extending from proximal end 101
to distal end 103. Intermediate portion 92-3 of valve assembly 91 may be a generally tubular
structure shaped to include a proximal end 111, a distal end 113, and a side wall 115.      Side
wall 115 may be appropriately shaped to define a proximal valve 117 and a distal valve 119.
Valves 117 and 119 may divide the interior of intermediate portion 92-3 into a proximal
channel 118 that is in fluid communication with distal section 94-3 of proximal portion 92-1
and a distal channel 120 that is in fluid communication with channel 107 of distal portion 92-2.
Valves 117 and 119, each of which may be a four-sided duckbill valve, may be oriented in
opposite directions relative to one another, with valve 117 tapering in a distal direction and
with valve 119 tapering in a proximal direction. Moreover, the distal end of valve 117 and the
proximal end of valve 119 may be conjoined so that valves 117 and 119 open and close in
unison. As will be discussed further below, valves 117 and 119 may be constructed so as to
                                              -31-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
be biased towards a closed state. While in such a closed state, valves 117 and 119 may serve
to prevent fluids or other matter from passing through valve assembly 91.         In particular,
because of its distally-tapered orientation, valve 117 may serve to prevent fluid from flowing
proximally through valve assembly 91. In addition, as will also be discussed further below,
valves 117 and 119 may be opened, when desired, by inserting an appropriate medical device
through valve assembly 91. A benefit of the opposed orientation of valve 119 relative to valve
117 is that valve 119 may reduce the likelihood that, as a medical device that has previously
been inserted through valve assembly 91 is thereafter withdrawn from valve assembly 91,
valve 117 will scrape against the exterior of the medical device being withdrawn.          Such
scraping may be undesirable, for example, where the medical device is a removal device used
to remove a pressure-attenuating device from a patient and the scraping causes the pressure
attenuating device to become detached from the removal device.
        [0218]      Referring now to Fig. 8(a), there is shown a side view, partly in cross
section, of the combined handle 71 and valve assembly 91. As can be seen, distal portion 92-2
of valve assembly 91 may be dimensioned relative to the interior surface of intermediate
portion 77-3 of handle 71 such that a gap 121 may be provided therebetween.            Without
wishing to be limited to any particular theory of operation, the present inventors believe that
gap 121 may be advantageous in permitting a portion of the fluid entering handle 71 through
distal portion 77-2 to flow proximally around distal portion 92-2 and to accumulate around
the exterior of intermediate portion 92-3 of valve 91. Such accumulated fluid may serve to
equalize the fluid pressures within intermediate portion 92-3 of valve assembly 91 and around
the exterior of intermediate portion 92-3 of valve assembly 91, thereby promoting the biasing
of valves 117 and 119 to a normally closed state. According to one embodiment, gap 121
may be sized to be approximately 0.0001-2 inches, preferably about 0.001-0.500 inch, more
preferably about 0.010-0.050 inch.
        [0219]      As can also be seen in Fig. 8(a), proximal portion 92-1 of valve assembly
91 may be dimensioned relative to proximal portion 77-1 of handle 71 such that proximal
portion 92-1 may form a fluid-tight seal with ridge 83.         In this manner, fluid flowing
proximally through gap 121 may be kept from flowing proximally past ridge 83. As can be
seen in Fig. 8(b), a structure, such as an O-ring 122 may be added around valve assembly 91
                                               -32-

  WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
to help valves 117 and 119 coapt without relying on cavity pressure. In some embodiments,
the valve assembly 91 can be made together with or as part of the handle 71.
         [0220]     Referring now to Figs. 2(b)-2(c) and 9(a)-9(b), access device 13 may
further comprise a seal 125. Seal 125 may comprise a unitary structure, which may be made of
a medical-grade silicone or a similarly suitable material.    Seal 125 may be of annular shape
having a central opening 126.     Seal 125 may be appropriately dimensioned to be mounted
within valve assembly 91 as shown in Fig. 2(c). Seal 125 may be positioned in valve assembly
91 in intermediate section 94-2 of channel 94, with a rear surface 125-1 of seal 125 fixed by
suitable means (e.g., ultrasonic welding, adhesive, etc.) to a shelf 126 (see Fig. 7(b)) within
valve assembly 91.    Central opening 126 may be appropriately dimensioned to form a fluid
tight seal coaxially around a medical device (e.g., delivery device 15, removal device 19, etc.)
that has been inserted through valve assembly 91. In this manner, if valves 117 and 119 are
opened by such a medical device inserted through valve assembly 91, seal 125 may serve to
minimize the proximal leakage of fluid around said medical device.
         [0221]     Access device 13 may further comprise a dilator or obturator 131 (see
Figs. 2(b)-2(c)).   Obturator 131, shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), may comprise a unitary
structure, preferably made of a medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material having
columnar strength as well as angular flexibility.      Obturator 131, which may be a tubular
member having a cavity or channel 132, may be shaped to include a proximal portion 133-1, a
distal portion 133-2, and an intermediate portion 133-3.          It should be understood that,
although obturator 131 is shown in the present embodiment as having a longitudinal channel,
such a channel need not be a longitudinal channel and, alternatively, could be a channel, at
least portion of which does not extend along the longitudinal axis of obturator 131.        For
example, channel 132 could have a proximal opening and/or a distal opening that is positioned
on the side of obturator 131, or obturator 131 could simply have one opening, such as in the
case of a pocket or cavity located at or near the distal end of the obturator.
         [0222]     Referring to Fig. 10(a)-10(b), each of proximal portion 133-1, distal
portion 133-2, and intermediate portion 133-3 may be generally cylindrical in shape, with
proximal portion 133-1 and distal portion 133-2 having similar outer diameters over much of
their respective lengths and with intermediate portion 133-3 having a narrowed outer diameter
                                               -33-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
as compared to that of proximal portion 133-1 and distal portion 133-2. Distal portion 133-2
may include a frusto-conical distal end 135 that may be formed, in part, by a wall thickness
that tapers distally. Channel 132, which may extend from a proximal end 137 of obturator
131 to distal end 135, may be narrowed within intermediate portion 133-3, as well as in the
adjacent portions of proximal portion 133-1 and distal portion 133-2, and also may be
narrowed as it approaches distal end 135.
        [0223]      Obturator 131 may be appropriately dimensioned so as to permit its distal
end 135 to be inserted coaxially through the combination of seal 125, valve assembly 91,
tubular member 23, and sheath 61, with distal end 135 of obturator 131 extending a short
distance distally beyond distal end 64 of sheath 61, with proximal end 137 of obturator 131
extending a short distance proximally of proximal end 63 of sheath 61, with proximal portion
133-1 possibly but not necessarily forming a fluid-tight seal with seal 125, and with
intermediate portion 133-3 residing within valves 117 and 119 of valve assembly 91 (Fig.
2(c)).  Intermediate portion 133-3 preferably has a narrowed diameter so as not to open
valves 117 and 119 any more than is minimally needed. Intermediate portion 133-3 may have
a length 11 of approximately 0.001-3 inches, preferably approximately 0.050-2 inches, and
even more preferably about 0.050-1 inch.       For example, the intermediate portion can be
greater in length than one or more of the valves 117, 119, the seal 125, and the valve assembly
91.
        [0224]      Access device 13 may further comprise an obturator handle 151 (see Figs.
2(a)-2(c)). Handle 151, shown in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b), may comprise a unitary structure,
preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Handle 151
may be a tubular member shaped to include a side wall 153, a proximal end 155, and a distal
end 157. A longitudinal channel 159 may extend from proximal end 155 to distal end 157.
Channel 159 may include a proximal portion 159-1, a distal portion 159-2, and an
intermediate portion 159-3.     Proximal portion 159-1 and distal portion 159-2 may have
generally similar diameters to one another whereas intermediate portion 159-3 may have a
reduced diameter relative to proximal portion 159-1 and distal portion 159-2. Distal portion
159-2 may be appropriately dimensioned to receive proximal portion 133-1 of obturator 131,
with proximal end 137 of obturator 131 being positioned flush against a proximal end 160 of
                                              -34-

 WO 2014/026028                                                            PCT/US2013/054185
distal portion 159-2. Obturator 131 may be secured to handle 151 by suitable means, such as
ultrasonic welding.   To facilitate digital manipulation of handle 151 by a user, the exterior
surface of handle 151 may be appropriately shaped with a pair of opposing contoured faces
163 (of which only one is shown) and with a pair of opposing ribbed faces 165-1 and 165-2.
         [0225]     Access device 13 may further comprise a handle plug 171 (see Figs. 2(a)
2(c)). Plug 171, shown in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b), may comprise a unitary structure, preferably
made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material.         Plug 171 may be
shaped to include a base portion 173 and a barbed stem portion 175. Base portion 173 may
be appropriately dimensioned to matingly fit within proximal portion 159-1 of handle 151.
Barbed stem portion 175 may be appropriately dimensioned to frictionally fit within proximal
portion 133-1 of obturator 131 and to form a fluid-tight seal therewith to prevent fluid flow
proximally through proximal end 137 of obturator 131.          (Alternatively, plug 171 could be
provided with a narrow longitudinal bore to allow some fluid to flow proximally through
proximal end 137 of obturator 131, for example, in order to alert a user that obturator 131 has
been inserted to a particular location or depth.) In addition to preventing such proximal fluid
flow through obturator 131, plug 171 may also serve to provide some mechanical strength to
the joint between handle 151 and obturator 131.
         [0226]     Access device 13 may further comprise a protective sleeve 181 (see Figs.
2(a)-2(c)).   Sleeve 181, shown in Figs. 13(a) and 13(b), may comprise a tubular structure
preferably comprising a flexible material, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or a similarly
suitable material. As will be discussed further below, at least a portion of sleeve 181 may be
positioned within channel 132 of obturator 131, and the material used to make sleeve 181 may
additionally be lubricious (and/or channel 132 may have a lubricious surface in contact with
the sleeve 181) in order to assist in the deployment of sleeve 181 from channel 132 in the
manner to be described further below. Sleeve 181 may comprise a first end 183, a second end
185, and a longitudinal channel 187 extending from first end 183 to second end 185. Sleeve
181 may be shaped to include a first portion 182-1 of comparatively greater diameter and a
second portion 182-2 of comparatively lesser diameter. As will be described further below,
sleeve 181 may be used to coaxially cover what would otherwise be the exposed lengths of
obturator 131 and sheath 61 passing through an anatomical structure, such as the urethra of a
                                              -35-

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
patient, with sleeve 181 lining the inside walls of the anatomical structure, such as the urethra.
In so doing, sleeve 181 may facilitate the insertion of obturator 131 and sheath 61 through the
anatomical structure by reducing the shear force with the walls of the anatomical structure.
Moreover, where access device 13 is used, for example, to provide access to the bladder
through the urethra, sleeve 181 additionally may serve to minimize the transport of
microorganisms into the urethra or bladder of the patient.

         [0228]      It is to be understood that although sleeve 181 has been described herein as
being a tubular structure, sleeve 181 could alternatively be provided in the form of one or
more flat sheets.
         [0229]      Referring back to Figs. 2(a) and 2(c), access device 13 may further
comprise a slide ring assembly 191 coaxially mounted around sheath 61. Slide ring assembly
191 may comprise an inner member 193, an outer member 195, and an O-ring 197 illustrated
in Fig. 2(b).   Inner member 193, shown in detail in Figs. 14(a) and 14(b), may comprise a
unitary structure, preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable
material. Inner member 193 may be a tubular structure shaped to include a proximal portion
199 and a distal portion 201. Proximal portion 199 may include a continuous side wall 203
defining a proximal end 205 and a longitudinal channel 207. One or more transverse slots 204
may be provided in side wall 203, and one or more ribs 206 may be arranged along an exterior
circumference of side wall 203. Distal portion 201 may include a generally circular side wall
                                                -36-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
209 defining a distal end 211 and a longitudinal channel 213. A generally circular groove 212
may be formed on the exterior surface of side wall 209 at its proximal end, and one or more
ribs 214 may be arranged along an exterior circumference of side wall 209 at a location
intermediate to groove 212 and distal end 211.        Channels 207 and 213 may be collinearly
aligned with one another, with channel 213 having a comparatively lesser diameter and with
channel 207 having a comparatively greater diameter.         Channel 213 may be appropriately
dimensioned to permit member 193 to be freely slid over sheath 61 in the manner to be
discussed further below. Channel 207 may be appropriately dimensioned to permit proximal
portion 199 to reversibly snap-lock onto the exterior of distal portion 32-2 of hub 21 by
engaging circumferential rib 37. One or more internal axial ribs 215 may be provided on the
interior surface of wall 203 to delimit rotation of proximal portion 199 on distal portion 32-2
of hub 21 by abutting one or more of ribs 41 and 43 on distal portion 32-2.
         [0230]      Outer member 195, shown in Figs. 15(a) and 15(b), may comprise a unitary
structure, preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material.
Outer member 195 may be a tubular structure shaped to include a continuous side wall 221
defining a proximal end 223, a distal end 225 and a longitudinal channel 227 extending from
proximal end 223 to distal end 225. Proximal end 223 and longitudinal channel 227 may be
appropriately dimensioned to receive inner member 193, which may be fixedly secured to
outer member 195 by suitable means. O-ring 197 (Fig. 16) may be appropriately constructed
to mate tightly with groove 212 of inner member 193.
         [0231]      Side wall 221 of the outer member 195 may have a generally tapered shape
to facilitate digital manipulation by a user, with proximal end 223 having a comparatively
greater diameter than distal end 225.           (Alternatively, distal end 225 could have a
comparatively greater diameter than proximal end 223.)         One or more circumferential ribs
229, which may facilitate gripping, may be provided on the exterior of side wall 221.
         [0232]      Moving now to Figs. 17(a)-17(b), the assembled slide ring assembly 191
can be seen together with other components of the system. The slide ring assembly 191 can
engage and secure one end of the sleeve. As can be seen best in Figs. 17(a) and 17(b), first
portion 182-1 of sleeve 181 may be tightly secured between O-ring 197 and inner member
193, with second portion 182-2 of sleeve 181 extending distally through distal end 225 of
                                               -37-

 WO 2014/026028                                                            PCT/US2013/054185
outer member 195. By securing sleeve 181 to inner member 193 in this manner, sleeve 181
may be mechanically coupled to sliding ring assembly 191 for sliding movement therewith
relative to sheath 61.     Consequently, as seen in Fig. 17(a), when ring assembly 191 is in its
initial distal position, a length of second portion 182-2 of sleeve 181 may serve to cover the
portion of obturator 131 that is located distal to ring assembly 191, with the remainder of
second portion 182-2 of sleeve 181 wrapping around distal end 135 of obturator 131 and
being tucked into channel 132 of obturator 131.
         [0233]       Thereafter, as ring assembly 191 may be slid proximally relative to sheath
61, the length of second portion 182-2 of sleeve 181 residing within channel 132 of obturator
131 may be withdrawn from within obturator 131 through distal end 135 and may be everted,
or pulled outward and inside out, over obturator 131 and sheath 61 until the entirety of sleeve
181 has been withdrawn from channel 132. As can be seen in Fig. 17(b), when ring assembly
191 is in its most proximal position, distal end 185 of sleeve 181 may be positioned proximal
to distal end 65 of sheath 61, thereby exposing the distal ends of sheath 61 and obturator 131.
Nonetheless, sleeve 181 preferably has an appropriate length so that, for example, where
access device 13 is used to provide access to the bladder through the urethra, the distal ends
of sheath 61 and obturator 131 may be covered by sleeve 181 as the distal ends of sheath 61
and obturator 131 pass through the urethra of a patient.          In some embodiments, the ring
assembly 191 is maintained in position, while the rest of the access device is advanced distally.
         [0234]       To position distal end 185 of sleeve 181 within channel 132 of obturator
131, one may, prior to the insertion of plug 171 into obturator handle 151, insert a device
having a distal loop (not shown) distally through obturator handle 151, through obturator 131,
and through distal end 185 of sleeve 181, then thread distal end 185 of sleeve 181 through the
distal loop of the inserted device, and then retract the inserted device, with sleeve 181
attached thereto, until distal end 185 of sleeve 181 is located within channel 132, the device
thereafter detaching from sleeve 181 after its continued withdrawal. In positioning distal end
185 of sleeve 181 within obturator 131 in the aforementioned manner, the length of second
portion 182-2 of sleeve 181 positioned within channel 132 of obturator 131 may not
necessarily lie flat against the interior surface of obturator 131, but such an occurrence should
be of no consequence.

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
         [0235]     Referring back now to Figs. 2(a) through 2(c), access device 13 may
further comprise one or more restraining mechanisms for limiting distal and/or proximal
sliding movement of slide ring assembly 191 relative to sheath 61.      As can be appreciated,
absent such a restraint, slide ring assembly 191 may be free to slide relative to sheath 61.
Consequently, if access device 13 is held in such a way that sheath 61 is pointed downwardly,
assembly 191 may slide distally relative to sheath 61, even possibly sliding entirely off of
sheath 61.   Such a decoupling of assembly 191 from sheath 61 would be highly undesirable
since, amongst other things, it may preclude keeping the distal ends of sheath 61 and
obturator 131 covered by sleeve 181 until after the distal ends of sheath 61 and obturator 131
have passed through the urethra or other desired anatomical structure of a patient. Further,
the slide ring assembly 191 may be inadvertently slid proximally on sheath 61, either all the
way to hub 21 or substantially all the way to hub 21. Such proximal movement of assembly
191 would be highly undesirable since, amongst other things, it could cause end 185 of sleeve
181 to be prematurely withdrawn from obturator 131, which, in turn, may preclude keeping
the distal ends of sheath 61 and obturator 131 covered by sleeve 181 until after the distal ends
of sheath 61 and obturator 131 have passed through the urethra or other desired anatomical
structure of a patient. Though two separate restraining mechanisms are disclosed herein, it
will be understood that a single restraining mechanism could also perform the functions of
both.
         [0236]     One of the two restraining mechanisms may comprise a tether 241. Tether
241 may be a string, suture, band, or a similarly suitable structure.     The tether 241 may
comprise an elongated member having a proximal end 243 and a distal end 245 (Fig. 18).
Proximal end 243 may be secured to hub 21, for example, by being looped through opening
57 and tied to tab 55. Distal end 245 may be secured to slide ring assembly 191, for example,
through an interference-fit by being inserted between inner member 193 and outer member
195. Therefore, because tether 241 is secured at one end to hub 21 and at the opposite end to
ring assembly 191 and because tether 241 is sized appropriately in length, distal movement of
assembly 191 relative to sheath 61 may be restricted and, in particular, assembly 191 may be
restrained from moving beyond a desired axial position on sheath 61.
                                              -39-

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
          [0237]    The other of the two restraining mechanisms may comprise a retaining card
261.     Card 261, shown in Figs. 19(a) through 19(c), may comprise a unitary structure,
preferably made of a rigid cardstock, polymer, or a similarly suitable material. Card 261 may
be cut and scored from a sheet of suitable material to define a top portion 263, a left flap 265
extending downwardly a short distance from a left side of top portion 263, and a right flap
267 extending downwardly a short distance from a right side of top portion 263. Top portion
263 may have a width that may exceed the diameter of sheath 61. In this manner, with top
portion 263 positioned over sheath 61, left flap 265 may be positioned on one side of sheath
61 and right flap 267 may be positioned on the opposite side of sheath 261. A proximal end
263-1 of top portion 263 may be shaped to include a recess 269 that may be appropriately
dimensioned to matingly engage waist 53 of tubular member 25. A distal end 263-2 of top
portion 263 may be appropriately dimensioned to engage slide ring assembly 191 and may be
shaped to include a tab 271 that may be inserted into inner member 193 of assembly 191. In
this manner, with recess 269 engaging waist 53 and with tab 271 inserted into inner member
193 of assembly 191, retaining card 261 may be used to prevent proximal movement of
assembly 191 relative to sheath 61. Card 261 may also serve to prevent rotation of slide ring
assembly 191 relative to sheath 61 and, in so doing, may limit the extent to which sleeve 181
may become twisted within obturator 131. Such a twisting of sleeve 181 within obturator 131
may be undesirable as it may increase the resistance of sleeve 181 to evert properly when such
eversion is eventually desired. Card 261 is preferably removed from device 13 when proximal
movement of assembly 191 relative to sheath 61 is desired. Preferably, card 261 is removed
immediately before insertion of the distal end of device 13 into a patient (although card 261
could alternatively be removed after insertion of the distal end of device 13 into a patient). To
facilitate the removal of card 261, top portion 263 may be shaped to include a tab 275
connected via a living hinge 277 at a proximal end of tab 275. Tab 275 may be marked, either
through direct printing or via an adhesive label, with an arrow 278 or similar indicia to
indicate that tab 275 may be pulled distally to disengage waist 53 from recess 269.
Thereafter, tab 271 may be removed from inner member 193.
          [0238]    Access device 13 may further comprise a fluid extension line 281 (see Figs.
2(a)-2(c)).    Line 281, which may be a unitary tubular structure preferably made from a
                                              -40-

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material, may comprise a proximal end 283 and
a distal end 285. A stopcock valve 287, which may be a three-way stopcock valve, may be
coupled to proximal end 283 of line 281 and may also be coupled to a fluid source (not
shown) and to a drain (not shown). A male luer connector 289, which may be connectable to
second tubular member 25 of hub 21, may be coupled to distal end 285 of line 281. Where
access device 13 is used to provide access to a urinary bladder, the combination of line 281,
stopcock valve 287, and connector 289 may be used, after obturator 131 has been removed,
to deliver fluids to the patient's bladder or to drain fluids from the patient's bladder. As can
be appreciated, one advantage to the aforementioned combination of line 281, stopcock valve
287, and connector 289 is that, where stopcock valve 287 is being operated to drain fluid
from the patient's bladder, such urine may be collected from a patient at a location remote
from the patient's meatus.
         [0239]     Prior to use, access device 13 may be sterilized by a suitable sterilization
technique, for example, ethylene oxide treatment.
         [0240]     Referring now to Figs. 20A-B,           there are shown two flowcharts,
schematically depicting possible methods 290A and 290, respectively, of using access device
13 to provide access to a desired anatomical structure.        Such access can be, for example,
trans-urethral access to a female human urinary bladder. Method 290A may begin with a step
290-1A of unlocking a restraining mechanism.        This can be done, for example, by removing
card 261 from device 13, preferably by pulling tab 275 distally until waist 53 of hub 21
disengages from recess 269 of tab 275 and then by removing tab 271 from inner member 193
of slide ring assembly 191 (see Fig. 21(a)). Method 290A may then continue with a step 290
2A of aligning and inserting the distal end of the access device into a body. This can include
positioning a meatal stop next to the meatus. This may also include aligning and inserting
distal end 135 of obturator 131 into the outer opening of the urethra, with the distal end of
slide ring assembly 191 contacting the meatus of the patient and with distal end 135 of
obturator 131 being covered by sleeve 181 (see Fig. 21(b) with the urethra being represented
by the reference letter U, the meatus being represented by the reference letter M, and the
bladder being represented by the reference letter B).        Though illustrated schematically, in
some embodiments, the slide ring assembly 191 can engage the body tissue at the meatus.
                                               -41-

  WO 2014/026028                                                        PCT/US2013/054185
Method 290 may then continue with a step 290-3 of advancing obturator 131 and sheath 61
distally through the urethra U in a straight and steady motion until sleeve 181 everts
completely (is pulled outward and turned inside out) and slide ring assembly 191 snaps onto
the distal end of hub 21 (see Fig. 21(c)). (With obturator 131 and sheath 61 advanced in the
manner discussed above, distal end 135 of obturator 131 and distal end 64 of sheath 61 may
be positioned within the bladder B of a patient.) Preferably, as obturator 131 and sheath 61
are advanced distally in the manner discussed above, rotation of obturator 131 and sheath 61
relative to slide ring assembly 191 is avoided so as to minimize twisting of sleeve 181, which
twisting may impede eversion of sleeve 181.
         [0241]      Method 290 may then proceed to step 290-4 of withdrawing obturator 131
proximally from sheath 61, hub 21, and handle 71 by holding hub 21 stationary with one hand
while grasping and pulling on obturator handle 151 with the other hand (see Fig. 21(d)).
With obturator 131 thus removed, the remaining implanted portion of access device 13 may
provide a conduit through which medical devices, such as delivery device 15, pressure
attenuating device 17, and removal device 19, may be delivered to a desired anatomical
structure.   During the above-recited steps, stopcock valve 287 may be either opened or
closed, depending upon the design of the access device and whether or not one wishes to
allow fluid from the patient's bladder to empty. In some embodiments, the obturator 131 can
block access to the fluid extension line 281 and the stopcock valve 287. Thus, fluid may be
drained after the access device is positioned and the obturator 131 removed.
         [0242]      As has been mentioned, other access devices or systems can be used. The
access device can vary from a basic cannula to any number of different combinations involving
at least some of the access device components described herein.
         [0243]      As noted above, it may be desirable to minimize the rotation of slide ring
assembly 191 relative to obturator 131 and sheath 61 so as to minimize the twisting of sleeve
181 within obturator 131. Although card 261 may satisfactorily prevent such rotation prior to
its removal from access device 13, once card 261 has been removed from access device 13,
there may be no remaining mechanism in access device 13 for restraining such rotation.
Therefore, according to one aspect, certain alternate embodiments are disclosed below that
may include a rotation-restraining mechanism.

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
         [0244]      Referring now to Figs. 22(a) through 22(c), there are shown various views
of a first alternate embodiment of an access device 301. Access device 301 may be similar in
most respects to access device 13, the principal difference between the two devices being that
access device 301 may further include a mechanism for restraining rotational movement of the
slide ring assembly relative to the sheath and the obturator in the absence of a retaining card.
In the present embodiment, said mechanism may include a sheath 303 and an inner ring
member 305.       Sheath 303 and inner ring member 305 may be similar in most respects to
sheath 61 and inner ring member 193, respectively, of device 13.         A principal difference
between sheath 61 and sheath 303 may be that sheath 303 may additionally include a pair of
axially-extending grooves 306-1 and 306-2 provided in a side wall 307 at approximately
opposing points along the circumference of side wall 307. A principal difference between
inner ring member 193 and inner ring member 305 may be that inner ring member 305 may
additionally include a pair of tongues 309-1 and 309-2 extending radially inwardly from a side
wall 311, tongues 309-1 and 309-2 being appropriately positioned and appropriately
dimensioned to mate with and to travel within grooves 306-1 and 306-2, respectively, in such
a way as to restrain rotational movement of inner ring member 305 relative to sheath 61. It
will be understood that the tongue and groove can be switched to be on opposite components
from that described above. In addition, there may be one or more tongues and grooves.
         [0245]      Referring now to Fig. 23, there is shown an enlarged fragmentary
longitudinal section view of a second alternate embodiment of an access device 321. Access
device 321 may be similar in most respects to access device 301.          A principal difference
between the two devices may be that access device 321 may comprise barbs 325-1 and 325-2,
instead of tongues 309-1 and 309-2 that mate with and are angled distally within grooves 306
1 and 306-2, respectively.     The aforementioned arrangement of barbs 325-1 and 325-2 and
grooves 306-1 and 306-2, respectively, can restrain facile distal movement of inner ring
member 323 relative to sheath 303 and can restrain rotational movement of inner ring member
323 relative to sheath 303 but permits facile proximal movement of inner ring member 323
relative to sheath 303.      It may be noted that, because the aforementioned arrangement
restrains facile distal movement of inner ring member 323 relative to sheath 303, access device
                                               -43-

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
321 need not additionally include tether 241.       Thus, the slide ring assembly can be moved
distally while preventing or reducing the ability to move proximally.
         [0246]     Referring now to Fig. 24, there is shown an enlarged fragmentary
longitudinal section view of a third alternate embodiment of an access device 341.       Access
device 341 may be similar in most respects to access device 321, but may be devoid of
grooves. As can be appreciated, although the aforementioned arrangement of access device
341 may restrain facile distal movement of inner ring member 323 relative to sheath 343 while
permitting facile proximal movement of inner ring member 323 relative to sheath 343, this
arrangement does not provide any restraint of rotational movement of inner ring member 323
relative to sheath 343.
         [0247]     Referring now to Fig. 25, there is shown an enlarged fragmentary
longitudinal section view of a fourth alternate embodiment of an access device 361. Access
device 361 may be similar in most respects to access device 301, but, instead of having a pair
of tongues 309-1 and 309-2, access device 361 may comprise one or more one-way rollers.
Two one-way rollers 365-1 and 365-2 can be coupled to inner ring member 363 and disposed
within grooves 306-1 and 306-2, respectively, in such a manner as to permit facile proximal
movement of inner ring member 363 relative to sheath 303 while restraining facile distal
movement and facile rotational movement of inner ring member 363 relative to sheath 303.
         [0248]     Referring now to Figs. 26 and 27, there are shown top and enlarged
fragmentary perspective views, respectively, of a fifth alternate embodiment of an access
device 371.    Access device 371 can comprise a housing assembly, a sheath assembly, and a
fluid control system. Access device 371 may be similar in certain respects to access device 13.
One difference between the two access devices may be that, whereas access device 13 may
include hub 21 and handle 71, access device 371 may instead include a housing 373. Housing
373 may be a generally wing-shaped structure including a proximal end 374-1, which may be
comparatively wider, and a distal end 374-2, which may be comparatively narrower. Housing
373 may comprise a first housing portion 375 and a second housing portion 377. Each of first
housing portion 375 and second housing portion 377 may be made of a hard, medical-grade
polymer or a similarly suitable material. First housing portion 375 and second housing portion
377 may be joined together by screws (not shown) or other suitable means.
                                                -44-

 WO 2014/026028                                                            PCT/US2013/054185
         [0249]      Preferably, housing 373 of access device 371 is dimensioned to have a
greater length, as measured from proximal end 374-1 to distal end 374-2, than the
corresponding length of the combination of hub 21 and handle 71 of access device 13. Due in
part to such an increased length, access device 371 may enable an operator to keep his hands
farther away from a patient than may be the case with access device 13. This may be desirable
insofar as it may improve patient comfort and may reduce the likelihood of urinary tract
infections resulting from the operator contacting the patient's anatomy and then cross
contaminating access device 371 and/or tools inserted through access device 371.
         [0250]      Another difference between access device 371 and access device 13 may be
that, whereas access device 13 may comprise a single stopcock valve 287, which may be a
three-way stopcock valve, access device 371 may instead comprise a pair of stopcock valves
381 and 383, each of which may be a two-way stopcock valve. Valve 381, which may be
mounted in first housing portion 375, may be used to control the flow of fluid through a first
port 385 disposed on one side of proximal end 374-1 of housing 373. Valve 383, which may
be mounted in first housing portion 375, may be used to control the flow of fluid through a
second port 387 disposed on another side of proximal end 374-1 of housing 373.            One of
ports 385 and 387 may be connected, for example, to a fluid source so that fluid may be
delivered to the patient, and the other of ports 385 and 387 may be connected, for example, to
a drain or similar fluid collection device so that fluid may be drained from the patient.
         [0251]      Due in part to the design of housing 373 and the placement of stopcock
valves 381 and 383 relative to housing 373, an operator may hold access device 371 and may
operate stopcocks 381 and 383 using only one hand. This is in contrast with access device
13, where for most operators at least one hand may be needed to hold handle 71 and another
hand may be needed to operate stopcock 287. The fact that access device 371 may be held
and operated with a single hand may be desirable as it may reduce the likelihood of cross
contamination, as well as simplifying fluid control.
         [0252]      Still another difference between access device 371 and access device 13
may be that, whereas device 13 may comprise a slide ring assembly 191 and one or more
restraining mechanisms 241 and 261, device 371 may instead comprise a slide assembly 391
and a ratchet track 393. Slide assembly 391 may comprise a slide 395, which may be a tubular
                                                -45-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
member made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or similarly suitable material. Slide 395,
which may be coaxially mounted over sheath 61, may be shaped to include a proximal end 397
and a distal end 399. Proximal end 397 may be shaped to include a pair of spring clips 401
substantially evenly spaced on the outer circumference of slide 395. Distal end 399 may be in
the shape of an outwardly-extending circumferential flange. Distal end 399 may be used to
engage slide 395 so that slide 395 may be slid relative to sheath 61.     (Such sliding may be
effected either by gripping distal end 399 in one hand and manually sliding slide 395
proximally over sheath 61 or, more preferably, by pressing distal end 399 against the patient
and using the patient's body, such as the patient's meatus, to cause slide 395 to slide
proximally over sheath 61.)       Slide assembly 391 may further comprise a mechanism (not
shown) disposed within slide 395 proximate to distal end 399 for retaining the proximal end of
protective sleeve 181.
         [0253]     Ratchet track 393 may comprise a pair of rails 394-1 and 394-2. Rails
394-1 and 394-2, which may be integrally formed with second housing portion 377 and
disposed within the interior of housing 373, may be arranged parallel to one another and may
be positioned so as to be on opposite sides of sheath 61 and slide 395. Rails 394-1 and 394-2
may be dimensioned and positioned so that spring clips 401 may slide thereover as slide 395 is
moved proximally.      A plurality of detents 405 may be formed on rails 394-1 and 394-2.
Detents 405 may be shaped to permit facile proximal movement of clips 401 over detents 405
but to prevent facile distal movement of clips 401 over detents 405. In this manner, slide
assembly 391 may be effectively permitted to move only proximally, with distal and rotational
movement being constrained by ratchet track 393.      As can be appreciated, the number and
spacing of detents 405 on rails 394-1 and 394-2 may be modified as desired. For example,
detents 405 may be positioned at regular or irregular intervals along the entire length of travel
of slide assembly 391 or may be positioned at regular or irregular intervals only at a latter part
of the length of travel of slide assembly 391.
         [0254]     As can be appreciated, access device 371 may be shaped so that those
portions thereof that may come into contact with the patient, such portions including, for
example, distal end 399 of slide 395 and/or distal end 374-2 of housing 373, may be relatively
                                               -46-

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
smooth, with a minimal number of sharp edges. In this manner, irritation of the patient caused
by contact with access device 371 may be minimized.
        [0255]      Although access device 371 is shown without an obturator, access device
371 may include an obturator, such as an obturator similar to obturator 131.
        [0256]      Referring now to Fig. 28, there is shown a top view of a sixth alternate
embodiment of an access device 431. Access device 431 can comprise a housing assembly, a
sheath assembly, and a fluid control system.      Access device 431 may be similar in certain
respects to access device 371. One difference between the two access devices may be that,
whereas access device 371 may comprise stopcock valve 381 for controlling the flow of fluid
through first port 385 and stopcock valve 383 for controlling the flow of fluid through second
port 387, device 431 may instead comprise a single stopcock valve 433. Stopcock valve 433
may be a three-way stopcock valve that may be used to control the flow of fluid both through
port 385 and through port 387, for example, by having a first position in which port 385 is
open and port 387 is closed, a second position in which port 387 is open and port 385 is
closed, and a third position in which both ports 385 and 387 are closed.
        [0257]      Although access device 431 is shown without an obturator, access device
431 may include an obturator, such as an obturator similar to obturator 131.
        [0258]      Referring now to Figs. 29(a) through 29(c), there are shown top, side, and
perspective views, respectively, of a seventh alternate embodiment of an access device 461.
Access device 461 can comprise a housing assembly, a sheath assembly, and a fluid control
system.   Access device 461 may be similar in certain respects to access device 431.        One
difference between the two access devices may be that, whereas access device 431 may
comprise stopcock 433 for controlling the flow of fluid through ports 385 and 387, access
device 461 may instead comprise a cam-actuated valve mechanism 463, extending through a
slot 465 in a housing 467, for controlling the flow of fluid through ports 385 and 387.
        [0259]      Referring also now to Fig. 30, there is shown a simplified schematic
representation of a fluid control system 463 such as a cam-actuated valve mechanism 463.
The cam-actuated valve mechanism 463 may comprise a first compliant tube 469, a second
compliant tube 471, and a cam 473. First compliant tube 469 may be connected at one end to
port 385 and at an opposite end to sheath 61, and second compliant tube 471 may be
                                               -47-

 WO 2014/026028                                                            PCT/US2013/054185
connected at one end to port 387 and at an opposite end to sheath 61. Cam 473, which may
be accessible to an operator through a slot 465 provided in a housing 467 of access device
461, may be used selectively to pinch shut or to keep open first compliant tube 469 and
second compliant tube 471. Tubes 469 and 471 and cam 473 may be arranged relative to one
another so that cam 473 may axially compress tubes 469 and 471 positioned on the same side
of cam 473. Tubes 469 and 471 may be compressed distally (away from a proximal end 467-1
of housing 467).      Cam 473 may be mounted coaxial to sheath 61 (see Figs. 29(a) through
29(c) for sheath 61). Cam 473 may be designed to dependently control each valve, providing
3 functions: fill, drain, and closed (i.e., no flow). A fourth "flush" position may be included
where both the inlet and the outlet are open at the same time.
        [0260]       Another difference between access device 461 and access device 431 may
be that access device 461 may further comprise an obturator 481 and an obturator handle 483.
Obturator 481 may be similar to obturator 131.            Obturator handle 483 may differ from
obturator handle 151 in that obturator handle 483 may comprise a D-ring. The non-circular
shape of a D-ring may enable a user alternately to rest his thumb inside the D-ring during
insertion of access device 461 into a patient and to accommodate his forefinger being inserted
through the D-ring to facilitate removal of obturator 481 from the patient.
        [0261]       It should be understood that access device 461 could include, instead of
obturator handle 483, an obturator handle like obturator handle 151.          Alternatively, access
device 461 could simply not include an obturator or obturator handle.
        [0262]       Referring now to Fig. 31,         there is shown a simplified schematic
representation of a fluid control system 501 such as a first alternate embodiment of a cam
actuated valve mechanism 501. Cam-actuated valve mechanism 501, which may be a
dependent-control,     double-sided, axially-compressing     mechanism, may comprise a first
compliant tube 503, a second compliant tube 505, and a cam 507.              As can be seen, first
compliant tube 503 and second compliant tube 505 may be positioned on opposite sides of
cam 507 in cam-actuated valve mechanism 501.
        [0263]       Referring now to Figs. 32(a) through 32(d), there are shown simplified
schematic representations of a fluid control system 531 such as a second alternate embodiment
of a cam-actuated valve mechanism 531. Cam-actuated valve mechanism 531 may include a
                                                  -48-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
first compliant tube 533, a second compliant tube 535, a first cam 537, and a second cam 539.
First cam 537 may be used to pinch shut first compliant tube 533, and second cam 539 may be
used to pinch shut second compliant tube 535. First cam 537 and second cam 539 may be
independently operable. In this manner, cam-actuated valve mechanism 531 may be operated
to assume any one of a "closed" position, where the first tube 533 and the second tube 535
are closed, as shown in Fig. 32(a), a "fill" position, where the first tube 533 is open and the
second tube 533 is closed, as shown in Fig. 32(b), a "drain" position, where the second tube
535 is open and the first tube 533 is closed, as shown in Fig. 32(c), and a "flush" position,
where the first tube 533 and the second tube 535 are open, as shown in Fig. 32(d).
         [0264]     Referring now to Figs. 33(a) through 33(c), there are shown simplified
schematic representations of a fluid control system 571 such as a third alternate embodiment
of a cam-actuated valve mechanism 571. Cam-actuated valve mechanism 571 may include a
first compliant tube 573, a second compliant tube 575, and a linear cam 577. Linear cam 577
may be used to pinch shut one or both of first compliant tube 573 and second compliant tube
575. In this manner, cam-actuated valve mechanism 571 may be operated to assume any one
of a "closed" position, where the first tube 573 and the second tube 575 are closed, as shown
in Fig. 33(a), a "fill" position, where the second tube 575 is open and the first tube 573 is
closed, as shown in Fig. 33(b), and a "drain" position, where the first tube 573 is open and
the second tube 573 is closed, as shown in Fig. 33(c).
         [0265]     It should be appreciated that fluid control systems with a cam-actuated
valve mechanism may operate in a radial direction, instead of in an axial direction as disclosed
above. Such a cam may be used to pinch shut the compliant tubes towards the central axis or
away from such an axis. An example of a fluid control system with a radially-compressing,
cam-actuated valve mechanism is shown in Fig. 34 and is represented generally by reference
numeral 591.     Cam-actuated valve mechanism 591, which may be designed to be inwardly
compressing, may include a first compliant tube 593, a second compliant tube 595, and a cam
597.    Another example of a fluid control system with a radially-compressing, cam-actuated
valve mechanism is shown in Fig. 35 and is represented generally by reference numeral 611.
Cam-actuated valve mechanism 611, which may be designed to be outwardly-compressing,
may include a first compliant tube 613, a second compliant tube 615, and a cam 617.

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
         [0266]     In any cam configuration, including the various cam configurations
described above, the cam may be detented at a flow position to provide tactile feedback that
the cam is in a desired position. In some configurations, the housing of the access device can
be configured to have one or more detents to provide tactile feedback for positions of the
cam. For example, the detents can be configured to help position the selector switch of the
cam in "flow" positions for each tube and a "no-flow" position for both tubes.         In some
embodiments the cam configuration can include separate cams to control flow in each of the
tubes, as illustrated in Figs. 32(a) through 32(d).   Also, instead of positioning the selector
switch of the cam at the top of the housing, the switch may be located on the bottom of the
housing or at any point along the travel of the cam. In addition, in any cam configuration
disclosed herein, the cam may be constructed to provide more than merely a "flow" position
and a "no-flow" position, but rather, to additionally include one or more "intermediate-flow"
positions having flow rates intermediate to that of the "no-flow" and "flow" positions. For
example, the positioning of the cam can be used to increase or decrease the flow rate of fluid
within the tubes.
         [0267]     Moreover, in the embodiments described herein, the cam face may slide
directly across the compliant tubes. Such sliding may create an undesirable amount of friction,
thereby requiring too much force to move the cam selector switch. To reduce the friction at
this interface, pushrods may be used to follow the cam face and to translate its displacement
into pure linear motion.      Such pushrods would then pinch the compliant tubes without
shearing across them, thereby reducing the amount of friction generated.
         [0268]     Referring now to Figs. 36(a) through 36(c), there are shown various views
of an eighth alternate embodiment of an access device 721.         The access device 721 can
comprise a housing assembly, a sheath assembly, and a fluid control system. Access device
721 may be similar in certain respects to access device 431. One difference between the two
access devices may be that, whereas access device 431 may include slide assembly 391 and
ratchet track 393, access device 721 may include a slide assembly 723 and a pair of bosses
725. Slide assembly 723 may comprise a slide 727, which may be a tubular member made of a
hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Slide 727 may be provided with
a plurality of notches 729, which may be positioned at regular intervals along substantially the
                                              -50-

 WO 2014/026028                                                              PCT/US2013/054185
entire length of travel of slide 727. Bosses 725, which may be integrally formed on a housing
portion 731 of access device 721, may be oriented to engage notches 729 in such a way as to
permit facile proximal movement of slide 727 while preventing facile distal movement of slide
727. Rotational movement of slide 727 relative to the housing of access device 721 may be
constrained by an axially-extending rib 733 provided on the interior surface of housing portion
731 that may travel within a corresponding axially-extending notch 735 on slide 727. (An
additional rib may be provided on the housing portion that is not shown, and a corresponding
notch may be provided in the portion of slide 727 that is not shown.) Slide assembly 723 may
further comprise a mechanism (not shown) disposed within slide 727 for retaining the
proximal end of the protective sleeve (not shown).
         [0269]      It is to be understood that, although notches 729 are disclosed above as
being positioned at regular intervals along substantially the entire length of slide 727, notches
729 may be positioned at irregular intervals and/or may be positioned only along a portion of
the length of travel of slide 727.
         [0270]      For example, referring now to Figs. 37(a) and 37(b), there are shown
various views of a ninth alternate embodiment of an access device 751. Access device 751
can comprise a housing assembly, a sheath assembly, and a fluid control system.               Access
device 751 may differ from access device 721 in that, whereas access device 721 may include
slide 727 having notches 729 positioned at regular intervals substantially along its entire
length, access device 751 may instead include a slide 753 (shown separately in Fig. 38)
including only a proximal notch 755 and a distal notch 757. As seen best in Fig. 37(a), with
slide 753 in its distal position (i.e., before insertion of access device 751 into a patient), bosses
725 may engage proximal notch 755 of slide 753.             Proximal notch 755 may be shaped to
provide only slight resistance to movement of slide 753 in either axial direction. A purpose of
the proximal notch 755 is to position slide 753 during assembly and to keep slide 753 in its
distal position before deployment of access device 751. During insertion of access device 751
into a patient, the slide 753 can be moved past proximal notch 755 with only slight resistance
from bosses 725.       There may be clearance between bosses 725 and notch 755 to prevent
bosses 725 and slide 753 from permanently deforming at elevated temperatures or after
extended periods of time. As slide 753 moves between proximal notch 755 and distal notch
                                                  -51-

 WO 2014/026028                                                             PCT/US2013/054185
757, bosses 725 may deflect and may apply light pressure to the outer diameter of slide 753
due to an interference fit. When slide 753 is in its proximal position (i.e., upon full insertion
of access device 751 into a patient), bosses 725 may snap into distal notch 757, which may be
beveled or otherwise positioned to lock bosses 725 in place.
         [0271]      Referring now to Figs. 39(a) and 39(b), there are shown various views of a
tenth alternate embodiment of an access device 801.            Access device 801 can comprise a
housing assembly, a sheath assembly, and a fluid control system.           Access device 801 may
differ from access device 751 in that, whereas access device 721 may include slide 753, access
device 801 may instead include a slide 803 (also shown separately in Fig. 40). Slide 803 may
be shaped to include a ring portion 805 and a pair of angularly deflectable or splaying legs
807-1 and 807-2 extending from ring portion 805. As seen best in Fig. 39(a), with slide 803
in its distal position (i.e., before insertion of access device 801 into a patient), feet 809-1 and
809-2 at the ends of legs 807-1 and 807-2, respectively, may engage notches 811-1 and 811
2, respectively, provided on the exterior surface of a sheath 813. During insertion of access
device 801 into a patient, feet 809-1 and 809-2 may be easily moved proximally past notches
811-1 and 811-2 with only slight resistance and may move proximally along an outwardly
tapering track 813 formed along the inside of the housing of access device 801. When slide
803 is in its proximal position (i.e., upon full insertion of access device 803 into a patient), feet
809-1 and 809-2 may engage the proximal end of track 813 in such a way as to lock slide 803
in place.
         [0272]      One advantage of access device 801, as compared to access devices like
access device 751, is that splaying legs 807-1 and 807-2 may permit access device 801 to have
a reduced axial length.
         [0273]      Referring now to Figs. 4 1(a) through 4 1(d), there are shown various views
of an eleventh alternate embodiment of an access device 901. Access device 901 can include
a housing assembly 903, a sheath assembly, and a fluid control system. The sheath assembly
may include a cannula or sheath 913, a protective sleeve 925, a slide ring assembly 927, a
dilator or obturator 921, and an obturator handle 923. The fluid control system can include a
hub 905, a cam 907, a pair of compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2, a pair of fluid connectors
                                                  -52-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
911-1 and 911-2, a valve assembly 915, a seal 917, and a cap 919. Each of the foregoing
components will now be discussed in detail.
         [0274]     Referring now to Figs. 42(a) and 42(b), housing 903 may comprise a pair
of complementary housing halves 931 and 933, each of which may be a unitary structure made
of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Housing half 931 is also
shown separately in Figs. 43(a) and 43(b), and housing half 933 is also shown separately in
Figs. 44(a) and 44(b). Housing halves 931 and 933 may be joined together by suitable means,
such as by screws, adhesive, or ultrasonic welding, to jointly define a generally gun-shaped
structure including a barrel portion 935 and a handle portion 937.
         [0275]     Barrel portion 935, which may be generally circular in transverse cross
section, may be a tubular structure shaped to include a proximal end 939 and a distal end 941.
Barrel portion 935 may taper in cross-sectional diameter from proximal end 939 to distal end
941. Proximal end 939 may be shaped to include an opening 943, and distal end 941 may be
shaped to include an opening 945.      A circumferentially-extending slot 947, the purpose of
which will become apparent below, may be provided along the top surface of barrel portion
935 and may be spaced distally a short distance from proximal end 939. Slot 947 may have a
first end 948-1 and a second end 948-2. Indentations 949 and 951, which may be used as
finger rests to receive the forefinger and middle finger, respectively, of an operator, may be
provided along the top and bottom surfaces, respectively, of barrel portion 935 at the interface
of barrel portion 935 and handle portion 937 and may be used to facilitate the holding of
housing 903 in one hand. (The thumb of the same hand of the user may also rest on housing
903 below barrel portion 935 and proximal to handle portion 937; alternatively, as will
become apparent below, the thumb of the same hand of the user may also be used to operate
cam 907.) The barrel portion 935 and handle portion 937 are configured so that the opening
943 is not blocked by the operator when holding the housing 903. Rib 953 (see, for example,
Figs. 43(a) and 43(b)) and rib 955 (see, for example, Fig. 44(a)), which may be formed on the
interior surfaces of housing halves 931 and 933, respectively, between proximal end 939 and
slot 947, may be used to axially secure hub 905 within housing 903.          Rib 957 (see, for
example, Figs. 43(a) and 43(b)) and rib 959 (see, for example, Fig. 44(a)), which may be
formed on the interior surfaces of housing halves 931 and 933, respectively, just distal to
                                              -53-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
indentations 949 and 951, may be used to rotationally secure hub 905 within housing 903.
The positioning of ribs 953 and 955 can be configured so that the hub 905 is recessed within
the housing and does not extend past the opening 943, which can help to reduce
contamination.
        [0276]      Handle portion 937, which may be generally elliptical in transverse cross
section, may be a tubular structure shaped to include a joined end 961 and a free end 963.
Handle portion 937 may extend downwardly at an angle from barrel portion 935, with joined
end 961 being joined to barrel portion 935 at a location between slot 947 and indentations 949
and 951.    Free end 963 may be shaped to include an opening 965 (see, for example, Fig.
42(b)), the purpose of which will become apparent below. Rib 967 (see, for example, Figs.
43(a) and 43(b)) and rib 969 (see, for example, Fig. 44(a)) may be formed on the interior
surfaces of housing halves 931 and 933, respectively, just above free end 963 and may be
used, in combination with free end 963, to securely receive fluid connectors 911-1 and 911-2,
respectively.
        [0277]      Referring now to Figs. 45(a) through 45(d), hub 905 may be a unitary
structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material.      Hub 905
may comprise a proximal portion 971 and a distal portion 973, each of which may be generally
tubular in shape.    Proximal portion 971 and distal portion 973 may be coaxial with one
another, with proximal portion 971 having a comparatively larger diameter and with distal
portion 973 having a comparatively smaller diameter.
        [0278]      Proximal portion 971 of hub 905 may comprise a proximal end 975 and a
distal end 977. Proximal end 975 may be shaped to include a proximal opening 979 and a
circumferential flange 981 extending radially outwardly a short distance therefrom.           A
circumferential rib 983 may be provided on the exterior of proximal portion 971 and may be
spaced distally a short distance from flange 981. Rib 983 and flange 981 may jointly define a
waist 985 therebetween. Waist 985 may be appropriately dimensioned to receive rib 953 (see,
for example, Fig. 43(a) and 43(b)) and rib 955 (see, for example, Fig. 44(a)) of housing 903 to
axially secure hub 905 within housing 903.      A rib 988, which may extend distally a short
distance from rib 983, may be formed on the exterior of proximal portion 971.        As will be
discussed further below, rib 988 may be used to delimit the rotation of cam 907 relative to hub
                                              -54-

 WO 2014/026028                                                             PCT/US2013/054185
905. A pair of tubular posts 989-1 and 989-2 may extend distally a short distance from distal
end 977 of proximal portion 971.             Posts 989-1 and 989-2, which may be in fluid
communication with the interior of proximal portion 971, may be appropriately dimensioned
for compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 (see, for example, Fig. 41(d)), respectively, to be
inserted coaxially thereover and to be retained thereon by an interference fit.
        [0279]      Distal portion 973 of hub 905 may comprise a proximal end 991 and a
distal end 993. Distal end 993 may be shaped to include a distal opening 995 and a pair of
tabs 997-1 and 997-2 extending radially outwardly a short distance from the top and bottom
surfaces, respectively, of distal portion 973.       Tabs 997-1 and 997-2 may be appropriately
dimensioned to engage rib 957 (see, for example, Figs. 43(a) and 43(b)) and rib 959 (see, for
example, Fig. 44(a)) of housing 903 in such a way as to rotationally secure hub 905 within
housing 903.
        [0280]      Referring now to Figs. 46(a) through 46(e), cam 907 may be a generally
tubular unitary structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable
material. Cam 907, which may be rotatably mounted over hub 905, may comprise a circular
side wall 1001 having a proximal end 1003 and a distal end 1005.            Side wall 1001 may be
appropriately dimensioned to coaxially receive hub 905, as well as to receive compliant tubes
909-1 and 909-2 inserted axially therethrough.          A circumferentially-extending recess 1007
may be provided in side wall 1001 proximate to proximal end 1003. Recess 1007, which may
include a first end 1009, a second end 1011, and a midpoint notch 1013, may be appropriately
dimensioned to receive rib 988 of hub 905 in such a way that rib 988 may delimit the rotation
of cam 907 relative to hub 905.
        [0281]      Cam 907 may further comprise a handle, switch or lever 1015, which may
extend radially outwardly from side wall 1001.               Handle 1015 may be appropriately
dimensioned to extend through slot 947 (see, for example, Fig. 41(a)) in housing 903. In this
manner, an operator may, for example, using his thumb, manipulate the handle 1015 to
different positions within slot 947, e.g., a first position in which handle 1015 is centered within
slot 947 (as shown, for example, in Fig. 41(a)), a second position in which handle 1015 is
positioned at end 948-1 (as shown, for example, in Fig. 47), and a third position in which
handle 1015 is positioned at end 948-2 (as shown, for example, in Fig. 48). Slot 947 may be
                                                 -55-

  WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
appropriately dimensioned so that (i) when handle 1015 is positioned against end 948-1 of slot
947, rib 988 may be positioned against first end 1009 of recess 1007, (ii) when handle 1015 is
positioned against end 948-2 of slot 947, rib 988 may be positioned against second end 1011
of recess 1007, and (iii) when handle 1015 is centered within slot 947, the distal tip of rib 988
may be positioned within notch 1013 of recess 1007. The slot 947 may have detents that
provide tactile feedback to position the handle 1015 at (i) the first end 948-1 of the slot 947,
(ii) the second end 948-2 of the slot 947, or (iii) centered within the slot 947.
         [0282]      The handle 1015 can be configured to have a limited range of motion
within the slot 947. The range of motion can be limited to help facilitate manipulation of the
handle 1015 with a single hand. By limiting the angular range of motion the handle 1015, the
operator can be positioned between each of the positions with one hand, and preferably, with
a single digit (e.g., the thumb). In some embodiments the handle 1015 can be configured to
have an angular rotation between two positions, such as from the centered position within the
slot 947 to the first end 948-1 or the second end 948-2, that is less than or equal to about 45
degrees, preferably, the angular rotation can be less than or equal to about 30 degrees, and,
more preferably, less than or equal to about 25, 20, 15, 10, or 5 degrees. The total angular
rotation of the handle 1015 within the slot 947 from the first end 938-1 to the second end
948-2 can be less than or equal to about 90 degrees, preferably, less than or equal to about 60
degrees, and, more preferably, less than or equal to about 50, 45, 40, 30, 20, or 10 degrees.
         [0283]      Cam 907 may further comprise a distal wall 1017 disposed within distal
end 1005 of side wall 1001.      Distal wall 1017, which may be generally U-shaped, may be
appropriately dimensioned so that, depending on the angular position of cam 907, one or both
of compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 may be pinched shut between distal wall 1017 and distal
portion 973 of hub 905. For example, when cam 907 is angularly positioned so that handle
1015 is centered within slot 947, distal wall 1017 may pinch shut both compliant tube 909-1
and compliant tube 909-2 against distal portion 973 of hub 905. Alternatively, when cam 907
is angularly positioned so that handle 1015 is positioned at end 948-1 of slot 947, distal wall
1017 may pinch shut compliant tube 909-2 against distal portion 973 of hub 905 while
permitting compliant tube 909-1 to remain open, and when cam 907 is angularly positioned so
that handle 1015 is positioned at end 948-2 of slot 947, distal wall 1017 may pinch shut
                                               -56-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185

909-2 to remain open.
         [0284]     Figs. 49(a) through 49(c) are rear fragmentary views of access device 901,
with certain components, such as compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2, not being shown for
clarity. More specifically, Fig. 49(a) shows access device 901 with handle 1015 of cam 907
centered within slot 947 (as in Fig. 41(a)), Fig. 49(b) shows access device 901 with handle
1015 of cam 907 positioned at end 948-1 of slot 947 (as in Fig. 47), and Fig. 49(c) shows
access device 901 with handle 1015 of cam 907 positioned at end 948-2 of slot 947 (as in Fig.
48). As can be seen in Fig. 49(a), when handle 1015 of cam 907 is centered within slot 947,
distal wall 1017 is positioned so as to be substantially aligned with both post 989-1 and post
989-2. As a result, with distal wall 1017 thus positioned, compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2,
which are not shown but are mounted on posts 989-1 and 989-2, respectively, are pinched
shut between distal wall 1017 of cam 907 and distal portion 973 of hub 905. By comparison,
as seen in Fig. 49(b), when handle 1015 of cam 907 is positioned at end 948-1 of slot 947,
distal wall 1017 is positioned so as to be substantially aligned with post 989-2 but not with
post 989-1.     Consequently, with distal wall 1017 thus positioned, compliant tube 909-2 is
pinched shut between distal wall 1017 of cam 907 and distal portion 973 of hub 905 whereas
compliant tube 909-1 is not pinched shut between distal wall 1017 of cam 907 and distal
portion 973 of hub 905.      Finally, as seen in Fig. 49(c), when handle 1015 of cam 907 is
positioned at end 948-2 of slot 947, distal wall 1017 is positioned so as to be substantially
aligned with post 989-1 but not with post 989-2.        As a result, with distal wall 1017 thus
positioned, compliant tube 909-1 is pinched shut between distal wall 1017 of cam 907 and
distal portion 973 of hub 905 whereas compliant tube 909-2 is not pinched shut between distal
wall 1017 of cam 907 and distal portion 973 of hub 905.
         [0285]     It is to be understood that, although distal wall 1017 of cam 905 is
constructed in the present embodiment to have three positions, namely, (i) a position in which
both compliant tube 909-1 and compliant tube 909-2 are simultaneously pinched shut, (ii) a
position in which compliant tube 909-1 is allowed to be open and compliant tube 909-2 is
pinched shut, and (iii) a position in which compliant tube 909-1 is pinched shut and compliant
tube 909-2 is allowed to be open, distal wall 1017 of cam 905 may be constructed to have
                                              -57-

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
additional positions, such as a flush position in which both compliant tube 909-1 and
compliant tube 909-2 are allowed to be open. In addition, device 901 may be constructed so
that each of compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 may not be limited to being placed only in either
a fully opened state or a fully closed state, but rather, may additionally be placed in a finite
number or in an infinite number (i.e. continuously adjustable) of partially opened states having
flow rates varying by equal or unequal increments between a fully opened state and a fully
closed state.
         [0286]     Referring back now to Fig. 41(d), compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 each
may be a generally tubular unitary member made of a flexible medical-grade silicone or a
similarly suitable material. Compliant tube 909-1 may include a first end 1031 and a second
end 1033, and compliant tube 909-2 may include a first end 1035 and a second end 1037.
First end 1031 of compliant tube 909-1 may be coaxially mounted over post 989-1 and may be
secured thereto, for example, by an interference fit or other suitable means, and first end 1035
of compliant tube 909-2 may be coaxially mounted over post 989-2 and may be secured
thereto, for example, by an interference fit or other suitable means. In the above manner,
compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 may be placed in fluid communication with the interior of
proximal portion 971 of hub 905 and, thus, may be placed in fluid communication with the
interior of sheath 913 when obturator 921 is removed from sheath 913.
         [0287]         Second end 1033 of compliant tube 909-1 may be coaxially inserted
into a first end 1041-1 of fluid connector 911-1 and may be secured thereto, for example, by
adhesive or other suitable means, and second end 1037 of compliant tube 909-2 may be
coaxially inserted into a first end 1041-2 of fluid connector 911-2 and may be secured thereto,
for example, by adhesive or other suitable means. A second end 1043-1 of fluid connector
911-1 may be in the shape of a female luer lock connector, and a second end 1043-2 of fluid
connector 911-2 may be in the shape of a female luer lock connector. One of fluid connectors
911-1 and 911-2 may be connected to a male luer lock connector (not shown) that, in turn,
may be connected to a fluid source, and the other of fluid connectors 911-1 and 911-2 may be
connected to a male luer lock connector (not shown) that, in turn, may be connected to a
drain. Consequently, one of compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 may be used to deliver fluid to
a patient, and the other of compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 may be used to drain fluid from
                                               -58-

the patient. Fluid connector 911-1 may be further shaped to include a flange 1045-1, and fluid
connector 911-2 may be further shaped to include a flange 1045-2. Flange 1045-1 may be
appropriately dimensioned to mate with housing half 931 between rib 967 (see Figs. 43(a) and
43(b)) and free end 963, thereby securing fluid connector 911-1 to housing half 931.
Similarly, flange 1045-2 may be appropriately dimensioned to mate with housing half 933
between rib 969 (see Fig. 44(a)) and free end 963, thereby securing fluid connector 911-2 to
housing half 933.
         [0288]     The fluid flow rates for access device 901 may be in the range of about 1
cc/min to about 1000 cc/min, preferably about 10 cc/min to about 500 cc/min, and more
preferably about 100 cc/min to about 250 cc/min. Moreover, the following dimensions, which
may affect how cam 907 pinches shut tubes 909-1 and 909-2, may be used:

that handle 1015 of cam 907 may be located so that fluid may be delivered to a patient, so that
fluid may be drained from a patient, or neither. For example, to indicate a "filling" function,
i.e., where fluid is to be delivered to the patient, one may use, for example, the following
indicia: "IN," "FILL," "+," or an arrow indicating inflow. To indicate a "draining" function,
i.e., where fluid is to be drained from the patient, one may use, for example, the following
indicia: "OUT," "DRAIN,"     "-," or an arrow indicating outflow. To indicate that the device is

closed for fluid transfer in either direction, one may use, for example, the following indicia:
"CLOSED," a circle with a single line through it, or an "X" circumscribed with a circle. If a
flush function were added, one may use, for example, the following indicia: "FLUSH" or
         [0290]      Referring now to Figs. 50(a) through 50(c), sheath 913, which may
comprise a generally tubular unitary structure made of a medical-grade polymer or a similarly
suitable material having columnar strength as well as angular flexibility, may be shaped to
include a proximal portion 1053-1, a distal portion 1053-2, and a longitudinal channel 1054,
longitudinal channel 1054 extending through the entire respective lengths of proximal portion
1053-1 and distal portion 1053-2.        Proximal portion 1053-1, which may have a generally
cylindrical shape, may include a proximal end 1055, which may be fixedly secured, for
example, by adhesive or other suitable means within hub 905 proximate to the interface of
proximal portion 971 and distal portion 973, with the remainder of proximal portion 1053-1
of sheath 913 extending distally therefrom. A plurality of longitudinally-extending grooves
1057 may be provided on the exterior of proximal portion 1053-1 of sheath 913. As will be
discussed further below, grooves 1057, which may terminate at the interface of proximal
portion 1053-1 and distal portion 1053-2, may serve as a track along which slide ring
assembly 927 (see, for example, Figs. 41(a) and 41(b)) may slide.
         [0291]      Distal portion 1053-2 of sheath 913, which may have a generally frusto
conical shape, may include a distal end 1059. Distal portion 1053-2 may have a wall thickness
that tapers distally to distal end 1059.
         [0292]       Sheath 913 may be appropriately dimensioned so that the exposed portion
of sheath 913, i.e., the portion of sheath 913 that extends distally from housing 903, has a
length that is slightly greater than the length of a typical female human urethra and additionally
has an external diameter that permits the exposed portion of sheath 913 to easily traverse a
typical female human urethra. For illustrative purposes, sheath 913 may have an external
diameter of about 24 Fr and may be dimensioned so that the length of sheath 913 inserted into
the patient's urethra has a length in the range of about 0.001 inch to about 100 inches,
preferably about 1 inch to about 10 inches, more preferably about 1.5 inch to about 2 inches.

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
         [0293]     Referring now to Figs. 41(c), 41(d), and Fig. 51, valve assembly 915,
which may be similar in size, shape, construction, and function to valve assembly 91 of access
device 13, may comprise a proximal portion 1071-1 that may be similar to proximal portion
92-1 of valve assembly 91, a distal portion 1071-2 that may be similar to distal portion 92-2 of
valve assembly 91, and an intermediate portion 1071-3 that may be similar to intermediate
portion 92-3 of valve assembly 91.      One difference between valve assembly 915 and valve
assembly 91 may be that, whereas proximal portion 92-1 of valve assembly 91 may be shaped
for seal 125 to be mounted therewithin, valve assembly 915 may not be so shaped. Instead,
seal 917, which may be similar to seal 125 but having a greater outer diameter, may have its
distal surface 917-1 positioned flush against a proximal end 1072 of proximal portion 1071-1
of valve assembly 915. Valve assembly 915 may be partially coaxially inserted into proximal
portion 971 of hub 905, with a distal end 1073 of proximal portion 1071-1 of valve assembly
915 abutting proximal end 975 of hub 905 and with a distal end 1075 of distal portion 1071-2
of valve assembly 915 being spaced a short distance from distal end 977 of proximal portion
971 of hub 905 to define a gap 1080. In this manner, for example, fluid from the patient may
flow proximally to gap 1080 through sheath 913 (proximal end 1055 of sheath 913 being
disposed just distal to gap 1080), and such fluid may then flow from gap 1080 into posts 989
1 and 989-2. Then, depending on the positioning of cam 907 and the respective patencies of
compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2, such fluid may flow through compliant tube 909-1,
compliant tube 909-2 or neither.      In a corresponding fashion, fluid may be delivered from
compliant tube 909-1 or compliant tube 909-2 to sheath 913 via gap 1080.
         [0294]     Referring also now to Figs. 52(a) through 52(d), cap 919, which may be a
unitary structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or similarly suitable material, may
comprise a proximal portion 1101 and a distal portion 1103, each of which may be generally
tubular in shape. Proximal portion 1101 and distal portion 1103 may be coaxial with one
another, with proximal portion 1101 being comparatively larger in diameter and with distal
portion 1103 being comparatively smaller in diameter. Proximal portion 1101 may include a
proximal face 1105 and a distal face 1106. An opening 1107 may be provided in proximal
face 1105. Opening 1107, the purpose of which will become apparent below, may be shaped
to include a generally circular central portion 1109 and a pair of side lobes 1111-1 and 1111

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
2. Cap 919 may be appropriately dimensioned so that distal end 1106 of proximal portion
1101 may lie flush against proximal end 939 of housing 903, with distal portion 1103 residing
within housing 903 (see Fig. 41(c)).      Cap 919 may also be appropriately dimensioned to
coaxially receive the combination of seal 917, proximal portion 1071-1 of valve assembly 915,
and flange 981 of hub 905 (see Fig. 51). Distal portion 1103 of hub 905 may be secured to
flange 981 of hub 905 by any suitable means, such as, for example, ultrasonic welding. The
securing of cap 919 to hub 905 may serve not only to fasten cap 919 to hub 905 but also to
compress seal 917 and valve assembly 915 to ensure that these components create a fluid-tight
seal and to constrain these components against axial or other movement during use of access
device 901.
         [0295]     Referring now to Figs. 41(c), 41(d), 53, and 54, obturator 921 may be
similar in most respects to obturator 131 of access device 13. One difference between the two
obturators may be that obturator 921 may include a distal end 1121 that is more blunted than
distal end 135 of obturator 131. Such a blunted end may reduce the likelihood that the distal
end of the obturator may cause injury or discomfort to the patient during its insertion. The
obturator 921 can also have an intermediate portion with a narrowed diameter so as not to
open valves within the valve assembly 915 any more than is minimally needed. For example,
the intermediate portion can be greater in length than the combination of the valves, the seal
917, and the valve assembly 915.
         [0296]     Referring now to Figs. 41(a) through 41(d), 53, 55(a) and 55(b), obturator
handle 923, which may be a unitary structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or
similarly suitable material, may comprise a proximal portion 1201, an intermediate portion
1203, and a distal portion 1205.     Proximal portion 1201, which may be a generally planar
member having an hourglass profile, may be shaped to include a pair of recesses 1207-1 and
1207-2 at opposing locations on its periphery.        Recesses 1207-1 and 1207-2 may be
appropriately dimensioned to accommodate the thumb and forefinger, respectively, of a user
or the forefinger and thumb, respectively, of a user. Proximal portion 1201 may be further
shaped to include a transverse opening 1209, which may be centrally located. Intermediate
portion 1203, which may be generally tubular in shape, may be concentrically positioned
around opening 1209 and may extend distally a short distance from proximal portion 1201.
                                              -62-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
Distal portion 1205, which may be generally tubular in shape, may extend distally a short
distance from intermediate portion 1203, distal portion 1205 being coaxial with but
comparatively smaller in diameter than intermediate portion 1203. Distal portion 1205 and
intermediate portion 1203 may be appropriately dimensioned so that a proximal end 1210 of
obturator 921 may be axially received therewithin and may be fixed to handle 923 by suitable
means.    With obturator 921 thus secured to handle 923, opening 1209 may be in fluid
communication with the interior of obturator 921. Consequently, where, for example, access
device 901 is used to provide access to a bladder, correct placement of obturator 921 in the
bladder may be noted by the proximal flow of urine through opening 1209. However, if such
confirmation is unnecessary or undesirable, opening 1209 may be eliminated.
        [0297]       Distal portion 1205 may comprise a distal end 1211 that is mateable with
opening 1107 in proximal face 1105 of cap 919. Consequently, by inserting distal end 1211 of
handle 923 through opening 1107 and, thereafter, rotating handle 923 clockwise relative to
cap 919 by approximately 90 degrees, one may lock handle 923 to cap 919 and, in so doing,
may prevent unwanted axial movement of obturator 921 relative to cap 919 and, thus, relative
to sheath 913.     For example, such locking may prevent undesired proximal movement of
obturator 921 relative to sheath 913 as obturator 921 is being inserted into a patient. After
access device 901 has been properly placed in a patient, obturator 921 may be removed from
the remainder of access device 901 by rotating handle 923 counterclockwise relative to cap
919 until distal end 1211 of handle 923 may be withdrawn through opening 1107 of cap 919.
        [0298]       It should be understood that a flush adapter may be used in place of
obturator 921 to provide flushing capabilities at the tip of sheath 913.       It should also be
understood that a multiple lumen sheath could be used in place of sheath 913 to provide
flushing capabilities. Alternatively, the end of the obturator handle may include a luer or other
attachment that may allow for the flow of fluid through the obturator to distend the urethra
during insertion of the access device.       Such an attachment may alternatively be used to
introduce fluids or tools into the bladder through the obturator before the obturator is
removed.
        [0299]       Referring now to Figs. 41(a) through 41(d), 56(a) and 56(b), protective
sleeve 925 may be identical in size, shape, construction, and function to protective sleeve 181
                                               -63-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
of access device 13. Protective sleeve 925 may comprise a first end 1251 and a second end
1253.    Prior to deployment of access device 901, first end 1251 may be disposed within
obturator 921.
         [0300]     Referring also now to Fig. 57, slide ring assembly 927 may comprise an
inner member 1261, an outer member 1263, and an O-ring 1265. Inner member 1261, which
may be a unitary structure, preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly
suitable material, may comprise a tubular portion 1271.      A plurality of angularly-deflectable
legs 1275 may be spaced around the periphery of tubular portion 1271 and may extend
proximally a short distance therefrom. Legs 1275 may be shaped to include feet 1276 that
may lockably engage the interior of housing 903 once feet 1276 have been inserted into
opening 945 of housing 903.       Such locking may also provide tactile feedback that slide ring
assembly 927 has been fully moved to its proximal position. A plurality of legs 1277 may be
spaced around the periphery of tubular portion 1271 and may extend distally a short distance
therefrom.     Legs 1277, which may be biased radially inwardly, may be appropriately
configured and dimensioned to ride within grooves 1057 of sheath 913 and, in so doing, may
constrain rotational movement of inner member 1261 relative to sheath 913.            In addition,
distal movement of inner member 1261 may be constrained by the fact that grooves 1057 may
terminate at the distal end of proximal portion 1053-1 of sheath 913 and may not continue in
distal portion 1053-2 of sheath 913. Consequently, distal portion 1053-2 of sheath 913 may
effectively act as a stop for distal movement of inner member 1261.        Still further, the legs
1277 can function similar to the barbs 325-1 and 325-2 described with respect to Fig. 23. The
legs 1277 can be biased to extend radially inwardly and distally. This can prevent or restrain
distal movement of the slide ring assembly 927 relative to the sheath 913. When positioned
within a groove 1057 on the sheath, the legs can also prevent rotational movement. At the
same time, the legs 1277 can allow proximal movement of the slide ring assembly 927 relative
to the sheath 913. In this way, the slide ring assembly 927 can be a one directional slide ring.
Thus, proximal retraction of the slide ring to advance the everting sleeve out of the obturator
and over the outside of the tubular body or sheath can be performed while reducing the
possibility of undesirable distal movement of the slide ring assembly.

 WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
         [0301]     Second end 1253 of sleeve 925 may be inserted coaxially over tubular
portion 1271 of inner member 1261 and may be secured thereto by O-ring 1265.               Outer
member 1263, which may be a generally tubular unitary member made of a soft or
compressible medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material, may be coaxially and
fixedly mounted over O-ring 1265 and inner member 1261. Outer member 1263, which may
be shaped to minimize irritation of a patient, may include a distal flange 1281, which may be
used to move slide ring assembly 927 proximally relative to sheath 913.
         [0302]     Access device 901 may have an overall length in the range of about 0.001
inch to about 20 inches, preferably about 0.1 inch to about 10 inches, more preferably about 1
inch to about 6 inches.
         [0303]     Access device 901 may be used in a manner similar to that discussed above
for access device 13.      For example, for trans-urethral access to a female human urinary
bladder, cam 907 may be switched to its closed position (as in Fig. 41(a)), i.e., so that both
compliant tubes 909-1 and 909-2 may be pinched shut, and distal end 1121 of obturator 921
may be aligned with and inserted into the patient. As access device 901 may continue to be
inserted into the patient, the meatus of the patient may cause slide ring assembly 927 to be slid
proximally, thereby causing the portion of sleeve 925 that is disposed within obturator 921 to
be removed therefrom and to be everted over the exterior of sheath 913, thereby providing a
barrier between the patient's urethra and sheath 913. Further insertion of access device 901
into the patient may cause inner member 1261 of slide ring assembly 927 to be slid proximally
until it lockably engages housing 903 (as in Fig. 57).      With slide ring assembly 927 thus
engaged with housing 903, the distal end of access device 901 should be located in the bladder
of the patient. Confirmation of such placement may be noted by the proximal flow of urine
through opening 1107 of obturator handle 923. Obturator 921 may then be removed from the
patient by rotating obturator handle 923 until distal portion 1205 of obturator handle 923 is
aligned with opening 1107 of cap 919 and then by withdrawing proximally the combination of
obturator handle 923 and obturator 921 from the remainder of access device 901.             With
obturator 921 thus removed, the remaining implanted portion of access device 901 may
provide a conduit through which medical devices, such as delivery device 15, pressure
attenuating device 17, and removal device 19, may be delivered to the bladder. If desired,

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
fluid may be delivered to or drained from the bladder by switching cam 907 from its closed
position to one of its open positions (see Figs. 47 and 48), whereby compliant tube 909-1 is
pinched shut and compliant tube 909-2 is allowed to be open or vice versa.
         [0304]     Referring now to Figs. 58(a) through 58(d), there are shown various views
of a twelfth alternate embodiment of an access device 1291. (For simplicity and clarity, one
or more of the components of access device 1291 may not be shown in all of Figs. 58(a)
through 58(d).) Access device 1291 can include a housing assembly 1293, a sheath assembly,
and a fluid control system.    The sheath assembly can include a cannula or sheath 1303, a
dilator or obturator 1311, an obturator handle 1313, a protective sleeve 1315, and a slide ring
assembly 1317.     The fluid control system can include a hub 1295, a cam 1297, a pair of
compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2, a pair of fluid connectors 1301-1 and 1301-2, a valve
assembly 1305, a seal 1307, and a cap 1309. Each of the foregoing components will now be
discussed further below.
         [0305]     Referring now to Fig. 59, housing 1293 may comprise a pair of
complementary housing halves 1319 and 1320, each of which may be a unitary structure made
of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Housing half 1319 is also
shown separately in Figs. 60(a) and 60(b), and housing half 1320 is also shown separately in
Figs. 61(a) and 61(b). Housing halves 1319 and 1320 may be joined together by suitable
means, such as by screws, adhesive, or ultrasonic welding, to jointly define a generally gun
shaped structure including a barrel portion 1321 and a handle portion 1322.
         [0306]     Barrel portion 1321, which may be generally circular in transverse cross
section, may be a tubular structure shaped to include a proximal end 1323 and a distal end
1324. Barrel portion 1321 may taper in cross-sectional diameter from proximal end 1323 to
distal end 1324. Proximal end 1323 may be shaped to include an opening 1325, and distal end
1324 may be shaped to include an opening 1326. A circumferentially-extending slot 1327, the
purpose of which will become apparent below, may be provided along the top surface of
barrel portion 1321 and may be spaced distally a short distance from proximal end 1323. Slot
1327 may have a first end 1327-1 and a second end 1327-2. A rib 1328 (see, for example,
Figs. 60(a) and 60(b)) may be formed on the interior surface of housing half 1319 between
proximal end 1323 and slot 1327, and a rib 1329 (see, for example, Fig. 6 1(b)) may be formed
                                              -66-

on the interior surface of housing half 1320 between proximal end 1323 and slot 1327. Ribs
 1328 and 1329 may serve to axially secure hub 1295 within housing 1293. A rib 1330 (see,
for example, Figs. 60(a) and 60(b)) may be formed on the interior surface of housing half
 1319 between handle portion 1322 and distal end 1324, and a rib 1331 (see, for example, Fig.
61(b)) may be formed on the interior surface of housing half 1320 between handle portion
 1322 and distal end 1324. Ribs 1330 and 1331 may be used to rotationally secure hub 1295
within housing 1293.
        [0307]      Handle portion 1322, which may be generally elliptical in transverse cross
section, may be a tubular structure shaped to include a joined end 1332 and a free end 1333.
Handle portion 1322 may extend downwardly at an angle from barrel portion 1321, with
joined end 1332 being joined to barrel portion 1321 at a location between slot 1327 and distal
end 1324. The barrel portion 1321 and the handle portion 1322 are positioned to form an
acute angle relative to the distal end 1324, in other words the barrel portion 1321 and the
handle portion 1322 generally form a "y" shape relative to each other. In some embodiments,
the barrel portion 1321 and handle portion 1322 can be substantially perpendicular to one
another. Thus, the barrel and handle portions can provide sufficient structure for a user to
securely grip and control the access device with one hand while also operating one or more
features of the device, such as a fluid control system, with digits (finger(s) and/or thumb) of
the same hand.
        [0308]      Free end 1333 may be shaped to include an opening 1334 (see, for
example, Fig. 60(b) and 61(b)), the purpose of which will become apparent below.            A rib
 1335 (see, for example, Figs. 60(a) and 60(b)) may be formed on the interior surface of
housing half 1319, and a rib 1336 (see, for example, Fig. 6 1(b)) may be formed on the interior
surface of housing half 1320. Ribs 1335 and 1336 may be used, in combination with free end
 1333, to securely receive fluid connectors 1301-1 and 1301-2, respectively.     A first plurality
of ribs 1337 (see, for example, Figs. 60(a) and 60(b)) may be formed on the interior surface of
housing half 1319 between rib 1335 and barrel portion 1321, and a second plurality of ribs
 1338 (see, for example, Fig. 6 1(b)) may be formed on the interior surface of housing half 1320
between rib 1336 and barrel portion 1321. Ribs 1337 and 1338 may be used to form channels
for receiving compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2.

         [0309]      Referring now to Figs. 62(a) and 62(b), hub 1295 may be a unitary
structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Hub 1295
may comprise a proximal portion 1339 and a distal portion 1340, each of which may be
generally tubular in shape. Proximal portion 1339 and distal portion 1340 may be coaxial and
in fluid communication with one another, with proximal portion 1339 having a comparatively
larger inner diameter and with distal portion 1340 having a comparatively smaller inner
diameter.
         [0310]      Proximal portion 1339 of hub 1295 may comprise a proximal end 1341 and
a distal end 1342. Proximal end 1341 may be shaped to include a proximal opening 1343. A
pair of circumferential ribs 1344 and 1345 may be provided on the exterior of proximal
portion 1339 and may be spaced distally a short distance from proximal end 1341. Ribs 1344
and 1345 may jointly define a waist 1346 therebetween.       Waist 1346 may be appropriately
dimensioned to receive rib 1335 (see, for example, Figs. 60(a) and 60(b)) and rib 1336 (see,
for example, Fig. 61(b)) of housing 1293 to axially secure hub 1295 within housing 1293.
The interior of proximal portion 1339 of hub 1295 may be appropriately dimensioned to
coaxially receive valve assembly 1305.
         [0311]      Distal portion 1340 of hub 1295 may comprise a proximal end 1347 and a
distal end 1348. Distal end 1348 may be shaped to include a distal opening 1349 and a pair of
tabs 1350-1 and 1350-2 extending radially outwardly a short distance from the top and
bottom surfaces, respectively, of distal portion 1340.      Tabs 1350-1 and 1350-2 may be
appropriately dimensioned to engage rib 1330 (see, for example, Figs. 60(a) and 60(b)) and
rib 1331 (see, for example, Fig. 61(a)) of housing 1293 in such a way as to rotationally secure
hub 1295 within housing 1293.        A pair of tubular posts 1351-1 and 1351-2 may extend
downwardly from the bottom of distal portion 1340.            Post 1351-1 may be positioned
proximate to proximal end 1347 of distal portion 1340, and post 1351-2 may be spaced
distally a short distance from post 1351-1.   Posts 1351-1 and 1351-2, which may be in fluid
communication with the interior of distal portion 1340, may be appropriately dimensioned for
compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2 (see, for example, Fig. 58(d)), respectively, to be inserted
coaxially thereover and to be retained thereon by an interference fit.

         [0312]     Referring now to Figs. 63(a) through 63(d), cam 1297 may be a generally
tubular, unitary structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable
material. Cam 1297, which may be rotatably mounted over hub 1295, may comprise a curved
side wall 1352 having an open proximal end 1353 and an open distal end 1354. A wedge
shaped slot 1352-1 may be provided on the bottom surface of side wall 1352 and may extend
from proximal end 1353 to a short distance proximal to distal end 1354. A first cam surface
1355 may extend distally a short distance from distal end 1354, and a second cam surface
1356 may extend proximally a short distance from distal end 1354.
         [0313]     Cam surface 1355 may be appropriately contoured and dimensioned to
control fluid flow through compliant tube 1299-2, and cam surface 1356 may be appropriately
contoured and dimensioned to control fluid flow through compliant tube 1299-1.          More
specifically, cam surface 1355 may include a ramp portion 1357, a plateau portion 1358, and a
detent 1359, and cam surface 1356 may include a ramp portion 1360, a plateau portion 1361,
and a detent 1362. As will become apparent below, as cam 1297 is rotated in one direction,
thereby effectively causing compliant tube 1299-2 to ride along cam surface 1355 in the
direction of detent 1359, the patency of compliant tube 1299-2 may be reduced by ramp
portion 1357 and may be completely closed by plateau portion 1358. Similarly, as cam 1297
is rotated in an opposite direction, thereby effectively causing compliant tube 1299-1 to ride
along cam surface 1356 in the direction of detent 1362, the patency of compliant tube 1299-1
may be reduced by ramp portion 1360 and may be completely closed by plateau portion 1361.
Detent 1359 may be used to provide some resistance to the movement of compliant tube
1299-2 relative to cam surface 1355 as compliant tube 1299-1 rides along ramp portion 1360
of cam surface 1356, and detent 1362 may be used to provide some resistance to the
movement of compliant tube 1299-1 relative to cam surface 1356 as compliant tube 1299-2
rides along ramp portion 1357 of cam surface 1355. As seen best in Fig. 63(b), ramp surfaces
1355 and 1356 may have symmetrically opposing contours. In this manner, cam surface 1355
may be arranged to provide patency for compliant tube 1299-2 at the same time that cam
surface 1356 may prevent patency for compliant tube 1299-1, and cam surface 1356 may be
arranged to provide patency for compliant tube 1299-1 at the same time that cam surface
1355 may prevent patency for compliant tube 1299-2.

 WO 2014/026028                                                             PCT/US2013/054185
         [0314]     Cam 1297 may further comprise a handle, switch or lever 1363, which may
extend upwardly from the top of side wall 1352.               Handle 1363 may be appropriately
dimensioned to extend through slot 1327 (see, for example, Fig. 58(a)) in housing 1293. In
this manner, an operator may, for example, using his thumb, slide handle 1363 to any one of
three different positions within slot 1327, i.e., a first position in which handle 1363 is centered
within slot 1327 (as shown, for example, in Fig. 58(a)), a second position in which handle
1363 is positioned at end 1327-1 (as shown, for example, in Fig. 64), and a third position in
which handle 1363 is positioned at end 1327-2 (as shown, for example, in Fig. 65). The cam
1297 can include features described in association with other cam embodiments.
         [0315]     Referring now to Fig. 63(d), cam 1297 has different radial distances from
the central axis of rotation, between handle 1363 - indicated as RI, and cam surface
1355/1356 - indicated as R2; this relationship can enable a mechanical advantage and reduced
interior space requirements inside handle 1363 (Rd2 < Rdl). The ratio R1/R2 is preferably
between 5/1, more preferably 3/1, even more preferably 1.6/1.
         [0316]     Cam 1297 may have a rotational range between three positions: 1) cam
surface 1355 provides patency for compliant tube 1299-2 (Fig. 58(c)), while preventing
patency for compliant tube 1299-1; 2) cam surface 1355 and 1356 simultaneously prevent
patency for compliant tube 1299-1 and compliant tube 1299-2; 3) cam surface provides
patency for compliant tube 1299-1, while preventing patency for compliant tube 1299-2. Said
rotational range from position 1 to position 3 is preferably less than 90 degrees, more
preferably less than 75 degrees, even more preferably less than 60 degrees, where a reduced
rotational range is advantageous for single handed or single digit operation. For example, the
cam can have a rotational range similar to that described herein with reference to other
embodiments.
         [0317]     The cam can have two main features, the user interface (handle 1363) and
the surfaces (1355 & 1356) that open/close the compliant tubes. The radial distances from the
central axis of rotation is different for these two features - in that the handle is farther away
providing an mechanical force advantage to the surfaces closing off the tubes. The balance of
the difference in radius and the degree of angular rotation determines the "practical usability"
of the product (fluid control mechanism).

  WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
         [0318]      Figs. 66(a) and 66(b) are bottom and perspective views, respectively, of the
combination of hub 1295, cam 1297, and compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2 of access device
1291, with cam 1297 being rotated relative to hub 1295 so that handle 1363 faces directly
upwardly. As can be seen best in Fig. 66(a), in this angular orientation, compliant tube 1299
2 is closed off by plateau portion 1358 of cam surface 1355, and compliant tube 1299-1 is
closed off by plateau portion 1361 of cam surface 1356.
         [0319]      Figs. 67(a) through 67(c) are bottom views of the combination of hub
1295, cam 1297, compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2, sheath 1303, and slide ring assembly
1317 of access device 1291. Fig. 67(a) shows cam 1297 in its closed position, with compliant
tube 1299-2 being closed off by cam surface 1355 and with compliant tube 1299-1 being
closed off by cam surface 1356. Fig. 67(b) shows cam 1297 rotated relative to hub 1295 so
that compliant tube 1299-1 is no longer closed off by cam surface 1356 whereas compliant
tube 1299-2 is still closed off by cam surface 1355.        Fig. 67(c) shows cam 1297 rotated
relative to hub 1295 in the opposite direction to that shown in Fig. 67(b) so that compliant
tube 1299-1 is now closed off by cam surface 1356 whereas compliant tube 1299-2 is no
longer closed off by cam surface 1355.
         [0320]      It is to be understood that, although cam 1297 is constructed in the present
embodiment to have three positions, namely, (i) a position in which both compliant tube 1299
1 and compliant tube 1299-2 are simultaneously pinched shut, (ii) a position in which
compliant tube 1299-1 is allowed to be open and compliant tube 1299-2 is pinched shut, and
(iii) a position in which compliant tube 1299-1 is pinched shut and compliant tube 1299-2 is
allowed to be open, cam 1297 may be constructed to have additional positions, such as a flush
position in which both compliant tube 1299-1 and compliant tube 1299-2 are allowed to be
open. In addition, device 1291 may be constructed so that each of compliant tubes 1299-1
and 1299-2 may not be limited to being placed only in either a fully opened state or a fully
closed state, but rather, may additionally be placed in a finite number or in an infinite number
(i.e. continuously adjustable) of partially opened states having flow rates varying by equal or
unequal increments between a fully opened state and a fully closed state.
         [0321]      Referring back now to Fig. 58(d), compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2 each
may be a generally tubular unitary member made of a flexible medical-grade silicone or a
                                                -71-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
similarly suitable material. Compliant tube 1299-1 may include a first end 1364 and a second
end 1365, and compliant tube 1299-2 may include a first end 1366 and a second end 1367.
First end 1364 of compliant tube 1299-1 may be coaxially mounted over post 135 1-1 and may
be secured thereto, for example, by an interference fit or other suitable means, and first end
1366 of compliant tube 1299-2 may be coaxially mounted over post 1351-2 and may be
secured thereto, for example, by an interference fit or other suitable means. In the above
manner, compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2 may be placed in fluid communication with the
interior of distal portion 1340 of hub 1295 and, thus, may be placed in fluid communication
with the interior of sheath 1303.
         [0322]     Second end 1365 of compliant tube 1299-1 may be coaxially inserted into a
first end 1368-1 of fluid connector 1301-1 and may be secured thereto, for example, by
adhesive or other suitable means, and second end 1367 of compliant tube 1299-2 may be
coaxially inserted into a first end 1368-2 of fluid connector 1301-2 and may be secured
thereto, for example, by adhesive or other suitable means.       A second end 1369-1 of fluid
connector 1301-1 may be in the shape of a female luer lock connector, and a second end
1369-2 of fluid connector 1301-2 may be in the shape of a female luer lock connector. One of
fluid connectors 1301-1 and 1301-2 may be connected to a male luer lock connector (not
shown) that, in turn, may be connected to a fluid source, and the other of fluid connectors
1301-1 and 1301-2 may be connected to a male luer lock connector (not shown) that, in turn,
may be connected to a drain. Consequently, one of compliant tubes 130 1-1 and 1301-2 may
be used to deliver fluid to a patient, and the other of compliant tubes 1301-1 and 1301-2 may
be used to drain fluid from the patient. Fluid connector 1301-1 may be further shaped to
include a flange 1370-1, and fluid connector 1301-2 may be further shaped to include a flange
1370-2. Flanges 1370-1 and 1370-2 may be appropriately dimensioned to mate with rib 1335
of housing half 1319 (see, for example, Figs. 60(a) and 60(b)) and with rib 1336 of housing
half 1320 (see, for example, Fig. 61(b)) to secure fluid connectors 1301-1 and 1301-2 to
housing 1293.
         [0323]     It is believed that, because compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2 may be
supported within the channels defined by ribs 1337 and 1338, compliant tubes 1299-1 and
1299-2 may be less likely to kink, particularly when subjected to the action of cam 1297.

         [0324]      The fluid flow rates for access device 1291 may be in the range of about 1
cc/min to about 1000 cc/min, preferably about 10 cc/min to about 500 cc/min, and more
preferably about 100 cc/min to about 300 cc/min, and the inlet pressure for access device
1291 may be in the range of, for example, 0.01 inH20 to 1000 inH20 (0.0254 cmH 20 to 2540
cmH20), preferably 1.0 inH20 to 100 inH20 (2.54 cmH20 to 254 cmH20), and more
preferably 20 inH20 to 50 inH20 (50.8 cmH 20 to 127 cmH20). The tubing inner diameter for
compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2 may be similar to that for tubes 909-1 and 909-2 of device
901.
         [0325]      Housing 1293 may be provided with markings similar to those discussed
above in connection with housing 903 for indicating the various positions in which handle
1363 of cam 1297 may be placed so that device 1291 may be used for filling, draining,
flushing, or the like.
         [0326]      Referring back now to Figs. 58(d), sheath 1303, valve assembly 1305, seal
1307, and protective sleeve 1315 may be identical to sheath 913, valve assembly 915, seal
917, and protective sleeve 925, respectively, of device 901.
         [0327]      Cap 1309, which may be shown separately in Figs. 68(a) through 68(c),
may be a unitary member structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or similarly
suitable material. Cap 1309 may comprise a proximal portion 1371 and a distal portion 1372,
each of which may be generally tubular in shape. Proximal portion 1371 and distal portion
1372 may be coaxial with one another, with proximal portion 1371 being comparatively larger
in diameter and with distal portion 1372 being comparatively smaller in diameter. Proximal
portion 1371 may include a proximal face 1373 and a distal face 1374. An opening 1375 may
be provided in proximal face 1373. Distal portion 1372 may include a proximal end 1376 and
a distal end 1377.     An annular wall 1378 may be provided within distal end 1377 of distal
portion 1372.     A circumferential rib 1379 may be provided around the exterior of distal
portion 137.     Rib 1379 may be used to provide an interference fit with a groove 1380
provided on the interior of hub 1295 (see Fig. 62(b)) so that cap 1309 may be joined to hub
1295.
         [0328]      The combination of obturator 1311 and obturator handle 1313 is shown in
Fig. 69.   As can be seen, obturator 1311 may be identical to obturator 921 of device 901.

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
Obturator handle 1313, which may be shown separately in Figs. 70(a) and 70(b), may be fixed
to obturator 1311 and may be shaped to include spring tabs 1382 that may be inserted through
opening 1325 of housing 1293 (see, for example, Figs. 60(b) and 61(b)) and then locked in
place within housing 1293 by being rotated approximately 90 degrees against a cam 1381
(see, for example, Figs. 60(b) and 61(b)). Such locking of obturator handle 1313 to housing
1293 may prevent undesired proximal movement of obturator 1311 relative to housing 1293
as obturator 1311 is being inserted into a patient. After access device 1291 has been properly
placed in a patient, obturator 1311 may be removed from the remainder of access device 1291
by rotating obturator handle 1313 counterclockwise until spring tabs 1382 are no longer
engaged by cam 1381, thereby enabling obturator handle 1313 to be withdrawn from housing
1293.
          [0329]    Referring now to Figs. 71(a) and 71(b), there are shown various views of a
first alternate obturator handle 1383 to obturator handle 1313.    Obturator handle 1383 may
differ from obturator handle 1313 in that obturator handle 1383 may include threaded tabs
1383-1 and 1383-2, as opposed to spring tabs 1382. Handle 1383 may be particularly well
suited for use with a housing having a complementarily threaded proximal opening. (See, for
example, Fig. 72, which shows left housing half 1384 with a threaded proximal opening 1384
1.)   Handle 1383 may also differ from handle 1313 in that handle 1383 may be shaped to
include a large pocket 1383-3 and inner pockets 1383-4 and 1383-5.        Large pocket 1383-3
may have a uniform wall thickness, for example, to facilitate its manufacture by injection
molding. Inner pockets 1383-4 and 1383-5 may have a reduced wall thickness, for example,
to enable better securing of obturator 1311 to obturator handle 1383, for example, by
welding.
          [0330]    Referring now to Fig. 73, there is shown the combination of sheath 1303,
protective sleeve 1315, and slide ring assembly 1317. Slide ring assembly 1317 may comprise
an inner member 1385, an outer member 1386, and an O-ring 1387. Inner member 1385,
which may be a unitary structure, preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a
similarly suitable material, may comprise a tubular portion 1388.      A circumferential notch
1389 may be provided in tubular portion 1388 near a proximal end 1388-1 of tubular portion
1388. Notch 1389 may be used to matingly receive a pair of deflectable fins 1390 provided

on the interior of housing 1293 and spaced proximally a short distance from opening 1326
(see, for example, Fig. 74).    The mating of fins 1390 to notch 1389 may be used to limit
proximal movement of inner member 1385 and to provide a tactile indication to a user that
inner member 1385 has been moved fully to its proximal position. A plurality of angularly
deflectable legs 1391 may be spaced around the periphery of tubular portion 1388 and may
extend distally a short distance therefrom. Legs 1391, which may be biased radially inwardly,
may be appropriately configured and dimensioned to ride within grooves 1392 of sheath 1303
and, in so doing, may constrain rotational movement of inner member 1385 relative to sheath
1303 (see, for example, Fig. 75).
        [0331]      An end 1315-1 of sleeve 1315 may be inserted coaxially over tubular
portion 1388 of inner member 1385 and may be secured thereto by O-ring 1387.             Outer
member 1386, which may be a generally tubular unitary member made of a soft or
compressible medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material, may be coaxially and
fixedly mounted over O-ring 1387 and inner member 1385. Outer member 1386, which may
be shaped to minimize irritation of a patient, may include a distal flange 1393, which may be
used to move slide ring assembly 1317 proximally relative to sheath 1313.
        [0332]      Access device 1291 may have an overall length in the range of about 0.001
inch to about 20 inches, preferably about 0.1 inch to about 10 inches, more preferably about 1
inch to about 6 inches.
        [0333]      Access device 1291 may be used in a manner similar to that discussed
above for access device 13. For example, for trans-urethral access to a female human urinary
bladder, cam 1297 may be switched to its closed position (as in Fig. 58(a)), i.e., so that both
compliant tubes 1299-1 and 1299-2 may be pinched shut, and the distal end of obturator 1311
may be aligned with and inserted into the patient. As access device 1291 may continue to be
inserted into the patient, the meatus of the patient may cause slide ring assembly 1317 to be
slid proximally, thereby causing the portion of sleeve 1315 that is disposed within obturator
1311 to be removed therefrom and to be everted over the exterior of sheath 1303, thereby
providing a barrier between the patient's urethra and sheath 1303. Further insertion of access
device 1291 into the patient may cause inner member 1385 of slide ring assembly 1317 to be
slid proximally until it lockably engages fins 1390.     With slide ring assembly 1317 thus
                                              -75-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
engaged with fins 1390, the distal end of access device 1291 should be located in the bladder
of the patient. Confirmation of such placement may be noted by the proximal flow of urine
through an opening in obturator handle 1313. Obturator 1311 may then be removed from the
patient by rotating obturator handle 1313 until it disengages from cam 1381 and then by
withdrawing proximally the combination of obturator handle 1313 and obturator 1311 from
the remainder of access device 1291.      With obturator 1311 thus removed, the remaining
implanted portion of access device 1291 may provide a conduit through which medical
devices, such as delivery device 15, pressure-attenuating device 17, and removal device 19,
may be delivered to the bladder. If desired, fluid may be delivered to or drained from the
bladder by switching cam 1297 from its closed position to one of its open positions (see Figs.
64 and 65), whereby compliant tube 1299-1 is pinched shut and compliant tube 1299-2 is
allowed to be open or vice versa.
         [0334]    Referring now to Fig. 76, there is shown a perspective view of a first
alternate cam 1395 for use in device 1291. Cam 1395 may differ from cam 1297 in that cam
1395 may have a longer ramp portion 1396 than that of cam 1297. In this manner, cam 1395
may be used to provide one or more states of partial patency. Additionally, the shape of the
cam allows the body of the shell (or housing containing the cam/tubes/hub/sheath) to be
narrower than if a constant radius arc (or circle) were used.      The variable radius that is
imparted onto the two cam surfaces (relative to the axis of rotation) can provide beneficial
changes in force throughout the rotational travel of the lever or user interface (i.e., higher
ramp force, when the cam surface is transitioning from smaller radius to larger radius).
         [0335]    Referring now to Figs. 77(a) and 77(b), there are shown perspective and
partly exploded perspective views, respectively, of a second alternate cam 1397. Cam 1397
may include a first cam surface 1398-1 and a second cam surface 1398-2, each of which may
be capable of being operated independently of the other. Such independent operation may be
enabled by removing a block 1399 that may be used to couple handles 1400-1 and 1400-2 for
rotating surfaces 1398-1 and 1398-2, respectively. By independently operating cam surfaces
1398-1 and 1398-2, it may be possible for device 1291 to be used for "fill," "drain," "flush,"
and "off' functions.

Delivery Device
         [0336]     A delivery device may be inserted through the passageway created by the
access device. The delivery device may be used to deliver a pressure-attenuating device to the
body, such as to the bladder. The delivery device may deliver the pressure-attenuating device
in a compacted state which may then be inflated and released. The steps of inflation and/or
release may be performed by the delivery device.     The delivery device can include a delivery
tube, an inflation tube, a connection to inflation media and a release mechanism, among other
features.
         [0337]     Certain embodiments of a delivery device are described in U.S. Patent
Application Publication No. 2010/0222802, incorporated by reference herein.            See for
example: Figs. 6-18H, and the accompanying discussion, including at paragraphs [0153]
[0206]. Embodiments of a delivery device are also provided in U.S. Patent No. 6,976,950,
incorporated by reference herein. See for example: Figs. 6-1 1A, 34A-35B and 48A-48D, and
the accompanying discussion, including at columns 13-16, and 35.
         [0338]     Referring now to Figs. 78(a), 78(b), 79, and 80, delivery device 15 may
comprise a housing 1401.      Housing 1401, in turn, may comprise a pair of complementary
housing halves 1403-1 and 1403-2, housing half 1403-1 also being shown separately in Figs.
8 1(a) and 8 1(b) and housing half 1403-2 also being shown separately in Figs. 82(a) and 82(b).
Each of housing halves 1403-1 and 1403-2 may comprise a unitary structure preferably made
of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Housing halves 1403-1 and
1403-2, which may be aligned with one another by pins 1405 extending from half 1403-1 and
complementary sockets 1407 provided in half 1403-2, may be secured to one another by
suitable means, such as by adhesive or by ultrasonic welding. Halves 1403-1 and 1403-2 may
be appropriately shaped to jointly define a generally hollow, gun-shaped structure comprising
a barrel portion 1409 and a handle portion 1411.
         [0339]     The housing 1401 may include one or more openings at the proximal end.
The housing 1401 may be shaped to include a first opening 1413 at a proximal end 1415 of
barrel portion 1409, a second opening 1417 spaced inwardly a short distance from first
opening 1413, and a third opening 1419 at a distal end 1421 of barrel portion 1409. For
reasons to become apparent below, first opening 1413 may be of greater diameter than second
                                               -77-

 WO 2014/026028                                                        PCT/US2013/054185
opening 1417, and each of openings 1413 and 1417 may be angled downwardly slightly
relative to the longitudinal axis of barrel portion 1409, with opening 1417 being angled
downwardly to a greater extent than is opening 1415.
        [0340]      Delivery device 15 may further comprise a fluid connector 1423 (see Figs.
79-80). Connector 1423, shown separately in Fig. 83, may be disposed within housing 1401
and may be fixedly mounted on a pair of supports 1425-1 and 1427-1 formed on half 1403-2.
(Complementary supports 1425-2 and 1427-2 on half 1403-1 may be provided to furnish
additional support to connector 1423.) The connector can receive one, two, or more lines in
and can have one line out. Connector 1423, which may be a unitary structure preferably made
from a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material, may be shaped to include
a proximal portion 1426 of comparatively greater width and a distal portion 1428 of
comparatively lesser width. A pair of fluid channels 1429-1 and 1429-2 may be provided in
proximal portion 1426 and may extend in a generally parallel fashion distally from a proximal
end 1431 of proximal portion 1426. A fluid channel 1433 may be provided in distal portion
1428 and may extend proximally from a distal end 1435 of distal portion 1428. The distal
ends of channels 1429-1 and 1429-2 may be joined to the proximal end of channel 1433 such
that each of channels 1429-1 and 1429-2 may be in fluid communication with channel 1433.
        [0341]      Delivery device 15 may further comprise a pair of connectors and/or check
valves 1441 and 1443 (Figs. 79-80). The connectors and/or check valves can be identical or
different.  Though the connectors and/or check valves will be described generally as check
valves, it will be understood that a check valve is not required. Check valve 1441, shown in
Fig. 84, may be disposed within barrel portion 1409 and may be fixedly mounted on a pair of
supports 1445-1 and 1447-1 formed on half 1403-2. (Complementary supports 1445-2 and
1447-2 on half 1403-1 may be provided to furnish additional support to valve 1441.) Valve
1441, which may be made, for example, of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly
suitable material, may comprise a proximal end 1449 and a distal end 1451.       Proximal end
1449, which may be in the shape of a female luer connector, may be oriented coaxially with
opening 1413 but spaced distally a short distance therefrom. Distal end 1451 may be fluidly
connected to fluid channel 1429-1 of connector 1423 by a fluid line 1453. Check valve 1443
may be disposed within barrel portion 1409 and may be fixedly mounted on a pair of supports
                                             -78-

 WO 2014/026028                                                            PCT/US2013/054185
1455-1 and 1457-1 formed on half 1403-2. (Complementary supports 1455-2 and 1457-2 on
half 1403-1 may be provided to furnish additional support to valve 1443.) Valve 1443 may
comprise a proximal end 1459 and a distal end 1461.         Proximal end 1459 may be oriented
coaxially with opening 1417 but spaced distally a short distance therefrom. Distal end 1461
may be fluidly connected to fluid channel 1429-2 of connector 1423 by a fluid line 1463.
        [0342]       Delivery device 15 may further comprise an inflation tube 1471 (Figs. 79
80). Tube 1471, which is also shown separately in Fig. 85, may be a unitary structure
preferably made of a medical-grade stainless steel or a similarly suitable material. Tube 1471
may comprise a circular side wall 1473 defining a proximal end 1475, a distal end 1477, and a
longitudinal channel 1479 extending from proximal end 1475 to distal end 1477. Proximal
end 1475 of tube 1471 may be fixedly mounted within channel 1433 of connector 1423 in
such a way that channels 1433 and 1479 are aligned and in fluid communication with one
another.   The remainder of tube 1471 may extend distally from connector 1423 through
opening 1419 of housing 1401, with distal end 1477 of tube 1471 being positioned a distance,
e.g., several inches, from distal end 1421 of housing 1401.        As will be discussed further
below, distal end 1477 of inflation tube 1471 may be inserted into pressure-attenuating device
17 for use in inflating device 17; therefore, inflation tube 1471, or at least the distal end, may
have an outer diameter that is appropriately dimensioned for this purpose.
        [0343]       It should be understood that, although inflation tube 1471 of the present
embodiment has a single channel 1479, inflation tube 1471 could have two or more such
channels, with said two or more channels being fluidly coupled to channel                    1433.
Alternatively, one or more of such channels could be fluidly coupled to connector and/or
check valve 1441, and one or more of such channels could be fluidly coupled to connector
and/or check valve 1443.        In this manner, for example, the materials passing through
connector and/or check valve 1441 could be conducted to one of said two or more channels,
and the materials passing through connector and/or check valve 1443 could be conducted to
another of said two or more channels.
        [0344]       Delivery device 15 may further comprise a carriage 1491 and a decoupling
or push-off member 1521 (Figs. 79-80).           These components can be part of a release
mechanism used to decouple the inflated implant from the inflation tube 1471 as will be
                                               -79-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
described below.    Carriage 1491, shown in Figs. 86(a) through 86(e), may be a unitary
structure preferably made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material.
Carriage 1491 may be shaped to comprise a top 1493, a bottom 1495, a left side 1497, a right
side 1499, a proximal end 1501, and a distal end 1503. There may be one or more slots and
complimentary protrusions or ribs on either the carriage or the housing. For example, left side
1497 may be shaped to include a longitudinal slot 1505, and right side 1499 may be shaped to
include a similar longitudinal slot 1507.    Slot 1505 may be appropriately dimensioned to
permit carriage 1491 to slide on a complementarily shaped rib 1506 formed on half 1403-2
and extending in the direction of the longitudinal axis of barrel portion 1409. Slot 1507 may
be appropriately dimensioned to permit carriage 1491 to slide on a corresponding rib 1508
formed on half 1403-1. Left side 1497 may additionally be shaped to include a post 1509
extending towards half 1403-1, the purpose of post 1509 to become apparent below.
Carriage 1491 may be additionally shaped to include a longitudinal channel 1511 extending
from proximal end 1501 to distal end 1503. Longitudinal channel 1511 may be aligned with
and may be appropriately dimensioned relative to inflation tube 1471 such that carriage 1491
may be permitted to ride freely along a portion of inflation tube 1471. For reasons to become
apparent below, channel 1511 may include a proximal portion 1511-1 of comparatively lesser
diameter and a distal portion 1511-2 of comparatively greater diameter.
         [0345]    Push-off member 1521, shown in Fig. 87, may comprise a unitary structure
preferably made of a medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Push-off member
1521 may comprise a tube with a circular side wall 1523 defining a proximal end 1525, a
distal end 1527, and a longitudinal channel 1529 extending from proximal end 1525 to distal
end 1527. Proximal end 1525 of push-off member 1521 may be fixedly mounted by glue or
other suitable means within distal portion 1511-2 of channel 1511, with the remainder of
push-off member 1521 extending distally from carriage 1491 and through opening 1419 of
housing 1401. Member 1521 may be mounted coaxially around tube 1471, and the inner
diameter of push-off member 1521 may be sufficiently larger than the outer diameter of tube
1471 to permit member 1521 to slide freely over tube 1471. Push-off member 1521 may have
a length such that, when push-off member 1521 is positioned in its most proximal position,
distal end 1527 of push-off member 1521 may be positioned sufficiently proximal to distal end
                                              -80-

  WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
1477 of tube 1471 so as not to interfere with the coupling of tube 1471 to a pressure
attenuating device 17 mounted thereon, and such that, when push-off member 1521 is
positioned in its most distal position, distal end 1527 of tube may be positioned sufficiently
distal to distal end 1477 of tube 1471 so as to cause tube 1471 to be physically decoupled
from a pressure-attenuating device 17 mounted thereon. Although distal end 1527 has been
shown herein as having a straight end, it should be understood that distal end 1527 could
alternatively be shaped so as to be biased towards the outer diameter of push-off member
1521 to minimize the possibility of skiving against device 17 as it approaches the pushing-off
surface of device 17.
         [0346]      Also, it is to be understood that, although inflation tube 1471 has been
described herein as being fixed to housing 1401 and push-off member 1521 has been described
herein as sliding relative both to tube 1471 and to housing 1401, both tube 1471 and push-off
member 1521 could be slidably mounted relative to housing 1401, or tube 1521 could be fixed
relative to housing 1401 and tube 1471 could be slidably mounted relative to housing 1401. It
is also to be understood that, although push-off member 1521 has been described herein as
being tubular in shape, push-off member 1521 could be a non-tubular member.
         [0347]      Delivery device 15 may further comprise a trigger 1541 (Figs. 79-80).
Trigger 1541, shown in Figs. 88(a) and 88(b), may comprise a unitary structure preferably
made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Trigger 1541 may be
an elongated member that may be shaped to include a left side 1543, a right side 1545, a
proximal end 1547, a distal end 1549, a top 1551, and a bottom 1553. Trigger 1541 may be
partially inserted into barrel portion 1409 of housing 1401 through an opening 1542 provided
in housing 1401 and may be mounted for pivotal movement using a pair of posts 1555-1 and
1555-2 formed on housing halves 1403-1 and 1403-2, respectively, and extending through a
transverse opening 1557 in trigger 1541.      For reasons to become apparent below, left side
1543 may be shaped to include a post 1559 extending in the direction of housing half 1403-1.
Proximal end 1547 of trigger 1541 may be shaped to include a tab 1561 that may extend
proximally at an angle for a short distance. Tab 1561 may have a beveled surface 1563 that
may permit tab 1561 to slide across a rib 1564 extending from housing 1403-2 as trigger 1541
completes its trigger stroke (i.e., as trigger 1541 pivots clockwise) but that, thereafter,
                                               -81-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
prevents tab 1561 from returning to its original position by sliding back across rib 1564 (i.e.,
as trigger 1541 pivots counterclockwise).       In this manner, tab 1561 and rib 1564 may
effectively prevent the return of trigger 1541 to its original position after being actuated,
thereby ensuring that trigger 1541 is squeezed only once. As tab 1561 slides across rib 1564,
an audible click may be produced, which may be desirable in notifying an operator of device
15 that trigger 1541 has completed its clockwise trigger stroke. (As will be discussed further
below, the squeezing of trigger 1541 is used to release an inflated pressure-attenuating device
17 from delivery device 15. Therefore, the audible click produced by tab 1561 sliding across
rib 1564 may signal to a user that pressure-attenuating device 17 has been released from
delivery device 15.)
         [0348]      Delivery device 15 may further comprise a linkage 1571 (Figs. 79-80).
Linkage 1571, shown in Figs. 89(a) and 89(b), may comprise a unitary structure preferably
made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Linkage 1571 may be
an elongated member of generally oval-shape in transverse cross-section comprising a pair of
transverse openings 1573 and 1575.       Opening 1573 may be appropriately dimensioned to
receive post 1509 of carriage 1491, and opening 1575 may be appropriately dimensioned to
receive post 1559 of trigger 1541.     In this manner, by inserting posts 1509 and 1559 into
openings 1573 and 1575, respectively, linkage 1571 may be used to mechanically couple
trigger 1541 and carriage 1491 such that the squeezing of trigger 1541 causes carriage 1491
to be slid from its most proximal position to its most distal position. Consequently, because
push-off member 1521 may be mechanically coupled to carriage 1491 in the manner described
above, the squeezing of trigger 1541 may cause push-off member 1521 to be moved from its
most proximal position to its most distal position. The trigger 1541 and the linkage 1571 can
be part of the release mechanism. In some embodiments, the trigger 1541 can engage one or
more of the cartridge and the push-off member directly with or without some of the
intermediate components.
         [0349]      Delivery device 15 may further comprise a safety 1591 (Figs. 79-80).
Safety 1591, shown in Fig. 90, can effectively prevent actuation of the trigger. Safety 1591
may comprise a unitary structure preferably made of a medical-grade polymer or a similarly
suitable material. Safety 1591 may be an elongated member shaped to include a top surface
                                              -82-

1593 and a bottom surface 1595. A pair of spaced-apart, wedge-shaped cuts 1601 and 1603
may be provided in safety 1591, cuts 1601 and 1603 extending from bottom surface 1595
towards, but not completely to, top surface 1593. Cuts 1601 and 1603 may define a proximal
segment 1605, an intermediate segment 1607, and a distal segment 1609, with proximal
segment 1605 and intermediate segment 1607 being interconnected by a bridge 1611 and with
intermediate segment 1607 and distal segment 1609 being interconnected by a bridge 1613.
Proximal segment 1605 may include a proximal end 1615 that may be circular in longitudinal
cross-section.   End 1615 may be shaped to include a transverse opening 1617 that may be
appropriately dimensioned to receive a pair of posts 1619 and 1621 formed on housing halves
1403-1 and 1403-2, respectively. Distal segment 1609 may include a distal end 1623 that may
be circular in longitudinal cross-section. End 1623 may be appropriately dimensioned to be
received within a recess 1625 provided in trigger 1541. In this manner, safety 1591 may be
coupled at one end to housing 1401 by virtue of the engagement of posts 1619 and 1621 with
opening 1617, and safety 1591 may be coupled at the opposite end to trigger 1541 by virtue
of the engagement of end 1623 with recess 1625, with an intermediate length of safety 1591
extending through an opening 1626 in handle portion 1411 of housing 1401.
        [0350]      As can be seen best in Figs. 9 1(a) and 9 1(b), because of the construction of
safety 1591 and because of the manner in which safety 1591 may be coupled to housing 1401
and to trigger 1541, safety 1591 may assume either a locked state or an unlocked state. When
in such a locked state, which is shown, for example, in Fig. 91(a), proximal segment 1605 is
bent downwardly at bridge 1611 relative to intermediate segment 1607, and distal segment
1609 is bent downwardly at bridge 1613 relative to intermediate segment 1607. In this state,
compressive pressure applied to safety 1591 at ends 1615 and 1623, such as by applying a
squeezing force to trigger 1541, cannot readily cause ends 1615 and 1623 to be drawn
appreciably closer to one another; thus, trigger 1541 is effectively prevented from being
actuated. By contrast, as seen in Fig. 91(b), when proximal segment 1605 is bent upwardly at
bridge 1611 and when distal segment 1609 is bent upwardly at bridge 1613, compressive
pressure applied to safety 1591 at ends 1615 and 1623, such as by applying a squeezing force
to trigger 1541, causes ends 1615 and 1623 to be drawn considerably closer to one another as
safety 1591 bends at bridge 1611, thereby enabling trigger 1541 to be actuated. Moreover,

safety 1591 may be transformed from its locked state to its unlocked state simply by applying
sufficient force to the top surface of intermediate segment 1607 to cause proximal segment
1605 and distal segment 1609 to pivot about bridges 1611 and 1613, respectively. Such force
may be provided, for example, using the index finger or thumb of the hand used to grip trigger
1541. The safety can be an ambidextrous safety.
         [0351]     Delivery device 15 may further comprise a window catheter 1641 (Figs.
79-80).    Catheter 1641, which is also shown separately in Figs. 92(a) through 92(c), may
comprise a unitary structure preferably made of a medical-grade polymer or a similarly
suitable material having columnar strength with some angular flexibility. Though illustrated as
a separate piece from the housing 1401, it will be understood that the window catheter 1641
can be part of housing and may be made integral with one or more of the other housing
components or parts.       Catheter 1641 may comprise a side wall 1643 defining an open
proximal end 1645, a closed distal end 1647, a channel 1649 extending longitudinally from
open proximal end 1645 up to closed distal end 1647, and a window 1651 spaced a short
distance from distal end 1647 and providing top access to channel 1649 through side wall
1643.    The closed distal end 1647 can be an atraumatic end or shape, such as a rounded or
hemispherical end.    Proximal end 1645 of catheter 1641 may have an enlarged profile relative
to the remainder of catheter 1641, which can be generally circular in transverse cross-section
for most of its length.    The enlarged cross section can be may be generally rectangular in
transverse cross-section.   This enlarged proximal end 1645 of catheter 1641 may be fixedly
mounted within barrel portion 1409 of housing 1401 and may be disposed on a support 1653
formed on half 1403-2, with the remainder of catheter 1641 extending distally through
opening 1419 in housing 1401 and continuing distally for several inches. (A complementary
support 1655 on half 1403-1 may be provided to furnish additional support to end 1645.)
Inflation tube 1471 and push-off member 1521 may be coaxially received within channel 1649
(with inflation tube 1471 also being coaxially received within push-off member 1521), with
channel 1649 having a sufficiently large diameter to permit push-off member 1521 to slide
freely therewithin.
         [0352]     As will be discussed further below, pressure-attenuating device 17 may be
disposed at least partially within channel 1649 during the insertion of device 15 into a desired
                                              -84-

anatomical structure of a patient and during inflation of pressure-attenuating device 17.
Pressure-attenuating device 17 may be released from channel 1649 through window 1651
when deployment of device 17 is desired. Accordingly, window 1651 may be appropriately
shaped to promote retention of pressure-attenuating device 17 within channel 1649 during the
aforementioned insertion and inflation steps and to promote release of pressure-attenuating
device 17 from channel 1649 through window 1651 when deployment is desired. To this end,
in the present embodiment, window 1651 may be shaped to include a proximal portion 1652
1, a distal portion 1652-2, and an intermediate portion 1652-3. Proximal portion 1652-1 and
distal portion 1652-2 may be substantially similar to one another and may be comparatively
narrower and comparatively shallower than intermediate portion 1652-3, with intermediate
portion 1652-3 transitioning from the width and depth of proximal portion 1652-1 and distal
portion 1652-2 to a maximum width and depth between proximal portion 1652-1 and distal
portion 1652-2. Each of window 1651 and catheter 1641 may be appropriately dimensioned
in length so that the distal end 1477 of inflation tube 1471 may be approximately aligned with
the transition in window 1651 from proximal portion 1652-1 to intermediate portion 1652-3.
Moreover, each of window 1651 and catheter 1641 may be appropriately dimensioned in
length so that, when push-off member 1521 is in its most distal position, the distal end 1527 of
push-off member 1521 may be approximately aligned with the midpoint of intermediate
portion 1652-3 of window 1651.
         [0353]     The cross section of catheter 1641 at the proximal portion of the window
1652-1 has an opening between 1 and 270 degrees, more preferably between 20 and 180
degrees, more preferably between 50 and 120 degrees, and more preferably approximately 95
degrees. The cross section of catheter 1641 at the middle portion of the window 1652-2 has
an opening between 1 and 270 degrees, more preferably between 20 and 180 degrees, more
preferably between 50 and 180 degrees, and more preferably approximately 151 degrees.
The cross section of catheter 1641 at the distal portion of the window 1652-3 has an opening
between 1 and 270 degrees, more preferably between 20 and 180 degrees, more preferably
between 50 and 120 degrees, and more preferably approximately 102 degrees.
         [0354]     Figure 92(d) illustrates an embodiment in which catheter 1641 includes a
feature 1647-1 intended to manipulate the holding force and radial expansion force of the
                                                -85-

 WO 2014/026028                                                            PCT/US2013/054185
delivery system on an attenuator via spring-like compliance . A feature, such as 1647-1, may
provide an advantageous force balance between retention force during the aforementioned
insertion, and resistance to radial expansion during inflation steps to promote release of
pressure-attenuating device 17 from channel 1649 through window 1652 when deployment is
desired.     In some embodiments, the distal end 1647 of catheter 1641 comprises a slit or cut
1647-1. The slit or cut 1647-1 may improve compliance of catheter 1641 without altering the
material geometry of the catheter 1641, or geometry of window 1652. For example, small
cuts or slits 1647-1 may improve the inflation and/or deployment of pressure-attenuating
device 17 by reducing a restraining and radial expansion force of the catheter 1641 on the
attenuator. Figure 92(e) shows a top view of a catheter 1641 having a window 1652 and a
cut or slit 1647-1 at the distal end 1647 of catheter 1641.
         [0355]     In some embodiments, slit 1647-1 has a length within a range of from
about 0.010 inches (in.) to about 1.000 in., while in other embodiments this length is from
about 0.015 in. to about 0.500 in. In some embodiments, the slit 1647-1 may have a length of
about 0.25 in., about 0.20 in., or about 0.15 in. Slit 1647-1 may also comprise other lengths.
In some embodiments, slit 1647-1 comprises a width less than about 0.200 in., such as less
than about 0.125 in., and in some cases less than about 0.025 in.           Slit 1647-1 may also
comprise other widths.
         [0356]     The distal end 1647 of catheter 1641 may comprise an opening or hole
1647-2. For example, Figure 92(f) shows a catheter 1641 having both a cut or slit 1647-1 and
an opening 1647-2 at the distal end 1647 of the catheter 1641. In some embodiments, the
opening 1647-2 may enable a reduced restraining force, reduced radial expansion force, and
or increased flexibility during inflation of pressure-attenuating device 17 stored within catheter
1641. In some embodiments, the distal end 1647 comprises a chamfer, for example suitable
for facilitating catheter 1641 placement.      The chamfer provides a gradual widening in the
width of the distal end 1647 to facilitate atraumatic advancement. Figure 92(g) shows a top
view of a catheter 1641 having both a slit 1647-1 and an opening 1647-2 at the distal end
1647 of catheter 1641.       By providing the opening 1647-2, in the event of an improperly
inflated or incomplete release of a device, the device can be manipulated into opening 1647-2
during the delivery devices retraction into or during the advancement of an over lying sheath,

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
cover, or member to promote the tensile release of the device in the coaxial direction of
catheter 1641.
          [0357]    In some embodiments, the opening 1647-2 comprises a circular or
substantially circular shape. For example, a circular opening 1647-2 can comprise a diameter
within the range of from about 0.010 in. to about 0.250 in., such as from about 0.025 in. to
about 0.200 in., and including from about 0.050 in. to about 0.150 in. Opening 1647-2 may
comprise other shapes and/or sizes.
          [0358]    Referring to Figure 92(h), in some embodiments, catheter 1641 has a slit
1647-1 and a circular or substantially circular opening 1647-2 that comprises a substantially
continuous slot 1647-3. Figure 92(i) shows a top view of a catheter 1641 having both a slit
1647-1 and a circular or substantially circular opening 1647-2 at the distal end 1647 of
catheter 1641, where the slit 1647-1 and the opening 1647-2 comprise a substantially
continuous slot 1647-3.     This arrangement may enable a reduced restraining force, reduced
radial expansion force, and or increased flexibility during inflation of pressure-attenuating
device 17 stored within catheter 1641. In addition, this arrangement provides a continuously
open area connecting the opening 1652 and the opening 1647-2 so that in the event of an
improperly inflated or incomplete release of a device, the device can be easily manipulated into
opening 1647-2 during the delivery devices retraction into or during the advancement of an
over lying sheath, cover, or member to promote the tensile release of the device in the coaxial
direction of catheter 1641.
          [0359]    Referring to Figure 92(j), a distance D between the distal end 1647 and a
distal portion 1652-2 of window 1652 may be varied. A position of the window 1652 of the
catheter 1641, for example a position relative to the distal end 1647 of the catheter 1641, may
facilitate proper deployment of pressure-attenuating device 17. In some embodiments, the
catheter 1641 having a window 1652 positioned a distance D from the distal end 1647 of
catheter 1641 facilitates storage of pressure-attenuating device 17, for example during
shipping and handling, and enables proper deployment of pressure-attenuating device 17 from
the catheter 1641 into a patient. Figure 92(j) shows a cross-sectional view of catheter 1641
having no opening 1647-2, the catheter 1641 having a distance D between a distal portion
1652-2 of window 1652 and the distal end 1647. In some embodiments, the distance D
                                               -87-

  WO 2014/026028                                                        PCT/US2013/054185
comprises a value less than about 0.500 in., such as less than about 0.250 in., and in some
cases less than about 0.150 in.
         [0360]    Figure 92(k) shows a cross-sectional view of catheter 1641 comprising an
opening 1647-2, the catheter 1641 having a distance D1 between a distal portion 1652-2 of
window 1652 and the distal end 1647. This variation may have the same dimensions as D set
forth above, but provides the advantage that if an attenuator is fully advanced within the
catheter 1641 there will be no contact between the device 17 disposed within the catheter
1641 and the area of the opening 1647-2. This may reduce restraining force in that region.
Additionally, compared to the embodiment of Figure 92(j), a smaller arcuate zone of contact
is provided between the central longitudinal axis of the catheter 1641 and the opening 1652.
The angle between the uppermost edge of the circumference of the opening 1647-2 and the
distal-most edge of the opening 1652 may be less than 45 degrees, e.g., less than about 30
degrees, and in some cases 15 degrees or less. This reduces the amount of overhang between
the inner surface of the distal end and the opening 1652 to reduce the restraining force at the
distal end.
         [0361]    Figure 92(1) shows a cross-sectional view of catheter 1641 having no
opening 1647-2, the catheter 1641 having a reduced distance D2 between a distal portion
1652-2 of window 1652 and the distal end 1647. In this embodiment, there is very little and
in some modified embodiments there is no overhang between the distal inner surface of the
catheter 1641 and the opening 1652 because the opening extends to the end of the catheter
1641.
         [0362]    Delivery device 15 may further comprise a sealing ring 1661. Ring 1661,
which is also shown separately in Fig. 93, may comprise a unitary structure preferably made of
a medical-grade silicone or a similarly suitable material. Ring 1661 may be coaxially mounted
over push-off member 1521 and may be fixedly mounted within barrel portion 1409 of
housing 1401, with ring 1661 being sandwiched between proximal end 1645 of catheter 1641
and complementary supports 1663 and 1665 formed on housing halves 1403-1 and 1403-2,
respectively. Ring 1661 may be appropriately dimensioned to provide a fluid-tight seal with
proximal end 1645 of catheter 1641 so that any fluids entering catheter 1641 through window
1651 do not leak from proximal end 1645.

 WO 2014/026028                                                       PCT/US2013/054185
         [0363]     One or more syringes can be connected to or be part of the delivery device
15 (Figs. 79-80). First syringe 1671, shown in Fig. 94, may comprise a tubular body 1675
containing a desired quantity of a first inflation medium 1677 for use in inflating pressure
attenuating device 17, a piston 1679 slidably mounted in body 1675, and a male luer
connector 1681. Body 1675 may be appropriately sized for insertion into opening 1417, and
connector 1681 may be appropriately sized for mating with proximal end 1459 of valve 1443.
In the present embodiment, inflation medium 1677 may be a fluid and more specifically may
be one or more high vapor pressure media that may serve as a pressure regulator to help keep
device 17 inflated. The one or more high vapor pressure media may be, for example, one or
more liquid perfluorocarbons (PFCs), preferably one or more liquid PFCs having a vapor
pressure greater than 50 Pa.      (The one or more liquid perfluorocarbons may sometimes
alternatively be referred to herein as "AIRLOC@.")       The one or more liquid PFCs may
comprise a perfluorinated heptane, a perfluorinated octane, or one or more combinations
thereof    Preferably, the one or more liquid PFCs are a mixture of perfluoroheptane and
perfluorooctane. Such a mixture can range from about 0.05 mole fraction of perfluoroheptane
and about     0.95 mole fraction of perfluorooctane      to about 0.95 mole fraction of
perfluoroheptane and about 0.05 mole fraction of perfluorooctane, more preferably can range
from about 0.2730 mole fraction of perfluoroheptane and about 0.7270 mole fraction of
perfluorooctane to about 0.7270 mole fraction of perfluoroheptane and about 0.2730 mole
fraction of perfluorooctane, even more preferably can range from about 0.3640 mole fraction
of perfluoroheptane and about 0.6360 mole fraction of perfluorooctane to about 0.5450 mole
fraction of perfluoroheptane and about 0.4550 mole fraction of perfluorooctane.        In one
particular embodiment, the mixture includes about 0.4548 mole fraction of perfluoroheptane
and about 0.5452 mole fraction of perfluorooctane.       For example, about 25 ml of this
perfluorocarbon    mixture   can be   manufactured    by  mixing about     18.336   grams   of
perfluoroheptane with about 24.8099 grams of perfluorooctane.
         [0364]     Delivery device 15 may further comprise a second syringe 1691.     Second
syringe 1691, which is also shown separately in Fig. 95, may comprise a tubular body 1693
containing a desired quantity of a second inflation medium 1695 for use in inflating pressure
attenuating device 17, a piston 1697 slidably mounted in body 1693, and a male luer
                                              -89-

connector 1699. Body 1693 may be appropriately sized for insertion into opening 1413, and
connector 1699 may be appropriately sized for mating with proximal end 1449 of valve 1441.
In the present embodiment, medium 1695 may be a fluid and more specifically may be a gas,
such as air. Where, for example, one or more PFCs are used as inflation medium 1677, and
air is used as inflation medium 1695, the relative volumes of the one or more PFCs to air may
range, for example, from about 1 (PFC(s)): 1000(air) to about 1(PFC(s)): 1(air). In addition,
where, for example, pressure-attenuating device 17 is appropriately dimensioned for use in the
human bladder, syringe 1691 may contain approximately 25-30 cc of air.
         [0365]      Preferably, the respective quantities of first medium 1677 disposed within
body 1675 of syringe 1671 and second medium 1695 disposed within body 1693 of syringe
1691 are sufficient to inflate pressure-attenuating device 17 to a desired extent, taking into
account the fact that the total volume of one or both fluid media may not be transferred
entirely from syringes 1671 and 1691 to device 17, but rather, that a portion of the volume of
one or both inflation media may be left behind in the fluid passageways extending from check
valves 1443 and 1441 to distal end 1477 of inflation tube 1471. For example, the amount of
first medium 1677 present within device 17 can range from about 0.01-1 liter, preferably from
about 0.1 to 30 ml, more preferably from about 0.2 to 10 ml. Therefore, to determine the
amount of first medium 1677 that should be loaded into syringe 1671, the amount of first
medium 1677 that remains in the delivery system may be added to the minimum target amount
of first medium 1677 to be delivered to device 17. For example, if the target amount of first
medium 1677 is about 0.45 ml, and the potential retention of first medium 1677 remaining
within the delivery system is 0.25 ml, the amount of first medium 1677 initially loaded into
syringe 1671 may be about 0.7 ml. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that
more accurate and reproducible placement of first medium 1677 into device 17 may occur by
reducing the amount of fluid volume retained in the delivery system. This can be achieved by
first dispensing medium 1677 into device 17 and then by dispensing second medium 1695
and/or by reduction of the dimensions of the various components of the delivery device 15.
         [0366]      It is to be understood that, although media 1677 and 1695 have been
described herein as being essentially inert or non-reactive with one another, media 1677 and
1695 may be reactive with one another to form, for example, a third medium which, itself,

may be used to inflate device 17. It is also to be understood that, although media 1677 and
1695 have been described herein as being used to inflate device 17, medium 1677 could be
used to inflate device 17 and medium 1695 could be used as a sealant to seal the valve or port
through which medium 1677 is introduced into device 17 to prevent medium 1677 from
leaking from device 17. In addition, it may be desirable to inject other substances into the
balloon, such as a medication.
         [0367]     Referring now to Figs. 96(a) and 96(b), there are shown side views of an
alternate embodiment of a delivery device to delivery device 15, the alternate embodiment
being represented generally by reference numeral 1701.
         [0368]     Delivery device 1701 may be similar in most respects to delivery device 15.
One difference between the two delivery devices may be that, whereas device 15 may include
window catheter 1641, delivery device 1701 may include a window catheter 1702. Window
catheter 1702 may be similar in most respects to window catheter 1641, the principal
difference between the two window catheters being that, whereas window catheter 1641 may
include window 1651, window catheter 1702 may include a window 1703. Window 1703
may include a proximal portion 1704-1, a distal portion 1704-2, and an intermediate portion
1704-3. Proximal portion 1704-1 and intermediate portion 1704-3 may be similar to proximal
portion 1652-1 and intermediate portion 1652-3, respectively, of window 1651.          However,
distal portion 1704-2 of window 1703 may differ from distal portion 1652-1 of window 1651
in that distal portion 1704-2 may extend all the way to distal end 1705 of window catheter
1702 and may be deeper than proximal portion 1704-1 and/or intermediate portion 1704-3 for
at least some of its length. It is believed that the increased size of window 1703, as compared
to the size of window 1651, may facilitate the passage and release of pressure-attenuating
device 17 from the delivery device.
         [0369]     Another difference between the two delivery devices is that delivery device
1701 may further include a cover 1707 slidably mounted over catheter 1641.          Cover 1707,
which is also shown separately in Fig. 97, may comprise a generally tubular member 1708
having a proximal end 1708-1 and a distal end 1708-2. Cover 1707 may also comprise a hub
1710 secured to the proximal end 1708-1 of member 1708. As can be seen in Fig. 96(a), when
cover 1707 is in its distal position, distal end 1708-2 may be positioned so that cover 1707
                                                 -91-

 WO 2014/026028                                                              PCT/US2013/054185
covers window 1703 of catheter 1702. This may be useful in retaining pressure-attenuating
device 17 within catheter 1641. On the other hand, as can be seen in Fig. 96(b), when cover
1707 is in its proximal position, distal end 1708-2 may be positioned so that cover 1707 does
not cover window 1703 of catheter 1702. In use, cover 1707 may initially be positioned as in
Fig. 96(a), and that, as device 1701 is inserted through access device 13, handle 71 may
engage hub 1710 and may cause cover 1707 to be slid proximally relative to catheter 1702
until it assumes the position shown in Fig. 96(b), thereby "opening" window 1703 to allow
device 17 to pass therethrough in the manner described above. Distal end 1708-2 may have a
tapered geometry to aid in its introduction through an orifice, such as that of access device 13
or some anatomical orifice. This tapered end can also decrease the likelihood that the cover
will be prematurely retracted through contact with such an orifice.               Also, it is to be
understood that, although not shown, cover 1707 and/or catheter 1702 may be provided with
some mechanism, such as a catch or one or more engagement surfaces, that may serve to
impede, to a certain extent, axial movement of cover 1707 relative to catheter 1702 so that
inadvertent proximal and/or distal movement of cover 1707 relative to catheter 1702 may be
avoided.
         [0370]     Referring to Fig. 98(a), in some embodiments, a cover 1707, which may for
example be suitable for retaining pressure-attenuating device 17 within any of the catheters
described herein, e.g., the catheter 1702.       The cover 1707 can be removed, e.g., retracted
distally. The cover 1707 may comprise a proximal end 1708-1 and a distal end 1708-2. The
cover 1707 may comprise a handle 1708-3 on the distal end 1708-2. In some embodiments,
the proximal end 1708-1 is sized to slide over and cover, at least in part, the window 1703 of
catheter 1702.     For example, the cover 1707 may reduce displacement of the pressure
attenuating device 17 prior to removal of the cover 1707. In some embodiments, the cover
1707 comprises a plastic material (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyethylene (PE),
synthetic polymers such as nylon).            In some embodiments, the cover 1707 comprises
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) heat shrink. In some embodiments, cover 1707 comprises a
metallic material (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, a nickel-titanium alloy (Nitinol), aluminum).
         [0371]     The cover 1707 may facilitate the un-inflated pressure-attenuating device
17 to "take a set" over time while stored in catheter 1702 having window 1703. For example,
                                                  -92-

 WO 2014/026028                                                         PCT/US2013/054185
at time zero when the pressure-attenuating device 17 is folded and packed into the catheter
1702, the pressure-attenuating device 17 may be unstable and the cover 1707 and/or catheter
1702 may provide physical restraint upon the pressure-attenuating device 17.          In some
embodiments, the physical restraint enables the pressure-attenuating device 17 to take a set by
facilitating retention of the device 17 within catheter 1702 having window 1703.            For
example, a pressure-attenuating device 17 may take a set by becoming more rigidly stored
within catheter 1702, such that device 17 may be more stably retained in catheter 1703,
including a catheter 1703 having features to increase catheter 1703 compliance (features as
described herein). In some embodiments, a time to facilitate the pressure-attenuating device
17 to take a set can have a value within a range of from about 1 minute to about 1 month,
including from about 1 hour to about 2 weeks, including from about 1 hour to about 1 week.
In some embodiments, the catheter 1702 having a window 1703 and containing a pressure
attenuating device 17, and a cover 1707 covering at least a portion of window 1703 of
catheter 1702, may be subjected elevated temperature during the manufacturing process to
facilitate the pressure-attenuating device 17 to take set.
          [0372]     Fig. 98(b) shows a profile view of a cover 1707 having a handle 1708-3 at
the distal end 1708-2 and a proximal end 1708-1 suitable for covering, at least in part, the
window 1703 of catheter 1702. Fig. 98(c) shows a cross-sectional view of a cover 1707
having a handle at the distal end 1708-2 and a proximal end 1708-1 suitable for covering, at
least in part, the window 1703 of catheter 1702.
          [0373]     The cover 1707 may be removed, for example, during manufacturing,
immediately prior to packaging and sterilization, or immediately prior to the use of the
delivery system.     The cover 1707 can be removed manually, or can be attached to the
packaging so that removal of the system from the packaging also removes the cover.
Referring to Fig. 98(d), a tab 1709 may be attached to the cover 1707 distal end 1708-2,
including for example the handle portion.       In some embodiments, the tab 1709 facilitates
removal of the cover 1707. For example, the cover 1707 having the tab 1709 may be placed
over at least a portion of window 1703 of catheter 1702, catheter 1702 containing a pressure
attenuating device 17. In some embodiments, as the delivery system is removed from the
packaging tube, the tab 1709 contacts the packaging tube and is restrained, and the catheter
                                               -93-

1702 slides out of the cover 1707 and packaging tube. For example, the packaging tube may
comprise the protective sleeve 1759 as shown in Fig. 106.
Implant
        [0374]       An implantable device having a compressible element can be placed within
a body, such as the bladder. The compressible element can act as a pressure attenuator to
attenuate transient pressure events. Gases, such as atmospheric air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
and certain perfluorocarbons (PFC), may be used to inflate the implant and can act as a low or
variable rate spring in series with the native fluidic circuit of the urinary tract. The implant can
take many forms including a sphere, some examples of which will be outlined below.
        [0375]       In some embodiments, the implant can include an outer surface that defines
a container within the outer surface. The implant may also include a valve that can allow for
the addition or removal of substances from the container.
        [0376]       Additional embodiments of an implantable device are described in U.S.
Patent No. 6,682,473, incorporated by reference herein. See for example, Figs. 5, 5A, 7A-C,
8A-E, 13-25, and 27-3 1, and the accompanying discussion, including at columns 9-12, 13-14,
17-20, and 21-24.        See also the similar disclosure from U.S. Patent No. 6,976,950,
incorporated by reference herein, as well as, Figs. 32A-33C, 36-38, 47A-C, 49 and the
accompanying discussion, including at columns 15-18, 30-35, and 39-40.
        [0377]       U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0222802, incorporated by
reference herein discloses still additional embodiments of implantable devices.             See for
example, Figs. 5-5N, 8A-8B, 10A, 1IC, 23A-23H, 34A-35D, 37A-37B, 38A-51C, and the
accompanying      discussion, including paragraphs        [0127]-[0152],     [0167]-[0168],  [0174],
[0177], [0233]-[0242], [0354]-[0438], and [0466]-[0475].
        [0378]       Referring now to Figs. 99(a) through 100, implant or pressure-attenuating
device 17 may comprise an inflatable cell 1711 and a valve 1713. The valve 1713 can serve to
regulate the flow of fluid into and out of cell 1711. Cell 1711 may be made of an elastomeric
material. When inflated, cell 1711 may comprise a generally spherical bulb portion 1714 and
an inverted tubular tail portion 1717 extending into bulb portion 1714, tail portion 1717
terminating in an opening 1719 (Fig. 100). An area of increased wall thickness or retaining
feature 1715 may be disposed on bulb portion 1714 opposite to tail portion 1717.                 The
                                                 -94-

  WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
retaining feature 1715 can be a portion of the balloon that is used to retain the balloon into the
window of the delivery system. The retaining feature 1715 can be an area of the cell 1711
that is the same or higher wall thickness than adjacent areas of the cell 1711, or a member that
is more rigid than the cell 1711, which can be integral to or adhered to the cell 1711, as an
example. In the present embodiment, cell 1711 may be made of a sufficiently transparent
material to permit the contents housed by cell 1711 to be seen.
         [0379]      Cell 1711 may be seamless and may be substantially arcuate, with the only
exception being tail portion 1717, which is inverted and to which valve 1713 can be welded or
otherwise attached.       To minimize the potential for encrustation, to maximize patient
tolerability, or for other reasons, it is preferable that over 95% of the external surface area of
cell 1711 be continuously arcuate and that less than 5% of the surface area of cell 1711 not be
arcuate. More preferably, over 97% of the external surface area of cell 1711 is continuously
arcuate and less than 3% of the external surface area is not arcuate. Even more preferably,
over 99% of the external surface area of cell 1711 is continuously arcuate and less than 1% of
the surface area is not arcuate.
         [0380]      For example, one embodiment of cell 1711 has an overall surface area of
4,586 sq. mm. The external surface area of the continuously arcuate portion of cell 1711 is
4,575 sq. mm. The ratio of continuously arcuate surface area to non-arcuate surface area for
the external surface of the inflatable cell in this embodiment is 401:1. This ratio is preferably
from about 100:1 to 1500:1 and more preferably from about 400:1 to 600:1.               The inner
diameter of tail portion 1717 in the embodiment above is 0.15 inch, and the maximum
diameter of the external surface of the bulb portion 1714 is 1.58 inches.        The ratio of the
maximum diameter of the external surface of the bulb portion 1714 to the inner diameter of
the tail portion 1717 is 10.53:1. This ratio is preferably between about 6:1 and 20:1 and more
preferably greater than about 8:1.           Without limitation to any particularly theory or
embodiment, it is believed that such a ratio may serve to keep tail portion 1717 inverted
within bulb portion 1714.
         [0381]      Valve 1713, which is also shown in Fig. 101, may be formed from a pair of
matching, appropriately shaped, flat sheets of elastomeric material. The pair of matching flat
sheets may be heat-sealed to one another along their respective sides to form a pair of seams
                                                 -95-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
1720-1 and 1720-2 and may also be molded so as to define a proximal section 1721, an
intermediate section 1723, and a distal section 1725. Proximal section 1721 may be generally
flat or generally frusto-conical in shape and may include outer surfaces 1721-1 and 1721-2
that may be fixedly mounted within opening 1719 of cell 1711 (Fig. 100) by a flat weld (where
proximal section 1721 is flat) or by a circumferential weld (where proximal section 1721 is
frusto-conical.)  Proximal section 1721 may include an end surface 1722, which may be a
surface or mating surface, intended to interface the distal end 1527 of push-off member 1521,
thereby allowing push-off member 1521 to push device 17 off distal end 1477 of inflation tube
1471.   In one embodiment, this surface 1722 is a 90 degree flat surface. Other surfaces, such
as a concave or convex surface that interacts with the distal end of push-off member 1521.
The shape of the distal end of the pushoff member 1521 may be flat, concave, convex, or a
shape that permits interaction with the end surface 1722. Intermediate section 1723 may be
generally cylindrical and may be reduced in inner diameter and in outer diameter as compared
to proximal section 1721.      Moreover, intermediate section 1723 may be reduced in inner
diameter as compared to the outer diameter of inflation tube 1471 and may include an inner
side surface 1724 that may be used to make a stretch interference fit with inflation tube 1471
so as to seal against inflation tube 1471 or to prop open valve 1713, which will close upon
release, thereby enabling cell 1711 to be inflated under high pressure with minimal leaking.
For example, where the outer diameter of inflation tube 1471 may be in the range of about
0.001-5.00 inch, preferably about 0.005-0.50 inch, more preferably about 0.010-0.125 inch,
the inner diameter of intermediate section 1723 may be correspondingly smaller, for example,
in the range of about 0.0005-4.900 inch, preferably about 0.001-0.49 inch, more preferably
about 0.005-0.120 inch. Moreover, the thickness of intermediate section 1723 may be in the
range of about 0.0001-2.00 inch, preferably about 0.001-0.24 inch, more preferably about
0.005-0.050 inch.    In certain applications, the nominal pressure exerted on the self-sealing
valve 1725 is relatively low, below 3 psi. Therefore the surface area of the contact area of the
two surfaces must be sufficient to resist flow during use.        This is accomplished with a
structure 1725 that has a width typically less than 1', more preferably less than 0.5 inches, and
more preferably less than 0.25 inches. To maintain valve function, the length of the structure
1725 is greater than the width of structure 1725, more preferably the length is greater than 1.5
                                               -96-

  WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
times the width of the structure 1725, and more preferably greater than two times the width of
the structure 1725.      Distal section 1725 may be a generally elongated, flattened structure that
is self-sealing (i.e., biased, independently of its environment, towards a closed state) and that
has a distal end 1727 through which fluid inputted to valve 1713 in the manner discussed
below may exit valve 1713 to occupy the space defined by cell 1711. Preferably, distal section
1725 is made sufficiently long to minimize the escape of fluid from within cell 1711 through
valve 1713.
         [0382]        Referring now to Fig. 102, there is shown a flowchart, schematically
depicting one possible method 1731 for making device 17. Method 1731 may begin with a
step 1731-1 of providing a tubular member, which may be, for example, an extruded tube
1733 of elastomeric material having a pair of open ends 1734-1 and 1734-2 (see Fig. 103(a)).
Method 1731 may continue with a step 1731-2 of closing off end 1734-2 to form a tube 1735
having a closed end 1735-1 (see Fig. 103(b)). Method 1731 may then continue with a step
1731-3 of blowing up or expanding tube 1735 to form a generally spherical portion 1736 and
a generally cylindrical tail portion 1737 (see Fig. 103(c)). (Step 1731-3 may further include
pulling on the closed end 1735-1 during said expansion of tube 1735.)           Method 1731 may
then continue with a step 1731-4 of inserting valve 1713 into tail portion 1737 and joining,
such as by either a circumferential weld or a flat weld, proximal section 1721 to tail portion
1737 (see Fig. 103(e)). Method 1731 may then conclude with a step 1731-5 of inverting the
combination of valve 1713 and tail portion 1737 into generally spherical portion 1736, thereby
forming device 17. In some embodiments, to prevent the valve 1713 and tail portion 1737
from reversing this inverting step 1731-5 during use, the valve and tail portion may be
anchored to the balloon wall in any method known in the art including but not limited to use
of an adhesive or welding the distal end of the valve to the balloon wall, for example. A
preferred embodiment is to fabricate the balloon to provide increase resistance to the reversal
of inverting step 1731-5 with the following features:        1) An increase in wall thickness or
stiffness on the balloon near the area of the balloon where the tail protrudes. For example, a
circumferential increase in balloon thickness 1736-1 that measures more than two times the
diameter of the tail, and more preferably more than 1.5 times the diameter of the tail and more
preferably more than one times the diameter of the tail, and this circumferential wall thickness
                                                -97-

  WO 2014/026028                                                           PCT/US2013/054185
is less than 0.075 inches and more preferably less than 0.050 inches and more preferably less
than 0.025 inches, and/or 2) a wall thickness of the tail 1737 that is at least one times the wall
thickness of the balloon 1736, more preferably at least 1.5 times the wall thickness of the
balloon 1736, more preferably at least two times the wall thickness of the balloon 1736, more
preferably at least three times the wall thickness of the balloon 1763, and/or 3) a balloon with
a measured angle between the wall of the balloon near the tail opening and the tail 1736-2 of
at least 45 degrees, more preferable greater than 70 degrees, more preferable greater than 80
degrees, and more preferable approaching 90 degrees, and/or 4) a measured radius where the
tail 1737 interfaces with balloon 1736 of less than 0.5 inches, more preferably less than 0.1
inches, more preferably less than 0.075 inches and more preferably less than 0.035 and
preferably 0.015 inches. Preferably, device 17 is dimensioned so that spherical portion 1736,
when expanded, has a diameter that is approximately 6-20 times the diameter of the entry port
defined by the interface of spherical portion 1736 and inverted tail portion 1737.         In one
embodiment, the shape, thickness and material of closed end 1735-1 forms the integral
retaining member 1715 in the wall of the balloon.
         [0383]      Cell 1711 may alternatively be made using a dip process that is common in
the industry. For example, Brash et al., "Development of block copolyether-urethane intra
aortic balloons and other medical devices," Journal of Biomedical Research, 7(4):313-34
(1973), which is incorporated herein by reference, describe a manufacturing process that can
be used to manufacture cell 1711.       A mandrel is formed from expendable wax, and then
dipped using commonly known balloon dipping methods to form a balloon. Upon cure of the
balloon material, the wax is melted and removed, resulting in the desired balloon.
         [0384]      One advantageous feature of device 17 is that it may be devoid of seams on
its exterior surface. The absence of such seams may be desirable since such seams may rub up
against and cause irritation with the bladder or other anatomical structure in which device 17
is positioned.    In addition, such seams may become encrusted, over time, with biological
sediment from the anatomical structure in which device 17 is positioned, which encrustation
may exacerbate such irritation or may otherwise be regarded as unhygienic or undesirable.

inflated and deployed. Preferably, the delivery of device 17 to the anatomical structure in a
deflated state is accomplished by positioning device 17 in its deflated state within window
catheter 1641, with distal end 1477 of inflation tube 1471 sealed against intermediate section
1723 of valve 1713 in the manner discussed above. As seen in Fig. 104, cell 1711 may be
folded within catheter 1641 in a manner complementary to the shape of window 1651 so as to
maximize the likelihood that device 17 may be retained within catheter 1641 by window 1651
prior to being inflated and may be released through window 1651 once inflated.
         [0386]      Referring now to Fig. 105, device 17 is shown in a deflated, flattened state
with internal retention member 1715 on the lower layer of the balloon prior to being folded.
A plurality of imaginary fold lines 1741-1, 1741-2, and 1741-3 are shown on cell 1711 to
depict where cell 1711 may be folded. According to one embodiment of the invention, cell
1711 may first be folded about line 1741-1, then about line 1741-2, and then about line 1741
3. Alternatively, cell 1711 may be folded about line 1741-2, then about line 1741-1, and then
about line 1741-3. When device 17 is inflated, cell 1711 may unfold in an order opposite to
the order in which it had previously been folded.        In an alternate embodiment, the balloon
includes an integral retention member 1715, which is on top of the balloon when folded along
line 174 1-1 described above. The integral retention member may be circular, rectangular, oval
or any shape so long as it is sufficiently wide to extend beyond the opening in the window,
more preferably greater than 1.5 times the opening in the window, more preferably two times
the opening in the window. This dimension permits the retention member to be tucked under
the catheter on one or more sides of the window when the folded balloon is secured in the
catheter.
         [0387]      It is to be understood that, although device 17 has been described herein as
being inflatable, device 17 could be expandable in ways other than by inflation. For example,
device 17 could be self-expandable, for instance, by virtue of being made of a shape-memory
material.

        [0388]       Referring now to Fig. 106, there is shown a top view of one embodiment
of a sterilizable kit comprising certain components of system 11, the sterilizable kit being
represented generally by reference numeral 1751.
        [0389]       Kit 1751 may comprise a sheet of support material 1753, which may be a
sheet of cardboard or a similarly suitable support material. Kit 1751 may further comprise a
sealed pouch 1755 surrounding support material 1753, pouch 1755 defining a sealed cavity
1757. Pouch 1755 may be made of a transparent material, such as one or more transparent
polymer sheets.      Kit 1751 may further comprise the components of delivery device 15,
excluding syringe 1671 (which syringe 1671 may be separately sterilized, for example, through
heat-sterilization), the components of delivery device 15 nearly being fully assembled, except
that syringe 1671 is not present and that syringe 1691 is not attached to the remaining
components of delivery device 15. Syringe 1691 may be disposed within cavity 1757 and may
be mounted on support material 1753, and the remainder of delivery device 15 may be
disposed within cavity 1757 and may be mounted on support material 1753 at a distance from
syringe 1691. Syringe 1691 may be opened to drawn in a volume of air corresponding to the
volume of air one wishes to dispense therefrom into device 17. Although not visible in Fig.
106, kit 1751 may further comprise pressure-attenuating device 17, which may be loaded
within window catheter 1641 of delivery device 15 and may be coupled to inflation tube 1741
in the manner described above. Kit 1751 may further comprise a removable protective sleeve
1759, which may be inserted over catheter 1641 to ensure retention of device 17 within
catheter 1641 during shipping and/or storage. (Sleeve 1759 is removed from catheter 1641
prior to use; alternatively, sleeve 1759 may be replaced with cover 1703, which may be
retained for use in the manner described above.) All of the components of kit 1751 are made
of a material that may be sterilizable by a suitable sterilization technique, such as gamma
radiation.
        [0390]       An advantageous feature of kit 1751 is that the air contained within syringe
1691 may become sterilized during the sterilization procedure applied to kit 1751.        In this
manner, one may minimize the introduction of air into device 17 that may contain undesirable
microorganisms.      For similar reasons, microbial filters may alternatively or additionally be
appropriately positioned within fluid connector 1423 and/or check valves 1441 and 1443.

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
         [0391]      Referring now to Fig. 107, there is shown a flowchart, schematically
depicting one possible method 1771 of implanting pressure-attenuating device 17 in an
anatomical structure of a patient, such as a bladder. Method 1771 may begin with a step
1771-1 of installing an access device in a patient in any of the manners discussed above.
Where, for example, access device 13 is used to provide transurethral access to the bladder,
said installing step may comprise inserting distal end 135 of obturator 131, covered by sleeve
181, through the urethra and into the bladder and then removing obturator 131, whereby an
access path extending across the urethra and into the bladder may be created (see Fig. 108(a)).
Method 1771 may then continue with a step 1771-2 of inserting a distal end of a delivery
device through the access device and into the anatomical structure of a patient. This may be
done by inserting distal end 1647 of delivery device 15 through the remaining installed portion
of access device 13 and into the bladder of the patient (see Fig. 108(b)). (Prior to insertion of
delivery device 15 into access device 13, pressure-attenuating device 17 may be loaded into
delivery device 15 in the manner discussed above.)
         [0392]      Method 1771 may then continue with a step 1771-3 of inflating pressure
attenuating device 17 (see Fig. 108(c)). Said inflating step may be effected by fully depressing
piston 1679 to dispense first fluid medium 1677 from first syringe 1671 (Fig. 94) into
pressure-attenuating device 17 and then by fully depressing piston 1697 to dispense second
fluid medium 1695 (Fig. 95) from second syringe 1691 into pressure-attenuating device 17.
(It may be preferred to dispense first fluid medium 1677 into device 17 before dispensing
second fluid medium 1695 into device 17 where first fluid medium 1677 is a liquid and second
fluid medium 1695 is a gas since a gas may be useful in flushing a liquid from delivery device
15 into device 17; however, such inflation may alternatively be achieved by dispensing second
fluid medium 1695 before first fluid medium 1677 or by simultaneously dispensing first fluid
medium 1677 and second fluid medium 1695.) Method 1771 may then continue with a step
1771-4 of releasing pressure-attenuating device 17 from delivery device 15 (see Fig. 108(d)),
thereby allowing device 17 to float freely in the bladder or other anatomical structure. Said
releasing step may be affected by deactivating safety 1591 and then by squeezing trigger 1541,
thereby causing push-off member 1521 to slide distally until push-off member 1521 pushes
device 17 off of distal end 1477 of inflation tube 1471. Method 1771 may then proceed with
                                              -101-

 WO 2014/026028                                                          PCT/US2013/054185
a step 1771-5 of withdrawing the delivery device from the access device. This may be done
by withdrawing delivery device 15 from the remaining installed portion of access device 13
while holding the remaining installed portion of access device 13 stationary in the patient.
(Access device 13 may thereafter be removed from the patient or may remain in the patient to
provide a conduit through which observational, removal, or other devices may be inserted.)
         [0393]     Some of the advantageous features of using delivery device 15 to deliver
pressure-attenuating device 17 are that, due to the orientation and placement of window 1651,
there is a controlled deployment of pressure-attenuating device 17 away from the trigone of
the patient and device 17 is kept away from the walls of the bladder while being inflated, such
contact with the walls of the bladder possibly impeding the opening of valve 1713 to inflate
device 17.
         [0394]     Referring back now to Figs. 81(a) and 82(b), to assist an operator in
properly using delivery device 15, one or both housing halves 1403-1 and 1403-2 may be
imprinted with certain markings, indicating certain steps in the delivery sequence.         For
example, each of housing halves 1403-1 and 1403-2 may be imprinted with the following
markings: marking 1781-1 comprising the number "1" and the text "Inject AirLoc" positioned
proximate to opening 1417; marking 1781-2 comprising the number "2" and the text "Inject
Air" positioned proximate to opening 1413; marking 1781-3 comprising the number "3" and
the text "Release Balloon" positioned proximate to trigger 1541; and marking 1781-4
comprising the number "4" and the text "Hold Sheath Remove Tool" positioned proximate to
opening 1419. As can be appreciated, markings 1781-1 through 1781-4 convey that syringe
1671 is to be emptied, followed by the emptying of syringe 1691, followed by the squeezing
of trigger 1541, and followed by the removal of delivery device 15 from the remaining
installed portion of access device 13. It is also to be noted that markings 1781-1 and 1781-4
can be positioned on housing halves 1403-1 and 1403-2 proximate to the related portions of
delivery device 15, thereby reinforcing the connection between the step to be taken and the
related physical structure of delivery device 15.
Removal
         [0395]     A removal device may be inserted through the passageway created by an
access device. The removal device may be used to capture, to deflate and/or to remove the
                                              -102-

pressure-attenuating device. The removal device may also be used to view the inside of the
anatomical structure, as well as the pressure-attenuating device. This viewing may be done
during all or part of the capturing, deflating, and/or removing the pressure-attenuating device.

1829 to distal end 1831. Bore 1827 and bore 1833 may have their axes generally aligned with
bore 1811 and cavity 1817, respectively.
         [0401]     First member 1801 may be coupled to second member 1803 for pivotal
movement relative thereto by a pin 1835 inserted through transverse openings 1837 and 1839
in first member 1801 and second member 1803, respectively.           Pin 1835 may be held in
openings 1837 and 1839 by having an end 1840 received within a cap 1841. In the above
manner, first member 1801 may be regarded as a movable member pivotally mounted about
pin 1835, and second member 1803 may be regarded as a stationary member.

         [0404]     Removal device 19 may further comprise a scope guide 1881. Guide 1881,
which is also shown separately in Fig. 112, may be a unitary structure, preferably made of a
medical-grade stainless steel or a similarly suitable material. Guide 1881 may be a generally
tubular member comprising a generally circular side wall 1883 defining a proximal end 1885, a

1963 (Figs. 109(b)-109(d)).    Arm 1961, which is also shown separately in Fig. 118, may be a
unitary structure, preferably made of a medical-grade stainless steel or a similarly suitable
material.   Arm 1961 may be an elongated flat member shaped to include a first transverse
opening 1965 proximate to a proximal end 1961-1 of arm 1961 and a second transverse
opening 1967 proximate to a distal end 1961-2 of arm 1961.          A pivot pin 1969 may be
received within opening 1965 of arm 1961, as well as within opening 1957 of connector 1951,
so as to pivotally couple arm 1961 to connector 1951.          Arm 1963, which is also shown
separately in Fig. 119, may be a unitary structure, preferably made of a medical-grade stainless
steel or a similarly suitable material. Arm 1963 may be an elongated flat member shaped to
include a first transverse opening 1971 proximate to a proximal end 1963-1 of arm 1963 and a
second transverse opening 1973 proximate to a distal end 1963-2 of arm 1963.          Pivot pin
1969 may additionally be received within opening 1971 of arm 1963 so as to pivotally couple
arm 1963 both to arm 1961 and to connector 1951.
        [0411]       Removal device 19 may further comprise a pair of jaws 1981 and 1983
(Figs. 109(a)-109(d)).    The jaws can include corresponding teeth 1997, 2017 which can be
used to grip or secure an implant. The jaws may also include one or more surface damaging
or compromising structures. For example, the surface damaging structure 2003, 2023 can be
a needle, knife, sharpened tooth, etc. In some embodiments, the surface damaging structure
can be a canulated needle that can also serve to allow the media within in the implant to
escape or otherwise be removed.        In some embodiments, having the opening in the needle
extend the entire length of the exposed needle structure permits the balloon to continue to
deflate even when the needle has penetrated completely through the balloon. Additionally, the
orientation of the sharp edge towards the distal end of the grasper has the advantage of
preventing lacerating the balloon film during the tensile removal of the deflated or partially
                                              -107-

deflated balloon thru the sheath. Additionally, the proximity of the needle relative to adjacent
teeth can improve the function of the removal system. Specifically, if the space between the
tip of the needle and the tip of an adjacent tooth is between 0.05 and 10 times the difference in
height between the tip of the needle and the tip of the adjacent tooth. This distance prevents
the balloon from "tenting" over the needle and adjacent teeth without needle penetration of
the balloon. An example of a larger distance between the tip of the needle and the tip of the
adjacent tooth is shown in Fig. 120(e). Needle 2513-3 is taller than adjacent tooth 1997. The
distance between the tip of the tooth 1997 and needle 2513-1 or 2513-3 is equal to or greater
than the difference in distance between the height of needle 2513-1 or 2513-3 and the height
of the adjacent tooth.
         [0412]     Jaw 1981, which is also shown separately in Figs. 120(a) through 120(d),
may comprise an elongated member 1985 (which may be, for example, approximately 1.55
2.5 inches in length), preferably made of a medical-grade stainless steel or a similarly suitable
material.   Member 1985 may be shaped to include a proximal portion 1987 and a distal
portion 1989. Proximal portion 1987, which may comprise a generally flat and arcuate arm,
may be shaped to include a first transverse opening 1991 proximate to a proximal end 1987-1
of proximal portion 1987 and a second transverse opening 1993 spaced distally a short
distance from first transverse opening 1991. A pivot pin 1995 may be received within opening
1991 of proximal portion 1987, as well as within opening 1967 of arm 1961, so as to pivotally
couple jaw 1981 to arm 1961. A pivot pin 1996 may be received within opening 1993 of
proximal portion 1987, as well as within opening 1933 of bracket 1921, so as to pivotally
couple jaw 1981 to bracket 1921. Distal portion 1989 of member 1985 may be shaped to
include a row of teeth 1997 facing towards jaw 1983, the row of teeth 1997 extending
proximally from approximately the distal end of distal portion 1989. Each tooth 1997 may
extend substantially across the width of distal portion 1989 and may have a height of, for
example, approximately 1-10 mm, preferably approximately 5 mm. Each tooth 1997 may
have a dulled peak 1997-1 that has a radius of, for example, 0.001-0.250 inch, preferably
0.005-0.050 inch, more preferably 0.010-0.25 inch. A first transverse opening 1999 may be
provided in distal portion 1989 amongst teeth 1997, and a second transverse opening 2001
may be provided in distal portion 1989 amongst teeth 1997, first and second transverse

openings 1999 and 2001 being spaced apart from one another by a short distance.                A
cannulated needle 2003 may be fixedly mounted in transverse opening 1999, needle 2003
having a sharpened end 2003-1 facing towards jaw 1983. Preferably, needle 2003 has a height
that exceeds the height of teeth 1997 so that sharpened end 2003-1 extends beyond dulled
peaks 1997-1.     Needle 2003 may have an inner diameter of, for example, approximately
0.0005-0.500 inch, preferably approximately 0.005-0.250 inch, more preferably approximately
0.010-0.050 inch, and may have an outer diameter of, for example, approximately 0.001
0.750 inch, preferably approximately 0.010-0.300 inch, more preferably approximately 0.015
0.075 inch.
        [0413]      Jaw 1983, which is also shown separately in Figs. 121(a) through 121(d),
may comprise an elongated member 2005 (which may be, for example, approximately 1.55
2.5 inches in length), preferably made of a medical-grade stainless steel or a similarly suitable
material.   Member 2005 may be shaped to include a proximal portion 2007 and a distal
portion 2009. Proximal portion 2007, which may comprise a generally flat and arcuate arm,
may be shaped to include a first transverse opening 2011 proximate to a proximal end 2007-1
of proximal portion 2007 and a second transverse opening 2013 spaced distally a short
distance from first transverse opening 2011. A pivot pin 2015 may be received within opening
2011 of proximal portion 2007, as well as within opening 1973 of arm 1963, so as to pivotally
couple jaw 1983 to arm 1963.        Pivot pin 1996 may be received within opening 2013 of
proximal portion 2007, as well as within opening 1933 of bracket 1921, so as to pivotally
couple jaw 1983 to bracket 1921.      In this manner, proximal movement of rod 1941, which
may be caused by pivotal movement of ring portion 1807 of member 1801 towards ring
portion 1823 of member 1803, may cause arms 1961 and 1963 to pivot towards each other
which, in turn, may cause jaws 1981 and 1983 to pivot towards each other. On the other
hand, distal movement of rod 1941, which may be caused by pivotal movement of ring portion
1807 of member 1801 away from ring portion 1823 of member 1803, may cause arms 1961
and 1963 to pivot away from one another which, in turn, may cause jaws 1981 and 1983 to
pivot away from one another. Jaws 1981 and 1983 may open to an angle of, for example,
approximately 20-150 degrees.

  WO 2014/026028                                                       PCT/US2013/054185
         [0414]     Distal portion 2009 of member 2005 may be shaped to include a row of
teeth 2017 facing towards jaw 1981.      The row of teeth 2017 may be staggered relative to
teeth 1997 so that the peaks 1997-1 of teeth 1997 may be aligned with the spaces between
teeth 2017 when jaws 1981 and 1983 are closed and so that the peaks 2017-1 of teeth 2017
may be aligned with the spaces between teeth 1997 when jaws 1981 and 1983 are closed.
Each tooth 2017 may extend substantially across the width of distal portion 2009 and may be
shaped and dimensioned similarly to each of teeth 1997. A first transverse opening 2019 may
be provided in distal portion 2009 amongst teeth 2017, and a second transverse opening 2021
may be provided in distal portion 2009 amongst teeth 2017.            Opening 2019 may be
appropriately positioned and appropriately dimensioned to receive cannulated needle 2003 of
jaw 1981 when jaws 1981 and 1983 are closed. (By receiving the sharpened end 2003-1 of
needle 2003, opening 2019 facilitates and promotes full closure of jaws 1981 and 1983 around
an inflated device 17, as opposed to having needle 2003 be deflected from the compressed and
inflated device 17.) Opening 2019 may have an inner diameter of, for example, approximately
0.002-0.100 inch, preferably 0.010-0.300 inch, more preferably 0.015-0.100 inch. Opening
2021 may be aligned with opening 2001 of jaw 1981 when jaws 1981 and 1983 are closed,
and a cannulated needle 2023 may be fixedly mounted in opening 2021 so as to be receivable
within opening 2001 of jaw 1981 when jaws 1981 and 1983 are closed. Cannulated needle
2023 may have a sharpened end 2023-1 facing towards jaw 1981, and needle 2023 and
opening 2001 may be dimensioned similarly to needle 2003 and opening 2019, respectively.
         [0415]     Preferably, teeth 19<removed-date> are dimensioned appropriately so that,
when jaws 1981 and 1983 are closed, a small gap 2018 (seen best in Fig. 109(d)) is left
between the respective rows of teeth 19<removed-date> that enables device 17 to be trapped
between teeth 19<removed-date> while minimizing any tearing of device 17 by teeth 1997 and
2017.    In this manner, device 17 may be securely held or gripped between teeth 1997 and
2017 while cannulated needles 2003 and 2023 puncture device 17.            Moreover, because
needles 2003 and 2023 are cannulated, the fluid contents of device 17 may be quickly
evacuated from device 17 through needles 2003 and 2023 without having needles 2003 and
2023 plug the same puncture holes they create.

         [0416]    It is to be understood that, although cannulated needles 2003 and 2023 are
described herein as being used to puncture device 17, other puncturing devices, such as, but
not limited to, blades, scissors, pins, hooks, or the like, may alternatively or additionally be
used.
         [0417]    In addition, it is to be understood that, although cannulated needles 2003
and 2023 are described herein as being oriented generally perpendicular to members 1985 and
2005, respectively, cannulated needles 2003 and 2023 need not be so oriented and may be
oriented, for example, so that sharpened ends 2003-1 and 2023-1 are angled towards proximal
portions 1987 and 2007, respectively.
         [0418]    Additionally, it is to be understood that, although both jaw 1981 and jaw
 1983 are described herein as being movable, one could make one of jaws 1981 and 1983
stationary and the other of jaws 1981 and 1983 movable.
         [0419]    Referring now to Fig. 122, there is shown a flowchart, schematically
depicting one possible method 2051 of using removal device 19 to remove an implanted
pressure-attenuating device 17 from an anatomical structure of a patient, such as a bladder.
Method 2051 may begin with a step 205 1-1 of installing an access device in a patient in any of
the manners discussed above.       Where, for example, access device 13 is used to provide
transurethral access to the bladder, said installing step may comprise inserting distal end 135
of obturator 131, which may be covered by sleeve 181, into the urethra, advancing obturator
 131 and sheath 61 through the urethra and into the bladder, and then removing obturator 131,
whereby an access path extending across the urethra and into the bladder may be created (see
Fig. 123(a)). Method 2051 may then continue with a step 2051-2 of inserting the distal end of
a removal device through the access device and into the anatomical structure of the patient.
This can be done by inserting the distal end of removal device 19 through the remaining
installed portion of access device 13 and into the bladder of the patient (see Fig. 123(b)). (In
order to permit insertion of removal device 19 into access device 13, one may use one hand to
pivot ring portion 1807 of member 1801 towards ring portion 1823 of member 1803 until
jaws 1981 and 1983 close. After jaws 1981 and 1983 have been inserted completely through
access device 13, jaws 1981 and 1983 may then be opened by pivoting ring portion 1807
                                              -111-

  WO 2014/026028                                                        PCT/US2013/054185
away from ring portion 1823.       Proper placement of the distal end of device 19 within the
bladder may be confirmed by observation with scope 1891.)
         [0420]      Where the method 2051 is performed in the bladder, or other fluid filled
structure, the method may then continue with a step 2051-3 of emptying the structure of
liquid, such as through stopcock valve 287, until the inflated device comes into alignment with
removal device. For example, urine can be removed from the bladder until the device 17 is
aligned with opened jaws 1981 and 1983 as observed through scope 1891 (see Fig. 123(c)).
Method 2051 may then continue with a step 2051-4 of engaging the inflated device with the
removal device. This may also include deflating the inflated device. For example, the jaws
1981 and 1983 can close around device 17, causing device 17 to deflate over the next several
seconds (see Fig. 123(d)).        Method 2051 may then conclude with a step 2051-5 of
withdrawing removal device, together with the deflated pressure-attenuating device from the
anatomical structure through the access device.       The implanted device 17 may be held
between jaws 1981 and 1983 and may be removed through the remaining installed portion of
access device 13 while the remaining installed portion of access device 13 is held stationary in
the patient.    If, for some reason, device 17 has not deflated completely as it is being
withdrawn from the patient, the distal end 64 of sheath 61 may advantageously serve as a
fulcrum to help to compress device 17 sufficiently for its facile withdrawal from the patient.
(Access device 13 may thereafter be removed from the patient or may remain in the patient to
provide a conduit through which observational, removal, or other devices may be inserted.)
         [0421]      Alternative embodiments to sheath 61 are shown in Figs. 121 and 122 and
are represented generally by reference numerals 2071 and 2081, respectively.      Sheaths 2071
and 2081 may be similar in most respects to sheath 61, sheaths 2071 and 2081 differing
principally from sheath 61 in that sheaths 2071 and 2081 may include distal ends 2073 and
2083, respectively. Distal ends 2073 and 2083 may be advantageous in increasing the contact
surface area during removal of device 17 and in forcing device 17 in a certain direction during
removal.
         [0422]      As can readily be appreciated, although removal device 19 is discussed
above as being used for observation and removal of an implanted device 17, removal device
19 could alternatively be used solely for observation of an implanted device 17, for example,

for observation of an implanted device 17 immediately after its implantation in a patient to
confirm that device 17 has been implanted properly.
        [0423]      As can be seen from the above discussion, one desirable feature of removal
device 19 is that removal device 19 may be operated with one hand.
        [0424]      Referring now to Figs. 126(a), 126(b), and 127, there are shown various
views of a first alternate embodiment of a removal device, the first alternate embodiment of
the removal device being represented generally by reference numeral 2101.
        [0425]      Removal device 2101 may be similar in many respects to removal device
19. A principal difference between the two devices may be that, whereas removal device 19
may comprise jaws 1981 and 1983 comprising rows of teeth 19<removed-date>, respectively, that
may be generally triangular in shape in side profile (i.e., when viewed from above device 19),
removal device 2101 may comprise jaws 2102 and 2104 comprising rows of teeth 2103 and
2105, respectively, that may be generally rectangular in shape in side profile.
        [0426]      Removal device 2101 may be used in a similar fashion to removal device

the removal device being represented generally by reference numeral 2151.
        [0428]      Removal device 2151 may be similar in many respects to removal device

removal device 2151 may comprise jaws 2152 and 2154 comprising rows of teeth 2153 and

        [0432]       Scissors-like handle 2203, which may be a unitary structure made of a
hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material, may comprise a first member
2215, a second member 2217, and a living hinge member 2219. First member 2215 may be
shaped to comprise an elongated arm portion 2221.        A transversely-extending ring portion
2223, which may be appropriately dimensioned to receive, for example, the thumb of a user,
may be disposed at one end of arm portion 2221.        Second member 2217 may be shaped to
comprise an elongated arm portion 2227. A transversely-extending ring portion 2229, which
may be appropriately dimensioned to receive, for example, the forefinger of a user, and a
finger rest 2231, which may be appropriately dimensioned to receive, for example, the middle
finger of a user, may be disposed at one end of arm portion 2227. The opposite end of arm
portion 2227 may be fixedly secured to sheath 2206. First member 2215 may be coupled to
second member 2217 for pivotal movement relative thereto by living hinge member 2219. In
this manner, handle 2203 may be operated much like a pair of scissors, albeit with first
member 2215 being regarded as a movable member and with second member 2217 being
regarded as a stationary member. It is to be understood, however, that handle 2203 could be
modified so that both first member 2215 and second member 2217 are movable.
        [0433]       Hub 2205 may be a unitary, tubular structure made of a hard, medical
grade polymer or a similarly suitable material, and sheath 2206 may also be a unitary, tubular
structure made of a hard, medical-grade polymer or a similarly suitable material. Hub 2205
and sheath 2206 may be joined to another by welding, adhesive or other suitable means and
may be arranged to be coaxial with one another, with hub 2205 having a comparatively larger
diameter and with sheath 2206 having a comparatively smaller diameter. Each of hub 2205
and sheath 2206 may be appropriately dimensioned to coaxially receive cystoscope 2207.
Hub 2205 and sheath 2206 may have a combined length such that, when cystoscope 2207 is
fully inserted into hub 2205 and sheath 2206, a distal end 2235 of cystoscope 2207 may
extend just distally beyond a distal end 2237 of sheath 2206.

         [0436]    Jaws 2209 and 2211, which may be similar in certain respects to jaws 1981
and 1983 of removal device 19, may be elongated members each made of a medical-grade
polymer or a similarly suitable material. Jaws 2209 and 2211 may be pivotally mounted on
distal end 2237 of sheath 2206 so that they may be moved towards and away from each other.
Sheath 2206 and jaws 2209 and 2211 may form a unitary structure, with jaw 2209 being
coupled to sheath 2206 by a living hinge 2241 and with jaw 2211 being coupled to sheath
2206 by a living hinge 2243. Articulation of jaws 2209 and 2211 may be effected using wire
2213, which may include a first end 2251 fixedly coupled to a tab 2253 provided on jaw 2211
and a second end 2255 fixedly coupled to a tab 2257 provided on jaw 2209, with an
intermediate portion of wire 2213 passing through sheath 2206 beneath cystoscope 2207 and
being fixedly coupled to first member 2215 of handle 2203.      In this manner, as first member
2215 may be pivoted towards second member 2217 in a counterclockwise direction indicated
by arrow 2218 in Fig. 130, wire 2213 may be moved proximally in tensile fashion, thereby
causing jaws 2209 and 2211 to be pivoted towards one another. Conversely, as first member
2215 may be pivoted away from second member 2217, wire 2213 may be moved distally,
thereby causing jaws 2209 and 2211 to be pivoted away from one another. As seen best in
Fig. 132(b), when device 2201 is viewed from the top, the left end of wire 2213, namely, end
2251, is secured to the right jaw, namely, jaw 2211, and the right end of wire 2213, namely,
end 2255, is secured to the left jaw, namely, jaw 2209. It is believed that such an arrangement
is advantageous in providing increased leverage for closing jaws 2209 and 2211.
         [0437]    Jaw 2209 may be shaped to include a post 2260 extending upwardly at a
distal end 2263 of jaw 2209, and jaw 2211 may be similarly shaped to include a post 2262
extending upwardly at a distal end 2265 of jaw 2211. Posts 2260 and 2262 may be helpful in
enabling an operator to visualize the distal end of device 2201, which may facilitate the
capture of pressure-attenuating device 17 or the like.

        [0438]       Jaw 2209 may be further shaped to include a couplet of teeth 2261-1 and
2261-2. Teeth 2261-1 and 2261-2 may be disposed at an intermediate location between tab
2257 and post 2260 and may extend generally in the direction of jaw 2211.          A transverse
opening 2265, which may serve as a relief hole in the manner to become apparent below, may
be provided in jaw 2209 between teeth 2261-1 and 2261-2.
        [0439]       Jaw 2211 may be further shaped to include a first couplet of teeth 2271-1
and 2271-2 and a second couplet of teeth 2273-1 and 2273-2, all of which may be disposed
between tab 2253 and post 2262.          More specifically, teeth 2271-1 and 2271-2 may be
positioned so that, when jaws 2209 and 2211 are brought together, teeth 227 1-1 and 2271-2
may be located at an intermediate position between tab 2257 and teeth 2261-1 and 2261-2,
and teeth 2273-1 and 2273-2 may be positioned so that, when jaws 2209 and 2211 are
brought together, teeth 2273-1 and 2273-2 may be located at an intermediate position
between teeth 2261-1 and 2261-2 and post 2262.            A transverse opening 2277 may be
provided in jaw 2211 between teeth 227 1-1 and 2271-2, and a transverse opening 2279 may
be provided in jaw 2211 between teeth 2273-1 and 2273-2. Openings 2277 and 2279 may
function as relief holes in the manner to become apparent below.
        [0440]       Cannulated needle 2212-1 may be fixedly mounted in a transverse opening
2281 provided in jaw 2211 and may be appropriately positioned and dimensioned to be
insertable between teeth 226 1-1 and 2261-2 when jaws 2209 and 2211 are brought together.
In a corresponding fashion, cannulated needle 2212-2 may be fixedly mounted in a transverse
opening 2283 provided in jaw 2209 and may be appropriately positioned and dimensioned to
be insertable between teeth 2271-1 and 2271-2 when jaws 2209 and 2211 are brought
together, and cannulated needle 2212-3 may be fixedly mounted in a transverse opening 2285
provided in jaw 2209 and may be appropriately positioned and dimensioned to be insertable
between teeth 2273-1 and 2273-2 when jaws 2209 and 2211 are brought together.              It is
believed that the present arrangement of teeth and cannulated needles is advantageous in that
the teeth may be particularly well-suited to keeping taut the pressure-attenuating device 17 or
other object that is to be punctured by the cannulated needles.
        [0441]       Cannulated needles 2212-1 through 2212-3 may be beveled at their
respective free ends, and the bevels may extend to a depth that approaches or even exceeds
                                              -116-

the depths of the teeth on opposing sides of the cannulated needle. A bevel that exceeds the
depth of the teeth may be preferred as it may facilitate air loss from the pressure-attenuating
device 17 or other object that has been captured and punctured by removal device 2201.
         [0442]      Removal device 2201 may be used in a similar fashion to removal device
19.
         [0443]      It should be understood that the numbers of cannulated needles and teeth
disclosed in the present embodiment are merely illustrative and that such numbers may be
increased, decreased or otherwise modified. It should also be understood that the size, shape
and positioning of such needles and teeth may also be modified.           It should further be
understood that, although both jaw 2209 and jaw 2211 are described herein as being movable,
one could make one of jaws 2209 and 2211 stationary and the other of jaws 2209 and 2211
movable.
         [0444]      As alluded to above, handle 2203, hub 2205, sheath 2206, and jaws 2209
and 2211 may easily be made at low cost using polymeric materials. In addition, needles
2212-1 through 2212-3, and wire 2213 may easily be made at low cost using metallic
materials. Moreover, the assembly of removal device 2201 may be achieved economically.
Consequently, after a single use of removal device 2201, cystoscope 2207 may be removed
and the remainder of removal device 2201 may be disposed. Cystoscope 2207 may then be
sterilized for reuse as part of a new removal device 2201. A benefit to making the majority of
removal device 2201 single-use is that there is no depreciation in the performance of the
device over time. Alternatively, instead of making cystoscope 2207 removable from hub 2205
and sheath 2206 to enable its sterilization and re-use, one could replace one or more of the
components of cystoscope 2207 with disposable, single-use components. For example, one
could replace the rod lens of cystoscope 2207 with an optical fiber or similar material that is
permanently mounted within hub 2205 and sheath 2206.
         [0445]      Referring now to Figs. 133(a) through 133(c), 134, 135, 136(a), 136(b),
137(a), and 137(b), there are shown various views of a fourth alternate embodiment of a
removal device, the fourth alternate embodiment of the removal device being represented
generally by reference numeral 2501.

         [0446]     Removal device 2501 may be similar in many respects to removal device
2201. A difference between the two removal devices may be that removal device 2501 may
be, in its entirety, a disposable single-use device.  Removal device 2501 may comprise a
cystoscope 2503, a handle assembly 2505, a jaw assembly 2507, a sheath 2509, a wire 2511,
and a plurality of cannulated needles 2513-1 through 2513-3.
         [0447]     Cystoscope 2503, which may be made of suitable materials for a single-use,
may comprise an optical fiber 2515, an eyepiece 2517, and a light guide 2519.
         [0448]     Handle assembly 2505, which is also shown separately in Fig. 138, may be
a unitary structure shaped to comprise a hub 2521, a first member 2523, and a second member
2525.    Hub 2521 may be generally tubular in shape and may be dimensioned for insertion
therethrough of the distal end of cystoscope 2503.      First member 2523 may be shaped to
comprise an elongated arm portion 2527. A transversely-extending ring portion 2529, which
may be appropriately dimensioned to receive, for example, the thumb of a user, may be
disposed at one end of arm portion 2527. Second member 2525 may be shaped to comprise
an elongated arm portion 2531.     A transversely-extending ring portion 2533, which may be
appropriately dimensioned to receive, for example, the forefinger of a user, and a finger rest
2535, which may be appropriately dimensioned to receive, for example, the middle finger of a
user, may be disposed at one end of arm portion 2531. The opposite end of arm portion 2531
may be joined to hub 2521. First member 2523 may be coupled to second member 2525 for
pivotal movement relative thereto by living hinge member 2537. In this manner, first member
2523 and second member 2525 may be operated much like a pair of scissors, albeit with first
member 2523 being regarded as a movable member and with second member 2525 being
regarded as a stationary member. It is to be understood, however, that handle assembly 2505
could be modified so that both first member 2523 and second member 2525 are movable.
         [0449]     Jaw assembly 2507, which is also shown separately in Figs. 139(a) through
 139(c), 140(a) and 140(b), may be a unitary structure shaped to comprise a hub 2541, a first
jaw 2543, and a second jaw 2545. Hub 2541 may be generally tubular in shape and may be
dimensioned to securely receive the distal end of sheath 2509.      Jaw 2543, which may be
identical to jaw 2209, may be joined to hub 2541 by a living hinge 2547. Jaw 2545, which
may be identical to jaw 2211, may be joined to hub 2541 by a living hinge 2549.

         [0450]      Sheath 2509, which is also shown separately in Figs. 141(a) and 141(b),
may be identical to sheath 2206 and may be shaped to include a first longitudinal cavity 2561
and a second longitudinal cavity 2563.     First longitudinal cavity 2561 may be appropriately
dimensioned to receive, for example, optical fiber 2515 of cystoscope 2503.              Second
longitudinal cavity 2563 may be appropriately dimensioned to receive, for example, wire
2511. The outer surface of sheath 2509 is circumferential, allowing for sealing around the
sheath when the removal tool is placed in an access device such as 13 and 1291 described
herein.   The circumferential surface of sheath 2509 is advantageous compared to the outer
surface of 1881 and 1901 in removal device 19 described herein. The gap between 1881 and
1901 permits leakage around the valves such as 125 and 91 described herein.
         [0451]     Wire 2511, which is also shown separately in Figs. 142(a), 142(b), 143,
and 144, may be a unitary structure shaped to include a first leg 2571 and a second leg 2573.
The proximal ends of first leg 2571 and second leg 2573 may jointly form a loop 2575, which
may be secured to first member 2523 of handle assembly 2505.          The distal end of first leg
2571 may form a hook 2577, which may be secured to second jaw 2545, and the distal end of
second leg 2573 may form a hook 2579, which may be secured to first jaw 2543.
         [0452]     Cannulated needle 2513-1, which may be identical cannulated to needles
2513-2 and 2513-3, may be a unitary structure having the shape shown in Figs. 145(a) and
145(b).
         [0453]     Additional alternate embodiments to removal device 19 may comprise, in
addition to or instead of the cannulated needle, a scissor or similar structure built into jaws
1981 and 1983 to puncture device 17 as teeth 19<removed-date> hold device 17 or a razor blade
or scalpel on one jaw and a receiving slot in the other jaw.
         [0454]     With reference now to Figures 146-153 an embodiment of an inflatable cell
compression test fixture 2601 is illustrated. The inflatable cell test fixture 2601 comprises a
test vessel 2611, piston 2621, a centering disk 2625, a heater 2631, a base 2623, a bracket
post 2629, and a heater bracket 2627. Various views of an embodiment of the test vessel
2611 are illustrated in Figs. 147(a)-(d). Various views of an embodiment of the piston 2621
are illustrated in Figs. 148(a)-(d). Various views of an embodiment of centering disk 2625

are illustrated in Figs. 152(a)-(d).
          [0455]     The inflatable cell compression test fixture 2601 is assembled (base 2623,
post 2629 and bracket 2627 with fasteners) and loaded onto the base 2623 of a vertical tensile
and compression testing machine, such as an Instron, MTS, Chatillon, etc. Such machines can
measure and record force and deflection through a data acquisition system.           Data can be
recorded in some embodiments at a minimum rate of 25Hz. Distilled water can be heated and
maintained at 370 C +/-1 0 C (98'F) for the duration of the test.      The test can be performed
indoors at an ambient room temperature of 21'C (70'F). In one embodiment the test fixture
can have a load cell rated at 501bs, a cross head speed of 2 inches per minute, a minimum data
acquisition rate of 25 Hz, and a minimum crosshead travel distance of 8 inches.           The test
fixture 2601 can be used perform burst tests, deflection/deformation tests, and cyclical
compression tests on a test vessel 2605.
          [0456]     The burst, deformation, and cyclical tests can be used to evaluate various
inflatable cell materials, configurations, and wall thicknesses. Force and deformation distance
can be measured during testing. With specific reference to Fig. 153, the test fixture 2601 can
be used to simulate the clinical experience. During testing, the test sample of the inflatable
cell (i.e., balloon) 2605 resides in the test vessel 2611. The opening 2606 for the inverted tail
portion of the test sample 2605 is shown. The test sample 2605 is oriented within the test
vessel 2611 so that the opening 2606, or a portion of the opening, is not positioned adjacent
the test vessel orifice 2612. Preferably, the opening 2606 is positioned so that the opening
2606 does not contact the orifice 2612, or a portion of thereof, during operation of the test
procedure. Preferably, the test sample is oriented similar to configuration in Figure 153, such
that the opening 2606 is aligned on a plane that is substantially perpendicular to the direction
of the force applied by the piston 2621.       The test vessel has a substantially hemispherical
shaped portion with a first diameter 2613, in this embodiment the first diameter is 1.625
inches. The test vessel 2611 constrains the test sample's deformation in all directions except at
the bottom where there is a circular orifice 2612.       The circular orifice 2612 has a diameter
2617.     In one embodiment the diameter of the orifice is 0.575 inches. As the piston 2621

compresses the test sample 2605, only the portion of the test sample 2605 that aligned with
the circular orifice 2612 is able to deform.       Deformation is measured by determining the
distance the test sample extends through the orifice 2612. The configuration and testing
parameters described herein help replicate usage of the test sample 2605 in patients.          For
example, the pressure applied by the piston 2621 substantially replicates the pressure applied
in the bladder of a patient and the orifice 2612 is substantially the same as the size of the
bladder neck and urethra. The specific steps for the burst, deformation, and cyclical tests are
described below.
        [0457]      The burst test comprises the steps: (a) position the piston 2621 for testing
on the test fixture 2601; (b) orient the test sample 2605, with the desired section to be tested
pointing down, and adhere the test sample 2605 to the underside of the piston 2621; (c) zero
the force on the load cell; (d) lower the test sample 2605 into the test vessel 2611 until the test
sample 2605 is close to the bottom of the test vessel 2611; (e) set the testing speed to 2.0
inches/min and enable the data acquisition system to record force and deformation. Set the
program to complete the test if the force drops 95% of the maximum recorded value, which is
usually indicative of test sample failure.
        [0458]      The deflection/deformation test comprises the steps: (a) position the piston
2621 for testing on the test fixture 2601; (b) orient the test sample 2605, with the desired
section to be tested pointing down, and adhere the test sample 2605 to the underside of the
piston 2621; (c) zero the force on the load cell; (d) lower the test sample 2605 into the test
vessel 2611 until the test sample 2605 is close to the bottom of the test vessel 2611; (e) set
the cycle program and data acquisition system to record Force and Deflection. Set the
following parameters: (i) crosshead speed to 2.0 inches/min; (ii) set point of 4.251bs; (iii) peak
force dwell time of 0.5 seconds; (iv) 5 cycles. (f) Record the maximum deflection distance on
the 3rd cycle.
        [0459]      The cyclical compression test comprises the steps: (a) position the piston
2621 for testing on the test fixture 2601; (b) orient the test sample 2605, with the desired
section to be tested pointing down, and adhere the test sample 2605 to the underside of the
piston 2621; (c) zero the force on the load cell; (d) lower the test sample 2605 into the test
vessel 2611 until the test sample 2605 is close to the bottom of the test vessel 2611; (e) set

the cycle program and data acquisition system to record Force and Deflection. Set the

force dwell time of 0.5 seconds; (iv) 50 cycles.
        [0460]       Deformation tests determined the distance the inflatable cell deforms
through the opening 2612 in the test chamber at a force of 4.25 lbs. Burst tests determined
the distance the inflatable cell deformed and the force required for the inflatable cell to burst.
The cyclical test determined the number of cycles that the inflatable cell survives with a force
of 4.25 lbs applied in cyclic loading. Based on evaluation of empirical test data with clinical
experience the following characteristics of the inflatable cell were determined.
        [0461]       A table illustrating exemplary test data is shown in Figure 154.          The
columns are associated with different embodiments of the inflatable cell. The table is divided
into three sections, a top section, a middle section, and a bottom section. The top section
provides the characteristics of each cell. For each inflatable cell, the material, manufacturing
process, cell size, and the wall thickness is provided. The middle section provides the results
of the deformation test, burst test, and cyclical compression test. For the deformation test, the
results of the cell deformation are provided in millimeters. For the burst test, the results of the
force at burst are provided in pounds, and the results of the cell deformation ("d at burst") are
provided in millimeters. For the cyclical compression test, the results indicate whether the cell
was intact (i.e., 100%) at the end of the test. The bottom section provides pressure and
volume characteristics of the inflatable cells at pressures of 30 cmH 20 and 15 cmH 20. For
each cell, a base cell volume, cell volume at pressure (30 cmH 20 and 15 cmH 20), and
percentage change in volume from base cell volume to cell volume at pressure (30 cmH 20 and
15 cmH 20) is provided.
        [0462]       In one embodiment, preferably, the inflatable cell has a burst force of
greater than about 3 pounds, more preferably greater than about 4 pounds, more preferably
greater than about 4.9 pounds, more preferably greater than about 6 pounds, more preferably
greater than about 7 pounds, and more preferably greater than about 8 pounds.               In one
embodiment the preferred inflatable cell will deform less than about 20 millimeters, more
preferably less than about 18 millimeters, more preferably less than about 15 millimeters, more

process.
         [0468]      Embodiments of inflatable cells have been described as having certain
properties and characteristics as described in relation to specific test procedures. In some
embodiments, the cell may be substantially homogeneous such that the entirety of the
inflatable cell exhibits the properties. For example the cell wall thickness can be substantially
homogenous over the surface of the cell. In some embodiments the cell wall thickness can
vary throughout the cell. In some embodiments, a portion of the inflatable cell that is less than
the entirety of the cell can exhibit the properties. For example a portion of the inflatable cell
wall could exhibit the characteristics described.
