ABSTRACT
Described herein are compounds and compositions that are characterized by the Markush
formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), and (VI) underneath, where at least one terminal amino group
is further functionalized by bearing a group of type (i), (ii), or (iii).     Such compounds are
obtained by reacting a terminal or internal amino group with epoxides, acrylates, or aldehydes
bearing lipophilic groups. The resulting amino acid, peptide, polypeptide-lipids (named
"APPLs" in the application) are deemed useful as drug delivery systems including nucleotide
delivery to cells. Formulae (i), (ii), and (iii). See Fig. 1.

[0001]         The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S.
provisional patent application, U.S.S.N. 61/552,423, filed October 27, 2011, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
                                      Government Support
[0002]         This invention was made with government support under Grant No. R37
EB000244 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights
in this invention.
                                   Background of the Invention
[0003]         The ability to silence genes via RNA interference (RNAi) was reported by
Mello and Fire in 1998. See Fire et al., Nature (1998) 391:806-811. Since then, scientists
have rushed to take advantage of the enormous therapeutic potential driven by targeted gene
knockdown. This is evidenced by the fact that the first report of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) mediated RNAi in human beings was reported only twelve years after the
phenomenon was described in Caenorhabditiselegans. See Davis et al., Nature (2010)
464:1067-1070. It is well understood that development of genetic drugs is slowed by the
inability to deliver nucleic acids effectively in vivo. When unprotected, genetic material
injected into the bloodstream can be degraded by DNAases and RNAases, or, if not degraded,
the genetic material can stimulate an immune response. See, e.g., Whitehead et al., Nature
Reviews DrugDiscovery (2009) 8:129-138; Robbins et al., Oligonucleotides(2009) 19:89
102. Intact siRNA must then enter the cytosol, where the antisense strand is incorporated into
the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Whitehead supra). The RISC associates with
and degrades complementary mRNA sequences, thereby preventing translation of the target
mRNA into protein, i.e., "silencing" the gene.
[0004]           To overcome difficulties in delivery, nucleotides have been complexed with a
wide variety of delivery systems, including polymers, lipids, inorganic nanoparticles and
viruses. See, e.g., Peer et al. Nature Nanotechnology, (2007) 2:751-760. However, despite
promising data from ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus and
liver cancers (see, e.g., Zamora et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. (2011) 183:531-538),
                                                -1 -

    WO 2013/063468                                                              PCT/US2012/062222
the clinical use of siRNA continues to require development of safer and more effective
delivery systems. Toward this end, numerous lipid-like molecules have been developed
including poly      -amino esters and amino alcohol lipids. See, e.g., PCT Application
Publication Nos. WO 2002/031025; WO 2004/106411; WO 2008/011561; WO 2007/143659;
WO 2006/138380; and WO 2010/053572. Amino acid, peptide, polypeptide-lipids (APPL)
have also been studied for a variety of applications, including use as therapeutics,
biosurfactants, and nucleotide delivery systems. See, e.g., Giuliani et al., Cellularand
Molecular Life Sciences (2011) 68:2255-2266; Ikeda et al., CurrentMedicinal
Chemistry (2007) 14: 111263-1275; Sen, Advances in Experimental Medicine and
Biology (2010) 672:316-323; and Damen et al., Journalof Controlled Release (2010)
145:33-39. However, there continues to remain a need to investigate and develop new APPL
systems with improved properties, such as new and improved APPL nucleotide delivery
systems.

[00331]         As used herein, when the group RL is depicted as bisecting a carbon-carbon
bond, e.g., of the group of the formula (i), it is understood that RL may be substituted at either
carbon. Nucleophilic attack of an amino or amide group at the least sterically hindered
carbon of the epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine of formula (i-x) provides a group of the formula
(i-al), (i-a2), or (i-a3) (route a), while nucleophilic attack at the more sterically hindered
carbon of the epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine of formula (i-x) provides a group of the formula
(i-bl), (i-b2), or (i-b3) (route b), wherein RP is hydrogen (Scheme 6). It is understood that
compounds of the present invention may comprise a mixture of products attached thereto
arising from route (a) and route (b) depending on the preference, or lack thereof, of the mode
of addition. The bisecting group RL depicted in the Formulae seeks to encompasses all
contemplated modes of addition.

[00335]           In certain embodiments, the reaction mixture provides a mixture of APPLs
comprising more APPLs conjugated to a group of formula (i-a) than formula (i-b), e.g., the
reaction mixture comprises greater than 50%, greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater
than 80%, greater than 90%, greater than 95%, greater than 99%, between about 60% to
about 100%, between about 70% to about 100%, between about 80% to about 100%, between
about 90% to about 100%, between about 95% to about 100%, or between about 99% to
about 100%, of an APPL attached to formula (i-a).
[00336]           In certain embodiments, the epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine of formula (i-x) is
chiral, i.e., having (R) or (S) stereochemistry. Chiral epoxides, thiiranes, and aziridines can
be obtained from a variety of sources which are familiar to those skilled in the art of organic
synthesis. In some embodiments, the chiral epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine is obtained
commercially. In some embodiments, the chiral epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine is synthesized
according to methods known to those of skill in the art, such as, but not limited to the
Sharpless epoxidation of primary and secondary allylic alcohols into 2,3-epoxyalcohols (see,
e.g., Katsuki et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102, 5974; Hill et al., Org. Syn., Coll. Vol. 7,
p. 4 6 1 (1990); Vol. 63, p. 6 6 (1985); Katsuki et al., Org. React. 1996, 48, 1-300). In some
embodiments, the chiral epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine is obtained from the resolution of a
mixture (e.g., racemic mixture) of epoxides, thiiranes, or aziridines. In some embodiments,
the chiral epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine is obtained by the separation of enantiomers or
diastereoisomers using chiral chromatography. Chirality can be characterized in a variety of
ways, e.g., obtaining a crystal structure of the compound containing a heavy atom attached
thereto, obtaining the optical rotation of the compound, and/or NMR analysis after chemical
modification of the optically active compound with a chiral derivatizing agent are some
methods useful in evaluating chirality.

such groups are meant to encompass lipophilic groups (also referred to as a "lipid tail").
Lipophilic groups comprise a group of molecules that include fats, waxes, oils, fatty acids,

depending on whether or not the lipid tail comprises double bonds. The lipid tail can also
comprise different lengths, often categorized as medium (i.e., with tails between 7-12
carbons, e.g., C 7-12 alkyl or C 7- 12 alkenyl), long (i.e., with tails greater than 12 carbons and up

Additional Methods of Preparation
[00355]        As described herein, in order to provide compounds of the present invention, an
APPL precursor is treated with one or more conjugating reagents, e.g., selected from an
epoxide, thiirane, or aziridine of formula (i-x), an a, -unsaturated ester, thioester, or amide of
formula (ii-x), or an an aldehyde of formula (iii-x), to provide the APPL.

[00356]          For example, in one aspect, provided is a method of preparing an APPL
functionalized with a group of formula (i) comprising heating the precursor in an organic
solvent (e.g., EtOH) with one or more conjugating reagents of formula (i-x) to provide the
desired APPL. In certain embodiments, the mixture is heated between about 100 to about
200 'C, inclusive, e.g., about 150 'C.
[00357]          In another aspect, provided is a method of preparing an APPL functionalized
with a group of formula (ii) comprising heating the precursor in an organic solvent (e.g.,
EtOH) with one or more conjugating reagents of formula (ii-x) to provide the desired APPL.
In certain embodiments, the mixture is heated between about 50 to about 100 'C, inclusive,
e.g., about 90'C.
[00358]          In another aspect, provided is a method of preparing an APPL functionalized
with a group of formula (iii) comprising mixing the precursor in an organic solvent (e.g.,
THF) with one or more conjugating reagents of formula (iii-x) and a reducing agent (e.g.,
NaBH(OAc) 3 ) to provide the desired APPL. In certain embodiments, the temperature of the
reaction mixture is room temperature mixture.
[00359]          In certain embodiments, wherein only one conjugating reagent is used, each
instance of RL is the same in the APPL. For example, in certain embodiments, each instance
of RL is the same wherein RL is an optionally substituted alkyl. In certain embodiments, each
instance of RL is the same wherein RL is an unsubstituted alkyl. In certain embodiments,
each instance of RL is the same wherein RL is selected from the group consisting of -CH 3 ,
C 2H5 , -C 3H 7, -C 4H 9 , -C 5H11 , -C 6H 13, -C 7H15 , -C 8H 17 , -C 9 H 19 , -CioH 2 1, -CH      11 23 , -C 12H 25,
C13H27, -C   14 H 29 , -C 15H 3 1, -C 16H 33 , -C17H 35 , -C 18 H37 , -C 19H 39 , and -C 20H 4 1. In certain
embodiments, each instance of RL is the same wherein RL is an n-alkyl group selected from
C 8 H17, -C9 H 19 , -CioH21,     -C 1H23, -C12H 25 , -C    13 H2 7 , -C 14 H 29 , -C 15 H 3 1 , and -C16H33.
[00360]          Alternatively, in certain embodiments, wherein more than one conjugating
reagent is used in the conjugation reaction (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
or ten different conjugating reagents), the APPL may comprise two or more (e.g., two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten) different groups of the formula (i), (ii), and/or (iii)
attached thereto.
[00361]          For example, in certain embodiments, two different epoxides are used in the
conjugation reaction. In this instance, in certain embodiments, the APPL comprises two
different RL groups.        For example, in certain embodiments, the APPL comprises a mixture of
two different RL groups, wherein the first RL group is an optionally substituted alkyl, and the
second RL group is a polymer.

[00362]        As would be appreciated by one of skill in this art, the degree of conjugation
may be controlled by the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, starting materials,
concentration, solvent, etc.) used in the synthesis. The synthesized APPL may be purified by
any technique known in the art including, but not limited to, precipitation, crystallization,
chromatography, distillation, etc.
[00363]        In certain embodiments, the APPL is isolated as a salt. For example, in certain
embodiments, the APPL is reacted with an acid (e.g., an organic acid or inorganic acid) to
form the corresponding salt. In other embodiments, tertiary amines are alkylated to form a
quaternary ammonium salt of the APPL. The tertiary amines may be alkylated with any
alkylating agent, for example, alkyl halides such as methyl iodide may be used to from the
quaternary amino groups. The anion associated with the quaternary amine may be any
organic or inorganic anion. In certain embodiments, the anion is a pharmaceutically
acceptable anion.
[00364]        The invention also provides libraries of APPLs prepared by the inventive
methods. For example, in certain embodiments, provided is a method of screening a
compound library, the method comprising providing a plurality of different APPLs, or salts
thereof; and performing at least one assay with the compound library to determine the
presense or absence of a desired property. These APPLs may be prepared and/or screened
using high-throughput techniques involving liquid handlers, robots, microtiter plates,
computers, etc. In certain embodiments, the APPLs are screened for their ability to transfect
polynucleotides or other agents (e.g., proteins, peptides, small molecules) into the cell. For
example, in one embodiment, provided is a method of screening a compound library, the
method comprising providing a plurality of two or more different APPLs and screening the
compound library for a desired property.
[00124]        In one embodiment, a library of different APPLs is prepared in parallel. A
different precursor and/or conjugating reagent is added to each vial in a set of vials or to each
well of a multi-well plate used to prepare the library. The array of reaction mixtures is
incubated at a temperature and length of time sufficient to allow formation of the APPL. The
APPL may then be isolated and purified using techniques known in the art. The APPL may
then be screened using high-throughput techniques to identify APPLs with a desired property,
e.g., wherein the desired property is solubility in water, solubility at different pH, ability to
bind polynucleotides, ability to bind heparin, ability to bind small molecules, ability to bind
protein, ability to form microparticles, ability to increase tranfection efficiency, ability to
support cell growth, ability to support cell attachment, ability to support tissue growth, and/or

intracellular delivery of the APPL and/or an agent complexed or attached thereto to aid in
bioprocessing, e.g., for the purpose of manufacturing proteins. In certain embodiments the
APPLs may be screened for properties or characteristics useful as coatings, additives,
materials, and excipients in biotechnology and biomedical applications such as the coating of
medical devices or implants with films or multilayer films, as non-biofouling agents,
micropatterning agents, and cellular encapsulation agents. In certain embodiments the APPL
may be screened for properties or characteristics useful in gene therapy (e.g., the ability to
bind polynucleotides and/or increase in transfection efficiency), bioprocessing (e.g., aiding in
the intracellular manufacturing of proteins), or the administration and/or delivery of a
therapeutic agent (e.g., polynucleotide, small molecule, antigen, drug, protein, peptide, etc.)

    WO 2013/063468                                                           PCT/US2012/062222
[00369]        The present invention contemplates an APPL as a component of a composition.
For example, in certain embodiments, provided is a composition comprising an APPL, or salt
thereof, and an excipient, wherein the APPL is an amino acid, a linear or cyclic peptide, or a
linear or cyclic polypeptide, or structural isomer thereof, and wherein an amino or amide
group of the APPL is conjugated to a group of formula (i), (ii), or (iii). In certain
embodiments, the group of formula (i), (ii), or (iii) is attached to an amino group present on
the APPL scaffold.
[00370]        Compositions, as described herein, comprising an APPL and an excipient of
some sort may be useful in a variety of medical and non-medical applications. For example,
pharmaceutical compositions comprising an APPL and an excipient may be useful in the
delivery of an effective amount of an agent to a subject in need thereof. Nutraceutical
compositions comprising an APPL and an excipient may be useful in the delivery of an
effective amount of a nutraceutical, e.g., a dietary supplement, to a subject in need thereof.
Cosmetic compositions comprising an APPL and an excipient may be formulated as a cream,
ointment, balm, paste, film, or liquid, etc., and may be useful in the application of make-up,
hair products, and materials useful for personal hygiene, etc. Compositions comprising an
APPL and an excipient may be useful for non-medical applications, e.g., such as an emulsion
or emulsifier, useful, for example, as a food component, for extinguishing fires, for
disinfecting surfaces, for oil cleanup, etc.
[00371]        Peptides play significant roles in endogenous cellular signaling and trafficking
pathways, and offer tremendous potential in leveraging such interactions to enhance the
delivery efficiency of systems which incorporate peptide moieties. Thus, compositions
comprising an APPL and an excipient may further be useful in bioprocessing, such as a cell's
bioprocessing of a commercially useful chemical or fuel. For example, intracellular delivery
of the APPL or an agent complexed thereto may be useful in bioprocessing by maintaining
the cell's health and/or growth, e.g., in the manufacturing of proteins.
[00372]        The composition may comprise one type of APPL but may also comprise any
number of different types of APPLs, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more different types of
APPLs.
[00373]        In certain embodiments, the composition further comprises an agent, as
described herein. For example, in certain embodiments, the agent is a small molecule,
organometallic compound, nucleic acid, protein, peptide, polynucleotide, metal, targeting
agent, an isotopically labeled chemical compound, drug, vaccine, immunological agent, or an
agent useful in bioprocessing. In certain embodiments, the agent is a polynucleotide. In

certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is DNA or RNA. In certain embodiments, the RNA
is RNAi, dsRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, or antisense RNA. In certain embodiments, the
polynucleotide and the one or more APPLs are not covalently attached.
[00374]        In certain embodiments, the one or more APPLs are in the form of a particle. In
certain embodiments, the particle is a nanoparticle or microparticle. In certain embodiments,
the one or more APPLs are in the form of liposomes or micelles. It is understood that, in
certain embodiments, these APPLs self-assemble to provide a particle, micelle, or liposome.
In certain embodiments, the particle, micelle, or liposome encapsulates an agent. The agent
to be delivered by the particle, micelle, or liposome may be in the form of a gas, liquid, or
solid. The APPLs may be combined with polymers (synthetic or natural), surfactants,
cholesterol, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids etc. to form the particles. These particles may be
further combined with an excipient to form the composition.
[00375]        "Excipients" include any and all solvents, diluents or other liquid vehicles,
dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or
emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the
particular dosage form desired. General considerations in formulation and/or manufacture
can be found, for example, in Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences, Sixteenth Edition, E.
W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980), and Remington: The Science and
Practiceof Pharmacy,21st Edition (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005).
[00376]        Exemplary excipients include, but are not limited to, any non-toxic, inert solid,
semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any
type. Some examples of materials which can serve as excipients include, but are not limited
to, sugars such as lactose, glucose, and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato
starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose,
and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter
and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive
oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and
ethyl laurate; agar; detergents such as Tween 80; buffering agents such as magnesium
hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline;
Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic
compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as
coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming
agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to
the judgment of the formulator. As would be appreciated by one of skill in this art, the

excipients may be chosen based on what the composition is useful for. For example, with a
pharmaceutical composition or cosmetic composition, the choice of the excipient will depend
on the route of administration, the agent being delivered, time course of delivery of the agent,
etc., and can be administered to humans and/or to animals, orally, rectally, parenterally,
intracisternally, intravaginally, intranasally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders,
creams, ointments, or drops), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray.
[00377]        Exemplary diluents include calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium
phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, sodium
phosphate lactose, sucrose, cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, sorbitol,
inositol, sodium chloride, dry starch, cornstarch, powdered sugar, etc., and combinations
thereof.

[00397]        Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration may be in the form of
suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the particles with suitable non-irritating
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, or a suppository wax which
are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the particles.
[00398]        Solid compositions include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In
such solid compositions, the particles are mixed with at least one excipient and/or a) fillers or
extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders
such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone,
sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as

also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as
lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
[00399]        Tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and
shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical
formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a
composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part
of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions
which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.
[00400]        Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
[00401]        Compositions for topical or transdermal administration include ointments,
pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants, or patches. The APPL is
admixed with an excipient and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required.

lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates, and polyamide powder, or
mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as
chlorofluorohydrocarbons.
[00404]         Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery
of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the
microparticles or nanoparticles in a proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used
to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either
providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the particles in a polymer matrix or
gel.

[00410]        Since it is often desirable to target a particular cell, collection of cells, or tissue,
an APPL, and the complexes, liposomes, micelles, microparticles, picoparticles and
nanoparticles, prepared therefrom, may be modified to include targeting agents or targeting
regions. For example, the APPL scaffold may include a targeting region. A variety of agents
or regions that target particular cells are known in the art. See, e.g., Cotten et al., Methods
Enzym. 217:618, 1993. The targeting agents may be included throughout the particle or may
be only on the surface. The targeting agent may be a protein, peptide, carbohydrate,
glycoprotein, lipid, small molecule, nucleic acids, etc. The targeting agent may be used to
target specific cells or tissues or may be used to promote endocytosis or phagocytosis of the
particle. Examples of targeting agents include, but are not limited to, antibodies, fragments
of antibodies, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), transferrin, asialycoproteins, gp120 envelope
protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), carbohydrates, receptor ligands, sialic
acid, aptamers, etc. If the targeting agent is included throughout the particle, the targeting
agent may be included in the mixture that is used to form the particles. If the targeting agent
is only on the surface, the targeting agent may be associated with (i.e., by covalent,
hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, or other interactions) the formed particles
using standard chemical techniques.
Polynucleotide Complexes
[00411]        The present invention contemplates APPLs are particularly useful in the
administration of polynucleotides. For example, APPLs comprise secondary or tertiary
amines, and, although these amines are hindered, they are available to non-covalently interact
with a polynucleotide (e.g., DNA, RNA, synthetic analogs of DNA and/or RNA, DNA/RNA
hydrids, etc.). Polynucleotides or derivatives thereof are contacted with an APPL under
conditions suitable to form a polynucleotide/APPL non-covalent complex. The interaction of
the APPL with the polynucleotide is thought to at least partially prevent the degradation of
the polynucleotide. By neutralizing the charge on the backbone of the polynucleotide, the
neutral or slightly-positively-charged complex is also able to more easily pass through the
hydrophobic membranes (e.g., cytoplasmic, lysosomal, endosomal, nuclear) of the cell. In
certain embodiments, the complex is slightly positively charged. In certain embodiments, the
complex has a positive (-potential. In certain embodiments the        Q-potential is between   0 and
+30.

    WO 2013/063468                                                             PCT/US2012/062222
[00412]        In one aspect, provided is a method of delivering a polynucleotide to a
biological cell, comprising providing a composition comprising an APPL, or salt thereof, and
a polynucleotide; and exposing the composition to the biological cell under conditions
sufficient to facilitate delivery of the polynucleotide into the interior of the biological cell;
wherein the APPL is an amino acid, a linear or cyclic peptide, or a linear or cyclic
polypeptide, or structural isomer thereof, wherein an amino or amide group of the APPL is
conjugated to a group of formula (i), (ii), or (iii). In certain embodiments, the method is an
in vivo method. In certain embodiments, the method is an in vitro method.
[00413]        An APPL may be at least partially provided as a salt (e.g., is protonated) so as
to form a complex with the negatively charged polynucleotide. In certain embodiments, the
polynucleotide/APPL complex form particles that are useful in the delivery of
polynucleotides to cells. In certain embodiments, more than one APPL may be associated
with a polynucleotide molecule. For example, the complex may include 1-100 APPLs, 1
1000 APPLs, 10-1000 APPLs, or 100-10,000 APPLs associated with a polynucleotide
molecule.
[00414]        Increasing nitrogen:phosphate ratios have been shown to positively influence
delivery of genetic material by increasing nucleic acid binding and negatively influence
delivery by increasing toxicity. See, e.g., Incani et al., Soft Matter (2010) 6:2124-2138. In
certain embodiments, the nitrogen:phosphate ratio (i.e., the ratio between the amino groups
present in the APPL, and the phosphate groups present in the polynucleotide) is between
about 10:1 to about 50:1, inclusive. In certain embodiments, the nitrogen phosphate ratio is
between about 10:1 to about 45:1, between about 15:1 to about 45:1, or between about 20:1
to about 40:1, inclusive. In certain embodiments, the APPL:polynucleotide mass ratio is
between about 10:1 to about 20:1, inclusive. In certain embodiments, the
APPL:polynucleotide mass ratio is about 15:1. In certain embodiments, the
APPL:polynucleotide molar ratio is between about 10:1 to about 400:1, inclusive. In certain
embodiments, the APPL:polynucleotide molar ratio is between about 10:1 to about 350:1,
between about 15:1 to about 300:1, or between about 20:1 to about 250:1, inclusive.
[00415]        In certain embodiments, the complex may form a particle. In certain
embodiments, the diameter of the particles ranges from 10-500 micrometers. In certain
embodiments, the diameter of the particles ranges from 10-1200 micrometers. In certain
embodiments, the diameter of the particles ranges from 50-150 micrometers. In certain
embodiments, the diameter of the particles ranges from 10-500 nm, in certain embodiments
the diameter of the particles ranges from 10-1200 nm, and in certain embodimentsfrom 50

150 nm. The particles may be associated with a targeting agent as described below. In
certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles ranges from 10-500 pm, in certain
embodimentsthe diameter of the particles ranges from 10-1200 pm, and in certain
embodimentsfrom 50-150 pm. The particles may be associated with a targeting agent as
described below. The film architecture is precisely designed and can be controlled to 1 nm
precision with a range from 1 to 150000 nm and with a definite knowledge of its molecular
composition.
[00416]        The polynucleotide may be complexed, encapsulated by an APPL, or included
in a composition comprising an APPL. The polynucleotide may be any nucleic acid
including, but not limited to, RNA and DNA. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is
DNA. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is RNA. In certain embodiments, upon
delivery of the RNA into a cell, the RNA is able to interfere with the expression of a specific
gene in the biological cell.
[00417]        In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is an RNA that carries out RNA
interference (RNAi). The phenomenon of RNAi is discussed in greater detail, for example, in
the following references: Elbashir et al., 2001, Genes Dev., 15:188; Fire et al., 1998, Nature,

Rossi, 2006, Gene Ther., 13:553. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is a dsRNA
(double-stranded RNA). In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is an siRNA (short
interfering RNA). In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is an shRNA (short hairpin
RNA). In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is an miRNA (micro RNA). Micro
RNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded non-coding RNAs of about 21 - 23 nucleotides in
length that help regulate gene expression, particularly during development. See, e.g., Bartel,
2004, Cell, 116:28 1; Novina and Sharp, 2004, Nature, 430:161; and U.S. Patent Publication
2005/0059005; also reviewed in Wang and Li, 2007, Front.Biosci., 12:3975; and Zhao,
2007, Trends Biochem. Sci., 32:189. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is an
antisense RNA.
[00418]        In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide may be provided as an antisense
agent or RNA interference (RNAi). See, e.g., Fire et al., Nature 391:806-811, 1998.
Antisense therapy is meant to include, e.g., administration or in situ provision of single- or
double-stranded oligonucleotides or their derivatives which specifically hybridize, e.g., bind,
under cellular conditions, with cellular mRNA and/or genomic DNA, or mutants thereof, so
as to inhibit expression of the encoded protein, e.g., by inhibiting transcription and/or

discussion 127, 2000; Methods in Enzymology volumes 313-314, 1999. The binding may be
by conventional base pair complementarity, or, for example, in the case of binding to DNA
duplexes, through specific interactions in the major groove of the double helix (i.e., triple
helix formation). See, e.g., Chan et al., J. Mol. Med. 75(4):267-282, 1997.
[00419]        In some embodiments, dsRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, antisense RNA,
and/or RNAi can be designed and/or predicted using one or more of a large number of
available algorithms. To give but a few examples, the following resources can be utilized to

[00420]        The polynucleotides may be of any size or sequence, and they may be single- or
double-stranded. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is greater than 100 base pairs
long. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is greater than 1000 base pairs long and
may be greater than 10,000 base pairs long. The polynucleotide is optionally purified and
substantially pure. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is greater than 50% pure, in
certain embodiments greater than 75% pure, and in certain embodimentsgreater than 95%
pure. The polynucleotide may be provided by any means known in the art. In certain
embodiments, the polynucleotide has been engineered using recombinant techniques. See,

York, 1999); Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, 2nd Ed., ed. by Sambrook, Fritsch,
and Maniatis (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: 1989). The polynucleotide may also be
obtained from natural sources and purified from contaminating components found normally
in nature. The polynucleotide may also be chemically synthesized in a laboratory. In certain
embodiments, the polynucleotide is synthesized using standard solid phase chemistry.
[00421]        The polynucleotide may be modified by chemical or biological means. In
certain embodiments, these modifications lead to increased stability of the polynucleotide.
Modifications include methylation, phosphorylation, end-capping, etc.

[00422]        Derivatives of polynucleotides may also be used in the present invention.
These derivatives include modifications in the bases, sugars, and/or phosphate linkages of the
polynucleotide. Modified bases include, but are not limited to, those found in the following
nucleoside analogs: 2-aminoadenosine, 2-thiothymidine, inosine, pyrrolo-pyrimidine, 3
methyl adenosine, 5-methylcytidine, C5-bromouridine, C5-fluorouridine, C5-iodouridine,

phosphodiester linkage found in naturally occurring DNA and RNA. Modified linkages
include, but are not limited to, phosphorothioate and 5'-N-phosphoramidite linkages.
Combinations of the various modifications may be used in a single polynucleotide. These
modified polynucleotides may be provided by any means known in the art; however, as will
be appreciated by those of skill in this art, the modified polynucleotides may be prepared
using synthetic chemistry in vitro.
[00423]        The polynucleotides to be delivered may be in any form. For example, the
polynucleotide may be a circular plasmid, a linearized plasmid, a cosmid, a viral genome, a
modified viral genome, an artificial chromosome, etc.
[00424]        The polynucleotide may be of any sequence. In certain embodiments, the
polynucleotide encodes a protein or peptide. The encoded proteins may be enzymes,
structural proteins, receptors, soluble receptors, ion channels, pharmaceutically active
proteins, cytokines, interleukins, antibodies, antibody fragments, antigens, coagulation
factors, albumin, growth factors, hormones, insulin, etc. The polynucleotide may also
comprise regulatory regions to control the expression of a gene. These regulatory regions
may include, but are not limited to, promoters, enhancer elements, repressor elements, TATA
box, ribosomal binding sites, stop site for transcription, etc. In certain embodiments, the
polynucleotide is not intended to encode a protein. For example, the polynucleotide may be
used to fix an error in the genome of the cell being transfected.
[00425]        In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide to be delivered comprises a
sequence encoding an antigenic peptide or protein. Nanoparticles containing these

sufficient to decrease the chance of a subsequent infection and/or lessen the symptoms
associated with such an infection. The polynucleotide of these vaccines may be combined

Particles
[00427]         The present invention also contemplates APPLs useful as a delivery device.
APPLs have several properties that make them particularly suitable for delivery, including: 1)
the ability of an APPL to complex and "protect" labile agents; 2) the ability to buffer the pH
in the endosome; 3) the ability to act as a "proton sponge" and cause endosomolysis; and 4)
the ability to neutralize the charge on negatively charged agents.
[00428]         In certain embodiments, an APPL is used to form particles containing the agent
to be delivered. An APPL may be used to encapsulate agents including, but not limited to,
organic molecules (e.g., cholesterol, drugs), inorganic molecules, nucleic acids, proteins,

peptides, polynucleotides, targeting agents, isotopically labeled organic or inorganic
molecules, vaccines, immunological agents, etc. Other exemplary agents are described in
greater detail herein. These particles may include other materials such as polymers (e.g.,
synthetic polymers (e.g., PEG, PLGA), natural polymers (e.g., phospholipids)). In certain
embodiments, the APPL is mixed with one or more agents (e.g., cholesterol) and/or one or
more other materials (e.g., polymers).
[00429]        In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between 1
micrometer to 1,000 micrometers. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles
range from between from 1 micrometer to 100 micrometers. In certain embodiments, the
diameter of the particles range from between from 1 micrometer to 10 micrometers. In
certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between from 10 micrometer to
100 micrometers. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between
from 100 micrometer to 1,000 micrometers. In certain embodiments, the particles range from
1-5 micrometers. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between 1
nm to 1,000 nm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between
from 1 nm to 100 nm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from
between from 1 nm to 10 nm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range
from between from 10 nm to 100 nm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles
range from between from 100 nm to 1,000 nm. In certain embodiments, the particles range
from 1-5 nm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between 1 pm
to 1,000 pm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between from
1 pm to 100 pm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from between
from 1 pm to 10 pm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range from
between from 10 pm to 100 pm. In certain embodiments, the diameter of the particles range
from between from 100 pm to 1,000 pm. In certain embodiments, the particles range from 1
5 pm.
[00430]        The particles may be prepared using any method known in this art. These
include, but are not limited to, spray drying, single and double emulsion solvent evaporation,
solvent extraction, phase separation, simple and complex coacervation, and other methods
well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, methods of
preparing the particles are the double emulsion process and spray drying. The conditions
used in preparing the particles may be altered to yield particles of a desired size or property
(e.g., hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, external morphology, "stickiness", shape, etc.). The
method of preparing the particle and the conditions (e.g., solvent, temperature, concentration,

air flow rate, etc.) used may also depend on the agent being encapsulated and/or the
composition of the matrix.
[00431]        Methods developed for making particles for delivery of encapsulated agents are
described in the literature. See, e.g., Doubrow, M., Ed., "Microcapsules and Nanoparticles in
Medicine and Pharmacy," CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1992; Mathiowitz and Langer, J.
ControlledRelease 5:13-22, 1987; Mathiowitz et al., Reactive Polymers 6:275-283, 1987;
Mathiowitz et al., J. Apple. Polymer Sci. 35:755-774, 1988.
[00432]        If the particles prepared by any of the above methods have a size range outside
of the desired range, the particles can be sized, for example, using a sieve. The particle may
also be coated. In certain embodiments, the particles are coated with a targeting agent. In
other embodiments, the particles are coated to achieve desirable surface properties (e.g., a
particular charge).
Micelles and Liposomes
[00433]        The present invention further contemplates use of APPLs in the preparation of
micelles or liposomes. Any agent may be further included in a micelle or liposome. Micelles
and liposomes are particularly useful in delivering hydrophobic agents such as hydrophobic
small molecules. When the micelle or liposome is complexed with (e.g., encapsulates or
covers) a polynucleotide it is also referred to as a "lipoplex." Many techniques for preparing
micelle and liposomes are known in the art, and any such method may be used with an APPL
to make micelles and liposomes.
[00434]        In certain embodiments, liposomes are formed through spontaneous assembly.
In other embodiments, liposomes are formed when thin lipid films or lipid cakes are hydrated
and stacks of lipid crystalline bilayers become fluid and swell. The hydrated lipid sheets
detach during agitation and self-close to form large, multilamellar vesicles (LMV). This
prevents interaction of water with the hydrocarbon core of the bilayers at the edges. Once
these particles have formed, reducing the size of the particle can be modified through input of
sonic energy (sonication) or mechanical energy (extrusion). See, e.g., Walde, P. "Preparation
of Vesicles (Liposomes)" In Encylopedia of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology; Nalwa, H. S.
Ed. American Scientific Publishers: Los Angeles, 2004; Vol. 9, pp. 43-79; Szoka et al.,
"Comparative Properties and Methods of Preparation of Lipid Vesicles (Liposomes)" Ann.
Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467-508, 1980; each of which is incorporated herein. The
preparation of lipsomes involves preparing the APPL for hydration, hydrating the APPL with
agitation, and sizing the vesicles to achieve a homogenous distribution of liposomes. APPLs
                                               142

    WO 2013/063468                                                          PCT/US2012/062222
are first dissolved in an organic solvent to assure a homogeneous mixture of the APPL. The
solvent is then removed to form a polymer-derived film. This polymer-derived film is
thoroughly dried to remove residual organic solvent by placing the vial or flask on a vaccuum
pump overnight. Hydration of the polymer-derived film is accomplished by adding an
aqueous medium and agitating the mixture. Disruption of LMV suspensions using sonic
energy typically produces small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) with diameters in the range of
15-50 nm. Lipid extrusion is a technique in which a lipid/polymer suspension is forced
through a polycarbonate filter with a defined pore size to yield particles having a diameter
near the pore size of the filter used. Extrusion through filters with 100 nm pores typically
yields large, unilamellar polymer-derived vesicles (LUV) with a mean diameter of 120-140
nm. In certain embodiments, the amount of APPL in the liposome ranges from 30-80 mol%,
in certain embodiments40-70 mol%, and in certain embodiments 60-70 mol%. In certain
embodiments, the APPL employed further complexes an agent, such as DNA and RNA. In
such embodiments, the application of the liposome is the delivery of polynucleotides.

[00436]         It is estimated that over 10,000 human diseases are caused by genetic disorders,
which are abnormalities in genes or chromosomes. See, e.g., McClellan, J. and M.C. King,

Dermatol Sci, 2008. 51(3): p. 151-7. Many of these diseases are fatal, such as cancer, severe
hypercholesterolemia, and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. See, e.g., Frank
Kamenetsky, M., et al., Therapeutic RNAi targeting PCSK9 acutely lowers plasma
cholesterol in rodents and LDL cholesterol in nonhuman primates. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S

developments in genetics and treatment. Curr Opin Neurol, 1996. 9(5): p. 355-9. Since the
discovery of gene expression silencing via RNA interference (RNAi) by Fire and Mello (Fire,
A., et al., Potent and specific genetic interference by double-strandedRNA in Caenorhabditis
elegans. Nature, 1998. 391(6669): p. 806-11), there has been extensive effort toward
developing therapeutic applications for RNAi in humans. See, e.g., Davis, M.E., Thefirst

[00449]      In certain embodiments, the condition is a painful condition and, in certain
embodiments, the composition further includes an analgesic agent. A "painful condition"
includes, but is not limited to, neuropathic pain (e.g., peripheral neuropathic pain), central
pain, deafferentiation pain, chronic pain (e.g., chronic nociceptive pain, and other forms of
chronic pain such as post-operative pain, e.g., pain arising after hip, knee, or other
replacement surgery), pre -operative pain, stimulus of nociceptive receptors (nociceptive
pain), acute pain (e.g., phantom and transient acute pain), noninflammatory pain,
inflammatory pain, pain associated with cancer, wound pain, burn pain, postoperative pain,
pain associated with medical procedures, pain resulting from pruritus, painful bladder
syndrome, pain associated with premenstrual dysphoric disorder and/or premenstrual
syndrome, pain associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, pain associated with pre-term
labor, pain associated with withdrawl symptoms from drug addiction, joint pain, arthritic pain

reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or Reiter's arthritis), lumbosacral pain, musculo
skeletal pain, headache, migraine, muscle ache, lower back pain, neck pain, toothache,
dental/maxillofacial pain, visceral pain and the like. One or more of the painful conditions
contemplated herein can comprise mixtures of various types of pain provided above and
herein (e.g. nociceptive pain, inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, etc.). In some
embodiments, a particular pain can dominate. In other embodiments, the painful condition
comprises two or more types of pains without one dominating. A skilled clinician can
determine the dosage to achieve a therapeutically effective amount for a particular subject
based on the painful condition.
[00450]      In certain embodiments, the painful condition is inflammatory pain. In certain
embodiments, the painful condition (e.g., inflammatory pain) is associated with an
inflammatory disorder and/or an autoimmune disorder.
[00451]         In certain embodiments, the condition is a liver disease and, in certain
embodiments, the composition further includes an agent useful in treating liver disease.
Exemplary liver diseases include, but are not limited to, drug-induced liver injury (e.g.,
acetaminophen-induced liver injury), hepatitis (e.g., chronic hepatitis, viral hepatitis,
alcohol-induced hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, steatohepatitis), non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, alcohol-induced liver disease (e.g., alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, alcohol

related hereditary amyloidosis, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, primary biliary cirrhosis,
cholestatis, cystic disease of the liver, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In certain
embodiments the liver disease is associated with inflammation.
[00452]         In certain embodiments, the condition is a familial amyloid neuropathy and, in
certain embodiments, the composition further includes an agent useful in a familial amyloid
neuropathy.
[00453]         A "subject" to which administration is contemplated includes, but is not limited
to, humans (i.e., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric subject (e.g, infant, child,
adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middle-aged adult or senior adult)) and/or
other non-human animals, for example mammals [e.g., primates (e.g., cynomolgus monkeys,
rhesus monkeys); and commercially relevant mammals such as mice, rats, hampsters, cattle,
pigs, horses, sheep, goats, cats, and/or dogs] and birds (e.g., commercially relevant birds such
as chickens, ducks, geese, and/or turkeys). In certain embodiments, the subject is a non
human animal. The non-human animal may be a male or female and at any stage of
development. A non-human animal may be a transgenic animal.
[00454]      As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms "treat," "treating" and
"treatment" contemplate an action that occurs while a subject is suffering from the specified
disease, disorder or condition, which reduces the severity of the disease, disorder or
condition, or retards or slows the progression of the disease, disorder or condition
("therapeutic treatment"), and also contemplates an action that occurs before a subject begins
to suffer from the specified disease, disorder or condition ("prophylactic treatment").
[00455]      In general, the "effective amount" of an active ingredient refers to an amount
sufficient to elicit the desired biological response. As will be appreciated by those of
ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of a compound of the invention may vary
depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the pharmacokinetics of the
active ingredient, the disease being treated, the mode of administration, and the age, health,
and condition of the subject. An effective amount encompasses therapeutic and prophylactic
treatment.
[00456]      As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a "therapeutically effective
amount" of an active ingredient is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the
treatment of a disease, disorder or condition, or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms
associated with the disease, disorder or condition. A therapeutically effective amount of an
active ingredient means an amount of the active ingredient, alone or in combination with
                                                152

    WO 2013/063468                                                            PCT/US2012/062222
other agents or therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of the disease,
disorder or condition. The term "therapeutically effective amount" can encompass an amount
that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of disease or condition,
or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent.
[00457]      As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a "prophylactically effective
amount" of an active ingredient is an amount sufficient to prevent a disease, disorder or
condition, or one or more symptoms associated with the disease, disorder or condition, or
prevent its recurrence. A prophylactically effective amount of an active ingredient means an
amount of the active ingredient, alone or in combination with other agents or therapies, which
provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of the disease, disorder or condition. The
term "prophylactically effective amount" can encompass an amount that improves overall
prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent.
[00458]         The active ingredient may be administered in such amounts, time, and route
deemed necessary in order to achieve the desired result. The exact amount of the active
ingredient will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general
condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular active ingredient, its mode
of administration, its mode of activity, and the like. The active ingredient, whether the APPL
itself, or the APPL in combination with an agent, is preferably formulated in dosage unit
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. It will be understood, however,
that the total daily usage of the active ingredient will be decided by the attending physician
within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level
for any particular subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being
treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the active ingredient employed; the
specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the
patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the
specific active ingredient employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination
or coincidental with the specific active ingredient employed; and like factors well known in
the medical arts.
[00459]         The active ingredient may be administered by any route. In some embodiments,
the active ingredient is administered via a variety of routes, including oral, intravenous,
intramuscular, intra-arterial, intramedullary, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intraventricular,
transdermal, interdermal, rectal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, topical (as by powders,
ointments, creams, and/or drops), mucosal, nasal, bucal, enteral, sublingual; by intratracheal
instillation, bronchial instillation, and/or inhalation; and/or as an oral spray, nasal spray,
                                                 153

and/or aerosol. In general the most appropriate route of administration will depend upon a
variety of factors including the nature of the active ingredient (e.g., its stability in the
environment of the gastrointestinal tract), the condition of the subject (e.g., whether the
subject is able to tolerate oral administration), etc.
[00460]        The exact amount of an active ingredient required to achieve a therapeutically
or prophylactically effective amount will vary from subject to subject, depending on species,
age, and general condition of a subject, severity of the side effects or disorder, identity of the
particular compound(s), mode of administration, and the like. The amount to be administered
to, for example, a child or an adolescent can be determined by a medical practitioner or
person skilled in the art and can be lower or the same as that administered to an adult.
                                             Examples
[00461]        In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the
following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for
illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner.
Amino acid-, peptide-, and polypeptide-lipids (APPL) for drug delivery
[00462]        To address the challenges associated with delivery efficiency, specificity, and
toxicity of biological agents, we developed a potent and selective siRNA delivery system
with a broad therapeutic window through rational design and optimization of novel amino
acid-based lipid derivatives.
[00463]        Previously, our group has pursued a combinatorial synthetic approach to
develop new cationic lipids (lipidoids) for siRNA delivery. See, e.g., Akinc, A., et al., A
combinatorial library of lipid-like materialsfor delivery of RNAi therapeutics.Nat
Biotechnol, 2008. 26(5): p. 561-9; Love Kevin, T., et al., Lipid-like materialsforlow-dose, in
vivo gene silencing. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 107(5): p. 1864-9; Siegwart, D.J., et al.,
Combinatorialsynthesis of chemically diverse core-shell nanoparticlesfor intracellular
delivery. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 108(32): p. 12996-3001. A number of these compounds
have shown significant silencing effects in vivo. See, e.g., Leuschner, F., et al., Therapeutic
siRNA silencing in inflammatory monocytes in mice. Nat Biotechnol. 29(11): p. 1005-10.
Prior studies have identified key chemical and structural features and formulation methods
for the development of new materials. See, e.g., Akinc, A., et al., Development of lipidoid
siRNA formulationsfor systemic delivery to the liver. Mol Ther, 2009. 17(5): p. 872-9; Akinc,

A., et al., Targeteddelivery of RNAi therapeuticswith endogenous and exogenous ligand
based mechanisms. Mol Ther. 18(7): p. 1357-64; Semple, S.C., et al., Rationaldesign of
cationic lipids for siRNA delivery. Nat Biotechnol. 28(2): p. 172-6. For example, active
compounds possess 12 or more carbons in tail length and multiple tails. See, e.g., Love
Kevin, T., et al., Lipid-like materialsforlow-dose, in vivo gene silencing. Proc Natl Acad Sci
U S A. 107(5): p. 1864-9. In order to improve efficacy, tissue and cell-type selectivity, and
tolerability, new chemical scaffolds need to be designed and investigated.
[00464]        Amino acids are natural building blocks of peptides and proteins in nature.
Amino acid derivatives can be metabolized by the human body; therefore, these materials are
likely well tolerated and safe as therapeutics. Additionally, peptides play significant roles in
membrane transport, endogenous cellular signaling and trafficking pathways, and offer
tremendous potential in leveraging such interactions to enhance the delivery efficiency of
systems which incorporate peptide moieties. Because of their significant physiological
functions and safety in humans, amino acid-based materials, such as insulin and trastuzumab,
have been widely applied as supplements and therapeutic medicines in the clinic for diverse
diseases. Studies have shown that it is feasible to apply amino acid-derivatives for gene
delivery or siRNA delivery. See, e.g., Prata, C.A., et al., Lipophilic peptidesfor gene
delivery. Bioconjug Chem, 2008. 19(2): p. 418-20; Adami, R.C., et al., An amino acid-based
amphoteric liposomal delivery systemfor systemic administrationof siRNA. Mol Ther. 19(6):
p. 1141-5 1; Margus, H., K. Padari, and M. Pooga, Cell-penetratingpeptides as versatile
vehicles for oligonucleotidedelivery. Mol Ther. 20(3): p. 525-33. Combining the advantages
of both natural properties of amino acids and structural features of lipidoids, we applied a
strategy of structural optimization through an iterative screening process and rationally
designed a series of amino acid-based lipid derivatives. We report the design, synthesis, and
biological evaluation of this new series of amino acid-based lipid derivatives. This efficient
and rational strategy yielded a lead material cKK-E12. We systematically investigated its
delivery efficiency, tissue and cell-type selectivity, tolerability, and mechanism of action.
Current results demonstrate that this delivery system is a novel platform for efficient,
selective, and safe delivery of siRNA, which shows great potential for the treatment of
various diseases.

Example 1. Synthesis of APPLs
[00471]        Schemes A-R show the general synthetic routes to APPLs of Formula (I) to
(VI), of the present invention. Application of these methods generated a variety of APPLs,
depicted in Tables 4 and 5.
[00472]        Compounds were named by combination of the abbreviation of amino acids,
aldehydes (A), acrylates (0), amides (N), or epoxides (E), and the length of carbon chains.
For example, K-E12 represents the reaction of lysine with 1,2-epoxydodecane.

siRNA Formulations
FormulationA
[00478]         APPL, distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), cholesterol and mPEG2000
DMG were solubilized in 90% ethanol at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5. The siRNA (against
firefly luciferase or fVII) was solubilized in 10 mM citrate, pH 3 buffer at a concentration of
0.4 mg/mL. The ethanolic lipid solution and the aqueous siRNA solution were pumped by
means of a syringe pump through a microfluidic mixing chamber to spontaneously form
siRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles. Lipids were combined with siRNA at a total lipid to
siRNA ratio of 7:1 (wt:wt). These formulations were dialyzed against PBS to remove ethanol
and exchange buffer.
FormulationB
[00479]         APPLs were formulated with cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich), DSPC (1,2
distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Avanti), mPEG2000-DMG (synthesized by
Alnylam), and siRNA via a microfluidic based mixing device See, e.g., Chen, D., et al.,
Rapid Discovery of PotentsiRNA-Containing Lipid NanoparticlesEnabled by Controlled
Microfluidic Formulation.J Am Chem Soc. Formulations were then dialyzed against PBS in
3,500 MWCO dialysis cassettes (Pierce) overnight. Particles were characterized with a
modified Ribogreen assay (Invitrogen) for siRNA entrapment and dynamic light scattering
(ZetaPALS, Brookhaven Instruments) for mean particle diameter. cKK-E12 formulations
were made from cholesterol, DSPC, and mPEG2000-DMG using a similar method at a molar
ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5. This formulation afforded a particle diameter of 60-70 nm with
approximately 65% siRNA entrapment.

In Vitro Luciferase Gene Silencing
[00480]        HeLa cells, stably expressing firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase, were
seeded (14,000 cells/well) into each well of an opaque white 96-well plate(Corning-Costar)
and allowed to attach overnight in growth medium. Growth medium was composed of 90%
phenol red-free DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin
(Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with LNPs formulated with anti-luciferase siRNA by
addition of formulated particles to growth medium. Transfections were performed in
quadruplicate. Cells were allowed to grow for 1 d at 370 C, 5% C02 and were then analyzed
for luciferase expression. Control experiments were performed with Lipofectamine 2000, as
described by the vendor (Invitrogen). Firefly and Renilla luciferase expression was analyzed
using Dual-Glo assay kits (Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Victor3
luminometer (Perkin Elmer).
In Vivo Factor VII Gene Silencing in Mice
[00481]        C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Labs) were used for siRNA silencing
experiments. Prior to injection, formulations were diluted in PBS at siRNA concentrations
(SEQ ID NO 1 (siFVII sense): 5'-GGAucAucucAAGucuuAcT*T-3'; SEQ ID NO 2
(antisense): 5'-(uAAGAcuuGAGAuGAuccT*T-3') such that each mouse was administered
a dose of 0.01 mI/g body-weight. Formulations were administered intravenously via tail vein
injection. After 48 or 72 h, body-weight gain/loss was measured and mice were anaesthetized
by isofluorane inhalation for blood sample collection by retroorbital eye bleed. Serum was
isolated with serum separation tubes (Falcon tubes, Becton Dickinson) and Factor VII protein
levels were analyzed by chromogenic assay (Biophen FV11, Aniara Corporation). A standard
curve was constructed using samples from PBS-injected mice and relative Factor VII
expression was determined by comparing treated groups to untreated PBS control.
Biodistribution Cy5.5-labled siRNA-cKK-E12 formulation in mice.
[00482]        The mice mentioned above were systemically injected with formulated Cy5.5
labeled siRNA at a dose of 1 mg/kg of total siRNA. The mice were sacrificed 1 hour or 24
hours post injection; the pancreas, spleen, liver, kidneys, ovaries, uterus, heart, lungs, and
thymus as well as a section of the adipose tissue and muscle tissue were then removed and
imaged. The organs were examined with an Ivis imaging system from Caliper using an
excitation wavelength of 675nm and an emission wavelength of 720nm. The data were

processed using the Living Image software from Caliper. Signal strength of the individual
organs was normalized against the total signal strength of all organs.
In Vitro siRNA Transfection Assay and Microscopy.
[00483]        Effects of apolipoproteins were evaluated through an in vitro siRNA
transfection assay in HeLa cells as previously reported. HeLa cells, stable expressing firefly
luciferase and Renilla luciferase were seeded in an opaque white 96-well plate (Corning
Costar) overnight. Cells were transfected by cKK-E12 formulated with 50 ng of firefly
specific siLuc in quadruplicate. Apolipoproteins (Fitzgerald Industries) were incubated with
cKK-E12 formulations for 5 mins before adding to cells. After 24 h incubation at 37 C. 5%
CO2 cells were analyzed for luciferase expression using Dual-Glo assay kits (Promega), For
visualization of cell uptake, cKK-E12 was formulated with an Alexa-Fluor 647-labeled
siRNA and incubated with Hela cells for 3 h. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and stained with Hoescht. All images were acquired using
an Opera spinning disc confocal system (Perkin Elmer), and the data was analyzed using
Acapella Software (Perkin Elmer).
                                           Discussion
[00484]        Single amino acids were reacted with aldehydes, acrylates, and epoxides to
produce APPLs. The newly-synthesized single amino acid-based lipid derivatives were
evaluated for their capacity to silence hepatic genes in mice. A validated genetic target,
Factor VII (a blood clotting factor), was selected as a silencing marker. See, e.g., Akinc, A.,
et al., A combinatoriallibrary of lipid-like materialsfor delivery of RNAi therapeutics. Nat
Biotechnol, 2008. 26(5): p. 561-9. New lipid derivatives were formulated with cholesterol,
DSPC, PEG-lipid, and siRNA via a microfluidic based mixing technology. See, e.g., Chen,
D., et al., Rapid Discovery of Potent siRNA -Containing Lipid NanoparticlesEnabled by
ControlledMicrofluidic Formulation.J Am Chem Soc. Formulations that were instable in
solution or had no siRNA entrapment were not screened. Stable formulations were injected in
mice through systemic administration at a dose of 1 mg/kg (Figure 1). From this initial
screening, we identified that K-E12 was more potent than others. The hit rate (over 50%
silencing) was one out of 60 compounds (i.e. 1.7%, including those compounds not screened
due to particle instability or no entrapment of siRNA).
[00485]        The enhanced potency of K-E12 led to our design of a second set of lysine
based peptide and polypeptide-lipid derivatives. Lysine-based dipeptides were reacted with
                                               224

   WO 2013/063468                                                            PCT/US2012/062222
epoxides to give diketopiperizine APPLs. Microwave ifradiation was utilized to produce
these scaffolds, which dramatically reduced the reaction time from 3 days to 5 hours. In
addition, to further confirm the chemical structure and improve chemical availability for
large-scale synthesis, an alternative synthetic route was developed for the synthesis of cKK
E12 (Example 2). Diamine 5 was synthesized according to the method reported previously
(Bergeron, R.J., et al., MacromolecularSelf-Assembly of Diketopiperazine Tetrapeptides. J.
Am. Chem. Soc., 1994. 116(19): p. 8479-84; Kaur, N., et al., A Delineationof
Diketopiperazine Self-Assembly Processes: Understandingthe Molecular Events Involved in
N-(Fumaroyl)diketopiperazineof L-Lys (FDKP)Interactions. Mol. Pharmaceutics, 2008.
5(2): p. 294-315), which reacted with 1,2-epoxydodecane to afford cKK-E12. Compound (C)
underwent reductive amination or Michael addition reactions with dodecanal or dodecyl
acrylate to yield cKK-A12 and cKK-012. Reactions between lysine-lysine and poly-L-lysine
(molecular weight from 500-70000 g/mol) and aldehydes and acrylates were similar to those
of single amino acids.
[00486]        The silencing effects were next evaluated. Ten out of 43 compounds showed
around 50% silencing at a dose of 1 mg/kg. The hit rate of the second set of compounds was
23%, which was over 10-fold more efficient compared to the first set of materials. The results
suggested that our iterative screening process is an efficient strategy for identifying lead
compounds. The results from the second set also showed that epoxide derivatives were more
potent than aldehyde and acrylate derivatives (such as cKK-E12 vs cKK-A12 & cKK-012).
Hit materials were further tested at a lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The tail length significantly
affects silencing and 12-14 carbon tail lengths appeared favorable (cKK-E1O, -E12, -E14, &
E16). cKK-E12 was the most potent material and was selected for further exploration.
BiodistributionStudy
[00487]        A biodistribution study was performed with naked Cy5.5 labeled siRNA and
formulated cKK-E12. By subtracting the contribution of free siRNA in the formulation of
cKK-E12, over 80% of particles were located in the liver at 1 hr and most residual siRNA
was cleared by 24 hr through kidney (Figure 2).
Effects of Apolipoproteins on Cell Uptake and Gene Silencing
[00488]        Previous studies have reported that Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) was able to
enhance cell uptake and gene silencing for a certain type of materials. Akinc, A., et al.,
                                               225

Targeted delivery of RNAi therapeuticswith endogenous and exogenous ligand-based
mechanisms. Mol Ther. 18(7): p. 1357-64. In order to test the effects of diverse apoliproteins
on cell uptake and gene silencing, and explore the mechanism of action, experiments were
performed with cKK-E12 and 11 isoforms of ApoA, ApoB, ApoC, ApoE, and ApoH. Results
in Hela cells showed that most apolipoproteins did not affect cell viability with the exception
of ApoB. ApoA, ApoC, and ApoH did not show significant effects on silencing compared to
free cKK-E12 (Figure 3). However, four different ApoE isoforms significantly improved
luciferase silencing.
[00489]         The activity of cKK-E12, cKK-A12, and cKK-012 was compared with and
without addition of apoE3 (apoE3 is the dominant isoform in humans. Figure 4A). Without
addition of ApoE3, cKK-A12 was more potent than cKK-E12 and cKK-012. However, with
addition of ApoE3, the order of silencing effects was cKK-E12 > cKK-A12 > cKK-012,
which correlated well with in vivo activity. The results suggested that a cell assay with
addition of ApoE might be a practical and effective model for preliminary screening for liver
hepatocytes silencing. In addition, the cell uptake of cKK-E12 formulated with an Alexa
Fluor 647 labeled siRNA was visualized using automated confocal microscopy (Figure 4B).
