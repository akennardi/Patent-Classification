ABSTRACT
      A  pump    cover   includes  a  plurality       of   panels   that    can  be
interlocked     to   form  the pump   cover,      thereby    allowing     the  pump
cover to have      a reduced volume for       transport. The panels         include
a lid panel    and a plurality of wall panels            that  form a perimeter
wall.   The  lid    panel   is core   to     the   assembly,    with     each  wall
panel   being     first   engaged   with      the   lid   panel    and     then  an
adjacent wall panel to assembly the perimeter wall.

                                                 PUMP COVER
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
          [0001]      This     disclosure            relates        to   covers.         The    equipment          to
be     described         herein       has      particular          application            for     pump      covers
and more         particularly to                covers        for   external         surface        mount pool
pumps,          rainwater           tank        pumps,          or     similar          pumps        that        are
ordinarily            situated           outdoors            and     are       therefore           potentially
exposed        to    environmental             elements,          though       it    will      be   understood
that the cover described herein has a wide range of uses.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
          [0002]         Pump     covers        for      rainwater        tank       pumps,       pool      pumps,
etc.       are    typically          a    generally            rectangular           dome-shaped            object
formed        from     a   single        piece       plastic        molding.          The     pump     cover       is
situated         over     the    pump        with     the     pump     located        within        the     cavity
defined by the dome and sidewalls.                                The cover may have cutouts or
removable         portions         that      allow        the    passage        of pipes,         cables,        and
similar         connections           to     pass      through        the     pump      cover       to    connect
with       the    pump     within.             A    base      may     be    supplied         with      the     pump
cover.        The    pump     may       rest       on     the    base     and       the    pump      cover       may
tightly engage the base so that the base and cover stay secured.
          [0003]      Typically, pump covers are bought and collected from
retailers          such     as    pool        shops,        hardware         stores,         rainwater         tank
manufactures              and      distributors,                 specialised            pump        shops,         or
similar         points      of    sale.          The       point      of   sale      typically          receives
many      pump     covers      in     one     batch        from the       manufacturer/distributor
and     sells      the    items      individually              to   a   customer         at    the    store      who
then         transports           the         purchased            cover          to      the       final        use
destination.

          [0004]      Each      individual          pump      cover,          though      light      weight,        is
typically          bulky       and    therefore           the    freighting             costs       are    largely
due     to    the    size      of   the     object.        For     traditional            business        models,
where       multiple        items       are     shipped        to     a    single        point       of   sale      in
one     shipment,         the bulk         of    the     item and          associated           freight        costs
can       be      reduced         by      producing            the         item        in      a     shape         and
configuration             that      allows        multiple          items         to   nest       together.         By
nesting         the    items      together          for     a   single          shipment,          the    size      of
the       shipment,            and      therefore            the        shipping           costs,         is       not
significantly            greater        for multiple            items         than     for a       single      item,
and therefore the shipping cost per item can be reduced.
          [0005]        However,         for     internet         sales         channels,         the    customer
typically           requires         delivery           of     only          a     single        item     to       the
customer's           destination.             The      customer           must        therefore         bear       the
cost      of    shipping,         which      for     a    single       bulky        item      can be      as    much
or more than the item itself.
          [0006]      What is        required is an improved pump cover design.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
          [0029]        Figure      1     shows      a    pump      cover        generally            at      10   in
accordance            with     an     embodiment          of    the      present          disclosure.            The
pump       cover         10     is     depicted          in     Figure           1    in       an      assembled
configuration              and    includes        a    roof     12     and     a    perimeter           wall      14.
The pump cover 10                is shown in an exploded view in Figure 2.
          [0030]        The    exploded        view      of    Figure       2     shows       that      the     pump
cover       is     made      of    a    series        of     interlocking            panels.          A     lid    22
provides         the      roof     12,     while       side     wall      panels         24,       corner       wall
panels       26      and     end   wall      panels         28   interlock           on     their        adjacent
edges      to   define        the perimeter            wall     14,     or     at   least        a   portion       of
a   perimeter           wall.     The     wall     panels       24,     26,     28    further          interlock
with      the    lid     22    so   that     the      assembled         pump       cover       10    defines       an
internal         space       into     which     a     pump     may     be    located.           In    the      final
assembly,          the     pump    cover      10    is    a   rectangular           dome       shape,        though
other       shapes        are    contemplated            and     are     considered             to    be     within
the scope of the disclosure in its broadest form.
          [0031]        In    Figure        2,     it     can     be      further          seen        that      the
assembly        includes         a   base     16.     The base        16    is     sized       and     shaped      to
fit      within       a    lower     edge      of    the     perimeter          wall       14.      As    will     be
described           below,        the      base      16      includes         multiple            interlocking
panels       18     that      allow      the    overall        dimensions           of     the      base      to   be
reduced        for       shipping         but     assembled          on    site.         The       base       16   is
optional and may be omitted in some                              embodiments,              for example,            if
there is        a suitable surface on which to locate the pump.

         [0032]        In general use,                a pump is          located on the base                    16,  or
if     the base        is    omitted,         on a       suitable         support       surface          such     as   a
concrete        slab,        wooden      framework,             ground       etc.     The     assembled           pump
cover      10     is      then     located          over      the     pump      to    provide          protection
from     environmental              elements.            Cutouts,         apertures        or      omitted        wall
panels      may be         used     to   provide           passage        of   pump     connections,              e.g.
pipes,       inlet         and     outlet        water         flow      pipes,       electrical             cables,
fuel      lines,         etc.      to   the       pump,         as    will      be    described             in    more
detail      below.         As   is    shown        in     Figure       2,    the    rear      end wall           panel
28     may have         a   large     grid       or     similar        vent     feature          that      will,     in
use,      be   located          adjacent           a    fan      of    the     pump.       Locating           a   vent
adjacent       the pump fan             assists           the pump         to draw air            into     the pump
cover for cooling.
         [0033]        The pump        cover         may be       transported           in     a    disassembled
form     and     assembled          on    site.         In    the    present        embodiment,             each     of
the     wall     panels        24,     26,      28     and     base      panels      18    fits        within       the
lid     22   and      thus     the     size      of      the     package        can    be    reduced          to    the
size      of     the       lid     22.          The       person         skilled        in      the       art     will
recognize         that      in other embodiments, a greater number of                                        smaller
panels       may       be     created         for      further          reducing         the       size      of     the

         [0034]        The lid 22 provides a solid core                              for the assembly to
which each of the perimeter wall panels                                     may be joined. By having
the lid as the core                  component,             it may be possible to                     omit one or
more       of      the      wall       panels          while         still       providing              sufficient
structural            integrity         for       the       remaining          assembly.            Omission         of
wall      panels         can    allow       easy         connection           of    pipes,         etc.       to    the
pump.
         [0035]        The      lid      22        is       shown         in    isolation              in      a    top
perspective            in    Figure       3.     A     lower       perspective           cross         section       of
the lid 22           is    shown in Figure                4. The      lid 22       is   a single integral
molded      plastic         piece.      The       lid      22    and    other      components            described

herein         may      be     manufactured            by      injection            molding,              rotational
molding,         vacuum        forming        etc.     Suitable         materials           for      the       lid   and
other       components            include,         without        limitation,             polyethylene,                UV
stabilised             polyethylene,               high        density           polyethylene                   (HDPE),
TPE/TPV/TPU, thermoplastic elastomers, polypropylene, etc.
          [0036]       The     lid    has      a   roof     31    that      curves         downwards             into    a
substantially             vertical         sidewall         33   that      defines         a    circumference.
At    the     base of        the     side wall          33,     there      is     a   rim      34     formed        by   a
flared wall            35    that     is      angled      outward        of     the     side       wall        33.   The
flared wall            35   curves        downward into             a substantially vertical                         rim
wall 37        that has a lower rim edge 38.
          [0037]       Around       the     perimeter          of     the     rim     34,      a    plurality          of
slots       or      apertures         39      are    formed         in     the      flared          wall        35   for
accommodating              complementary              formations            on      the      wall         panels       as
will be described below.
          [0038]       An    embodiment           of   a    wall      panel       50    is     illustrated             in
Figure        5.    The wall panel              50   may be used as                an end wall panel                   28
or     a   side       wall      panel       24.     The      wall      panel        50     is      single          piece
molded        plastic        panel       that      has    an     upper       edge      51,       lower         edge    52
and two         substantially vertical                   side edges            53,     54.     The       outer face
55    of    the      wall     panel       50    may    have      various         formations              59    thereon
for      providing          venting         and     thermal          flow      of     warm        air       from     the
internal space of the pump cover.
          [0039]       One side edge 53               includes a spring clip 57 while the
opposite           side     edge      54      includes         a    slot       58     that        is      sized      and
shaped        to    receive        an equivalent             spring       clip       of    an     adjacent          wall
panel.
          [0040]       The     lower       portion       of    the     wall      panel        50,      illustrated
in      close        up    perspective              in    Figure          6,      includes             an      outward
formation           on   the      lower       edge    for     accommodating              the       base        18.   The
wall      panel       50   curves       outward        to    form a        substantially                 horizontal
ledge        61      and     then      curves         downward          to      form        a      substantially

vertical         rim       wall       62     that      finishes              at    the       lower        edge       52.     The
height        of the        rim wall           62 matches              the height              of the        base panels
18    so that         in    use,       the     inner       surface            of    the     ledge        61    rests        upon
the base panels                 18.
          [0041]        Figure         6    further          shows          the     side        edge       54    featuring
the      slot     58.       This       side        edge      54      is      recessed           inward          64     by    the
thickness         of      the panel           side wall            so that          when       the adjacent               panel
is    connected,            the     adjacent          panel        overlaps           with       the recessed               edge
64 and is substantially flush with the main panel surface 55.
          [0042]        Extending            upward        from         the      top      edge       51     of     the      wall
panel        50   are       a    plurality            of     spring           tabs        70.     Two       tabs       70    are
shown       for    each        wall      panel        50,      though          any      appropriate              number        of
tabs      70 may be provided. In various                                   embodiments, the wall panels
may have at least one tab 70.
          [0043]        A    tab 70 is           shown in side view in Figure 7 and in an
inner       perspective              view       in    Figure          8.      The      tabs       have       a   generally
triangular            shape        with       a    sloping          outer         face        71,     outer         vertical
face       77   and       a    lower       substantially                  horizontal             edge       72.      At     each
end      of    the     tab,       there        is    a    triangular               end      face       73     that       has     a
substantially               vertical            inner       edge         74.      A    connecting              portion         75
connects          the       edge       72      to     the       top       edge        51.      The      angle          of    the
sloping outer face                    71 matches the angle of the                                flared wall 35                on
the      lower      rim        of     the      lid      22      and        the     outer         vertical            face      77
matches the vertical rim wall 37.                                     The edge 72 defines a lip.
          [0044]        The      tab 70        may be         inserted           through          a   slot       39     in   the
rim 34        of the         lid     22,     as     shown       in      the     perspective              cross        section
of    Figure       9.      When      the      tab     70    is      fully        inserted,            the      inner        edge
74     engages         the       outer       face      of      the       lid     side        wall      33.       The       lower
edge       72    clears           the      upper        edge         81       of     the       slot       and       the       lip
provided         by the          lower       edge      72     will        then       rest       on    the      edge       81   to
prevent         removal           of      the       tab.        The        wall       panel         50      may       require
levering         or     similar         manipulation                and/or         the      tabs      70     may      require

deflection              in      order        for       the      tabs       70     to       be     inserted            into        the
slots         39.     The     shape and dimensions of                           the tabs            70    are created to
match         the     shape       and     dimensions             of     the      rim 34         of      the      lid      so    that
when        fully        inserted,            the       tabs       70     are       substantially                  flush        with
the lid 22.
            [0045]        The       connecting               portion         75      of     the       tab       70     provides
sufficient              resilience             to      secure        the       wall        panel        in     the       slot        of
the      lid.       However,           the     connecting             portion           also       allows          the     tab      to
be     deformed           or manipulated                   enough       so     that        the     wall       panel        can      be
removed from the lid if disassembly of the lid is required.
            [0046]        The wall panel                   50   may be used as either                            a side wall
panel         24     or   end wall           panel          28.      As     is      shown       in      Figure         2,     there
are      two       wall       panels        for      each       side       and       one      wall       panel         for      each
end.        One      end wall           panel        may be         differently               formed          with       a    large
vent        that      provides           visual          access        to     the       inside         of     the     pump,         as
well       as      providing additional                       venting.          Otherwise,              the       connections
of     this        end wall          panel       are       as   described             above.         It     will       be     noted
by     the       person         skilled          in      the     art      that        this       differently                formed
end      wall        panel        could       equally           be     employed            as     a    side        wall       panel
24.
            [0047]        The corner wall panels 26 differ from the wall panel
50     in that          the side wall panels have a                               90 degree curve. The                          side
wall panel as depicted has                                only a single tab                    for engagement with
the       lid       22    but       has      equivalent              spring          clips         and       slots         on     the
opposite            vertical           edges        similar          to     the      wall       panel         50      described
herein.
            [0048]        Figures          10     and       11   show       the      edge       53     of     the      end wall
illustrating               the       spring         clip       57.     The      spring         clip        has       an    arm       83
connected             to     the     edge       53     that      extends          inward          to     a    u-bend          85.     A
free        arm      87    extends          forward           of    the      u-bend          85     to     a    free       end       88
that       is      short       of    the     inner         surface         89    of      the     end wall.             The      clip
57     has       a   degree        of    spring           in    which       the      free       arm      87     can       flex      at

the u-bend 85 toward the connected arm 83.                                         In the relaxed state,
the      width       of    the     clip        57,     as   viewed        from     above,           is     wider      than
the slot 58 but can be compressed to fit within the slot 58.
           [0049]       Figure         12     shows       the    clip       57    of      the      wall       panel      50
passing         through         the     slot        158    of   an    adjacent          wall        panel       150.     As
the       clip       57     is      pushed          against        the       slot       158,          the      clip      57
compresses            and passes through the                     slot      158 until            the       free end 88
is     clear       of   the     inner        surface        189.     The     free      arm 87          then     springs
back       due     to the       resilience             of the      u-bend        85.    The       free       end 88      is
thus        locked       behind         the       wall      189     preventing             the       clip      57     from
being        removed       from       the      slot      158.    A projection              160      may be        formed
on     the     inner      surface         of     the     wall    panel       150     that       further         engages
the free end 88 of the free arm 87.
           [0050]      As    seen most             clearly in Figure               11,      the height of the
clip 57         is shortest at the u-bend 85                           and increases along both of
the      connecting          arm 83          and     free    arm 87.           This      allows the             clip     57
to be more            easily located in the                      slot      158 while            still providing
a    tight        engagement           between          the   clip      and      the      slot        in     the    final
engagement position.
           [0051]       Figures         13      to    15   show     a   process          for      assembling            the
pump        cover.       Initially,               two     starting         pieces          are        selected          and
joined         together.          In    the      present       example,          the      lid      panel       22    is     a
core       piece      and     is     thus       selected        as    one     of     the      initial          assembly
pieces.         A   corner panel               261     may be      selected          as     the      second      piece.
The      tabs      70   of     the      wall      panels,       including           the      corner          panel      261
are      inserted         into       the      slots       39   of    the     lid      by     angling          the    wall
panel         inward       of      the      lid      and     pushing         the      tab       up      and     outward
through the            slot until the lip                    of horizontal edge 72 has                          cleared
the      edge      81   of    the      slot       39.     The   lower       edge      of      the      corner      panel
261 is         then levered outward, pivoting at the                                   tab so that              the tab
rotates         inward       until        it     engages       the     side      wall        33    of      the   lid     22
with the horizontal edge 72                             of the      tab resting on the                      edge 81      of

the       slot       39.         The       tab      engagement             within            the      slot      prevents
removal          of      the      corner         panel         261      except           by      reversal           of    the
levering actions.
          [0052]         In     the        full         engagement               position,             the        tab        is
substantially flush with the rim of the lid.
          [0053]         As   described above, each wall panel has                                       two vertical
edges.        A    first       vertical           edge      has     a     clip         57    for      mating        with        a
slot      on    a    first      adjacent          panel        and    a    second          vertical         edge       has      a
slot       58     for       mating        with       a    clip      of       a     second          adjacent          panel.
Because each wall panel must be levered into the                                                    lid from within
the inner space                of the cover and because the clip must pass into
the     slot      of     the    adjacent          panel        from the           outside,           the     next piece
chosen       for the          assembly          should be          the      first         adjacent        panel,        i.e.
the panel on the                  side of the corner panel                           that has the              clip.         In
the present              example,         the     third       piece       is      side       wall     panel        241    and
is    shown assembled in Figure 14.
          [0054]         The    side       wall       panel       241     is       fitted         to   the      lid     from
the      inside         using      the       same       levering         action           described           above        for
the corner panel 261.                      As    the      side wall panel                   is    levered forward,
the slot          258 of       the side wall panel                     241 becomes aligned with the
clip       257     of      the    already          fitted        corner           panel        261.      The      slot       is
pushed        over         the    clip       until        the     free         arm       the      clip     snaps        into
place       behind         the    inner        surface         of   the        side       wall      panel       241.      The
tabs       of    the       side     wall       panel       241     simultaneously                   engage        the      lid
22,     thereby          securing         the      side      wall     panel           241     to    the     lid      22   and
the      corner         panel       261       at     the      same       time          and     through          the     same
action.
          [0055]         In   the      final       position         shown           in    Figure        14,     the     side
wall       panel        241    is     secured           to    the     lid       22      by     the     tabs,        and      is
further         secured         to      the      adjacent          corner          panel         261     by     the     edge
tab/slot engagement.

          [0056]          By    joining successive                      wall      panels,         continuing            in    the
same      assembly             direction            as     described             above,         the    full       perimeter
wall      may       be     assembled.                Figure          15     shows        the      assembly         once       all
but     the       last       end      wall      panel        has       been       joined.            The     final        panel
requires            a   slight         twist        during         the      assembly            to   align        the     clips
and     slots         on    both       sides       of     the      final       panel.         This     twist provides
great        rigidity            to     the      final         structure             and      serves        to     lock       all
panels        in place.
          [0057]          The pump           cover        is    most       rigid        if    all wall panels                 are
joined         to      form      a    complete           wall       perimeter.                However,          sufficient
rigidity and stability can                              still be obtained even if some                                  of the
wall      panels          are      not     utilized            and      only       a    partial       wall        perimeter
is     formed.               Using       only        a     partial           wall        perimeter           can      provide
internal             access          for      allowing             easier          and       broader          passage           of
pipes, etc.              for connection to and from the pump.
          [0058]          While        the     lid      is     shown        and      described          herein         as     the
integrating               or      core       element,            other         assembly           processes           may       be
performed.              For     example,           the wall           panels         may be         joined        to    form a
wall       perimeter,                or      portion            thereof,             and        then     the        lid       may
attached to multiple wall panels                                     simultaneously.
          [0059]          The      panel       arrangement               of     the      pump      cover       is    but      one
embodiment and the person skilled in the                                              art will recognize                    that
other panel              configurations may be created in order to reduce the
size       of      the      pump       cover        for      transport             while         allowing          easy       and
tool-free assembly of the pump cover on site.
          [0060]          For      example,           while         the      lid      is     shown       and      described
herein        as      a   single piece,                it    is      feasible          for      the   lid       to also         be
made      of     two      or more          interlocking                panels        to     further         decrease          the
size        of         the        disassembled                product             for        transport.              In       one
particular                embodiment,                 the         lid        may          be      made         from         four
interlocking               panels        in     a    similar           manner        to    the      four panels             that
form the base.

          [0061]        In a further alternative embodiment, the wall panels
may extend into                the lid section such that                   the pump cover is made
of a series of wedge portions.
          [0062]        Particular           embodiments          for       connecting            the       wall
panels          of      the       pump      together        have       been        described          herein.
Similarly,            particular          examples       of   the      tab     and      slot     formations
for    connecting             the     wall   panels      to   the     lid     have      been     described.
The     invention            in      its   broadest        form     is     not       limited       to     these
particular               connection           types        and      other          arrangements               and
mechanisms           for     connecting         the panels        of    the     pump      cover     together
will be apparent to the person skilled in the art.
          [0063]        Shown        in   Figure     2    is   a   base       16      made    up     of     four
interlocking              panels        18.   The    base     is     shown        in     more    detail         in
Figures         16 and 17.             The base 16 has         a flat        top surface 161              and a
substantially               vertical        side   wall      162.      When      the      assembled         pump
cover 10          is    located on the base              16,   the     lip defined at the                 lower
edge      of     the     wall        panels    by   the     horizontal           surface       61    and      rim
wall      62     rests       on      the   base    16.     The    base      16     is     dimensioned           to
provide a tight fit within the                         cover 10        so that the           cover 10         and
base        16      are        not      inadvertently           separated,              e.g.      by      wind.
Additional           mechanisms,           e.g.   pins,      tabs,      tek     screws,       etc.      may     be
used to secure the pump cover 10                          to the base 16              if required.
          [0064]        The      base     16   is   made      of    a     series        of   interlocking
panels        18.    Each panel may be a                single piece plastic molded item.
On    the     internal         edges      of the    panels      18    there       may be      a   series        of
complementary               engagement         formations        that       are      used     for     joining
the base pieces                18     together to      form the        single base piece                 16.    In
one embodiment,                the     formations      include       half      circular        projections
171       that         engage          similar      half      circular            slots       172.        Other
complementary               formations         and/or       methods        for      joining        the      base
panels        16   together will be apparent                   to the person skilled in the
art.      The      surface         of   the   base     panels      18     may     be    roughened,          e.g.

sand     blasted,            to    provide            a   higher        friction          surface             to     prevent
the pump from sliding freely on the base.
         [0065]         The     inner        surface         89    of    a wall        panel        50      is     shown      in
Figure        18.    The      wall       panel        may be        formed        with grooves                 185       and/or
thinned         sections          of     the      wall      material           on    the     inner          surface          89.
The    thinned          sections           facilitate            cutting         and     removal            of     sections
of    the      wall        panels         to     accommodate              any      pump      fittings,               valves,
power       leads        and      water        carrying           pipes        feeding          to     and        from       the
pump,      as necessary.                  Because the wall panels                        can be used as both
side      and        end      wall         panels,           the       pump        cover         can        be       readily
configured            to     accommodate                any    arrangement             of     pump         fittings           by
removing           the     required           section          of    any       wall     panel.          For        example,
some     pumps         have       straight            connections             that      require            openings           in
the     end      wall       panels          of     the      pump       cover        while        other          pumps        use
elbow        or     angle        fittings             that      require          the     connection                 to      pass
through a side wall panel.
         [0066]         In    one      particular             assembly          process,          the wall              panels
may be        sequentially               connected           to    the     lid      so that          the       final        wall
piece       connected           is      the     piece        into       which        the     cutouts             have       been
formed        to    accommodate             pipes         or   similar.          This     wall        piece          is     made
more      flexible           by      the      cutouts          and      therefore           may        be       easier        to
twist and deflect for fitting as the final wall piece.
         [0067]         It    will       be     understood            by     the     person         skilled             in   the
art    that        terms      of     orientation             such      as     top,     bottom,           front,            back,
left,       right,         inner,        outer,          etc.     are      used       herein        with         reference
to     the       drawings            in      order         to      provide           a    clear          and         concise
description.                Such      terms        are     not     intended           to   limit         the       examples
and embodiments                in any manner and the                        scope       of the disclosure as
defined herein will encompass                               other possible orientations                                 of the
components            as     will       be     perceived            by     the      person         skilled             in    the
art.

          [0068]        Although  embodiments     of  the   present     invention   have
been       illustrated        in  the  accompanied     drawings      and  described   in
the       foregoing         description,    it   will    be    understood     that   the
invention            is  not   limited  to  the   embodiments       disclosed,   but  is
