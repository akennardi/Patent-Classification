 ASSEMBLY FOR FORMATION OF A PROFILE ON AN AGGREGATE
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]                  The invention relates to the formation of a profile on an aggregate load
particularly but not exclusively a load of coal carried by a rail wagon.
RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0002]                  The benefit of priority is claimed from Australian Patent Application No.
2015905256 and the parent International Patent Application No. PCT/AU2016/051247, the
contents of which are each incorporated by reference.
BACKGROUND
[0003]                  An aggregate such as coal is loaded into a rail wagon from a feed chute as the
wagon passes beneath the chute. The coal flows into the wagon and accumulates in a
mound that then tapers up to a central peak. When the wagon is transported from the
loading terminal to a port, coal dust is lifted off the peak which creates an environmental
problem.
[0004]                  In one form, the present invention seeks to reduce the problem of coal dust by
applying a profile to the top of the aggregate. In another form, the invention seeks to re
distribute the aggregate to fill empty voids to reduce under loading and/or to remove
excess aggregate to avoid over loading.
[0005]                  The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information
derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement or admission or any form of suggestion that prior publication (or

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00301                  The following modes, given by way of example only, are described in order to
provide a more precise understanding of the subject matter of a preferred embodiment or
embodiments.
[0031]                  In the Figures, incorporated to illustrate features of an example embodiment,
like reference numerals are used to identify like parts throughout the Figures.
[0032]                  Figure 1 shows an assembly 1 that includes a gantry 2 with side posts 3 that are
bolted to engineered concrete footings 4 to support a platform 5 over a rail track 6. The
spacing of the posts 3 and the height of the platform 5 allow a rail carriage 7 to pass under
the platform 5. A stair 8 provides access to the platform 5.
[0033]                  The carriage 7 includes a wheeled chassis 9 to carry the carriage 7 along the
track 6. The chassis 9 supports a bin 10 that has raised walls 11 with lengthwise extending
gunnels 12. The bin 10 is designed to carry an aggregate load (not shown) such as coal.
The bin 10 has a forward end 13 and a rear end 14.
[0034]                  The gantry 2 includes a frame 15 that supports a working head 16 that is raised
and lowered into the bin 10 as the carriage 7 passes beneath the platform 5 to form the top
of the aggregate load into a preferred profile.
[0035]                  Figure 2 shows the frame 15 and working head 16 in a raised position. The
lowered position of the working head 16 is shown in dashed lines.
[0036]                  Figure 3 shows a series of high pressure jets 17 that are arranged on the post 3
of the gantry 2. The jets 17 allow high pressure water to be sprayed onto an exterior 18 of
the carriage 7 in order to clean the carriage 7 of coal dust and the like as the carriage 7 rolls
past the gantry 2. A similar series of jets are provided on the other side of the gantry 2.
[00371                  Figure 4 shows the working head 16 as including a profiling unit 19 coupled to
a beam 20. The profiling unit 19 has a roller drum 21 mounted on an axle 22. A cleaning
element 23 is fixed to an attachment 24 at a rear side 25 of the unit 19, to scrape the roller
drum clean 21 of aggregate as the roller drum 21 is rotated.

                                                          -5
[00381                  A blade 26 is mounted at a front side 27 of the unit 19. A scraper 28 is bolted
to the blade 26 to push aggregate off the gunnel 12 and into the bin 10.
[0039]                  Figure 5 shows the roller drum 21 extends across the width of the carriage 7
and includes a cylindrical centre section 29 and flared end sections 30.
[0040]                  The blade 26 is shown bolted to the working head 16 upstream of the unit 19.
The blade 26 is provided with scrapers 28 at either end so that debris is cleared from both
gunnels 12 in advance of a gauge 31 which is provided either end 32 of the roller drum 21
in the form of gauge wheels 33.
[0041]                  The cleaning element 23 extends the length of the roller drum 21 and is shaped
to match the configuration of the centre section 29 and flared end sections 30 of the drum
21.
[0042]                  Figure 5 also clearly illustrates a spray system 34 which includes manifolds 35
that connect to an array of spray nozzles 36 at a front 37 and rear 38 of the working head
16.
[00431                  Figure 6 shows the positioning of one of the gauge wheels 33 and gunnels 12.
The gauge wheel 33 is mounted on the axle 22 of the roller drum 21, inboard of a bearing
39 that supports the axle 22 in the working head 16. The engagement of the gauge wheel
33 with the gunnel 12 provides a datum or stop which sets the correct level of the unit 19
relative to the bin 10.
[0044]                  Figure 7 shows the working head 16 in a position where the gauge wheel 33 is
in engagement with the gunnel 12 such that the flared end section 30 is below the level of
the gunnel 12.
[0045]                  Figure 8 illustrates the working head 16 in a lowered position, prior to a
profiling operation. To produce a preferred profile across the top of an aggregate with the
carriage 7, the working head 16 is lowered to a position shown in dashed lines, where the
gauge wheels 33 engage the gunnels 12 and the roller drum 21 enters the bin 10 to a pre
determine level or height set by the gauge wheels 33.

                                                           -6
[00461                  Figure 9 shows the position of the blade 26 when the working head 16 is
lowered into the bin 10. The scrapers 28 are flush with the gunnels 12 and angled to deflect
aggregate and debris into the bin 10 as the carriage 7 moves under the blade 26. The blade
26 will move through any aggregate above the level of the blade 26 and push the aggregate
forward and sideward to spill into empty space within the bin 10, closer to the walls 11.
The profiling unit 19 then rolls across the top of the aggregate to conform the aggregate to
the shape of the roller drum 21.
[00471                  The profile of the illustrated roller drum 21, as described above, is ideal for
forming the aggregate into a "garden bed" profile, which has been found to have the least
tendency for releasing dust.
[0048]                  As the aggregate is profiled, the spray system 34 sprays water on the aggregate
to further suppress generation of dust, while the jets 17 clean the outside of the carriage 7.
[0049]                  It is envisaged that the water from the jets 17 may be at 2,000 psi and that the
spray system 34 may be at 72 psi. The spray system 34 and jets 17 are only activated when
the working head 16 is lowered into the profiling position, to save water and flooding of
the aggregate. The hold down pressure on the working head 16 may be subject to a release
of 50 kg of force when the gauge wheels engage the gunnels.
[0050]                  The carriage 7 may move though the gantry 2 at about 1 to 2 km/hr and the
working head 16 is designed to automatically raise and lower as the ends 13, 14 of the
carriage 7 pass underneath the platform 5, with a fail safe raised position.
[0051]                  Although a roller drum has been described as a preferred embodiment of the
profiling unit, it should be appreciated the roller drum may instead be replaced by any
other suitable structure suitable for forming the required profile in the aggregate.
[0052]                  Also, it should be appreciated the invention has been described by reference to
use with aggregate such as coal however the invention also has application to other types
of aggregate or flowable material such as grain, iron ore, road base and the like.

[00531                  Lastly, the carriage need not be a rail carriage and may instead by any other
form of transport vehicle such as a truck.
[0054]                  Whilst the present invention has been described with reference to particular
embodiments, it will be understood that many modifications will be apparent to those
skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications should be considered to fall within
the scope of the invention as broadly described and as claimed below.
