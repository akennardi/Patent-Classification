This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the entire
content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
The present invention relates to the use of an S1 P receptor modulator in the treatment or
prevention of neo-angiogenesis associated with a demyelinating disease, e.g. multiple
sclerosis.
S1 P receptor modulators are typically sphingosine analogues, such as 2-substituted 2
amino- propane-1,3-diol or 2-amino-propanol derivatives, e. g. a compound comprising a
group of formula X .
Sphingosine-1 phosphate (hereinafter "S1P") is a natural serum lipid. Presently there are
eight known S1P receptors, namely S1 P1 to S1 P8. S1 P receptor modulators are typically
sphingosine analogues, such as 2-substituted 2-amino- propane-1,3-diol or 2-amino
propanol derivatives, e. g. a compound comprising a group of formula X

wherein Z1 is a direct bond or 0, preferably 0;
each of R5z and R6z, independently, is H, or C 14 alkyl optionally substituted by 1, 2 or 3
halogen atoms;
R1z is OH, acyloxy or a residue of formula (a); and each of R2z and R3 z independently, is
H, C14 alkyl or acyl.
Group of formula X is a functional group attached as a terminal group to a moiety which
may be hydrophilic or lipophilic and comprise one or more aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic
and/or heterocyclic residues, to the extent that the resulting molecule wherein at least one
of Z and

                                                -2
Ri, is or comprises a residue of formula (a), signals as an agonist at one of more
sphingosine-1 -phosphate receptor.
S1P receptor modulators are compounds which signal as agonists at one or more
sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors, e.g. S1P1 to S1P8. Agonist binding to a S1P receptor
may e.g. result in dissociation of intracellular heterotrimeric G-proteins into Ga-GTP and
Goy-GTP, and/or increased phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied receptor and activation
of downstream signaling pathways/kinases.
The binding affinity of SiP receptor modulators to individual human SiP receptors may be
determined in following assay:
SiP receptor modulator activities of compounds are tested on the human SiP receptors
S1P 1, SiP2 , S1P 3 , SiP 4 and S1P 5. Functional receptor activation is assessed by quantifying
compound induced GTP [y-35S] binding to membrane protein prepared from transfected CHO
or RH7777 cells stably expressing the appropriate human SiP receptor. The assay
technology used is SPA (scintillation proximity based assay). Briefly, DMSO dissolved
compounds are serially diluted and added to SPA- bead (Amersham-Pharmacia) immobilised
S1P receptor expressing membrane protein (10-20gg/well) in the presence of 50 mM Hepes,
 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgC 2 , 10 pM GDP, 0.1% fat free BSA and 0.2 nM GTP [y_35S] (1200
Ci/mmol). After incubation in 96 well microtiterplates at RT for 120 min, unbound GTP [y- 35S]
is separated by a centrifugation step. Luminescence of SPA beads triggered by membrane
bound GTP [y_35S] is quantified with a TOPcount plate reader (Packard).                EC 5os are
calculated using standard curve fitting software. In this assay, the S1 P
receptor modulators preferably have a binding affinity to S1P receptor <50 nM.
Preferred S1P receptor modulators are e.g. compounds which in addition to their S1P
binding properties also have accelerating lymphocyte homing properties, e.g. compounds
which elicit a lymphopenia resulting from a re-distribution, preferably reversible, of
lymphocytes from circulation to secondary lymphatic tissue, without evoking a generalized
immunosuppression. Naive cells are sequestered; CD4 and CD8 T-cells and B-cells from the
blood are stimulated to migrate into lymph nodes (LN) and Peyer's patches (PP).
The lymphocyte homing property may be measured in following Blood Lymphocyte Depletion
assay:
A S1 P receptor modulator or the vehicle is administered orally by gavage to rats. Tail blood
for hematological monitoring is obtained on day -1 to give the baseline individual values, and
at 2, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after application. In this assay, the S1P receptor agonist or

                                                     -3
modulator depletes peripheral blood lymphocytes, e.g. by 50%, when administered at a dose
of e.g. < 20 mg/kg.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system with
chronic inflammatory demyelination leading to progressive decline of motor and sensory
functions and permanent disability. The therapy of multiple sclerosis is only partially effective,
and in most cases only offers a short delay in disease progression despite anti-inflammatory
and immunosuppressive treatment. Accordingly, there is a need for agents which are
effective in the inhibition or treatment of demyelinating diseases, e.g. multiple sclerosis or
Guillain-Barre syndrome, including reduction of, alleviation of, stabilization of or relief from
the symptoms which affect the organism.
Characteristic    pathological features of demyelinating diseases include inflammation,
demyelination and axonal and oligodendrocyte loss. In addition lesions can also have a
significant vascular component. A firm link has recently been established between chronic
inflammation and angiogenesis and neovascularization seems to have a significant role in
the progression of disease.

                                                - 11
It has now been found that S1P receptor modulators have an inhibitory effect on neo
angiogenesis associated with demyelinating diseases, e.g. MS.
In a series of further specific or alternative embodiments, the present invention provides:
1.1     A method for preventing, inhibiting or treating neo-angiogenesis associated with a
        demyelinating disease, e.g. MS, in a subject in need thereof, comprising
        administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of an S1P receptor
        modulator, e.g. a compound of formulae I to lXb.
1.2     A method for alleviating or delaying progression of the symptoms of a demyelinating
        disease, e.g. multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome, in a subject in need
        thereof, in which method neo-angiogenesis associated with said disease is prevented
        or inhibited, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective
        amount of an SiP receptor modulator, e.g. a compound of formulae I to IXb.
1.3     A method for reducing or preventing or alleviating relapses in a demyelinating
        disease, e.g, multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome, in a subject in need
        thereof, in which method neo-angiogenesis associated with said disease is prevented
        or inhibited, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective
        amount of an S1P receptor modulator, e.g. a compound of formulae I to lXb.
1.4     A method for slowing progression of a demyelinating disease, e.g. multiple sclerosis
        or Gujillain-Barre syndrome, in a subject being in a relapsing-remitting phase of the
        disease, in which method neo-angiogenesis associated with said disease is
        prevented or inhibited, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically
        effective amount of an Si P receptor modulator, e.g. a compound of formulae I to Xlb.
1.5     A method as indicated above, wherein the S1P receptor modulator is administered
        intermittently.
        For example, the S1P receptor modulator may be administered to the subject every
        2n or 3rd day or once a week.
2.      A pharmaceutical composition for use in any one of the methods 1.1 to 1.5,
        comprising an S1 P receptor modulator, e.g. a compound of formulae I to IXb as
        defined hereinabove, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents
        or carriers therefor.

          above, for use in the preparation of a medicament for use in any one of the methods
           1.1 to 1.5.
Clinicians usually categorize patients having MS into four types of disease patterns:
      Relapsing-remitting (RR-MS): Discrete motor, sensory, cerebellar or visual attacks that
     occur over 1-2 weeks and often resolve over 1-2 months. Some patients accrue disability
    with each episode, yet remain clinically stable between relapses. About 85% of patients
     initially experience the RR form of MS, but within 10 years about half will develop the
     secondary progressive form.
.     Secondary-progressive (SP-MS): Initially RR followed by gradually increasing disability,
    with or without relapses. Major irreversible disabilities appear most often during SP.
.     Primary-progressive (PP-MS): Progression disease course from onset without any
    relapses or remissions, affecting about 15% of MS patients.
.     Progressive-relapsing (PR-MS):     Progressive disease from      onset with clear acute
     relapses; periods between relapses characterized by continuing progression.
Accordingly, the SIP receptor modulators, e.g. a compound of formulae I to IXb as defined
hereinabove, may be useful in the treatment of one or more of Relapsing-remitting (RR-MS),
Secondary-progressive (SP-MS),            Primary-progressive (PP-MS)       and      Progressive
relapsing (PR-MS).
In particular, the SIP receptor modulators as described herein, e.g. FTY720, i.e. 2-amino-2
[2-(4-octylphenyl) ethyl]propane-1,3-dio, are useful for treating PP-MS.
Utility of the S1P receptor modulators, e.g. the S1P receptor modulators comprising a group
of formula X, in preventing or treating neo-angiogenesis associated with a demyelinating
disease as hereinabove specified, may be demonstrated in animal test methods as well as in
clinic, for example in accordance with the methods hereinafter described.
In vivo: Relapsinq Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE)
Disease is induced in female Lewis rats by immunization with guinea pig spinal cord tissue
emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. This results in an acute disease within 11 days,
followed by an almost complete remission around day 16 and a relapse at around days 26.

                                              - 13
On day 26 rats are thoracectomized after having been deeply anesthetized with Isoflurane
(3%, 20 L I min) and perfused through the left ventricle of the heart. The left ventricle is
punctured with a 19 gauge needle from a winged infusion set (SV-19BLK; Termudo, Elkton,
MD), which is connected to an airtight pressurized syringe containing the rinsing solution
(NaCI 0.9% with 250,000 U/I heparin at 350C). The right atrium is punctured to provide
outflow, and the perfusate is infused under a precise controlled pressure of 120 mm Hg. The
perfusion    is continued for 5 min (at a constant rate of 20 ml/min) followed by a pre-fixation
solution (2% performaldehyde in PBS at 350C). Finally, up to 30 ml of polyurethane resin
(PUI4; Vasqtec, Zorich, Switzerland) is infused at the same rate. After 48 h, the resin-filled
brain and spinal cord are excised from the animal and the soft tissue removed by maceration
in 7.5% KOH during 24 hr at 50*C. The casts are then thoroughly cleaned with and stored in
distilled water before drying by lyophilization. These vascular casts are quantitated using
micro computer tomography.
In this assay, a S1P1 receptor modulator, e.g. Compound A significantly blocks disease
associated neo-angiogenesis when administered to the animals at a dose of from 0.1 to 20
mg/kg p.o. For example, Compound A, in the hydrochloride salt form, fully blocks disease
associated angiogenesis and completely inhibits the relapse phases when administered daily
at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg p.o. The same effect is obtained when Compound A, in the
hydrochloride salt form, is administered p.o. at 0.3 mg/kg every   2 nd or 3rd day or once a week.
C.      Clinical Trial
Investigation of clinical benefit of a S1P receptor agonist, e.g. a compound of formula 1, e.g.
Compound A.
20 patients with relapsing-remitting MS receive said compound at a daily dosage of 0.5, 1.25
or 2.5 mg p.o. The general clinical state of the patient is investigated weekly by physical and
laboratory examination, Disease state and changes in disease progression are assessed
every 2 months by radiological examination (MRI) and physical examination. Initially patients
receive treatment for 2 to 6 months, Thereafter, they remain on treatment for as long as their
disease does not progress and the drug is satisfactorily tolerated.
Main variables for evaluation: Safety (adverse events), standard serum biochemistry and
hematology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Daily dosages required in practicing the method of the present invention when a S1P
receptor modulator alone is used will vary depending upon, for example, the compound used,
the host, the mode of administration and the severity of the condition to be treated. A
preferred daily dosage range is about from 0.1 to 100 mg as a single dose or in divided

                                                 - 14
doses. Suitable daily dosages for patients are on the order of from e.g. 0.1 to 50 mg p.o. The
S1P receptor modulator may be administered by any conventional route, in particular
enterally, e.g. orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, capsules, drink solutions, nasally, pulmonary
(by inhalation) or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. Suitable
unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 0.1 to 30 mg, usually 0.25 to 30
mg S1P receptor modulator, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents
or carriers therefore. As already mentioned, the S1Preceptor modulator, e.g. Compound A,
may alternatively be administered intermittently, e.g. at a dose of 0.5 to 30 mg every other
day or once a week.
According to another embodiment of the invention, the S1P receptor modulator may be
administered as the sole active ingredient or in conjunction with, e.g. as an adjuvant to, a
VEGF-receptor antagonist.
Examples of suitable VEGF-receptor antagonist include e.g. compounds, proteins or
antibodies which inhibit the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, inhibit a VEGF receptor or bind
to VEGF, and are e.g. in particular those compounds, proteins or monoclonal antibodies
generically and specifically disclosed in WO 98/35958, e.g. 1-(4-chloroanilino)-4-(4
pyridylmethyl)phthalazine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, e.g. the succinate, in
WO 00/27820, e.g. a N-aryl(thio) anthranilic acid amide derivative e.g. 2-1(4
pyridyl)methyl]amino-N-[3-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]benzamide or 2-[(1-oxido-4
pyridyl)methyl]amino-N-[3-trifluoromethylphenyl]benzamide, or in WO 00/09495, WO

Where the S1 P receptor modulator is administered in conjunction with a VEGF-receptor
antagonist, dosages of the co-administered VEGF-receptor agonist will of course vary
depending on the type of co-drug employed, e.g. whether it is a steroid or a calcineurin
inhibitor, on the specific drug employed, on the condition being treated and so forth. In
accordance with the foregoing the present invention provides in a yet further aspect:
                5.      A method as defined above comprising co-administration, e.g.
                concomitantly or in sequence, of a therapeutically effective non-toxic amount of a
                S1 P receptor modulator and a VEGF-receptor antagonist, e.g. as indicated above.
                6.      A pharmaceutical combination, e.g. a kit, comprising a) a first agent which
                is a S1 P receptor modulator as disclosed herein, in free form or in
                pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, and b) a VEGF-receptor antagonist, e.g. as
                indicated above. The kit may comprise instructions for its administration.
The terms "co-administration" or "combined administration" or the like as utilized herein are
meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient,
and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are not necessarily
administered by the same route of administration or at the same time.
The term "pharmaceutical combination" as used herein means a product that results from
the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non
fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term "fixed combination" means that the
active ingredients, e.g. a S1 P receptor modulator and a VEGF-receptor antagonist, are both
administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term
"non-fixed combination" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a S1 P receptor modulator
and a VEGF-receptor antagonist, are both administered to a patient as separate entities
either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with no specific time limits, wherein such
administration provides therapeutically effective levels of the 2 compounds in the body of the
patient.
Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires
otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and "comprising", will be
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but
not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.
The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from it), or
to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or
admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or information derived from it)
or known matter forms part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to
which this specification relates.
