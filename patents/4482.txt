There is one page of description only

This L.E.D. headlight / tail light globe has additional functionality as Emergency warning lights. Extra L.E.D's are
incorporated at manufacturing stage of the globe to allow the headlight/ tail light globe to transition from normal
driving use, to Emergency light function.
Once the second function of the globe is activated ,the globes will flash and user selected colours indicate to other
vehicles and road users that a Hazard or Emergency vehicle is present. There is a choice of colours available
depending on service. Flashing pattern can be altered by the user.
