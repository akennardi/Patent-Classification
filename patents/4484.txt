ABSTRACT
A double cylinder deadlock lock arrangement including a deadlock control tab
slidably supported within an internal housing block such that a segment of said
deadlock control tab is extendible out from a peripheral edge of the internal
housing block to allow for a user operable engagement with said deadlock
control tab, wherein slidable retraction of the extended segment of said deadlock
control tab by a user at least substantially into the internal housing block
subsequently permits operable rotation of an internal rotatable operable cylinder
and/or the external key cylinder when a key is received within the slot of an
external key cylinder to move the arrangement from a deadlock lock unlocked
position to a deadlock lock locked position.

            A DOUBLE CYLINDER DEADBOLT LOCK ARRANGEMENT AND
 ASSEMBLY THEREOF AND A METHOD OF DOOR INSTALLATION OF SAID
            DOUBLE CYLINDER DEADBOLT LOCK ARRANGEMENT
         TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD
[001] This invention relates to double cylinder deadbolt lock and deadlatch lock
arrangements and more particularly to such arrangements that will mitigate the
risks in inadvertently deadlocking a door when there are still occupants left
within the confines of the deadlocked door.
         BACKGROUND ART DISCUSSION
[002] For the most part double cylinder operated deadlock arrangements will
accept keys on both sides of the lock and include a unique locking mechanism
wherein the deadbolt or the deadlatch itself is not retractable away from the
deadlocked position except when rotating either of the internal or external key
cylinders with a key.
[003] A problem with such arrangements that provide a deadlock utilising the
double cylinder operable control of both internal and external key cylinders is
that if the door was inadvertently deadlocked while occupants remain inside the
building, these occupants would not be able to exit out from the deadlocked
door unless they had possession of the appropriate key which would be able to
engage the internal key cylinder to disengage the deadlock.
[004] Keeping the key within the internal key cylinder of the lock for continuous
access by occupants within the building may mitigate against safety risks, but
also removes one of the important features associated with double cylinder
locks in preventing unwanted unlocking of the door by unauthorised access into
the building from another source.
                                         1

[005] For example if a thief broke into the building and preferred to exit from
the deadlocked door if the key remained within the internal key cylinder
unlocking of the deadlocked door would be possible.
[006] Accordingly it would be advantageous to be able to provide a double
cylinder deadlock arrangement either as a deadbolt or deadlatch that could
mitigate against the risks of inadvertently locking the deadlock when there are
occupants inside the building and like but also achieve this objective without
unduly eliminating one of the benefits of double cylinder deadlocks wherein
there remains the requirement of using a key with the internal key cylinder so as
to prevent unwanted unlocking of the deadlocked door.
[007] Therefore it is an object of this invention to provide for such a deadbolt
lock and/or deadlatch lock arrangement which can substantially ameliorate
those problems listed above or at least provide for an improved double cylinder
deadlock arrangement that hitherto has yet been made available.
[008] Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent
from a complete reading of this specification.
        SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[009] In one form of the invention there is provided a double cylinder deadlock
lock arrangement, said arrangement including;
[010] an internal housing block having an internal rotatable operable cylinder
supported therein said internal housing block, wherein a controlled operable
rotation of said internal rotatable operable cylinder provides for a deadlock lock
unlocked position or a deadlock lock locked position when said arrangement is
mounted to a door;
[011] an external housing block with an external key cylinder supported therein
said external housing block, wherein a controlled rotation of said external key
cylinder when a key is receivable within a slot of said external key cylinder
                                          2

provides for a deadlock lock unlocked position or a deadlock lock unlocked
position when said arrangement is mounted to the door;
[012] a deadlock control tab slidably supported within the internal housing
block such that a segment of said deadlock control tab is extendible out from a
peripheral edge of said internal housing block to allow for a user operable
engagement with said deadlock control tab, wherein slidable retraction of the
extended segment of said deadlock control tab by a user at least substantially
into the internal housing block subsequently permits operable rotation of the
internal rotatable operable cylinder and/or the external key cylinder when a key
is received within the slot of the external key cylinder to move between a
deadlock lock from an unlocked position to a deadlock lock locked position.
[013] In preference the arrangement further includes a deadlock indicator tab
slidably supported within the internal housing block such that when the internal
rotatable operable cylinder and/or the external key cylinder have been permitted
by virtue of the extended segment of the deadlock control tab being retracted
substantially into the internal housing block and subsequent rotation to provide
a deadlock lock locked position, said deadlock indicator tab is adapted to at
least partially extend out from the peripheral edge of said internal housing block
to provide a visual and tactile indicator that the arrangement is now in the
deadlock lock locked position.
[014]   In preference the peripheral edge of said internal housing block to which
the extended segment of the deadlock control tab is retractable there into and
said deadlock indicator tab is partially extendible out therefrom, is substantially
circular.
[015] In preference the deadlock control tab and the deadlock indicator tab are
symmetrically arranged on opposing sides of said circular periphery edge of the
internal housing block.
                                           3

[016] In preference the deadlock control tab and the deadlock indicator tab are
laterally or vertically arranged on opposing sided.
[017] In preference in one embodiment of the invention when the deadlock
indicator tab partially extends out from the peripheral edge of said internal
housing block to provide a visual and tactile indicator that the arrangement is in
a deadlock lock locked position, the deadlock control tab is adapted to slidably
partially extend out from the peripheral edge of said internal housing lock to the
pre-retracted position.
[018] In preference the controlled operable operation of the internal rotatable
operable cylinder from a deadlock lock unlocked position to a deadlock lock
locked position is by a user rotation of an external knob with or without a key
adapted to engage within a slot of the internal rotatable operable cylinder.
[019] In preference the controlled operable rotation of the internal rotatable
operable cylinder between a deadlock lock locked position and a deadlock lock
unlocked position requires an authorised key receivable within the slot of the
internal rotatable operable cylinder.
[020]   In one embodiment of the invention in preference the deadlock lock is a
deadbolt lock.
[021]   In a further embodiment of the invention in preference the deadlock lock
is a deadlatch lock.
[022]   In preference the deadlatch lock requires the latch to be in an extended
position from the edge of the door on the arrangement when mounted for the
deadlock control tab to be slidably retracted into the internal housing to permit
operable rotation of the internal rotatable operable cylinder or the external key
cylinder to provide a deadlatch lock locked position.
[023] Advantageously by providing a deadlock control tab for either
embodiments of the deadbolt lock or the deadlatch lock means that a conscious
                                          4

decision has to be made in order to place the lock arrangement into the
deadlocked position.
[024]   If someone is leaving the premises with the intentions of deadlocking the
door, that person will have to first of all prime the deadlock lock in order to allow
placing the lock into the deadlocked position.
[025] To do this the user must engage the slidably supported deadlock control
tab partially extending out from the peripheral edge of the internal housing
block.
[026] The user needs to retract that tab back into the internal housing block
and by doing this, this will then allow subsequent controlled rotation of either the
internal rotatable operable cylinder or the external key cylinder from the
deadlock lock unlocked position to the deadlock lock locked position.
[027] Accordingly, security and safety are considered at the time of
deadlocking the lock.
[028] Those in a hurry in leaving a building but still wish to provide a deadlock
will have to momentarily consider the consequences of deadlocking the door as
they slidably retract the deadlock control tab into the internal housing block. It is
during this action that the user engaging the double cylinder deadlock lock
arrangement can then take stock as to whether or not there are occupants
within the building and the associated risks then of deadlocking the door and
the like thereafter.
[029] Advantageously, as referred to above, in some preferred embodiments of
the invention while the operation of the locking mechanism between a deadlock
lock locked position and a deadlock lock unlocked position from the external
side of the lock arrangement will always require the use of a key within the
external key cylinder, this invention provides for operable control of the internal
cylinder simply by rotating a user accessible knob incorporated as part of the
                                            5

internal housing block to take the lock arrangement from the deadlock lock
unlocked position to the deadlock lock locked position.
[030] Importantly however so as to then prevent unwanted unlocking of the
deadlocked door from within the building subsequently thereafter there will
always be the requirement to have an authorised key being received within the
internal rotatable operable cylinder for the rotation which sees the lock
arrangement going from the deadlock locked position to the deadlock unlocked
position.
[031] Advantageously, as introduced above, this invention also in preferred
embodiments includes the use of the deadlock indicator tab such that when the
lock has been placed into the deadlock locked position at that same time the
deadlock indicator tab, because of the way it has been slidably supported and
configured within the internal housing block, is able to at least partially extend
out from the peripheral edge of the internal housing block to provide a visual
and tactile indicator that the lock is now in the deadlock lock locked position.
[032] Accordingly occupants within the building will be able to see both visually
and also tactilely by being able to engage the tab that has extended out from
the peripheral edge of the internal housing block that the lock is in the deadlock
lock locked position.
[033] In some embodiments however the use of the deadlock indicator tab may
be optional in that the recognition that the deadlock control tab has been
retracted into the internal housing block can in some instances provide an
indicator that the deadbolt or deadlatch is in, or at least ready to be in, a
deadlock lock locked position.
[034]   It is also an object in some forms of this invention to provide the
structural arrangement for a deadbolt locking assembly with the requisite user
operable trigger mechanism thereof so as to provide for a double cylinder
deadbolt lock arrangement that will be able to mitigate against the risk of
                                          6

inadvertently locking the deadbolt lock arrangement when there are occupants
inside the building but to achieve this objective without unduly eliminating one of
the benefits of double cylinder deadlocks wherein there remains the
requirement of using a key within the internal key cylinder to unlock a
deadlocked door once locked so as to prevent unauthorised unlocking of the
deadbolt lock arrangement by others whom may have enter the building without
authority.
[035] Accordingly in a further form of the invention there is provided a deadbolt
locking assembly for a double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement, said
assembly including:
[036] a lower housing block adapted to slideably support a user operable
deadlock control trigger tab, wherein a segment of the deadlock control trigger
tab is extendible out from a peripheral edge of said lower housing block for user
operable engagement when said assembly is in a deadbolt unlocked position
when a double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement is mounted to a door to be
deadbolt locked;
[037] a deadbolt holding arm pivotally supported within the lower housing
block, said deadbolt holding arm biased between a captured position when said
deadbolt holding arm is at least partially contained within a deadlock activation
tab slideably supported within the lower housing block when said assembly is in
a deadbolt unlocked position and an uncaptured biased position wherein the
deadbolt holding arm is characterised in being biasable into an assembly
deadbolt lock position or biased in the assembly deadbolt locked position;
[038] an upper housing block adapted to be rotatably engageable with said
lower housing block;
[039] said upper housing block including an underside profile with a lug
extension adapted to rotatably engage with said deadbolt holding arm, wherein
rotation of said upper housing block in a first direction relative to the lower
                                          7

housing block enables the lug extension to become biasable in engagement
with said deadbolt holding arm to be rotatable from a first position on one side
of said deadbolt holding arm to a second side of said deadbolt holding arm,
deadbolt holding arm further biased such that when the lug extension has been
rotated to the second side of the deadbolt holding arm said assembly is in the
deadbolt locked position;
[040] a rotatable deadbolt lock release cam supported within the upper
housing block wherein the rotatable deadbolt release cam includes a finger
adapted to engage the deadbolt holding arm such that authorised rotation of the
deadbolt release cam allows the finger to engage the deadbolt holding arm to
bias said deadbolt holding arm into the captured position within the deadlock
activation tab thereby allowing rotation of said upper housing block relative to
the lower housing block in a second direction for the lug extension to return to
the first side of the deadbolt holding arm thereby placing the assembly in a
deadbolt unlocked position.
[041]    In preference the deadlock activation tab slidably supported within the
lower housing block includes a segment that is adapted to at least partially
extend out from the peripheral edge of the lower housing block to provide a
visual and tactile indicator that the deadbolt locking assembly for the double
cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement has the deadbolt in a deadbolt locked
position.
[042]    In preference the upper housing block on an underside includes a track,
guide and/or abutment profiled into the underside which is adapted to engage
with a knob and/or raised section extending from the deadlock activation tab
such that during relative rotation of the lower housing block with the upper
housing block in the first direction so as to place the assembly in a deadbolt
locked position, said knob and/or raised section engages the track, guide and/or
abutment on the underside of the upper housing block so as to extend out the
indicator segment of the deadlock activation tab to provide for the visual and
                                          8

tactile indicator externally to the double cylinder deadlock arrangement so a
user is informed that the deadbolt lock is in a deadbolt locked position.
[043]    In preference the user operable deadlock control trigger tab includes an
untriggered configuration wherein the deadbolt holding arm remains captured
within the deadlock activation tab and a triggered configuration wherein the
deadbolt holding arm is in the uncaptured position no longer retained within the
deadlock activation tab.
[044]    In preference the configuration of the deadlock control trigger tab into the
trigger configuration produces a lateral slidable engagement between the
deadlock control trigger tab and the deadlock activation tab.
[045]    In preference the deadbolt holding arm substantially at one end is
pivotally supported upon the lower housing block and at a substantially
opposing end includes a distal end notch which is able to be received within a
receival slot defined within the deadlock activation tab when the deadbolt
holding arm is in the captured position.
[046]    In preference when the deadlock control trigger tab laterally slidably
engages the deadlock activation tab when the deadlock control trigger tab is in
the trigger configuration wherein lateral movement of the deadlock activation
tab releases the notch of the deadbolt holding arm from the receival slot of the
deadlock activation tab so as to bias the deadbolt holding arm away from the
captured position to the uncaptured position.
[047]    In preference the deadbolt holding arm includes a raised shoulder
wherein an external skirt or edge of the raised shoulder provides for an
interconnected engagement between a stem extending from the finger of the
deadbolt release cam such that rotation of the deadbolt release cam in the
second direction causes the interconnection engagement between the stem of
the finger attached to the deadbolt release cam and the shouldered skirt or
                                           9

edge of the raised shoulder of the deadbolt holding arm to bias the deadbolt
holding arm back into the captured position within the deadbolt activation tab.
[048]   In preference the deadlock activation tab is in communication with a
resilient spring biasing the deadlock activation tab to allow the receiving slot of
the deadlock activation tab to slidably return to its receival engagement
configuration with the deadbolt holding arm, when the deadbolt holding arm is
returned to its captured position by the deadbolt release cam.
[049]   In order to establish such a distinct locking mechanism for the
embodiments introduced above there could be a significant amount of
components associated with the locking mechanism per se, which in
conventional double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangements requires the internal
and/or external key cylinders to be intricately entwined there within the locking
mechanism for operable actioning of the lock.
[050] As either or both of the internal and external key cylinders are so
intricately involved in the workings of the locking mechanism of the deadbolt
lock arrangement, it often makes the design of the deadbolt lock quite
cumbersome being made up of almost a jigsaw combination of housing,
fastening features and locking mechanisms for which an installer must be
skilled enough to bring together into the correct configuration to then
appropriately align, mount and make operational the double cylinder deadbolt
lock arrangement within a door for which the lock will responsible for locking
and unlocking with a deadbolt lock functionality.
[051]   It would be particularly advantageous if it was possible to present to an
installer a much more simplified and streamlined design of a double cylinder
deadbolt lock arrangement that left the installer, without the requirement of
setting any components within operable positioning, and for the most part
simply require the installer to take an internal housing block, an external
housing block and a bolt assembly from it's supplied packaging to be then able
to conveniently mount these parts to the door without having to pre-position,
                                          10

assemble, align, activate or the like, the locking mechanism of the deadbolt
lock, as the mounting together of the respective internal housing block, external
housing block and the bolt assembly to the door automatically result in an
operational deadbolt lock arrangement once the pieces have been positioned
and fastened relative to the other to the door.
[052] It would also be particularly advantageous if it was possible to provide
such an easy to install, double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement having three
identifiable independent pieces, notably the internal housing block, external
housing block and the bolt assembly wherein both the internal and external key
cylinders are accessible through a sub-assembly arrangement arrangement of
the respect of the respective internal and external housing blocks without
interrupting, dislodging or coming in contact with the internal locking
mechanisms of the deadbolt lock arrangement thereby allowing locksmiths and
the like convenient accessibility to each of the internal and external key
cylinders when key lock changes are required.
[053] As introduced above many conventional locks require that the internal
and external key cylinders be intricately linked with the other components that
establish the locking mechanism thereby if a locksmith or the like needs to
access either or both of these internal and external key cylinders the locksmith
will need to disassemble many of the other features of the locking mechanism in
order to access and extricate the internal or external key cylinder for the
changing of the key details.
[054]   If the locking mechanism components need to be disassembled to
access the internal or external key cylinder, not only does this make the task of
getting access to the internal or external key cylinder more troublesome for a
locksmith, but also introduces potential ultimate deadbolt lock integrity issues
when the locksmith has to reposition back in place the internal and/or external
key cylinder with those components making up the locking mechanism which if
not correctly reassembled can result in malfunctioning or non-operation of the
deadbolt lock arrangement.
                                          11

[055] Hence in a further form of the invention there is provided a double
cylinder deadlock lock arrangement, said arrangement including:
[056] an internal housing block including a sub-assembly arrangement, said
internal housing block sub-assembly arrangement including an internal cylinder
housing enclosure having an external profile adapted for user rotation and said
internal cylinder housing enclosure having an internal profile for operably
retaining therein an internal key cylinder;
[057] a main internal housing body wherein said internal cylinder housing
enclosure is fastenable thereto, said main internal housing body characterised
by enclosing a deadbolt lock locking arrangement and providing an external
rotatable support for said internal key cylinder wherein when the internal
cylinder housing enclosure is fastened to the main internal housing body,
rotation of said internal key cylinder is adapted to in part control said deadbolt
lock locking arrangement;
[058] said main internal housing body further characterised by a pair of tab
extensions, wherein a spacing between the pair of tab extensions allows the
internal housing block to be locatable and in alignment about a bolt assembly
when said internal housing block and bolt assembly are mounted upon a door;
[059] an external housing block with a sub-assembly arrangement including an
external cylinder housing enclosure having an internal profile adapted to
operably retain an external key cylinder, a main external housing body wherein
said external cylinder housing enclosure is fastenable thereto, said main
external housing body characterised with an external operable rotatable support
of said external key cylinder, said external key cylinder in operable
communication with a spring biased spindle, wherein said spring biased spindle
is configured to pass through said bolt assembly and engage an external
receivable slot of said main internal housing body when said external housing
block is fixed thereto the internal housing block when said internal housing
block is mounted to a door such that when said spring biased spindle is
                                           12

received within the external slot of said main internal housing body said spring
biased spindle operably engages said deadbolt lock locking arrangement to
control said bolt assembly;
[060] such that when the double cylinder deadlock lock arrangement is
mounted to a door, the main internal housing body is fastened on an internal
side of the door and partially within a first bore hole defined in the door with the
pair of tab extensions located and positioned about the top and bottom of the
bolt assembly, wherein said bolt assembly is fixed within a cross-bore hole from
an edge of the door, and wherein the external housing block is fastened to an
external side of the door and partially within the first bore hole supported by
fixing screws supported by the main internal housing block when mounted to
the internal side of the door such that the spring biased spindle is in operable
engagement with the deadbolt lock locking arrangement to control said bolt
assembly.
[061] An advantage of such an arrangement is that this unique double cylinder
deadbolt lock provides for a simple three part design wherein the installer needs
only to position and mount the deadbolt assembly in the cross-bore from the
edge of the door frame to then conveniently have the internal housing block
mounted on the internal side of the door and partially within the main bore
where it is appropriately located and aligned relative to the bolt assembly by the
protruding pair of tab extensions.
[062] The external housing block is then able to be conveniently and securely
mounted to the external side of the door through fixing screws and the like
which are supported by the internal housing block which has been mounted to
the internal side of the door.
[063] Advantageously as the spindle which is able to be received within the
external slot of the main internal housing body in order to access the deadbolt
lock locking mechanism is spring biased, means that the three part deadbolt
lock arrangement can work with doors having different depths.
                                           13

[064] As the three part sections are taken from the packaging there would be
no requirement for the installer to then have to interrupt internal mechanisms of
the deadbolt lock arrangement by trying to adjust therein a spindle of an
appropriate length to match the depth of the door to which the deadbolt lock
arrangement is being mounted thereto.
[065] By having a spring biased spindle allows for an inherent adaptability to
handle doors of different depths so the deadbolt arrangement will not need to
be provided with a whole series of different spindle lengths where an installer
will have to match the right length from a selection of lengths with the depth of
the door or alternatively have to cut a longer length spindle to a reduced size
should the door be of less depth.
[066] Complexities of installation have been removed by incorporating a spring
biased spindle within the main external housing body of the external housing
block.
[067] When the installer wishes to install the deadbolt lock there is no pre
assembly of internal working componentry and parts to make the deadbolt lock
operable once mounted to the door.
[068] Advantageously the deadbolt lock arrangement becomes functionally
operable simply by putting together the three independent pieces of the internal
housing block, bolt assembly and external housing block as referred to above.
[069] Still further, advantageously this invention also utilises sub-assembly
arrangement configurations for both the internal housing block and the external
housing block wherein the sub-assemblies still avoids any necessity for an
installer or user to have to re-position any part relative to another in order to
bring about deadbolt lock functionality.
[070] The purpose of providing a sub-assembly arrangement configuration for
both the internal housing block and the external housing block is that it will allow
                                          14

easy and convenient access to both the internal and external key cylinders
without having to interrupt any of the overall internal locking mechanism
components.
[071] In the case of the internal key cylinder, as the internal cylinder housing
enclosure includes the internal profile to operably retain the internal key cylinder
which is then able to rest upon a corresponding external rotatable support of the
main internal housing body means that all one has to do in order to gain access
to the internal key cylinder is to simply dismantle the internal cylinder housing
enclosure from the main internal housing block. When these two parts of the
internal cylinder housing enclosure and the main internal housing body are
separated, there is no disengagement or falling apart of other parts and
components making up the deadbolt lock locking mechanism. The separation
simply allows for convenient access to the internal key cylinder for key
reconfiguration and the like.
[072] The same similar scenario is presented in the sub-assembly
arrangement associated with the external housing block wherein dismantling
the external cylinder housing enclosure with the internal profile which is adapted
to operably retain the external key cylinder from the main external housing
body, is that once these two parts are separated access becomes available to
the external key cylinder without having to interrupt any of the operations,
configuration and componentry associated with the spring biased spindle which
is housed and contained within the main external housing body.
[073] In preference the sub-assembly arrangement of the main internal
housing body includes a lower section with a peripheral collar to which said pair
of tab extensions extend therefrom.
[074]   In preference the lower section of the main internal housing body
peripheral collar is of a depth so as to circumferentially engage within first bore
hole defined in the door.
                                          15

[075] In preference the external receivable slot of the main internal housing
body includes a longitudinal rotatable slot of dimensions comparable to a distal
end of the spring biased spindle.
[076] In preference the bolt assembly includes a rotatable bolt controller
including a slot of comparable dimensions to the distal end of said spring biased
spindle such that when the external housing block is fixable to the main internal
housing block the spring biased spindle is adapted to pass through the slot of
bolt controller in the bolt assembly to be received within the external receivable
slot of the main internal housing body so as to operably engage the deadbolt
lock locking arrangement.
[077] In preference the spring biased spindle is supported within the sub
assembly arrangement of the main external housing body by a raised rotatable
platform.
[078] In preference the raised rotatable platform includes a pair of leg
extensions which are adapted to rotate along the external operable rotatable
support of the external key cylinder of the main external housing body such that
rotation of the external key cylinder allows a rotation of the pair of leg
extensions of the raised platform confining said spring biased spindle so as to
translate said rotational movement to corresponding rotational movement of
said spring biased spindle.
[079] Advantageously the spring biased spindle is allowed to rotate laterally as
a consequence of engagement of the external key cylinder with the leg
extensions of the raised platform. The actual biasing of the spring at the base of
the spindle enables the spindle to be resiliently pushed in and out within the
sub-assembly arrangement of the main external housing body so that it can be
of appropriate length to be able to pass through the rotatable slot of the bolt
assembly and then into the receivable slot within the main internal housing body
so as to engage the locking mechanism contained therein.
                                          16

[080] Depending on the depth of the door will then be relative to the degree in
which the spring biased spindle will extend out therefrom the main external
housing body.
[081]   In preference the main external housing body includes an upper section
wherein the circumferential diameter of the upper section is such so as to allow
the upper section to circumferentially rest within the first bore hole defined
within the door.
[082] In preference a lower section of the main external housing body includes
a separate circular base plate and a raised block.
[083] In preference the circular base plate includes a series of fastening holes
which correspond to grooves longitudinally configured along the raised block
and which also correspond to fastening holes of the external cylinder housing
enclosure operably retaining the internal key cylinder such that the sub
assembly arrangement of the external housing block are fixable together.
[084]   In preference a fixing of the external housing block to the main internal
housing block includes two fastening screws or bolts positionable along
definable pathways wherein said fastening screws or bolts include a flat resting
head, restable upon the raised collar of the main internal housing body with the
opposing terminal distal ends of said screws or bolts engaging corresponding
slots defined within the external cylinder housing enclosure retaining the
operable external key cylinder.
[085] In preference the holes to receive the fastening screws or bolts between
the main internal housing block and external housing block include identifiable
markers.
[086] An advantage of such an arrangement is that the installer is able to
recognise the location for fastening and fixing screws between the internal
housing block and the external housing block as opposed to the separation and
                                          17

access between sub-assembly arrangement parts of the internal and external
housing blocks.
[087] In preference the main internal housing block further includes an external
circular shouldered enclosing plate so that once the double cylinder deadbolt
lock arrangement has been mounted to the door the raised collar with the fixed
screws or bolts positioned therein can be covered thereby said external circular
shouldered enclosing plate providing an improved aesthetic appearance.

       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
                                        20

[0114] Referring now to the drawings in greater detail Figure 1 shows the
mounting of a double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement to a door shown
generally as (10).
[0115] The door includes an internal side (12), external side (14) and a door
edge (16).
[0116] The double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement includes an internal
housing block shown generally as (18), a bolt assembly shown generally as (20)
and an external housing block assembly shown generally as (22).
[0117] As best seen in Figure 2 the internal housing block (18) includes
deadlock control tab (32) extending out from the circular peripheral edge (30) of
the internal housing block (18).
[0118] In Figure 2 the deadlock control tab (32), which is slidably supported
within the internal housing block (18) and extends out through slot (19),
provides a user with an engageable section (32), again as best seen in Figure
2.
[0119] Figure 2 shows the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement in a
deadbolt lock unlocked position where the bolt, shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3
as (21) when extended, is in a retracted position inside the edge of the door
(16) and therefore is viewable as dashed lines (21) in Figure 2.
[0120] As the deadlock control tab segment (32) extending out from the
peripheral edge (30) of the internal housing block (18) has not been retracted
back within the internal housing block (18) this means that the internal locking
mechanism of the lock arrangement is not primed to allow the double cylinder
deadbolt lock arrangement to be moved into a deadbolt lock locked position
even if as seen in Figure 1 an authorised key (28) is received within a key slot
(29) of an external key cylinder supported within the main body (23) of the
external housing block (22).
                                        21

[0121] Also as best seen in Figure 3, if the knob (24) is rotated, shown by way
of arrow (34), with or without a key (26) inserted into the slot (27) so as to
engage the internal rotatable operable cylinder while the bolt (21) will be thrown
to lock the door the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement will however
while being locked not be in a deadbolt lock locked position as subsequent
rotation of the user controllable knob (24) of the internal housing block (18)
shown by way of arrow (35) will allow the corresponding retraction of the bolt
(21) back into the edge (16) of the door (10).
[0122] In order to be able to have the double cylinder deadbolt lock
arrangement in a status of a deadbolt lock locked position there is the
requirement for the deadlock control tab segment (32) shown by way of arrows
(36) in Figure 4 to be pushed within the internal housing block (18), which in the
preferred embodiment would be a retraction of the tab (32) back through slot
(19) on the peripheral edge (30).
[0123] As best seen in Figures 5a to 5c, now that the deadlock control tab
extended segment (32) has been engaged by the user and pushed back within
the internal housing block (18) the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement
can be placed into the deadbolt lock locked position from the scenarios
illustrated either from the inside shown generally as (38) (Figure 5b) or the
outside (40) (Figure 5c).
[0124] In the scenario shown for the inside (38) (Figure 5b), a user's hand (44)
can access the rotatable knob (24) without a key inserted into the slot (27)
which engages the internal rotatable operable cylinder (not shown) that
engages the locking mechanism within the internal housing block (18) and upon
rotation shown by arrow (42) brings about lock status from a deadbolt lock
unlocked position to a deadbolt lock locked position.
[0125] Hence in the preferred embodiment shown in Figures 5a to 5c, a user
need not have to utilise an authorised key, which in Figure 1 is shown as (26),
but providing the deadlock control tab (32) has been slid or pressed back into
                                         22

the internal housing block (18) this then structurally inherently activates the
internal lock mechanism such that subsequent rotation of the knob (24) shown
by way of arrow (42) will take the status of the bolt (21) to a deadbolt lock
locked position.
[0126] As shown in Figure 5c, the deadbolt lock locked position can also be
achieved by rotation of an authorised key (28) from the external housing block
(22), which engages the external key cylinder (not shown) supported in the
main body (23) of the external housing block (22), which communicates with the
double cylinder deadbolt lock mechanism which is permitted upon rotation of
the key (28) given that the deadlock control tab (32) has been pushed within the
internal housing block (18) to be rotatable to provide for a deadbolt lock locked
position.
[0127] Figures 6 and 7 both illustrate alternative preferred embodiments of what
happens once the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement has moved to a
deadbolt lock locked position.
[0128] As seen in Figure 6 a deadlock indicator tab (48) has extended out from
the peripheral edge (30) of the internal housing block (18).
[0129] The deadlock indicator tab (48) provides both a visual and tactile
indicator that the deadbolt lock arrangement is in the deadbolt lock locked
position. Figure 9 shows a similar representation to that shown in Figure 6
where the hand (44) of a user is able to recognise that the deadbolt lock is in
the deadbolt lock locked position because the hand (44) is able to feel the
actual tab extension (48) of the deadlock indicator tab (48) as it is now extended
out from the peripheral edge (30) of the internal housing block (18).
[0130] Hence if an occupant inside the building was blind and could not see, the
deadlock indicator tab still provides a tactile reference to show that the double
cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement is in the deadbolt lock locked position.
                                          23

[0131] Figure 7 shows the scenario that as the deadlock indicator tab (48)
extends out as the lock goes to the deadbolt lock locked position, the deadlock
control tab (32) simultaneously extends out from the peripheral edge (30) of the
internal housing block (18).
[0132] Figures 8a to 8c show schematically and generally by way of inside
operation (50) (Figure 8b) and outside (52) (Figure 8c) operation as to how the
locked status can be changed to the deadbolt lock unlocked position.
[0133] Internally the user must insert the key (26) so as to be able to rotate the
knob (24) shown by way of arrow (51) by the operation of the user's hand (44).
[0134] Alternatively as seen from the outside scenario (52) the user's hand (44)
would utilise the authorised key (28) and rotate the key (28) accordingly.
[0135] Therefore for security purposes the requirement of the use of a key both
internally and externally prevents any unwanted unlocking of the door by
someone who has entered the building illegally and wishes to exit from the door
that has been previously and deliberately placed in the deadbolt lock locked
position.
[0136] The act of the user placing the deadbolt lock in the locked position is
deliberate because, as introduced throughout Figures 2 to 9, the requirement to
permit the lock from going to the deadbolt lock locked position is done initially
only by the deliberate action of a user engaging the deadlock control tab (32)
and sliding, pushing or pressing the tab back within the internal housing block
(18).
[0137] Figures 10 to 14 for the most part are consistent with the operation
shown for the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement, however in this
preferred embodiment illustrated in Figures 10 through to 14 there is the use of
a self-latching bolt or latch (60) wherein the latch (60) does not have to be
deliberately thrown as the bolt (21) would be as part of the bolt assembly (20) in
                                          24

the preferred embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 9. The latch (60) is self
latching with a strike (not shown) within the frame (not shown) supporting the
door, which in Figure 10 in the preferred embodiment shows the internal side
thereof such a door as (62).
[0138] The internal housing block (63) of the deadlatch lock arrangement is
shown throughout Figures 10 to 14 and with the previous preferred embodiment
discussed in connection with Figures 1 to 9 includes the same kind of user
rotatable knob (64) which will be able to, as best seen in Figure 11, extend and
retract the latch (60) shown by way of corresponding arrows (72) and dashed
line imagery of the relative movement of the latch (60) between an extended
and a retracted position within the edge of the door all possible while the
deadlock control tab (66) remains extended out from the peripheral edge (65) of
the internal housing block (63).
[0139] As best seen in Figure 12, if the deadlatch lock is required to be placed
in the deadlatch lock locked position there is the requirement first of the user,
shown by way of the hand (73) engaging the deadlock control tab (66)
extending out from the periphery (65) of the internal housing block (63) to press
or push the tab (66) back inside the internal housing block (63) as shown by
way of arrows (75).
[0140] Once the deadlatch lock has been primed by way of the deadlock control
tab (66) being inserted back inside the internal housing block (63) the deadlatch
lock can be placed in the locked position by way of the internal engagement
(not shown) of a user by rotating a knob (not shown) of the internal housing
block (not shown) or alternatively by an external scenario user engagement
wherein the user uses an authorised key (not shown) to appropriately engage
the external key cylinder (not shown) in the external housing block (not shown)
where upon rotation would be allowed to place the deadlatch lock in the
deadlatch lock locked position.
                                         25

[0141] Figure 14 shows illustratively how the user's hand (73) will be prevented
from pushing in the deadlock control tab (66) shown by way of arrow (77) as the
latch (60) is in the retracted position inside the edge (59) of the door.
[0142] Referring to the drawings now in greater detail where a double cylinder
deadbolt lock arrangement is shown generally as (110) and includes three main
parts or pieces, notably the internal housing block (112), the bolt assembly or
bolt block (114) and external housing block (116).
[0143] As the illustration depicts, there is no additional unattached componentry
of the deadbolt lock that needs to be incorporated for the deadbolt to become
operational.
[0144] An installer is able to take the three parts of the double cylinder deadbolt
lock and install them conveniently onto the door, wherein the double cylinder
deadbolt lock becomes operational once mounted.
[0145] To mount the double cylinder deadbolt lock all that is required is for the
door to have the defined main bore hole at the level where the lock will be
mounted.
[0146] There will also be the requirement of the cross-bore starting from the
edge of the doorframe so that the bolt assembly (114) can be recessed and
bolted onto the edge or depth of the doorframe through the bolt assembly (114)
plate (113).
[0147] With the bolt assembly (114) mounted, the internal housing block (112)
through the tab extensions (128) and (130) can then be conveniently aligned
and located about the bolt assembly (114) to then be mounted to the door.
[0148] As will be explained in greater detail shortly hereafter, with the internal
housing block mounted to the internal side of the door, fixing screws can then
engage the corresponding external housing block so that the external housing
                                           26

block can then be securely mounted to the external surface of the door to
complete the double cylinder deadbolt lock installation.
[0149] Figure 15b shows a part exploded view of the internal housing block
(112), bolt assembly (114) and external housing block (116) so as to appreciate
how these parts also include sub-assemblies.
[0150] Referring to Figures 15b, 16, 17, 18a, 18b, 19 and 20 the internal
housing block includes a sub-assembly arrangement of an internal key cylinder
housing enclosure (118) which has an external profile adapted for a user's
thumbs rotatability (141).
[0151] Importantly the internal cylinder housing enclosure (118) as best seen in
Figure 18b also has an internal profile generally shown as (150) which includes
guide support (151) which will allow the internal key cylinder (119) to rest
therein.
[0152] There is also a resilient block (144) which assists in providing resiliency
but also an interference stabilising fit of the internal key cylinder (119) within the
profiled guide supports (151) within the internal spacing (150) of the internal key
cylinder housing enclosure (118).
[0153] Keyhole (134) allows the key access (135) of the internal key cylinder
(119) to protrude thereout from said hole (134).
[0154] Also as seen in Figure 18b slots (147) and (149) have been profiled into
the internal spacing (150) of the internal key cylinder housing enclosure (118)
so it can be attached to the other sub-assembly arrangement part, that being
the main internal housing body (120).
[0155] When access to the internal key cylinder (119) is required, all that is
required is for the internal cylinder housing enclosure (118) to be separated
from the main internal housing body (120).
                                           27

[0156] As the internal key cylinder (119) operably engages the locking
mechanism through its rotatable support on guides (143) when the internal key
cylinder (119) is withdrawn there is no interruption to the locking mechanism
components incorporated as part of the main internal housing body (120) sub
assembly arrangement of the internal housing block (112).
[0157] The main internal housing body (120) includes a lower section (127) with
a generally circular shape and dimensions and of a depth so as to be able to
comfortably rest with the defined bore hole to which the internal housing block
(112) will partially rest there within.
[0158] The pair of tab extensions (128) and (130) as best seen in Figure 16 help
to locate and align the internal housing block (112) with respect to the bolt
assembly (114).
[0159] As best seen in Figure 15b holes (137) and (139) which pass through the
circular raised collar or rim (125) of the upper section of the main internal
housing body (120) to fix the internal housing block (112) to the internal side of
the door.
[0160] Through holes (132) and (133) which include special markings (131)
provide information to the installer that these holes (132) and (133) are the main
through holes which will pass through the internal housing block (112) so as to
engage corresponding slots in the external key cylinder housing (111) which will
be discussed in greater detail, will ultimately allow the external housing block
(116) to be mounted to the external side of the door.
[0161] Figure 15b in part, Figures 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 show the external
housing block (116) and the sub-assembly arrangement parts of the external
key cylinder housing enclosure (111) and the main external housing body
shown generally as (122).
                                          28

[0162] The main external housing body (122) has a rounded raised block (167)
with a separate base plate (166). The base plate (166) includes along its
periphery circular edge slots (168) and holes (177) that match the
corresponding grooves (169) and (179) within the peripheral profile along the
circumferential edge of the rounded raised block (167) allowing for the
respective mounting and fixing screws to pass there through.
[0163] Importantly the main external housing body (122) within the raised
rounded block (167) houses a spindle (160) under a spring bias (161), wherein
the spindle is contained within guide barrel (162), which has a slot (159) that
allows the spindle (160) to pass there through. The spindle (160) and the barrel
(162) is supported upon raised platform (163) by way of leg extensions (164)
and (165) wherein rotation of the external key cylinder lock (123) rotatable
supported on guides (178) as best seen in Figure 23 will see the rotatable
movement of the spindle (160).
[0164] Accordingly the spring biased spindle not only has the ability to rotate
about its lateral axis it also has the ability to be pushed in and out thereby the
extended length of the spindle (160) can be varied depending upon the depth of
the door to which the deadbolt lock arrangement is required to be mounted
thereto.
[0165] As introduced above, rather than having to have the installer either cut
the spindle (160) and/or interrupt the locking mechanism in order to put in place
a spindle of appropriate length to fit the door of a particular depth, all these
problems are overcome as uniquely the main external housing body sub
assembly arrangement of the external housing block (116) structures itself to
support and maintain therein a spring bias for spindle (160).
[0166] As best seen in Figures 24 and 25 the external cylinder housing
enclosure (111) has an internal spacing (181) with a structured profile (182),
which will allow the external key cylinder (123) to be operably retained therein
within the profile guides (182).
                                           29

[0167] As with the internal key cylinder (119), the external key cylinder (123)
can be conveniently accessed simply by disengaging the main external housing
body (122) from the external key cylinder housing enclosure (111).
[0168] As introduced above, Figure 26 for the most part is a similar
representation to that shown in Figure 15a, however the internal housing block
(112), bolt assembly (114) and external housing block (116) are shown closer
together.
[0169] In Figure 27 it shows the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement
(110) mounted to a door (190) wherein the internal housing block is mounted to
the internal side (191) of the door (190).
[0170] Collar (117) is also included as part of the internal housing block (112) as
it provides an aesthetic appearance to cover up the fastening screws that show
on the sub-assembly arrangement of the main internal housing body (120).
[0171] The bolt assembly is positioned on the edge or depth of the door within a
set recess (192) and as discussed previously the mounting arrangement sees
the external housing block securely fixed up against the external side or surface
(193) of the door (190).
[0172] Figure 28 shows the internal housing block (112) mounted to the internal
side (191) of the door (190) with the bolt assembly (114) through the mounting
plate (113) mounted within the cross-bore hole (196) from the edge or depth
(197) of the door (190).
[0173] Figure 29 shows the external housing block (116) secured in place about
the external face or side (193) of the door (190) relative to the bolt assembly
(114).
[0174] As introduced above, this invention relates to a deadbolt locking
assembly and an operation thereof for a double cylinder deadlock arrangement
rather than a double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement per se.
                                         30

[0175] The point to be made is that the deadbolt locking assembly and the
operation thereof to be described in this preferred embodiment can be utilised in
other double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangements providing the requisite
essential features of this deadbolt locking assembly are included.
[0176] In order to place the deadbolt locking assembly in context with its use
within a double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement, Figures 30a and 30b are
provided.
[0177] In the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) there is included
three main parts or pieces, notably the internal housing block (212), the bolt
assembly or bolt block (214) and external housing (216).
[0178] In the double cylinder deadbolt arrangement (210) shown in Figures 30a
and 30b, while not shown, key cylinders incorporated in both the internal
housing block and external housing block for the most part either directly or
indirectly provide for rotational operation of the spindle (215) which is received
within the slot (217) of a drive cam (219) which is able to extend and retract the
bolt (213) from the bolt assembly (214) as required in order to place the double
cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) in the deadbolt locked or unlocked
position.
[0179] This invention focuses on the controlled operational way in which that
spindle (215) will be permitted to be rotated dependent upon the deadbolt
locking assembly which will be enclosed within the internal housing block (212)
in this preferred embodiment of the invention.
[0180] Notably shown in Figures 30a and 30b is an essential aspect of the
deadbolt locking assembly of this invention, that being the segment of the user
operable deadlock control trigger tab (222) which is extendable out from the
peripheral edge of the internal housing block (212) for user operable
engagement.
                                          31

[0181] As will be explained in greater detail shortly hereafter, when the user
pushes the deadlock control trigger tab (222) into the internal housing block
(212) or as illustrated in greater detail within the lower housing block (220)
enclosed within the internal housing block (212) this then primes the double
cylinder deadlock arrangement (210) which will then permit a user by way of
inserting a key into the external housing block (216) or by rotating the knob
(209) of the internal housing block (212) so as to provide for a configuration that
has the deadbolt locking assembly in the locked position as illustrated in
Figures 36a, 36b, 36c and 36d.
[0182] Figure 31 shows the lower housing block generally as (220) which
slidably supports the deadlock control trigger tab (222), which is adapted to
laterally engage the deadlock activation tab (224).
[0183] Figure 31 for the most part is the same representation provided for in
Figure 34c when the deadbolt locking assembly is in the deadbolt unlocked
position and is not primed, activated or triggered to be able to be placed into the
deadbolt locked position.
[0184] The deadbolt holding arm (225) is biased through spring (221) and is
pivotally supported at one end (223) to the lower housing block (220).
[0185] At the other end of the deadbolt holding arm (225) is a distal notch
extension (227) which is receivable into a receival slot when the deadbolt
holding arm (225) is in the captured position as illustrated in Figures in 31 and
34c.
[0186] The operational aspect of the workings of the deadlock control trigger tab
(222), deadlock activation tab (224) and the deadbolt holding arm (225) will be
discussed in greater detail when referencing Figures 34a, 34b, 34c and 34d.
[0187] Figure 32 shows the upper side (231) of the upper housing block (230),
which is able to rotatable engage through the slot (231) defined by the lower
                                          32

housing block (220) and the cylindrical column (232) extending from the
underside (233) of the upper housing block (230).
[0188] The relevance of which will be discussed in greater detail when
referencing the series of figures in 34, 35 and 36, the upper housing body (230)
on the underside also includes a lug extension (235), a guide track (237), which
is adapted to engage the raised knob or section (239) extending out from the
deadbolt activation tab (224).
[0189] The upper housing body (230) also includes a slot (239) and a slot (241)
which is the internal confines of the column (232) extending out from the
underside (233) of the upper housing body (230), wherein the deadbolt release
cam shown generally as (240) in Figure 37 is rotatable rested and supported
therein by virtue of shaft (243) of the deadbolt release cam (240).
[0190] The deadbolt release cam (240) includes the finger extension (244)
which is able to be guided within slot (239) of the upper housing body (230) and
wherein the stem (245) is able to interconnect with the raised shoulder (246)
along the edge (247) thereof to be able to bias the deadbolt holding arm (225)
back into the captured configuration within the deadbolt activation tab which will
be discussed in greater detail shortly hereafter.
[0191] Referring now to Figures 34a, 34b, 34c and 34d wherein the deadbolt
locking assembly parts are configured so that the double cylinder deadbolt
locking arrangement (210) remains in a deadbolt unlocked position with the
user operable deadlock control trigger tab (222) extended out from the
periphery (251) of the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) so it
remains engaging and operable by the user.
[0192] Figure 34a also assists in viewing the rotatable user knob (209), which
as will be discussed in greater detail when referencing Figures 36a, 36b, 36c
and 36d, is rotatable in a clockwise direction with or without a key to place the
                                          33

deadbolt in a locked position once the double cylinder deadbolt locking
arrangement has been triggered.
[0193] As best seen in Figure 34c the deadlock control trigger tab (222) is
slidably supported upon the lower housing block (220) resiliently by way of
spring (255).
[0194] As will be discussed in greater detail when referencing Figures 35a, 35b,
35c and 35d the deadlock control trigger tab (222) is laterally aligned so that
once it is inserted into the peripheral confines of the lower housing block (220) it
is able to slidably engage with the deadlock activation tab or slide (224).
[0195] While the deadlock control trigger tab (222) remains in the untriggered
configuration as seen in Figure 34c, the deadlock activation tab (224) is able to
capture and contain the notch extension (227) of the deadbolt holding arm (225)
within the receival slot (229) of the deadlock activation tab (224).
[0196] With the deadbolt holding arm (225) captured within the receival slot
(229) of the deadlock activation tab the deadbolt holding arm (225) is biased
away from a configuration that would allow for the deadbolt locking assembly to
provide for a deadbolt locked position or configuration.
[0197] Any relative rotation between the lower housing body (220) with the
upper housing body (230) will not result in any deadbolt lock positioning as
which will be as the lug extension (235) extending from the underside (233) of
the upper housing block doesn't engage and is not prevented from an anti
clockwise direction rotation which would not have been possible when the
deadbolt holding arm (225) has been freed from its capturing within the receival
slot (29) of the deadbolt activation tab (224) as shown in Figures 36a, 36b, 36c
and 36d.
                                          34

[0198] Viewing Figure 37 of the deadbolt release cam (240) and Figure 34b it is
to be understood that the spindle (215) is able to pass there through the shaft
(243) and into the receiving slot (265) of the deadbolt release cam (240).
[0199] As introduced above, the deadbolt release cam (240) is slidably rotating
within the upper housing body (230) and as the finger (244) and stem (245) are
restricted within slot (239) so as to remain interconnected to the defined edge
(247) of the raised shouldered portion (246) of the deadbolt holding arm (225)
means that if the upper housing body (230) is restricted from rotating by virtue
of the lug (235) engaging an uncaptured deadbolt housing arm (225) frontal
edge (262) this would then translate to restrictive movement of the deadbolt
releasable cam (240) which would stop any rotational movement of the spindle
(215), thereby preventing movement of the bolt.
[0200] The opposite scenario is also the case in that so long as the upper
housing body (230) is able to freely rotate this will then also allow the deadbolt
release cam (240) to be able to rotate thereby preventing the spindle (215)
which engages the bolt assembly (214) drivable cam (219) through the slot
(217) from being fixed within a deadbolt locked position.
[0201] The only way in which the deadbolt locking assembly of this invention
can be activated so as to be able to place the double cylinder deadbolt lock
arrangement in the deadbolt locked position is by a user pushing the user
operable deadlock control trigger tab (222) into the lower housing body (220) so
as to slidably engage the deadlock activation tab or slide (224).
[0202] As best seen in Figures 35a, 35b, 35c and 35d the actual locked status
of the double cylinder deadbolt deadlock arrangement (210) remains
unchanged from the unlocked status shown in Figures 34a, 34b, 34c and 34d
but what is different is that the deadbolt locking assembly by virtue of the user
having slidably inserted the deadlock control trigger tab (222) into the lower
housing body (220) has been able to activate or prime the deadbolt locking
                                         35

assembly so that the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) can now
be placed in the deadbolt locked position if so desired by the user.
[0203] Accordingly the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) cannot
be inadvertently or accidentally placed in the deadbolt locked position unless a
conscious decision is made to insert the deadlock control trigger tab (222) from
its external extension out from the peripheral edge (251) of the internal housing
block (212) to be inserted into the lower housing block (220) of the deadbolt
locking assembly as best seen in Figures 35b and 35c.
[0204] In Figure 35c the arrow (271) signifies the lateral slidable movement of
the user operable deadlock control trigger tab (222), which then slidably
engages, shown by way of arrow (273), to laterally push across the deadbolt
activation tab (224).
[0205] This slight lateral movement of the deadbolt activation tab (224) releases
the notch (227) of the deadbolt holding arm (225) from being captured within the
receivable slot (229) of the deadbolt activation tab (224).
[0206] As the deadbolt activation arm (225) is biased by the spring (221), once
the notch (227) is released from being captured within the receivable slot (229)
of the deadbolt activation tab (224) it is able to spring away from the deadbolt
activation tab (224).
[0207] The deadbolt activation arm (225) presents the front abutting edge (262),
the relevance of which will be discussed in greater detail when referencing
Figures 36a, 36b, 36c and 36d but from Figures 35a, 35b and 35c it can be
realized that the lug (235) extension still remains of the first side of the deadbolt
activation arm (225) and has yet to be rotated to the second side past the apex
(263) along the edge (247) of the raised shoulder (246) of the deadbolt
activation arm (225). Hence the assembly still remains deadbolt unlocked, albeit
the ability to deadbolt lock the assembly becomes possible as the deadbolt
activation arm (225) has been released from its captured position.
                                          36

[0208] As the deadbolt locking assembly is in the primed position this means
that it is possible to rotate the upper housing body (230) relative to the lower
housing body (220) in a clockwise direction as best seen in Figure 35d the lug
extension (235) on the underside (233) of the upper housing body (230) still
remains on the left-hand side or a first side of the apex (263) which commences
thereafter the abutting frontal edge (262) of the deadbolt holding arm (225).
[0209] As the deadbolt holding arm (225) is pivotally supported (223) and
biased by spring (221) rotation of the upper housing body (230) will allow the
lug extension (235) to be rotated in a clockwise direction where through the
biasing of spring (221) forms the upper shouldered edge (275) of the deadbolt
holding arm (225) to be pressed down to avoid the apex (263) from being fixed
in place up against the internal skirt (261) of the lower housing body (220).
[0210] As will be described in greater detail when referencing Figures 36a, 36b,
36c and 36d, once the lug (235) has been rotated beyond the apex (263) of the
deadbolt holding arm (265) the apex (263) will then be able to be biased up for
the abutting engagement with the internal rim or skirt (261) of the lower housing
body (220) thereby preventing any subsequent rotation back of the upper
housing body in an anti-clockwise direction while that apex (263) of the deadbolt
holding arm (225) remains abutted up against the internal collar or skirt (261) of
the lower housing body (220).
[0211] If the upper housing body (230) is prevented from rotation that means the
deadbolt release cam (240) rotatable supported therein the upper housing body
(230) is also preventing from moving and so too then the spindle (215) which is
engaging the driveable cam (219) through the slot (217) of the bolt assembly
(214).
[0212] Figures 36a, 36b, 36c and 36d illustrate the deadbolt locking assembly in
the deadbolt locked position.
                                          37

[0213] Arrow (281) in Figure 36a represents rotation of the knob (209) in a
clockwise direction.
[0214] Rotation of the knob (209) in a clockwise direction translates to rotation
of the upper housing body (230) from the configuration shown in Figures 35a,
35b, 35c and 35d to the one shown in 36a, 36b, 36c and 36d.
[0215] As introduced previously, rotation of the knob (209) and the upper
housing body (230) which then translated to rotational clockwise movement of
spindle (215) to place the bolt (213) of the bolt assembly (214) in an extended
position was permitted as the deadbolt holding arm (225) had been released
from being captured within the deadbolt activation tab (224) and the lug (235)
extending out from the underside (233) of the upper housing body (230) as it
rested on the upper shoulder (275) of the deadbolt housing arm (225) could
force the deadbolt housing arm (225) down as it rotated there along the upper
shoulder (275) so it could start from a first side relative to the apex (263) of the
deadbolt housing arm to a second side relative to the apex (263) which is then
able to bias up against the internal skirt or collar (261) of the lower housing
body (220) as the lug (235) is now extended beyond the apex (263). The lug
(235) is trapped from moving back in an anti-clockwise direction as the lug (235)
abuts up against the frontal edge (262) of the deadbolt housing arm (225).
[0216] Accordingly, as the upper housing body (230) is restricted from anti
clockwise direction, the rotatable deadbolt release cam (240) is also prevented
from moving in an anti-clockwise direction while the apex (263) of the deadbolt
holding arm (225) remains abutting up against the inner skirt or rim (261) of the
lower housing body (220).
[0217] Accordingly, the bolt (213) extending out from the bolt assembly (214)
remains in the deadbolt locked position.
[0218] As the upper housing body (230) was rotated in the clockwise direction
shown by way of arrow (281) the underside profile as best seen in Figure 33
                                          38

included the guide edge or track (237) which was able to engage the raised
knob (229) so as to extend a segment (284) of deadlock activation tab (224) out
beyond the peripheral edge (251) of the internal housing block (212) wherein
this tab extension (284) acts as a visual and tactile indicator that the double
cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) is now in the deadbolt locked position.
[0219] The upper housing body (230) also includes along its circumferential
edge a ram extension (253) which is able to engage the raised knob or length
(257) of the deadlock control trigger tab (222) so as to extend the deadlock
control trigger tab (222) out once again from the peripheral edge (251) of both
the lower housing block (220) and the overall internal housing block (212).
[0220] In order to free the bolt (213) from the deadlock locked position a key is
required to engage either the internal key cylinder (not shown) through the key
hole (207) of the internal housing block (212) or the external key cylinder (not
shown) housed within the external housing block (216) through the external
key-hold (291).
[0221] Authorised key entry into either key-hole (207) or (291) will rotate the
corresponding internal or external key cylinders, which engages either the
spindle (215) and/or the deadbolt release cam (240).
[0222] The rotation of the deadbolt release cam (240) or spindle (215) through
the authorised key entry at (207) and (291) allows the stem extension (245) of
the finger (244) extending from the deadbolt release cam (240) to interconnect
with the deadbolt holding arm (225) along the edge (247).
[0223] As can be appreciated by viewing Figure 36d if the finger (244) of the
deadbolt releasable cam (240) is rotated in the anti-clockwise direction, as it
engages the raised shoulder (246) along the profiled edge (247) of the deadbolt
holding arm (225), due to the spring (221) the interconnection is allowed to push
down the deadbolt holding arm (225) thereby removing the apex (263) of the
deadbolt holding arm (225) away from its contact engagement with the inner rim
                                          39

or skirt (261) of the lower housing body (220) providing a gap which the lug
(235) of the upper housing body (230) can rotatable pass there through rather
than abutting up against the front edge (262) which was the case when the
double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) was in the deadbolt locked
position.
[0224] While not shown, the deadlock activation tab (224) is also spring biased
and movement of the upper housing body (230) in the anti-clockwise direction
causes the deadbolt activation tab (224) to spring back into its original lateral
position once the notch (227) of the deadbolt holding arm (225) has been
lowered down by the biasing interaction between the deadbolt release cam
(240) finger (244) stem (245) interconnection and engagement with the raised
shouldered (246) profiled edge (247) of the deadbolt holding arm (225).
[0225] As the upper housing body (230) is rotated away from a deadbolt locked
position to a deadbolt unlocked position the ram tab (253) extending from the
peripheral edge of the upper housing body (230) moves away from its abutting
engagement with the raised knob or portion (287) extending out from the
deadlock control trigger tab (222) thereby allowing the deadlock control trigger
tab (222) to be in a re-set position ready to prime the deadbolt locking assembly
for the double cylinder deadbolt lock arrangement (210) again as required.
