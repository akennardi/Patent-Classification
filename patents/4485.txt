   No. 2013298113 is by this cross-reference incorporated into the present specification.
   The invention in principle pertains to the field of recombinant manufacture of fatty acids.
10  It provides nucleic acid molecules which encode lysophospholipid-coenzyme A synthase
   (LACS), desaturases, elongases and elongase components. The invention also provides
   recombinant expression vectors containing desaturase, KCS, KCR and/or LACS nucleic
   acid molecules, host cells into which the expression vectors have been introduced, and
   methods for large-scale production of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs),
15  e.g. arachidonic acid (ARA, omega-6 unsaturated fatty acid), eicosapentaenoic acid
   (EPA, omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid) and/or docosapentaenoic acid (DHA, omega-3
   unsaturated fatty acid).
   Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups that play a
20 fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely found free in
   nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. As such,
   lipids/ fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-oxidation). In addition, lipids/ fatty acids
   are an integral part of cell membranes and, therefore, are indispensable for processing
   biological or biochemical information.
25
   Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: saturated fatty acids formed of single carbon
   bonds and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bonds
   in cis-configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that
   belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of an
30 electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b5 and
   NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of
   double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule, for example, by
   catalyzing the oxygen-dependent dehydrogenation of fatty acids (Sperling eta., 2003).
   Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of desaturases that are required for
35 the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids and thus, have a
   limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their
   diet. Such essential fatty acids include, for example, linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic
   acid (C18:3). In contrast, insects, microorganisms and plants are able to synthesize a
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                     2
   much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Indeed, the
   biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms.
   Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid
 5 (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various
   tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For
   example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6)
   (Crawford, M.A., etal, (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S-1041S). In retina, DHA
   accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the
10 photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell (Giusto, N.M., eta. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res.
   39:315-391). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and
   development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in
   adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has significant effects
   on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin
15 activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N.M., etal. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res.
   39:315-391). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases
   such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers
   (Horrocks, L.A. and Yeo, Y.K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Therefore,
   appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for human health. Because such
20 fatty acids cannot be efficiently synthesized by infants, young children and senior
   citizerns, it is particularly important for these individuals to adequately intake these fatty
   acids from the diet (Spector, A.A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1-S3).
   Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and
25 traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold.
    In addition, the supply of fish oil is highly variable, particularly in view of the shrinking
   fish populations. Moreover, the algal source of oil is expensive due to low yield and the
   high costs of extraction.
30 The biosynthesis of LCPUFA and the incorporation of LCPUFA into membrane lipids or
   triacylglycerides proceeds via various metabolic pathways (Abbadi 2001, European
   Journal of Lipid Science & Technology 103:106-113). In bacteria such as Vibrio, and
   microalgae, such as Schizochytrium, malonyl-CoA is converted into LCPUFA via an
   LCPUFA-producing polyketide synthase (Metz 2001, Science 293: 290-293; WO
35 00/42195; WO 98/27203; WO 98/55625). In microalgae, such as Phaeodactylum, and
   mosses, such as Physcomitrella, unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid or linolenic
   acid are converted in a plurality of desaturation and elongation steps to give LCPUFA
   (Zank 2000, Biochemical Society Transactions 28: 654-658). Desaturation takes place
   either on acyl groups bound to Coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) or on acyl groups of membrane
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                  3
   lipids, whereas elongation is biochemicaly restricted to acyl chains bound to CoA. In
   mammals, the biosynthesis of DHA comprises a chain shortening via beta-oxidation, in
   addition to desaturation and elongation steps. In microorganisms and lower plants,
   LCPUFA are present either exclusively in the form of membrane lipids, as is the case in
 5 Physcomitrella and Phaeodactylum, or in membrane lipids and triacylglycerides, as is
   the case in Schizochytrium and Mortierella. Incorporation of LCPUFA into lipids and oils,
   as well as the transfer of the fatty acid moiety (acyl group) between lipids and other
   molecular species such as acyl-CoA, is catalyzed by various transferases, such as
   acyltransferases and transacylases. These enzymes are known to carry out the
10 incorporation or interexchange of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (Slabas 2001, J.
   Plant Physiology 158: 505-513, Frentzen 1998, Fett/Lipid 100: 161-166, Cases 1998,
   Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 13018-13023, Lu et al 2009, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA
   vol 106: no. 44: 18837-18842). One group of acyltransferases having three distinct
   enzymatic activities are enzymes of the "Kennedy pathway", which are located on the
15 cytoplasmic side of the membrane system of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER
   bound acyltransferases in the microsomal fraction use acyl-CoA as the activated form of
   fatty acids. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) catalyzes the incorporation of
   acyl groups at the sn-1 position of glycerol-3-phosphate. 1-Acylglycerol-3-phosphate
   acyltransferase, also known as lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), catalyze
20 the incorporation of acyl groups at the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). After
   dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP),
   diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the incorporation of acyl groups at the
   sn-3 position of diacylglycerols. Further enzymes directly involved in TAG biosynthesis
   - apart from the said Kennedy pathway enzymes - are the phospholipid diacylglycerol
25 acyltransferase (PDAT), an enzyme that transfers acyl groups from the sn-2 position of
   membrane lipids to the sn-3 position of diacylglycerols; diacylglyceroldiacylglycerol
   transacylase (DDAT), an enzyme that transfers acylgroups from the sn-2 position of one
   diacylglycerol-molecule to the sn-3 position of another diacylglycerol-molecule and
   phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PDCT), an enzyme
30 transfers the polar phosphatodyclcholine headgroup from the sn-3 position of an poly
   unsaturated phospholipid (e.g. containing 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3), to the sn-3 position of a
   saturated (e.g. containing 18:0) or mono unsaturased (e.g. containing 18:1n-9)
   diacylgcylerole Lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) represents a class of
   acyltransferases that are capable of incorporating activated acyl groups from acyl-CoA
35 to membrane lipids, and possibly catalyze also the reverse reaction. More specifically,
   LPLATs can have activity as lysophosphophatidylethanolamine acyltransferase (LPEAT)
   and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT). Further enzymes, such as lecithin
   cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) can be involved in the transfer of acyl groups from
   membrane lipids into triacylglycerides, as well. Generally, fatty acids in a cell are bound
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                    4
   as thioesters. Formation of these thiosesers from free fatty acids occurs by the action of
   a Lysophospholipid-Coenzyme A Synthase (LACS).
   EPA and ARA are both delta (d) 5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food
 5 and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five
   double bonds in the acyl chain. EPA is found in marine food and is abundant in oily fish
   from North Atlantic. ARA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a
   double bond in the o-3 position confers on ARA different properties than those found in
   EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet
10 aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and
   anti-platelet aggregating properties. ARA can be obtained from some foods such as
   meat, fish and eggs, but the concentration is low.
   Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is
15 the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active
   molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate
   limited by A6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as
   aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the
   A6 desaturation step. In addition, GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid
20 cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore,
   dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical
   studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some
   pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes,
   hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders.
25
   Although biotechnology offers an attractive route for the production of specialty fatty
   acids, current techniques fail to provide an efficient means for the large scale production
   of unsaturated fatty acids. Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved and efficient
   method of producing unsaturated fatty acids, such as DHA, EPA and ARA.
30
   As DHA is a particularly important polyunsaturated fatty acids, there is a high need for
   efficient production of this fatty acid. A particularly critical step in the production of DHA
   is the delta-4 desaturation step. This step is performed by delta-4 desaturases. These
   enzymes utilize docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5 delta7,10,13,16,19) bound to ACP,
35 to CoA or in phospholipids as substrate to produce the respective DHA bound to ACP, to
   CoA or in phospholipids. DPA, in turn, is produced by a delta-5 elongase. Generally,
   these elongases elongate acyl-CoA fatty acids. It has been observed that desaturation
   efficiency can be greatly increased if a desaturase is employed which use, as
   substrates, fatty acids bound to the same backbone as those used during elongation.
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                   5
   Specifically, desaturation efficiency has been shown to be increased by providing an
   acyl-coA desaturase (Domergue et al, Biochem. J. 2005, 483-490).
   There is thus a need for delta-4 desaturases having high desaturation efficiency when
 5 paired with a delta-5 elongase. So far, such desaturases were only known from
   Pavlova/Rebecca species (Uniprot identifiers Q6VPV2_PAVLU and A0PJ29_9EUKA,
   putatively also D6NSTO_9EUKA). This has made it difficult to screen for further
   desaturases having high desaturation efficiency when paired with a delta-5 elongase,
   because due to the similarity of the delta-4 desaturases of Pavlova/Rebecca, it is not
10 possible to ascertain whether amino acids conserved in these desaturases are required
   for their function, or if they are retained only because not enough time has passed to
   create further mutations.
   The inventors now provide a delta-4 desaturase having high desaturation efficiency
15 when paired with a heterologous delta-5 elongase. The delta-4 desaturase has a very
   low sequence identity to the Pavlova/Rebecca desaturases mentioned above. The
   invention thus also provides a list of allowable mutations to the delta-4 desaturase, such
   that only few of these mutations would abolish the delta-4 desaturase activity as such or
   the high desaturation efficiency when paired with a delta-5 desaturase. Accordingly, the
20 invention provides a method for screening for further delta-4 desaturases having high
   desaturation efficiency when paired with a heterologous delta-5 elongase.

    In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the
   context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
   " comprise" or variations such as " comprises" or " comprising" is used in an
30 inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the
   presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
35 Specifically, the invention provides a delta-4 desaturase having at least 60%, preferably
   at least 69%, even more preferably at least 74% and even more preferably at least 81%
   sequence identity to the amino acid sequence according to any of SEQ ID NO. 79, 86 or
   85, wherein the sequence preferably also comprises
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                   6
   -          a motif selected from " KHPGG" ," QHPGG" or " RHPGG" , preferably a motif
              selected from " KHPGGD" , " QHPGGD" or " RHPGGD" , and
   -          a motif selected from " GLNIQHDANHG" or " HVVGHH" , preferably a motif
              selected from " AAIGLNIQHDANHG" or " QHVVGHH"
 5
    It was particularly surprising that a delta-4 desaturase having high desaturation
   efficiency when paired with a heterologous delta-5 desaturase could be provided which
   has such low sequence identity to the above mentioned delta-4 desaturases of
   Pavlov/Rebecca. It was also particularly surprising that in the motiv " EHPGG"
10 conserved in Pavlova/Rebecca the first amino acid G, which is an acidic amino acid,
   could be replaced by K, which is a basic amino acid, without abolishing the high
   desaturation efficiency. It can thus be extrapolated that surprisingly also " QHPGG"
   and " RHPGG" are valid motifs in place of " EHPGG" . Also, it was surprising that the
   motif " HVVMHH" conserved in Pavlova/Rebecca delta-4 desaturases could be
15 replaced by " HVVGHH" , replacing hydrophobic methionine M by the inconspicuous
   glycine G. And it was surprising that the first amino acid E of the conserved
   Pavlova/Rebecca motif " EHVVMHH" could be replaced by Q, again exchanging an
   acidic amino acid for a non-acidic amino acid. It was unexpected that such significant
   changes in amino acid properties in conserved motifs would be possible without
20 abolishing the desaturation efficiency when compared with a heterologous delta-5
   elongase.
   The delta-4 desaturase of the present invention at least comprises the following
   conserved sequence motifs, wherein " X" denotes any amino acid: "HPGG",
25 "QDWIGG", "NGGLN", "QIEHHLFPR" and "IGLNIQHDXNHG". As shown in the
   alignment of figure 2, these sequences are required for delta-4 desaturase activity.
   Preferably, the delta-4 desaturase of the present invention comprises at least 5, more
   preferably at least 6, even more preferably at least 7 and most preferably all the
30 following conserved sequence motifs, wherein " X" denotes any amino acid: "DPDXK",
   "HPGG", "NGGLNXQIEHHLFPR", "GYXQDWIGG", "IGLNIQHDANHG", "YLXFFF",
   "HVVXHHXH" and "FXGXDAT". These longer conserved sequence motifs are also
   found in delta-4 desaturases of genus Sphaeroforma, Pavlova or Rebecca as shown in
   figure 2.
35
   More preferably, the delta-4 desaturase of the present invention comprises at least 5,
   more preferably at least 6, even more preferably at least 7, even more preferably at least
   8, even more preferably at least 9, even more preferably at least 10, even more
   preferably at least 11, even more preferably at least 12, even more preferably at least
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                  7
    13, even more preferably at least 14 and most preferably all of the following conserved
   sequence motifs: "DPD[VILMATQ]K", "HPGG", "NGGLN[FWY]QIEHHLFPR",
   "GY[ASGM]QDWIGG", "Y[FI]LP", "IGLNIQHDANHG", "YL[AG]FFF",
   "HVV[GNASKDWM]HH[LIFT]H", "AP[PA]S", "F[WF][AVCGSPI]R", "F[GP]G[RQ]DAT",
 5 "T[LIMVFCA][LIVCA]C", "P[LF][WA]L", "KA[CA]A" and "I[VL][GADE]D[GA]". In this list,
   " X" again denotes any amino acid. A list of amino acids in brackets indicates that one
   member chosen among the members of list is present at the corresponding position of
   the motif, wherein each individual list is ordered in decreasing preference. For example,
   a motiv " PLWL" is preferred over a motiv " PLAL" or " PFWL" or " PFAL" , and
10 one of these four motifs must be present in the more preferred delta-4 desaturases of
   the present invention. Some of the amino acids in the lists are not found in delta-4
   desaturases of genus Sphaeroforma, Pavlova or Rebecca as shown in figure 2.
   However, according to the invention these new amino acids are similar enough to those
   amino acids found at corresponding positions in the delta-4 desaturases of genus
15 Sphaeroforma, Pavlova or Rebecca, such that the new amino acids will generally not
   abolish or severely reduce the delta-4 desaturase efficiency, particularly the high
   efficiency of desaturation when combined with a delta-5 elongase for producing
   polyunsaturated fatty acids from the substrate or substrates of said delta-5 elongase.
20 Most preferably the delta-4 desaturase of the present invention comprises at least 5,
   more preferably at least 6, even more preferably at least 7, even more preferably at least
   8, even more preferably at least 9, even more preferably at least 10, even more
   preferably at least 11, even more preferably at least 12, even more preferably at least
    13, even more preferably at least 14 and most preferably all of the following conserved
25 sequence motifs: "DPD[VQ]K", "HPGG", "NGGLN[YF]QIEHHLFPR",
   "GY[SAM]QDWIGG", "Y[FI]LP", "IGLNIQHDANHG", "YL[AG]FFF", "HVV[GM]HH[LT]H",
   "AP[PA]S", "F[FW][AI]R", "F[GP]G[RQ]DAT", "T[LA][LA]C", "P[LF][AW]L", "KA[AC]A"
   and "I[VL][GE]D[GA]". As described above, a list of amino acids in brackets indicates
   that one member chosen among the members of list is present at the corresponding
30 position of the motif, wherein each individual list is ordered in decreasing preference.
   According to the invention, there is further provided a delta-4 desaturase having the
   amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO. 85 and optionally one or more of the following
   mutations: H4S, H4Y, H4Q, H4E, H4N, A5S, A5G, A5C, A5P, A5T, A5V, A6R, A6G,

   The invention also provides a method for screening for delta-4 desaturase genes,
   comprising the steps of
   a) extracting genetic material of an organism belonging to the taxonomic ranks of

   Hybridization indicates that the organism the genetic material of which is provided in
   step a) does comprise a gene for a delta-4 desaturase.
15 Particularly preferred is to detect hybridization or lack of hybridization by a nucleic acid
   amplification reaction. Such reaction will only provide significant products if a probe has
   hybridized to the genetic material serving as template for the amplification reaction.

              or a delta-4 desaturase as described above,
   c)         a nucleic acid sequence being at least 70% identical to the nucleic acid sequence

              lysophospholipid-coenzyme A synthase (LACS) activity
   d) a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide having desaturase, keto-acyl-CoA
              synthase (KCS), keto-acyl-CoA reductase (KCR) or lysophospholipid-coenzyme A
              synthase (LACS) activity and having an amino acid sequence which is at least

25
   The term " polynucleotide" as used in accordance with the present invention relates to
   a polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid sequence which encodes a polypeptide
   having desaturase, keto-acyl-CoA-synthase, keto-acyl-CoA-reductase or
   lysophospholipid-coenzyme A synthase activity. Preferably, the polypeptide encoded by
30 the polynucleotide of the present invention having desaturase, KCS,KCR or LACS
   activity, respectively, upon expression in a plant shall be capable of increasing the
   amount of PUFA and, in particular, LCPUFA in, e.g., seed oils or the entire plant or parts
   thereof. Such an increase is, preferably, statistically significant when compared to a
   LCPUFA producing transgenic control plant which expresses the minimal set of
35 desaturases and elongases requiered for LCPUFA synthesis but does not express the
   polynucleotide of the present invention. Whether an increase is significant can be
   determined by statistical tests well known in the art including, e.g., Student's t-test. More
   preferably, the increase is an increase of the amount of triglycerides containing LCPUFA
   of at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20% or at least 30% compared to said
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                 21
   control. Preferably, the LCPUFA referred to before is a polyunsaturated fatty acid having
   a C-20, C-22 or C-24 fatty acid body, more preferably, ARA, EPA or DHA. Suitable
   assays for measuring the activities mentioned before are described in the accompanying
   Examples.
 5
   The term " acyltransferase activity" or " acyltransferase" as used herein
   encompasses all enymatic activities and enzymes which are capable of transferring or
   are involved in the transfer of PUFA and, in particular; LCPUFA from the acly-CoA pool
   or the membrane phospholipis to the triglycerides, from the acyl-CoA pool to membrane
10 lipids and from membrane lipids to the acyl-CoA pool by a transesterification process. It
   will be understood that this acyltransferase activity will result in an increase of the
   LCPUFA esterified to triglycerides in, e.g., seed oils. In particular, it is envisaged that
   these acyl-transferases are capable of producing triglycerides having esterified EPA or
   even DHA, or that these acyltransferases are capable of enhancing synthesis of desired
15 PUFA by increasing the flux for specific intermediates of the desired PUFA between the
   acyl-CoA pool (the site of elongation) and membrane lipids (the predominant site of
   desatu-ration). Specifically, acyltransferase activity as used herein relates to
   lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) activity, preferably, lysophosphatidylcholine
   acyltransferase (LPCAT) or Lysophosphophatidylethanolamine acyltransferase (LPEAT)
20 activity, lyso-phosphosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) activity, glycerol-3
   phosphate acyl-transferase (GPAT) activity or diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT),
   and, more pref-erably, to LPLAT, LPAAT, DGAT or GPAT activity.
   The term " desaturase" encompasses all enymatic activities and enzymes catalyzing
25 the desaturation of fatty acids with different lengths and numbers of unsaturated carbon
   atom double bonds. Specifically this includes delta 4 (d4)-desaturase, catalyzing the
   dehydrogenation of the 4th and 5th carbon atom. Delta 5 (d5)-desaturase catalyzing the
   dehydrogenation of the 5th and 6th carbon atom. Delta 6 (d6)-desaturase catalyzing the
   dehydrogenation of the 6th and 7th carbon atom. Delta 8 (d8)-desaturase catalyzing the
30 dehydrogenation of the 8th and 9th carbon atom. Delta 9 (d9)-desaturase catalyzing the
   dehydrogenation of the 9th and 10th carbon atom. Delta 12 (d12)-desaturase catalyzing
   the dehydrogenation of the 12th and 13th carbon atom. Delta 15 (dl5)-desaturase
   catalyzing the dehydrogenation of the 15th and 16th carbon atom. It is understood that
   fatty acids can be bound to the acyl-carrier protein (ACP), to coenzyme A (CoA) or in
35 phospholipids, thereby forming different pools. Desaturases generally exhibit a
   preference for one of these pools.
   The terms " elongase" and " d5Elo, d6Elo or d9Elo" are synonymous to KCS and
   refer to keto-acyl-CoA-synthase enzymatic activity, which allows to introduce two carbon
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                 22
   atoms in a fatty acid whereby the fatty acid is elongated. Specifically, d5Elo, d6Elo or
   d9Elo catalyzes the introduction of two carbon atoms into fatty acids having 18 or 20
   carbon atoms and double bonds in the positions 5, 6, or 9, respectively.
 5 The term " KCR" as used herein refer to keto-acyl-CoA-reductase activity, which
   reduces the keto-group of keto-acyl-CoA to a hydroxyl-group, in the process of fatty acid
   elongation.
   The term " DH" as used herein refers to dehydratase activity, removing the hydroxyl
10 group leading to the formation of a acyl-2-en-CoA ester (delta-2-enoyl-CoA) and H2 0
   during fatty acid elongation.
   The term " ECR" as used herein refers to enoyl-CoA reductase activity, reducing the
   double bond of delta-2-enoyl-CoA, in course of fatty acid elongation, generating the
15 elongated acyl-CoA ester.
   Fatty acid elongation is catalyzed in four steps, represented by four enzymes: KCS
   (keto-acyl-CoA-synthase), KCR (keto-acyl-CoA-reductase), DH (dehydratase) and ECR
   (enoyl-CoA-reductase). In the first step a fatty acid-CoA ester is condensed with
20 malonyl-CoA producing a keto-acly-CoA intermediate, which is elongated by two carbon
   atoms, and C02. The keto-group of the intermediate is then reduced by the KCR to a
   hydroxyl-group. In the next step the DH cleaves of the hydroxyl-group (H20 is
   produced), forming a acyl-2-en-CoA ester (delta-2-enoyl-CoA). In the final step the
   double bound at position 2, 3 is reduced by the ECR forming the elongated acyl-CoA
25 ester (Buchanan, Gruissem, Jones (2000) Biochemistry & Molecular biology of plants,
   American Society of Plant Physiologists).
    In the studies underlying this invention, enzymes with superior desaturase, KCS KCR,
   DH, and ECR catalytic activities for the production of PUFA has been provided.

   20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 79 , 84, 85 or 86 by at least one nucleotide substitution, addition
   and/or deletion, whereby the variant nucleic acid sequence shall still encode a
   polypeptide having a desaturase, KCS, KCR and LACS activity as specified above.
   Variants also encompass polynucleotides comprising a nucleic acid sequence which is
25 capable of hybridizing to the aforementioned specific nucleic acid sequences, preferably,
   under stringent hybridization conditions. These stringent conditions are known to the
   skilled worker and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &
   Sons, N. Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. A preferred example for stringent hybridization
   conditions are hybridization conditions in 6 x sodium chloride/sodium citrate (= SSC) at
30 approximately 450C, followed by one or more wash steps in 0.2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50
   to 650C. The skilled worker knows that these hybridization conditions differ depending
   on the type of nucleic acid and, for example when organic solvents are present, with
   regard to the temperature and concentration of the buffer. For example, under
   " standard hybridization conditions" the temperature differs depending on the type of
35 nucleic acid between 420C and 58'C in aqueous buffer with a concentration of 0.1 to 5 x
   SSC (pH 7.2). If organic solvent is present in the abovementioned buffer, for example
   50% formamide, the temperature under standard conditions is approximately 42'C. The
   hybridization conditions for DNA: DNA hybrids are, preferably, 0.1 x SSC and 200C to
   450C, preferably between 300C and 450C. The hybridization conditions for DNA:RNA

                                                 25
   hybrids are, preferably, 0.1 x SSC and 30'C to 550C, preferably between 450C and
   55'C. The abovementioned hybridization temperatures are determined for example for a
   nucleic acid with approximately 100 bp (= base pairs) in length and a G + C content of
   50% in the absence of formamide. The skilled worker knows how to determine the
 5 hybridization conditions required by referring to textbooks such as the textbook
   mentioned above, or the following textbooks: Sambrook et al., "Molecular Cloning"
   Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1989; Hames and Higgins (Ed.) 1985, " Nucleic
   Acids Hybridization: A Practical Approach" , IRL Press at Oxford University Press,
   Oxford; Brown (Ed.) 1991, "Essential Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach" , IRL
10 Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford. Alternatively, polynucleotide variants are
   obtainable by PCR-based techniques such as mixed oligonucleotide primer- based
   amplification of DNA, i.e. using degenerated primers against conserved domains of the
   polypeptides of the present invention. Conserved domains of the polypeptide of the
   present invention may be identified by a sequence comparison of the nucleic acid
15 sequences of the polynucleotides or the amino acid sequences of the polypeptides of
   the present invention. Oligonucleotides suitable as PCR primers as well as suitable PCR
   conditions are described in the accompanying Examples. As a template, DNA or cDNA
   from bacteria, fungi, plants or animals may be used. Further, variants include
   polynucleotides comprising nucleic acid sequences which are at least 50%, at least
20 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%,
   at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the nucleic acid
   sequences shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 78
   or 83 preferably, encoding polypeptides retaining desaturase, KCS, KCR and LACS
   activity as specified above. Moreover, also encompassed are polynucleotides which
25 comprise nucleic acid sequences encoding a polypeptide having an amino acid
   sequences which are at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least
   70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%
   or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequences shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs:
   2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 79, 84, 85 or 86 wherein the polypeptide,
30 preferably, retains desaturase, KCS, KCR and LACS as specified above. The percent
   identity values are, preferably, calculated over the entire amino acid or nucleic acid
   sequence region. A series of programs based on a variety of algorithms is available to
   the skilled worker for comparing different sequences. In a preferred embodiment, the
   percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman
35 and Wunsch algorithm (Needleman 1970, J. Mol. Biol. (48):444-453) which has been
   incorporated into the needle program in the EMBOSS software package (EMBOSS: The
   European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice,P., Longden,I., and Bleasby,A,
   Trends in Genetics 16(6), 276-277, 2000), using either a BLOSUM 45 or PAM250
   scoring matrix for distantly related proteins, or either a BLOSUM 62 or PAM 160 scoring

   and a gap entension pentalty of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Guides for local installation of the
   EMBOSS package as well as links to WEB-Services can be found at
   http://emboss.sourceforge.net. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be
 5 used for aligning two amino acid sequences using the needle program are the default
   parameters, including the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix, a gap opening penalty of 10 and
   a gap extension penalty of 0.5. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity
   between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the needle program in the
   EM BOSS software package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open
10  Software Suite, Rice,P., Longden,I., and Bleasby,A, Trends in Genetics 16(6), 276-277,
   2000), using the EDNAFULL scoring matrix and a gap opening penalty of 16, 14, 12, 10,
   8, 6, or 4 and a gap extension penalty of 0.5,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting
   example of parameters to be used in conjunction for aligning two nucleic acid sequences
   using the needle program are the default parameters, including the EDNAFULL scoring
15 matrix, a gap opening penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.5. The nucleic acid
   and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a " query
   sequence" to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other
   family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the
   BLAST series of programs (version 2.2) of Altschul eta. (Altschul 1990, J. Mol. Biol.
20 215:403-10). BLAST using desaturase, KCS, KCR and LACS nucleic acid sequences of
   the invention as query sequence can be performed with the BLASTn, BLASTx or the
   tBLASTx program using default parameters to obtain either nucleotide sequences
   (BLASTn, tBLASTx) or amino acid sequences (BLASTx) homologous to desaturase,
   KCS, KCR and LACS sequences of the invention. BLAST using desaturase, KCS, KCR
25 and LACS protein sequences of the invention as query sequence can be performed with
   the BLASTp or the tBLASTn program using default parameters to obtain either amino
   acid sequences (BLASTp) or nucleic acid sequences (tBLASTn) homologous to
   desaturase, KCS, KCR and LACS sequences of the invention. To obtain gapped
   alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST using default parameters can be
30 utilized as described in Altschul et al. (Altschul 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389
   3402).

   A polynucleotide comprising a fragment of any of the aforementioned nucleic acid
 5 sequences is also encompassed as a polynucleotide of the present invention. The
   fragments shall encode polypeptides which still have desaturase, KCS, KCR or LACS
   activity as specified above. Accordingly, the polypeptide may comprise or consist of the
   domains of the polypeptide of the present invention conferring the said biological activity.
   A fragment as meant herein, preferably, comprises at least 50, at least 100, at least 250
10 or at least 500 consecutive nucleotides of any one of the aforementioned nucleic acid
   sequences or encodes an amino acid sequence comprising at least 20, at least 30, at
   least 50, at least 80, at least 100 or at least 150 consecutive amino acids of any one of
   the aforementioned amino acid sequences.
15 The variant polynucleotides or fragments referred to above, preferably, encode
   polypeptides retaining desaturase, KCS, KCR or LACS activity to a significant extent,
   preferably, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least
   60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% of the desaturase, KCS, KCR or LACS
   activity exhibited by any of the polypeptide shown in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 5, 8, 11,
20  14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 79, 84, 85 or 86. The activity may be tested as described in
   the accompanying Examples.
   The polynucleotides of the present invention either essentially consist of the
   aforementioned nucleic acid sequences or comprise the aforementioned nucleic acid
25 sequences. Thus, they may contain further nucleic acid sequences as well. Preferably,
   the polynucleotide of the present invention may comprise in addition to an open reading
   frame further untranslated sequence at the 3' and at the 5' terminus of the coding
   gene region: at least 500, preferably 200, more preferably 100 nucleotides of the
   sequence upstream of the 5' terminus of the coding region and at least 100, preferably
30 50, more preferably 20 nucleotides of the sequence downstream of the 3' terminus of
   the coding gene region. Furthermore, the polynucleotides of the present invention may
   encode fusion proteins wherein one partner of the fusion protein is a polypeptide being
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                  28
   encoded by a nucleic acid sequence recited above. Such fusion proteins may comprise
   as additional part other enzymes of the fatty acid or PUFA biosynthesis pathways,
   polypeptides for monitoring expression (e.g., green, yellow, blue or red fluorescent
   proteins, alkaline phosphatase and the like) or so called " tags" which may serve as a
 5 detectable marker or as an auxiliary measure for purification purposes. Tags for the
   different purposes are well known in the art and comprise FLAG-tags, 6-histidine-tags,
   MYC-tags and the like.
   The polynucleotide of the present invention shall be provided, preferably, either as an
10 isolated polynucleotide (i.e. purified or at least isolated from its natural context such as
   its natural gene locus) or in genetically modified or exogenously (i.e. artificially)
   manipulated form. An isolated polynucleotide can, for example, comprise less than
   approximately 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences
   which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in the genomic DNA of the cell from
15 which the nucleic acid is derived. The polynucleotide, preferably, is provided in the form
   of double or single stranded molecule. It will be understood that the present invention by
   referring to any of the aforementioned polynucleotides of the invention also refers to
   complementary or reverse complementary strands of the specific sequences or variants
   thereof referred to before. The polynucleotide encompasses DNA, including cDNA and
20 genomic DNA, or RNA polynucleotides.
   However, the present invention also pertains to polynucleotide variants which are
   derived from the polynucleotides of the present invention and are capable of interefering
   with the transcription or translation of the polynucleotides of the present invention. Such
25 variant polynucleotides include anti-sense nucleic acids, ribozymes, siRNA molecules,
   morpholino nucleic acids (phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos), triple-helix forming
   oligonucleotides, inhibitory oligonucleotides, or micro RNA molecules all of which shall
   specifically recognize the polynucleotide of the invention due to the presence of
   complementary or substantially complementary sequences. These techniques are well
30 known to the skilled artisan. Suitable variant polynucleotides of the aforementioned kind
   can be readily designed based on the structure of the polynucleotides of this invention.
   Moreover, comprised are also chemically modified polynucleotides including naturally
   occurring modified polynucleotides such as glycosylated or methylated polynucleotides
35 or artificial modified ones such as biotinylated polynucleotides.
    In the studies underlying the present invention, advantageously, polynucleotides where
   identified encoding desaturases, keto-acyl-CoA-synthases, keto-acyl-CoA-reductases
   and lysophospholipid-coenzyme A synthase from Thraustochytrium aureum and

    Sphaeroforma arctica. In particular, the Thraustochytrium aureum d6-desaturase
   (pd6Des(Ta)_c3318), d9-desaturase (pd9Des(Ta)_c4008), o3-desaturase
   (po3Des(Ta)_c959, po3Des(Ta)_c1830), d12-desaturase (pd12Des(Ta)_c1219) keto
   acyl-CoA-synthase (pd5EIo(Ta)_c1, pd6Elo(Ta)_c231, pd6EIo(Ta)_c752,
 5 pd6EIo(Ta)_c4696, pd9Elo(Ta)_c4589) keto-acyl-CoA-reductase (pKR(Ta)_c1703) and
   the Sphaeroforma arctica d4-desaturase d4Des(Sa) and lysophospholipid-coenzyme A
   synthase (LACS). The polynucleotides of the present invention are particularly suitable
   for the recombinant manufacture of LCPUFAs and, in particular, arachidonic acid (ARA),
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or docosapentaenoic acid (DHA).
10
    In a preferred embodiment of the polynucleotide of the present invention, said
   polynucleotide further comprises an expression control sequence operatively linked to
   the said nucleic acid sequence.
15 The term " expression control sequence" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid
   sequence which is capable of governing, i.e. initiating and controlling, transcription of a
   nucleic acid sequence of interest, in the present case the nucleic sequences recited
   above. Such a sequence usually comprises or consists of a promoter or a combination
   of a promoter and enhancer sequences. Expression of a polynucleotide comprises
20 transcription of the nucleic acid molecule, preferably, into a translatable mRNA.
   Additional regulatory elements may include transcriptional as well as translational
   enhancers. The following promoters and expression control sequences may be,
   preferably, used in an expression vector according to the present invention. The cos,
   tac, trp, tet, trp-tet, Ipp, lac, Ipp-lac, laclq, T7, T5, T3, gal, trc, ara, SP6, A -PR or A -PL
25 promoters are, preferably, used in Gram-negative bacteria. For Gram-positive bacteria,
   promoters amy and SP02 may be used. From yeast or fungal promoters ADC1, AOX1 r,
   GALl, MFa , AC, P-60, CYC1, GAPDH, TEF, rp28, ADH are, preferably, used. For
   animal cell or organism expression, the promoters CMV-, SV40-, RSV-promoter (Rous
   sarcoma virus), CMV-enhancer, SV40-enhancer are preferably used. From plants the
30 promoters CaMV/35S (Franck 1980, Cell 21: 285-294], PRP1 (Ward 1993, Plant. Mol.
   Biol. 22), SSU, OCS, lib4, usp, STLS1, B33, nos or the ubiquitin or phaseolin promoter.
   Also preferred in this context are inducible promoters, such as the promoters described
   in EP 0 388 186 Al (i.e. a benzylsulfonamide-inducible promoter), Gatz 1992, Plant J.
   2:397-404 (i.e. a tetracyclin-inducible promoter), EP 0 335 528 Al ( i.e. a abscisic-acid
35 inducible promoter) or WO 93/21334 (i.e. a ethanol- or cyclohexenol-inducible
   promoter). Further suitable plant promoters are the promoter of cytosolic FBPase or the
   ST-LSI promoter from potato (Stockhaus 1989, EMBO J. 8, 2445), the phosphoribosyl
   pyrophosphate amidotransferase promoter from Glycine max (Genbank accession No.
   U87999) or the node-specific promoter described in EP 0 249 676 Al. Particularly
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                   30
   preferred are promoters which enable the expression in tissues which are involved in the
   biosynthesis of fatty acids. Also particularly preferred are seed-specific promoters such
   as the USP promoter in accordance with the practice, but also other promoters such as
   the LeB4, DC3, phaseolin or napin promoters. Further especially preferred promoters
 5 are seed-specific promoters which can be used for monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous
   plants and which are described in US 5,608,152 (napin promoter from oilseed rape), WO
   98/45461 (oleosin promoter from Arobidopsis, US 5,504,200 (phaseolin promoter from
   Phaseolus vulgaris), WO 91/13980 (Bce4 promoter from Brassica), by Baeumlein et al.,
   Plant J., 2, 2, 1992:233-239 (LeB4 promoter from a legume), these promoters being
10 suitable for dicots. The following promoters are suitable for monocots: Ipt-2 or Ipt-1
   promoter from barley (WO 95/15389 and WO 95/23230), hordein promoter from barley
   and other promoters which are suitable and which are described in WO 99/16890. In
   principle, it is possible to use all natural promoters together with their regulatory
   sequences, such as those mentioned above, for the novel process. Likewise, it is
15 possible and advantageous to use synthetic promoters, either additionally or alone,
   especially when they mediate a seed-specific expression, such as, for example, as
   described in WO 99/16890. In a particular embodiment, seed-specific promoters are
   utilized to enhance the production of the desired PUFA or LCPUFA.
20 The term " operatively linked" as used herein means that the expression control
   sequence and the nucleic acid of interest are linked so that the expression of the said
   nucleic acid of interest can be governed by the said expression control sequence, i.e.
   the expression control sequence shall be functionally linked to the said nucleic acid
   sequence to be expressed. Accordingly, the expression control sequence and, the
25 nucleic acid sequence to be expressed may be physically linked to each other, e.g., by
   inserting the expression control sequence at the 5'end of the nucleic acid sequence to
   be expressed. Alternatively, the expression control sequence and the nucleic acid to be
   expressed may be merely in physical proximity so that the expression control sequence
   is capable of governing the expression of at least one nucleic acid sequence of interest.
30 The expression control sequence and the nucleic acid to be expressed are, preferably,
   separated by not more than 500 bp, 300 bp, 100 bp, 80 bp, 60 bp, 40 bp, 20 bp, 10 bp
   or 5 bp.
    In a further preferred embodiment of the polynucleotide of the present invention, said
35 polynucleotide further comprises a terminator sequence operatively linked to the nucleic
   acid sequence.
   The term " terminator" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid sequence which is
   capable of terminating transcription. These sequences will cause dissociation of the
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                 31
   transcription machinery from the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed. Preferably, the
   terminator shall be active in plants and, in particular, in plant seeds. Suitable terminators
   are known in the art and, preferably, include polyadenylation signals such as the SV40
   poly-A site or the tk-poly-A site or one of the plant specific signals indicated in Loke et al.
 5 (Loke 2005, Plant Physiol 138, pp. 1457-1468), downstream of the nucleic acid
   sequence to be expressed.
   The present invention also relates to a vector comprising the polynucleotide of the
   present invention.
10
   The term " vector" or " construct" , preferably, encompasses phage, plasmid, viral
   vectors as well as artificial chromosomes, such as bacterial or yeast artificial
   chromosomes. Moreover, the term also relates to targeting constructs which allow for
   random or site- directed integration of the targeting construct into genomic DNA. Such
15 target constructs, preferably, comprise DNA of sufficient length for either homolgous or
   heterologous recombination as described in detail below. The vector encompassing the
   polynucleotide of the present invention, preferably, further comprises selectable markers
   for propagation and/or selection in a host. The vector may be incorporated into a host
   cell by various techniques well known in the art. If introduced into a host cell, the vector
20 may reside in the cytoplasm or may be incorporated into the genome. In the latter case,
   it is to be understood that the vector may further comprise nucleic acid sequences which
   allow for homologous recombination or heterologous insertion. Vectors can be
   introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or
   transfection techniques. The terms " transformation" and " transfection" , conjugation
25 and transduction, as used in the present context, are intended to comprise a multiplicity
   of prior-art processes for introducing foreign nucleic acid (for example DNA) into a host
   cell, including calcium phosphate, rubidium chloride or calcium chloride co-precipitation,
   DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, natural competence, carbon-based
   clusters, chemically mediated transfer, electroporation or particle bombardment. Suitable
30 methods for the transformation or transfection of host cells, including plant cells, can be
   found in Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring
   Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY,
    1989) and other laboratory manuals, such as Methods in Molecular Biology, 1995, Vol.
   44, Agrobacterium protocols, Ed.: Gartland and Davey, Humana Press, Totowa, New
35 Jersey. Alternatively, a plasmid vector may be introduced by heat shock or
   electroporation techniques. Should the vector be a virus, it may be packaged in vitro
   using an appropriate packaging cell line prior to application to host cells.

                                                 32
   Preferably, the vector referred to herein is suitable as a cloning vector, i.e. replicable in
   microbial systems. Such vectors ensure efficient cloning in bacteria and, preferably,
   yeasts or fungi and make possible the stable transformation of plants. Those which must
   be mentioned are, in particular, various binary and co-integrated vector systems which
 5 are suitable for the T-DNA-mediated transformation. Such vector systems are, as a rule,
   characterized in that they contain at least the vir genes, which are required for the
   Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and the sequences which delimit the T-DNA (T
   DNA border). These vector systems, preferably, also comprise further cis-regulatory
   regions such as promoters and terminators and/or selection markers with which suitable
10 transformed host cells or organisms can be identified. While co-integrated vector
   systems have vir genes and T-DNA sequences arranged on the same vector, binary
   systems are based on at least two vectors, one of which bears vir genes, but no T-DNA,
   while a second one bears T-DNA, but no vir gene. As a consequence, the last
   mentioned vectors are relatively small, easy to manipulate and can be replicated both in
15 E. coli and in Agrobacterium. These binary vectors include vectors from the pBIB-HYG,
   pPZP, pBecks, pGreen series. Preferably used in accordance with the invention are
   Bin19, pBI101, pBinAR, pGPTV and pCAMBIA. An overview of binary vectors and their
   use can be found in Hellens et al, Trends in Plant Science (2000) 5, 446- 451.
   Furthermore, by using appropriate cloning vectors, the polynucleotides can be
20 introduced into host cells or organisms such as plants or animals and, thus, be used in

30 More preferably, the vector of the present invention is an expression vector. In such an
   expression vector, i.e. a vector which comprises the polynucleotide of the invention
   having the nucleic acid sequence operatively linked to an expression control sequence
   (also called " expression cassette" ) allowing expression in prokaryotic or eukaryotic
   cells or isolated fractions thereof. Suitable expression vectors are known in the art such
35 as Okayama-Berg cDNA expression vector pcDV1 (Pharmacia), pCDM8, pRc/CMV,
   pcDNA1, pcDNA3 (Invitrogene) or pSPORT1 (GIBCO BRL). Further examples of typical
   fusion expression vectors are pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith 1988, Gene 67:31
   40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway,
   NJ), where glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E-binding protein and protein A,

                                                 33
   respectively, are fused with the recombinant target protein. Examples of suitable
   inducible nonfusion E. coli expression vectors are, inter alia, pTrc (Amann 1988, Gene
   69:301-315) and pET 11d (Studier 1990, Methods in Enzymology 185, 60-89). The
   target gene expression of the pTrc vector is based on the transcription from a hybrid trp
 5 lac fusion promoter by host RNA polymerase. The target gene expression from the pET
    11 d vector is based on the transcription of a T7-gn10-lac fusion promoter, which is
   mediated by a coexpressed viral RNA polymerase (T7 gnl). This viral polymerase is
   provided by the host strains BL21 (DE3) or HMS174 (DE3) from a resident -prophage
   which harbors a T7 gnl gene under the transcriptional control of the lacUV 5 promoter.
10 The skilled worker is familiar with other vectors which are suitable in prokaryotic
   organisms; these vectors are, for example, in E. coli, pLG338, pACYC184, the pBR
   series such as pBR322, the pUC series such as pUC18 or pUC19, the M113mp series,
   pKC30, pRep4, pHS1, pHS2, pPLc236, pMBL24, pLG200, pUR290, plN-111113-B1,
   Xgtl1 or pBdCl, in Streptomyces plJ101, plJ364, plJ702 or plJ361, in Bacillus pUB110,
15 pC194 or pBD214, in Corynebacterium pSA77 or pAJ667. Examples of vectors for
   expression in the yeast S. cerevisiae comprise pYep Sec1 (Baldari 1987, Embo J.
   6:229-234), pMFa (Kurjan 1982, Cell 30:933-943), pJRY88 (Schultz 1987, Gene 54:113
    123) and pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, CA). Vectors and processes for the
   construction of vectors which are suitable for use in other fungi, such as the filamentous
20 fungi, comprise those which are described in detail in: van den Hondel, C.A.M.J.J., &
   Punt, P.J. (1991) " Gene transfer systems and vector development for filamentous
   fungi, in: Applied Molecular Genetics of fungi, J.F. Peberdy et al., Ed., pp. 1-28,
   Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, or in: More Gene Manipulations in Fungi (J.W.
   Bennett & L.L. Lasure, Ed., pp. 396-428: Academic Press: San Diego). Further suitable
25 yeast vectors are, for example, pAG-1, YEp6, YEp13 or pEMBLYe23. As an alternative,
   the polynucleotides of the present invention can be also expressed in insect cells using
   baculovirus expression vectors. Baculovirus vectors which are available for the
   expression of proteins in cultured insect cells (for example Sf9 cells) comprise the pAc
   series (Smith 1983, Mol. Cell Biol. 3:2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow 1989,
30 Virology 170:31-39).
   The polynucleotide of the present invention can be expressed in single-cell plant cells
   (such as algae), see Falciatore 1999, Marine Biotechnology 1 (3):239-251 and the
   references cited therein, and plant cells from higher plants (for example
35 Spermatophytes, such as arable crops) by using plant expression vectors. Examples of
   plant expression vectors comprise those which are described in detail in: Becker 1992,
   Plant Mol. Biol. 20:1195-1197; Bevan 1984, Nucl. Acids Res. 12:8711-8721; Vectors for
   Gene Transfer in Higher Plants; in: Transgenic Plants, Vol. 1, Engineering and
   Utilization, Ed.: Kung and R. Wu, Academic Press, 1993, p. 15-38. A plant expression

                                                  34
   cassette, preferably, comprises regulatory sequences which are capable of controlling
   the gene expression in plant cells and which are functionally linked so that each
   sequence can fulfill its function, such as transcriptional termination, for example
   polyadenylation signals. Preferred polyadenylation signals are those which are derived
 5 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA, such as the gene 3 of the Ti plasmid pTiACH5,
   which is known as octopine synthase (Gielen 1984, EMBO J. 3, 835) or functional
   equivalents of these, but all other terminators which are functionally active in plants are
   also suitable. Since plant gene expression is very often not limited to transcriptional
   levels, a plant expression cassette preferably comprises other functionally linked
10 sequences such as translation enhancers, for example the overdrive sequence, which
   comprises the 5' -untranslated tobacco mosaic virus leader sequence, which increases
   the protein/RNA ratio (Gallie 1987, Nucl. Acids Research 15:8693-8711). As described
   above, plant gene expression must be functionally linked to a suitable promoter which
   performs the expression of the gene in a timely, cell-specific or tissue-specific manner.
15 Promoters which can be used are constitutive promoters (Benfey 1989, EMBO J.
   8:2195-2202) such as those which are derived from plant viruses such as 35S CAMV
   (Franck 1980, Cell 21:285-294), 19S CaMV (see US 5,352,605 and WO 84/02913) or
   plant promoters such as the promoter of the Rubisco small subunit, which is described in
   US 4,962,028. Other preferred sequences for the use in functional linkage in plant gene
20 expression cassettes are targeting sequences which are required for targeting the gene
   product into its relevant cell compartment (for a review, see Kermode 1996, Crit. Rev.
   Plant Sci. 15, 4: 285-423 and references cited therein), for example into the vacuole, the
   nucleus, all types of plastids, such as amyloplasts, chloroplasts, chromoplasts, the
   extracellular space, the mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, oil bodies,
25 peroxisomes and other compartments of plant cells. As described above, plant gene
   expression can also be facilitated via a chemically inducible promoter (for a review, see
   Gatz 1997, Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol., 48:89-108). Chemically inducible
   promoters are particularly suitable if it is desired that genes are expressed in a time
   specific manner. Examples of such promoters are a salicylic-acid-inducible promoter
30 (WO 95/19443), a tetracyclin-inducible promoter (Gatz 1992, Plant J. 2, 397-404) and an
   ethanol-inducible promoter. Promoters which respond to biotic or abiotic stress
   conditions are also suitable promoters, for example the pathogen-induced PRP1-gene
   promoter (Ward 1993, Plant Mol. Biol. 22:361-366), the heat-inducible hsp80 promoter
   from tomato (US 5,187,267), the cold-inducible alpha-amylase promoter from potato
35 (WO 96/12814) or the wound-inducible pinll promoter (EP 0 375 091 A). The promoters
   which are especially preferred are those which bring about the expression of genes in
   tissues and organs in which fatty acid, lipid and oil biosynthesis takes place, in seed
   cells such as the cells of endosperm and of the developing embryo. Suitable promoters
   are the napin gene promoter from oilseed rape (US 5,608,152), the USP promoter from
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                  35
   Vicia faba (Baeumlein 1991, Mol. Gen. Genet. 225 (3):459-67), the oleosin promoter
   from Arabidopsis (WO 98/45461), the phaseolin promoter from Phaseolus vulgaris (US
   5,504,200), the Bce4 promoter from Brassica (WO 91/13980) or the legumin B4
   promoter (LeB4; Baeumlein 1992, Plant Journal, 2 (2):233-9), and promoters which
 5 bring about the seed-specific expression in monocotyledonous plants such as maize,
   barley, wheat, rye, rice and the like. Suitable promoters to be taken into consideration
   are the Ipt2 or Ipt1 gene promoter from barley (WO 95/15389 and WO 95/23230) or
   those which are described in WO 99/16890 (promoters from the barley hordein gene,
   the rice glutelin gene, the rice oryzin gene, the rice prolamin gene, the wheat gliadin
10 gene, wheat glutelin gene, the maize zein gene, the oat glutelin gene, the sorghum
   kasirin gene, the rye secalin gene). Likewise, especially suitable are promoters which
   bring about the plastid-specific expression since plastids are the compartment in which
   the precursors and some end products of lipid biosynthesis are synthesized. Suitable
   promoters such as the viral RNA-polymerase promoter, are described in WO 95/16783
15 and WO 97/06250, and the clpP promoter from Arabidopsis, described in WO 99/46394.
   The abovementioned vectors are only a small overview of vectors to be used in
   accordance with the present invention. Further vectors are known to the skilled worker
   and are described, for example, in: Cloning Vectors (Ed., Pouwels, P.H., et al., Elsevier,
   Amsterdam-New York-Oxford, 1985, ISBN 0 444 904018). For further suitable
20 expression systems for prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see the chapters 16 and 17 of
   Sambrook, loc cit.
    It follows from the above that, preferably, said vector is an expression vector. More

   promoter as meant herein is selected from the group consisting of Conlinin 1, Conlinin 2,
   napin, LuFad3, USP, LeB4, Arc, Fae, ACP, LuPXR, and SBP. For details, see, e.g., US

   Also preferably, said host cell is a microorganism. More preferably, said microorganism
   is a bacterium, a fungus or algae. More preferably, it is selected from the group
   consisting of Candida, Cryptococcus, Lipomyces, Rhodosporidium, Yarrowia, and
 5 Schizochytrium.
   Moreover, a host cell according to the present invention may also be an animal cell.
   Preferably, said animal host cell is a host cell of a fish or a cell line obtained therefrom.
   More preferably, the fish host cell is from herring, salmon, sardine, redfish, eel, carp,
10 trout, halibut, mackerel, zander or tuna.
   Generally, the controlling steps in the production of LCPUFAs, /.e., the long chain
   unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated
   fatty acid elongase complexes. Plants and most other eukaryotic organisms have
15 specialized elongase system for the extension of fatty acids beyond C18 atoms. These
   elongase reactions have several important features in common with the fatty acid
   synthase complex (FAS). However, the elongase complex is different from the FAS
   complex as the complex is localized in the cytosol and membrane bound, ACP is not
   involved and the elongase 3-keto-acyl-CoA-synthase catalyzes the condensation of
20 malonyl-CoA with an acyl primer. The elongase complex consists of four components
   with different catalytic functions, the keto-acyl-CoA-synthase (KCS, condensation
   reaction of malonyl-CoA to acyl-CoA, creation of a 2 C atom longer keto-acyl-CoA fatty
   acid), the keto-acyl-CoA-reductase (KCR, reduction of the 3-keto group to a 3-hydroxy
   group), the dehydratase (DH, dehydration results in a delta-2-enoyl-acyl-CoA fatty acid)
25 and the enoly-CoA-reductase (ECR, reduction of the double bond at position 2, release
   from the complex). For the production of LCPUFAs including ARA, EPA and/or DHA the
   elongation and desaturation reactions could be essential. Higher plants do not have the
   necessary enzyme set to produce LCPUFAs (4 or more double bonds, 20 or more C
   atoms). Therefore the catalytic activities have to be conferred to the plants or plant cells.
30 Critical steps in the process of LCPUFA biosynthesis are the elongation of fatty acids
   from 18 to 24 carbon atoms and desaturation of carbon atoms. Polynucleotides of the
   present invention surprisingly catalyze the keto-acyl-CoA-synthase, keto-acyl-CoA
   reductase reactions and therefore catalyze the elongation of 18 carbon atoms fatty
   acids. Polynucleotides of the present invention surprisingly catalyze the desaturation of
35 the    4th,9th,       12th, 15th and 17th fatty acids carbon atom bonds. By delivering these
   enzymes increased levels of PUFAs and LCPUFAs are produced.
   However, it will be understood that dependent on the host cell, further, enzymatic
   activities may be conferred to the host cells, e.g., by recombinant technologies.

                                               37
   Accordingly, the present invention, preferably, envisages a host cell which in addition to
   the polynucleotide of the present invention comprises polynucleotides encoding such
   desaturases and/or elongases as required depending on the selected host cell.

   The present invention furthermore pertains to a method for the manufacture of a
   polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of any the present invention comprising
   a) cultivating the host cell of the invention under conditions which allow for the
              production of the said polypeptide; and
15 b) obtaining the polypeptide from the host cell of step a).
   Suitable conditions which allow for expression of the polynucleotide of the invention
   comprised by the host cell depend on the host cell as well as the expression control
   sequence used for governing expression of the said polynucleotide. These conditions
20 and how to select them are very well known to those skilled in the art. The expressed
   polypeptide may be obtained, for example, by all conventional purification techniques
   including affinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, high pressure liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) and precipitation techniques including antibody precipitation. It
   is to be understood that the method may - although preferred -not necessarily yield an
25 essentially pure preparation of the polypeptide. It is to be understood that depending on
   the host cell which is used for the aforementioned method, the polypeptides produced
   thereby may become posttranslationally modified or processed otherwise.
   The present invention encompasses a polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide of the
30 present invention or which is obtainable by the aforementioned method.
   The term " polypeptide" as used herein encompasses essentially purified polypeptides
   or polypeptide preparations comprising other proteins in addition. Further, the term also
   relates to the fusion proteins or polypeptide fragments being at least partially encoded
35 by the polynucleotide of the present invention referred to above. Moreover, it includes
   chemically modified polypeptides. Such modifications may be artificial modifications or
   naturally occurring modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, myristylation
   and the like (Review in Mann 2003, Nat. Biotechnol. 21, 255- 261, review with focus on
   plants in Huber 2004, Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 7, 318-322). Currently, more than 300

                                                 40
   posttranslational modifications are known (see full ABFRC Delta mass list at
   http://www.abrf.org/index.cfm/dm.home). The polypeptide of the present invention shall
   exhibit the desaturase, keto-acyl-CoA-synthase and keto-acyl-CoA-reductase activity
   referred to above.

   Encompassed by the present invention is, furthermore, an antibody which specifically
   recognizes the polypeptide of the invention.
   Antibodies against the polypeptides of the invention can be prepared by well known
10 methods using a purified polypeptide according to the invention or a suitable fragment
   derived therefrom as an antigen. A fragment which is suitable as an antigen may be
   identified by antigenicity determining algorithms well known in the art. Such fragments
   may be obtained either from the polypeptide of the invention by proteolytic digestion or
   may be a synthetic peptide. Preferably, the antibody of the present invention is a
15 monoclonal antibody, a polyclonal antibody, a single chain antibody, a chimerized
   antibody or a fragment of any of these antibodies, such as Fab, Fv or scFv fragments
   etc.. Also comprised as antibodies by the present invention are bispecific antibodies,
   synthetic antibodies or chemically modified derivatives of any of the aforementioned
   antibodies. The antibody of the present invention shall specifically bind (i.e. does
20 significantly not cross react with other polypeptides or peptides) to the polypeptide of the
   invention. Specific binding can be tested by various well known techniques. Antibodies
   or fragments thereof can be obtained by using methods which are described, e.g., in
   Harlow and Lane "Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual", CSH Press, Cold Spring Harbor,
    1988. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by the techniques originally described in
25 K6hler 1975, Nature 256, 495, and Galfre 1981, Meth. Enzymol. 73, 3, which comprise
   the fusion of mouse myeloma cells to spleen cells derived from immunized mammals.
   The antibodies can be used, for example, for the immunoprecipitation,
   immunolocalization or purification (e.g., by affinity chromatography) of the polypeptides
   of the invention as well as for the monitoring of the presence of said variant
30 polypeptides, for example, in recombinant organisms, and for the identification of
   proteins or compounds interacting with the proteins according to the invention.
   Moreover, the antibody according to the present invention can be applied for identifying
   the presence or absence of the polypeptides of the present invention. Preferably, the
35 antibody is used for identifying non-human transgenic organisms as specified elsewhere
   herein and, preferably, transgenic plants, which comprise the polypeptides of the
   present invention. To this end, the antibody may be provided in form of a kit which
   allows for identifying non-human transgenic organisms and, preferably, transgenic plants
   comprising the polypeptides of the present invention. The kit, in addition to the antibody
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                 41
   of the present invention, may further comprise a detection agent for detecting a complex
   of the antibody of the invention and the polypeptide of the invention.
   Moreover, the present invention contemplates a non-human transgenic organism
 5 comprising the polynucleotide or the vector of the present invention.
   Preferably, the non-human transgenic organism is a plant, plant part, or plant seed.
   Preferred plants to be used for introducing the polynucleotide or the vector of the
   invention are plants which are capable of synthesizing fatty acids, such as all
10 dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants, algae or mosses. It is to be understood that
   host cells derived from a plant may also be used for producing a plant according to the
   present invention. Preferred plants are selected from the group of the plant families

   in the fatty acid chain. More preferably, the term relates to long chain PUFA (LCPUFA)
   having from 20 to 24 carbon atoms in the fatty acid chain. Preferred unsaturated fatty
   acids in the sense of the present invention are selected from the group consisting of
   DGLA 20:3 (8,11,14), ARA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), iARA 20:4(8,11,14,17), EPA 20:5

   20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). Thus, it
   will be understood that most preferably, the methods provided by the present invention
   pertaining to the manufacture of ARA, EPA or DHA. Moreover, also encompassed are
20 the intermediates of LCPUFA which occur during synthesis. Such intermediates are,
   preferably, formed from substrates by the desaturase, keto-acyl-CoA-synthase and keto
   acyl-CoA-reductase activity of the polypeptide of the present invention. Preferably,
   substrates encompass LA 18:2 (9,12), GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), DGLA 20:3 (8,11,14), ARA
   20:4 (5,8,11,14), eicosadienoic acid 20:2 (11,14), eicosatetraenoic acid 20:4
25 (8,11,14,17), eicosapentaenoic acid 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17).
   The term " cultivating" as used herein refers maintaining and growing the host cells
   under culture conditions which allow the cells to produce the said polyunsaturated fatty
   acid, i.e. the PUFA and/or LCPUFA referred to above. This implies that the
30 polynucleotide of the present invention is expressed in the host cell so that the
   desaturase, keto-acyl-CoA-synthase and keto-acyl-CoA-reductase activity is present.
   Suitable culture conditions for cultivating the host cell are described in more detail
   below.
35 The term " obtaining" as used herein encompasses the provision of the cell culture
   including the host cells and the culture medium as well as the provision of purified or
   partially purified preparations thereof comprising the polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   preferably, ARA, EPA, DHA, in free or in -CoA bound form, as membrane phospholipids
   or as triacylglyceride estres. More preferably, the PUFA and LCPUFA are to be obtained
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                   48
   as triglyceride esters, e.g., in form of an oil. More details on purification techniques can
   be found elsewhere herein below.
   The host cells to be used in the method of the invention are grown or cultured in the
 5 manner with which the skilled worker is familiar, depending on the host organism.
   Usually, host cells are grown in a liquid medium comprising a carbon source, usually in
   the form of sugars, a nitrogen source, usually in the form of organic nitrogen sources
   such as yeast extract or salts such as ammonium sulfate, trace elements such as salts
   of iron, manganese and magnesium and, if appropriate, vitamins, at temperatures of
10 between 00C and 100 C, preferably between 10 C and 600C under oxygen or anaerobic
   atmosphere depedent on the type of organism. The pH of the liquid medium can either
   be kept constant, that is to say regulated during the culturing period, or not. The cultures
   can be grown batchwise, semibatchwise or continuously. Nutrients can be provided at
   the beginning of the fermentation or administerd semicontinuously or continuously: The
15 produced PUFA or LCPUFA can be isolated from the host cells as described above by
   processes known to the skilled worker, e.g., by extraction, distillation, crystallization, if
   appropriate precipitation with salt, and/or chromatography. It might be required to disrupt
   the host cells prior to purification. To this end, the host cells can be disrupted
   beforehand. The culture medium to be used must suitably meet the requirements of the
20 host cells in question. Descriptions of culture media for various microorganisms which
   can be used as host cells according to the present invention can be found in the
   textbook "Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology" of the American Society for
   Bacteriology (Washington D.C., USA, 1981). Culture media can also be obtained from
   various commercial suppliers. All media components are sterilized, either by heat or by
25 filter sterilization. All media components may be present at the start of the cultivation or
   added continuously or batchwise, as desired. If the polynucleotide or vector of the
   invention which has been introduced in the host cell further comprises an expressible
   selection marker, such as an antibiotic resistance gene, it might be necessary to add a
   selection agent to the culture, such as a antibiotic in order to maintain the stability of the
30 introduced polynucleotide. The culture is continued until formation of the desired product
   is at a maximum. This is normally achieved within 10 to 160 hours. The fermentation
   broths can be used directly or can be processed further. The biomass may, according to
   requirement, be removed completely or partially from the fermentation broth by
   separation methods such as, for example, centrifugation, filtration, decanting or a
35 combination of these methods or be left completely in said broth. The fatty acid
   preparations obtained by the method of the invention, e.g., oils, comprising the desired
   PUFA or LCPUFA as triglyceride esters are also suitable as starting material for the
   chemical synthesis of further products of interest. For example, they can be used in
   combination with one another or alone for the preparation of pharmaceutical or cosmetic
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                    49
   compositions, foodstuffs, or animal feeds. Chemically pure triglycerides comprising the
   desired PUFA or LCPUFA can also be manufactured by the methods described above.
   To this end, the fatty acid preparations are further purified by extraction, distillation,
   crystallization, chromatography or combinations of these methods. In order to release
 5 the fatty acid moieties from the triglycerides, hydrolysis may be also required. The said
   chemically pure triglycerides or free fatty acids are, in particular, suitable for applications
   in the food industry or for cosmetic and pharmacological compositions.
   Moreover, the present invention relates to a method for the manufacture of poly
10 unsaturated fatty acids comprising:
   a) cultivating the non-human transgenic organism of the invention under conditions
              which allow for the production of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in said host cell; and
   b) obtaining said poly-unsaturated fatty acids from the said non-human transgenic
              organism.
15
   Further, it follows from the above that a method for the manufacture of an oil, lipid or
   fatty acid composition is also envisaged by the present invention comprising the steps of
   any one of the aforementioned methods and the further step of formulating PUFA or
   LCPUFA as oil, lipid or fatty acid composition. Preferably, said oil, lipid or fatty acid
20 composition is to be used for feed, foodstuffs, cosmetics or medicaments. Accordingly,
   the formulation of the PUFA or LCPUFA shall be carried out according to the GMP
   standards for the individual envisaged products. For example, an oil may be obtained
   from plant seeds by an oil mill. However, for product safety reasons, sterilization may be
   required under the applicable GMP standard. Similar standards will apply for lipid or fatty
25 acid compositions to be applied in cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions. All these
   measures for formulating oil, lipid or fatty acid compositions as products are comprised
   by the aforementioned manufacture.
   For the production of ARA it is, preferably, envisaged to cultivate a host cell of the
30 invention or a non-human transgenic organism which comprises a combination of
   polynucleotides of the present invention. Preferably, a combination of the
   polynucleotides of the invention is envisaged which encode a d12 desaturase, a d6
   desaturase, a d6 elongase, a d5 desaturase and KCR (see also Table 5 in the
   accompanying Examples).
35
   For the production of ARA it is, alternatively but also preferably, envisaged to cultivate a
   host cell of the invention or a non-human transgenic organism which comprises a
   combination of polynucleotides of the present invention. Preferably, a combination of the
   polynucleotides of the invention is envisaged which encode a d12 desaturase, a d9
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

                                                   50
   elongase, a d8 desaturase, a d5 desaturase and KCR (see also Table 6 in the
   accompanying Examples).
   For the production of EPA it is, preferably, envisaged to cultivate a host cell of the
 5 invention or a non-human transgenic organism which comprises a combination of
   polynucleotides of the present invention. Preferably, a combination of the
   polynucleotides which are preferably applied for the ARA production specified above is
   used together with a polynucleotide of the present invention encoding a d15 desaturase
   and a polynucleotide of the present invention encoding a omega-3 desaturase (i.e. a
10 combination of the activities referred to either in Table 7 with those of Table 5 or Table 6
   For the production of DHA it is, preferably, envisaged to cultivate a host cell of the
   invention or a non-human transgenic organism which comprises a combination of
15 polynucleotides of the present invention. Preferably, a combination of the
   polynucleotides which are preferably applied for the EPA production specified above is
   used together with a polynucleotide of the present invention encoding a d5 elongase and
   a polynucleotide of the present invention encoding a d4 desaturase (i.e. a combination
   of the activities referred to either in Table 5 and Table 7 with those of Table 8 or Table 6
20 and Table 7 with those of Table 8)
   The present invention also relates to an oil comprising a polyunsaturated fatty acid
   obtainable by the aforementioned methods.
25 The term " oil" refers to a fatty acid mixture comprising unsaturated and/or saturated
   fatty acids which are esterified to triglycerides. Preferably, the triglycerides in the oil of
   the invention comprise PUFA or LCPUFA as referred to above. The amount of esterified
   PUFA and/or LCPUFA is, preferably, approximately 30%, a content of 50% is more
   preferred, a content of 60%, 70%, 80% or more is even more preferred. The oil may
30 further comprise free fatty acids, preferably, the PUFA and LCPUFA referred to above.
   For the analysis, the fatty acid content can be, e.g., determined by GC analysis after
   converting the fatty acids into the methyl esters by transesterification. The content of the
   various fatty acids in the oil or fat can vary, in particular depending on the source. The
   oil, however, shall have a non-naturally occurring composition with respect to the PUFA
35 and/or LCPUFA composition and content. It is known that most of the fatty acids in plant
   oil are esterified in triacylglycerides. Accordingly, in the oil of the invention, the PUFAs
   and LCPUFAs are, preferably, also occur in esterified form in the triacylglcerides. It will
   be understood that such a unique oil composition and the unique esterification pattern of
   PUFA and LCPUFA in the triglycerides of the oil shall only be obtainable by applying the
   9865012_1 (GHMatters) P99034.AU.1

   methods of the present invention specified above.. Moreover, the oil of the invention
   may comprise other molecular species as well. Specifically, it may comprise minor
   impurities of the polynucleotide or vector of the invention. Such impurities, however, can
   be detected only by highly sensitive techniques such as PCR.

   Example 1: General Cloning Methods
   Cloning methods as e.g. use of restriction endonucleases to cut double stranded DNA at
35 specific sites, agarose gel electrophoreses, purification of DNA fragments, transfer of
   nucleic acids onto nitrocellulose and nylon membranes, ligation of DNA fragments,

   Example 2: Sequence Analysis of recombinant DNA
   Sequencing of recombinant DNA molecules was performed using a laser-fluorescence
   DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc, USA) employing the sanger method (Sanger
 5 et al. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 5463-5467). Expression constructs
   harboring fragments obtained by polymerase chain reaction were subjected to
   sequencing to confirm the correctness of the expression cassettes consisting of
   promoter, nucleic acid molecule to be expressed and terminator to avoid mutations that
   might result from handling of the DNA during cloning, e.g. due to incorrect primers,
10 mutations from exposure to UV-light or errors of polymerases.
   Example 3: Cloning of yeast expression construct via homologous recombination

15 and 83 encoding polypeptides with the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NOs: 2, 5, 8, 11,
    14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32,79, 84, 85 or 86 that have desaturase, elongase, KCR or
   LACS activity, respectively can be amplified using the primers listed in table 2 in a
   polymerase chain reaction. By doing so, the open reading frame is 5' fused to about 60
   nucleotides of the 3' end of the GAL1 promoter sequence with simultanious
20 introduction of an Asc I and/or Nco I restriction site between the fusion site and 3'
   fused to about 60 nucleotides of the 5' end of the CYC1 terminator sequence with
   simultanious introduction of an Pac I restriction site. To integrate these fragments into
   pYES2.1 TOPO downstream of the galactose inducible GAL1 Promoter via homologous
   recombination, the vector pYES2.1 (Invitrogen) can be digested using the restriction
25 endonucleases Pvu II and Xba l, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be transformed
   with 5 to 20 ng of linearized pYES2.1 TOPO vector and 20 to 100 ng PCR product per
   50 pl competent cells using the transformation method described by Schiestl et al.
   (Schiestl et al. (1989) Curr. Genet. 16(5-6), pp. 339-346), to obtain pYes

   Example 4: Activity Assay in Yeast
   As an example the superior activity of identified polypeptides can be confirmed by
   heterologous expression in yeast. Table 4 and 5 show activity assays of yeasts
 5 transformed with pYes-pd6Des(Ta)_c3318 (comprising the Thraustrochytrium aureum
   delta-6-desaturase gene), pYes-pd9Des(Ta)_c4008 (comprising the Thraustrochytrium
   aureum delta-9-desaturase gene), pYes-po3Des(Ta)_c959 (comprising the
   Thraustrochytrium aureum omega-3-desaturase gene), pYes-po3Des(Ta)_c1830
   (comprising the Thraustrochytrium aureum omega-3-desaturase gene), pYes
10 pd12Des(Ta)_c1219 (comprising the Thraustrochytrium aureum delta-1 2-desaturase
   gene), pYes-pd5Elo(Ta)_cl (comprising the Thraustrochytrium aureum delta-5-elongase
   gene), pYes-pd6Elo(Ta)_c231 (comprising the Thraustrochytrium aureum delta-6
   elongase gene), pYes-pd6Elo(Ta)_c752 (comprising the Thraustrochytrium aureum
   delta-6-elongase gene), pYes-pd6Elo(Ta)_c4696 (comprising the Thraustrochytrium
15 aureum delta-6-elongase gene), pYes-pd9Elo(Ta)_c4589 (comprising the
   Thraustrochytrium aureum delta-9-elongase gene), pYes-pKCR(Ta)_c1703 (comprising
   the Thraustrochytrium aureum KCR gene) and pYes-d4Des(Sa) (comprising the
   Sphaeroforma arctica delta-4-desaturase gene) constructs. Yeast cells containing the
   respective plasmids were incubated 12 h in liquid drop out base medium lacking uracil
20 (DOB-U medium) at 28 OC, 200 rpm incubated, followed by an additional 12 h in
   induction medium (DOB-U+2% (w/v) galactose + 2% (w/v) raffinose). To the induction
   medium 250 p M of the respecitve fatty acids were added to check for enzyme activity
   and specificity. In addition, the fed substrate ,the expected product fatty acid are
   indicated in table 4 and table 5.
25
    In the gas chromatograms of yeast extracts, transformed with pYes- pd5Elo(Ta)_c1 and
   fed with 20:5n-3 or 20:4n-6, the fatty acids 22:5n-3 and 22:4n-6 were detected (Table 5,
   Figure 1). This result shows that pYes- pd5Elo(Ta)_ci has d5-elongase activity and
   exhibits a surprisingly high conversion rate. In a direct comparison of the gene
30 d4Des(Sa) of SEQ ID NO 78 against d4Des(Tc) of SEQ ID NO 76 in a parallel
   experiment, d4Des(Sa) expressed by construct pYes-d4Des(Sa) was found to have a
   surprisingly high convertion rate (conversion efficiency) of 22%, compared to convertion
   rate of only 10% for the gene d4Des(Tc). According to the invention it is believed that
   the delta-4 desaturases of Sphaeroforma arctica and Thraustochytrium sp. exhibit a
35 preference for different fatty acid pools, i.e. for fatty acids bound to ACP, to CoA or in
   phospholipids.

 5 Example 6: yeast feeding with LACS
   To investigate the role of this gene by including it in cultures that also carried an
   elongase and a desaturase gene pair, namely D6ELO(SA) (i.e. delta-6-elongase of
   Sphaeroforma arctica), and D5DES(SA) (i.e. delta-5-desaturase of Sphaeroforma
10 arctica), both described in W02011064181 and W02011064183. When cultures were
   induced in the presence of GLA, the first elongation to DGLA in cultures carrying SA
   LACS1 (Sphaeroforma arctica LACS, SEQ ID NO. 83/84) was lower than that in cultures
   carrying an empty pYES2.1V5-His-TOPO vector, reflecting the higher, probably
   saturated level of substrate available due to the more efficient uptake of GLA in the
15 presence of the acyl CoA-synthetase. However, although DGLA accumulated to similar
   levels in both samples, desaturation to ARA was approximately 1.6 times as high in the
   presence of the LACS gene. Similarly, further elongations of DGLA to 22:3n-6 and ARA
   to 22:4n-6 were more efficient in the presence of SA-LACS1, with elongation of the
   desaturated product ARA about 1.7 fold higher in the presence of SA-LACS1. Results
20 from experiments where cultures were supplemented with SDA showed a similar trend,
   with approximately 40% more 20:4A 8,11,14.17 desaturated to EPA, and 25% more
   EPA extended to DHA. The overall lower conversion ratios for this experiment compared
   to experiments using single genes reflected reduced efficiencies due to different vectors
   and multiple gene expression.
