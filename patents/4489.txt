                                    CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
 5              This application is a divisional application of AU2013208104, which in turn claims priority
   from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/584,569, filed January 9, 2012. The contents of each of
   AU2013208104 and US61/584,569 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 0              The present invention relates to benzhydrol-pyrazole derivatives and related compounds
   having kinase inhibitory activity, as well as their therapeutic, diagnostic, and medical uses.
                Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (Btk or BTK) is a cytoplasmic kinase in the
   Tec family. Btk plays an important role in the development and regulation of lymphoid, myeloid,
   and mast cell lineages, such as by activating the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway,
 5 mediating cytokine receptor signaling, and participating in mast cell activation. However, activation
   or overactivation of Btk can contribute to or promote numerous diseases, including B-cell
   malignancies (e.g., Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia), inflammatory or autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
   erythematosus, or multiple sclerosis), and mast cell malignancies (e.g., pancreatic insulinoma).
 0 Thus, there is a need for new compounds that inhibit Btk and treatment methods using such
   compounds.

   Methods of Preparing Compounds of the Invention
 5              The compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes analogous to those established
   in the art, for example, by the reaction sequences shown in Schemes 1-5. The numbering system
   used for the general schemes does not necessarily correspond to that employed elsewhere in the
   description or in the claims.
                A compound of formula E-1 can be prepared under standard reductive conditions by treating
10 a compound of formula C-1 with a compound of formula D-1, or suitable protected derivatives
   thereof, and "R" is H, hydroxy, alkyl, alkoxy, or any leaving group, such as chloro, bromo, iodo, or
   sulfonate (e.g., mesylate, tosylate, or triflate) (see Scheme 1). Exemplary reductive conditions

 5              A compound of formula G-1 can be prepared by a coupling or acylation reaction between
   compounds of formulas E-1 and F-1, under standard conditions. For example, if E-1 and F-1 reacts
   to form an NH-C(O) moiety (e.g., where E-1 includes a carboxy and F-1 includes an amino, as
   defined herein, or vice versa), then any of the coupling reactions for peptides can be used (e.g., as
   described herein). Alternatively, if the compound of formula E-1 or F-1 includes an aldehyde or a
 0 ketone group, then reductive amination conditions can be used, such as a reducing agent (e.g.,
   NaBH 4 , NaBH(OAc) 3 , NaCNBH 4, and the like, in an alcoholic solvent, such as ethanol) or the
   combination of a silane reagent (e.g., Et 3 SiH, phenylsilanes (e.g., PhSiH 3), halosilanes (e.g.,
   trichlorosilane), or silylsilanes (e.g., tris(trimethylsilyl)silane))) with catalytic InX 3, FeX 3, CuX,
   Ni[ligand] 2 , PtX2 , Pd[ligand] 2, PdX2 [ligand] 2 , or Ir[X(ligand)] 2, where each X is independently halo
15 (e.g., bromo or chloro) and each ligand is any useful ligand (e.g., 1,5-cyclooctadiene, OAc, or PPh 3).
                Alternatively, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by modifying the reactions of
   Scheme 1 in any useful manner. For example, a compound of formula E-2 can be prepared under
   standard conditions by treating a compound of formula C-2 with a compound of formula D-2, or
   suitable protected derivatives thereof, and "LG" is a leaving group, such as chloro, bromo, iodo,

25 K-5. Then, the nitro group can be reduced by any useful reductive conditions (e.g., any described
   herein, such as Pd/C catalysis) to provide a compound of formula C-5. The amino group of formula
   C-5 could be further modified (e.g., alkylated) to provide a secondary or tertiary amine.

                In some cases the chemistry outlined herein may have to be modified, for instance, by the
   use of protective groups to prevent side reactions of reactive groups, e.g., those attached as
 5 substituents. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups as described in
   Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, McOmie, Ed., Plenum Press, 1973 and in Greene and
   Wuts, Protective Groups in OrganicSynthesis, John Wiley & Sons, 3'd Edition, 1999.
                The compounds of the invention, and intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of
   the invention, may be isolated from their reaction mixtures and purified (if necessary) using
 0 conventional techniques, including extraction, chromatography, distillation, and recrystallization.
                The formation of a desired compound salt is achieved using standard techniques. For
   example, the neutral compound is treated with an acid in a suitable solvent, and the formed salt is
   isolated by filtration, extraction, crystallization, or any other suitable method.
                The formation of solvates of the compounds of the invention will vary depending on the
 5 compound and the solvate. In general, solvates are formed by dissolving the compound in the
   appropriate solvent and isolating the solvate by cooling or adding an antisolvent. The solvate is
   typically dried or azeotroped under ambient conditions.
                Preparation of an optical isomer of a compound of the invention may be performed by
   reaction of the appropriate optically active starting materials under reaction conditions which will
 0 not cause racemization. Alternatively, the individual enantiomers may be isolated by separation of a
   racemic mixture using standard techniques, such as, for example, fractional crystallization or chiral
   HPLC.
                A radiolabeled compound of the invention may be prepared using standard methods known
   in the art. For example, tritium may be incorporated into a compound of the invention using
25 standard techniques, such as, for example, by hydrogenation of a suitable precursor to a compound
   of the invention using tritium gas and a catalyst. Alternatively, a compound of the invention
   containing radioactive iodine may be prepared from the corresponding trialkyltin (suitably
   trimethyltin) derivative using standard iodination conditions, such as [125I] sodium iodide in the
   presence of chloramine-T in a suitable solvent, such as dimethylformamide. The trialkyltin

    compound may be prepared from the corresponding non-radioactive halogen, suitably iodo,
    compound using standard palladium-catalyzed stannylation conditions, such as, for example,
    hexamethylditin in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) in an inert solvent,
    such as dioxane, and at elevated temperatures, preferably 50-100'C.

   Pharmaceutical Uses
                 The present invention features all uses for compounds of the invention, including use in
    therapeutic methods. The compounds of the invention have useful BTK inhibiting activity, and
    therefore are useful to treat, prevent, or reduce the risk of, diseases or conditions that are
 0  ameliorated by a reduction in BTK activity, such as a B-cell related disorder or a mast cell related
    disorder (e.g., any disorder described herein).
                 Cancer
                 BTK is a key regulator in B-cell development, differentiation, and signaling, as well as in
 5  mast cell activation. Accordingly, activation of BTK has been implicated in the pathology of
    numerous proliferative disorders, including B-cell, mast cell, and other non-B-cell associated
    cancers.
                 Exemplary proliferative disorders (e.g., cancers) include leukemia, including acute myeloid
    leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic
 0  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML),
   juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL);
    lymphomas, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, such as B-cell lymphomas (e.g.,
    diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (e.g., mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma and intravascular
    large B-cell lymphoma), follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic
25  lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), mantle cell lymphoma (e.g.,
    relapsed or refractory), marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (e.g., extranodal marginal zone B-cell
    lymphoma, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma), Burkitt
    lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia), hairy cell leukemia,
   primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and lymphomatoid
30  granulomatosis); myelomas, including multiple myeloma (plasma cell myeloma), plasmacytoma,
    localized myeloma, and extramedullary myeloma; and other cancers, such as pancreatic neoplasms,
    including pancreatic exocrine tumors (e.g., ductal adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell carcinomas,

   hepatoid carcinomas, colloid carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, and undifferentiated
   carcinomas with osteoclast-like giant cells), pancreatic cystic neoplasms (e.g., mucinous
   cystadenoma, serous cystadenoma, and mucinous ductal ectasia), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
   (e.g., insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), VIPoma, and
 5 somatostatinoma), papillary cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, lymphoma of the pancreas, and acinar
   cell tumors of the pancreas; malignant glioma; and papillary thyroid cancer.
                Inflammatory Disorders (includingAutoimmune Disorders)
                Inhibition of BTK has been shown to mitigate inflammation and/or suppress the production
 0 of inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used to treat or
   prophylactically treat inflammatory disorders, including autoimmune disorders.
                Exemplary inflammatory or autoimmune disorders include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
   lupus erythematosus (and associated glomerulonephritis), multiple sclerosis, and asthma. Further
   exemplary disorders include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Addison's disease, allergy,

   cortisone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisolone sodium phosphate, and
   prednisone. Non-limiting examples of immunosuppressants include alkylation agents (e.g.,
   cyclophosphamide), antimetabolites (e.g., azathioprine, methotrexate, leflunomide, and
   mycophenolate mofetil), antibodies or antibody fragments or derivatives (e.g., an anti-C5
 5 monoclonal antibody, such as eculizumab or pexelizumab; and a TNF antagonist, such as
   entanercept or infliximab, or fragments or derivatives of any of these), and macrolides (e.g.,
   cyclosporine and tacrolimus).
                Combination Therapies
 0              A compound of the invention can be used alone or in combination with other agents that
   have BTK-inhibiting activity, or in combination with other types of treatment (which may or may
   not inhibit BTK) to treat, prevent, and/or reduce the risk of cancer, an inflammatory disorder, or
   other disorders that benefit from BTK inhibition. In combination treatments, the dosages of one or
   more of the therapeutic compounds may be reduced from standard dosages when administered
 5 alone. For example, doses may be determined empirically from drug combinations and
   permutations or may be deduced by isobolographic analysis (e.g., Black et al., Neurology 65:S3-S6,
   2005). In this case, dosages of the compounds when combined should provide a therapeutic effect.
   Pharmaceutical Compositions
 0              The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated into pharmaceutical compositions
   for administration to human subjects in a biologically compatible form suitable for administration in
   vivo. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition
   comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a suitable diluent, carrier, or excipient.
                The compounds of the invention may be used in the form of the free base, in the form of
25 salts, solvates, and as prodrugs. All forms are within the scope of the invention. In accordance with
   the methods of the invention, the described compounds or salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof may
   be administered to a patient in a variety of forms depending on the selected route of administration,
   as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The compounds of the invention may be
   administered, for example, by oral, parenteral, buccal, sublingual, nasal, rectal, patch, pump, or
30 transdermal administration and the pharmaceutical compositions formulated accordingly.
   Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular,
                                                        40
   5548493 1 (GHMatters) P97495.Al

   transepithelial, nasal, intrapulmonary, intrathecal, rectal, and topical modes of administration.
   Parenteral administration may be by continuous infusion over a selected period of time.
                A compound of the invention may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent
   or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or it
 5 may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For
   oral therapeutic administration, a compound of the invention may be incorporated with an excipient
   and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions,
   syrups, wafers, and the like.
                A compound of the invention may also be administered parenterally. Solutions of a
 0 compound of the invention can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as
   hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols,
   DMSO and mixtures thereof with or without alcohol, and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of
   storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of
   microorganisms. Conventional procedures and ingredients for the selection and preparation of
 5 suitable formulations are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (2003,
   20th ed.) and in The United States Pharmacopeia: The National Formulary (USP 24 NF19),
   published in 1999.
                The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or
   dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or
 0 dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that may be easily
   administered via syringe.
                Compositions for nasal administration may conveniently be formulated as aerosols, drops,
   gels, and powders. Aerosol formulations typically include a solution or fine suspension of the active
   substance in a physiologically acceptable aqueous or non-aqueous solvent and are usually presented
25 in single or multidose quantities in sterile form in a sealed container, which can take the form of a
   cartridge or refill for use with an atomizing device. Alternatively, the sealed container may be a
   unitary dispensing device, such as a single dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a
   metering valve which is intended for disposal after use. Where the dosage form comprises an
   aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant, which can be a compressed gas, such as compressed
30 air or an organic propellant, such as fluorochlorohydrocarbon. The aerosol dosage forms can also
   take the form of a pump-atomizer.

                Compositions suitable for buccal or sublingual administration include tablets, lozenges, and
   pastilles, where the active ingredient is formulated with a carrier, such as sugar, acacia, tragacanth,
   gelatin, and glycerine. Compositions for rectal administration are conveniently in the form of
   suppositories containing a conventional suppository base, such as cocoa butter.
 5              The compounds of the invention may be administered to an animal, e.g., a human, alone or
   in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, as noted herein, the proportion of which
   is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen route of
   administration, and standard pharmaceutical practice.
 0 Dosages
                The dosage of the compounds of the invention, and/or compositions comprising a compound
   of the invention, can vary depending on many factors, such as the pharmacodynamic properties of
   the compound; the mode of administration; the age, health, and weight of the recipient; the nature
   and extent of the symptoms; the frequency of the treatment, and the type of concurrent treatment, if
 5 any; and the clearance rate of the compound in the animal to be treated. One of skill in the art can
   determine the appropriate dosage based on the above factors. The compounds of the invention may
   be administered initially in a suitable dosage that may be adjusted as required, depending on the
   clinical response. In general, satisfactory results may be obtained when the compounds of the
   invention are administered to a human at a daily dosage of, for example, between 0.05 mg and 3000
 0 mg (measured as the solid form). Dose ranges include, for example, between 10-1000 mg (e.g., 50
   800 mg). In some embodiments, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650,
   700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, or 1000 mg of the compound is administered. Preferred dose ranges
   include, for example, between 0.05-15 mg/kg or between 0.5-15 mg/kg.
                Alternatively, the dosage amount can be calculated using the body weight of the patient. For
25 example, the dose of a compound, or pharmaceutical composition thereof, administered to a patient
   may range from 0.1-50 mg/kg (e.g., 0.25-25 mg/kg). In exemplary, non-limiting embodiments, the
   dose may range from 0.5-5.0 mg/kg (e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0 mg/kg) or
   from 5.0-20 mg/kg (e.g., 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
    19, or 20 mg/kg).

   Diagnostic and Screening Assays
                In addition to the above-mentioned therapeutic uses, a compound of the invention can also
   be used in diagnostic assays, screening assays, and as a research tool.
                In diagnostic assays, a compound of the invention may be useful in identifying or detecting
 5 BTK activity.
                In screening assays, a compound of the invention may be used to identify other compounds
   that inhibit BTK, for example, as first generation drugs. As research tools, the compounds of the
   invention may be used in enzyme assays and assays to study the extent of BTK activity. Such
   information may be useful, for example, for diagnosing or monitoring disease states or progression.
 0 In such assays, a compound of the invention may also be radiolabeled.
   BTKIn Vitro Inhibition Assays
                The compounds of the present invention have been found to exhibit BTK inhibition.
   Compounds may be examined for their efficacy in inhibiting kinase activity by a person skilled in
 5 the art, for example, by using the methods described in Example 1 and the other examples provided
   herein or by methods known in the literature (e.g., Mast Cells: Methods and Protocols (eds. G.
   Krishnaswamy and D.S. Chi), Methods in Molecular Biology, Series 315, Humana Press, pp. 175
   192, 2006).
                Inhibitory activity can be determined by any useful method. For example, inhibition can be
 0 determined by the effect of a test compound on BTK autophosphorylation. Btk and varying
   concentrations of the test compound can be included in a [y- 3 2 P]ATP-containing kinase buffer.
   Autophosphorylation can be analyzed by SDS/PAGE followed by electroblotting and
   autoradiography, where phosphorylated protein bands can be quantified by densitometry. These
   assays can be conducted without or with an exogenous substrate (e.g., glutathione S-transferase
25 (GST)-IGa).
                In another example, inhibitory activity can be determined by the effect of a test compound
   on BTK binding. For example, BTK can bind to protein kinase C (PKC) in vivo, where PKC in turn
   phosphorylates BTK. Accordingly, an exemplary assay to assess BTK-PKC binding includes
   incubating PKC or cell lysates having PKC (e.g., lysates from human mast cell lines) with
30 glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Btk beads in the absence or presence of the test compound. Then,
   the extent of Btk-bound PKC can be detected by any useful manner, such as by SDS/PAGE
   followed by immunoblotting with anti-PKC (MC5) and/or anti-BTK antibodies.
                                                          43
   5548493 1 (GHMatters) P97495.AlJ

                Further examples include use of cellular assays, such as by determining the effect of a test
   compound on cellular activation. For example, stimulated lymphoid, myeloid, or mast cells (e.g.,
   cells stimulated with a signaling molecule, such as erythropoietin or an antigen, such as IgE) can be
   incubated with a test compound, and the activation of particular compounds or proteins can be
 5 measured. Exemplary compounds and proteins include histamine, leukotriene, cytokines, PKC,
   Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (Jak2), erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), Stat5, protein kinase B (PKB),
   and/or mitogen activating protein kinase (Erkl/2). In another example, as activated Btk can be
   phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and/or tyrosine 551 (Y55 1), cellular assays can be conducted
   by staining P-Y223 or P-Y55 1-positive cells in a population of cells (e.g., by phosphorylation
 0 specific immunochemical staining followed by FACS analysis).
                As BTK is a tyrosine kinase, additional useful assays include any tyrosine kinase assay. In
   particular, commercially available assays include kinase assays that detect formation of ADP, e.g.,
   with luminescent detection, such as in an ADP-GloTM Kinase Assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI).
                Dose response curves can be obtained by incubating BTK with a substrate (e.g., ATP or a
 5 binding partner, such as PKC) and increasing (e.g., logarithmically increasing) the concentration of
   a test compound. In addition, a detectable agent (e.g., a luminescent probe, such as a
   luciferase/luciferin reaction that measures ATP) can be used to correlate kinase activity (e.g., ATP
   to-ADP conversion) with the concentration of the test compound. These data can be used to
   construct a dose response curve, where IC 50 is the concentration of the test compound that provides
 0 about 50% inhibition.
                The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the present invention.
                                                    EXAMPLES
   Example 1: BTK assay
25              The compounds were assayed for BTK inhibition activity using the Invitrogen T M
   LanthaScreen@ Kinase Binding Assay. In short, the compounds were tested for their ability to
   displace a tracer (in this case Invitrogen TM Kinase Tracer 236) from the active site of BTK. The
   BTK protein used in the assay was labeled with europium (Eu), and so displacement was
   conveniently detected as a loss of Eu-to-tracer FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) signal
30 using a plate reader equipped to measure TR-FRET (time resolved FRET). This displacement assay
   is commonly used to characterize kinase inhibitors and it is predictive of kinase inhibitory activity.

   5548493 1 (GHMatters) P97495.Al

               Several of the compounds were also tested directly for kinase inhibitory activity using the
  Invitrogen T M Omnia@ assay. The Omnia@ assay is a real time kinetic assay that uses a phosphate
  induced fluorophore to detect transfer of phosphate from ATP to a peptide. Inhibition of kinase
  activity in this assay reduces the rate of fluorescence increase. Compounds tested in both assays
5 demonstrated similar IC 5 0 values. More details and experimental protocols for both assays can be
  found at invitrogen.com.
               Determinationof IC 50 Values
               Various compounds of the invention (i.e., compounds of formula (Ta)) were assayed for BTK
0 inhibition activity, as described above, and possessed IC 50 values less than 1.0 PM. In some
  embodiments, the compounds possessed IC5 0 values less than 0.9 ptM, less than 0.75 tM, less than
  0.5 piM, less than 0.3 pM, less than 0.25 ptM, less than 0.2 pM, less than 0.15 tM, less than 0.1 tM,
  less than 0.09 tM, less than 0.08 ptM, less than 0.05 pLM, less than 0.04 gM, less than 0.03 tM, or
  less than 0.025 pLM. In some embodiments, the compounds possessed IC5 0 values from 0.02 ptM to
5 0.9 pM (e.g., from 0.02 tM to 0.75 ptM, from 0.02 pM to 0.5 pIM, from 0.02 pM to 0.3 tM, from
  0.02 tM to 0.25 ptM, from 0.02 pM to 0.2 pM, from 0.02 ptM to 0.15 ptM, from 0.02 pM to 0.1 ptM,
  from 0.02 pM to 0.09 ptM, from 0.02 VM to 0.08 ptM, from 0.02 ptM to 0.05 ptM, from 0.02 pM to
  0.04 tM, from 0.02 ptM to 0.03 pLM, or from 0.02 ptM to 0.025 ptM).
