                                    ABSTRACT
A delivery device usable to deliver an inverting implant is provided that includes a
positioning mechanism that automatically initiates the inversion process once a
predetermined length of the implant has exited a delivery catheter. The positioning
mechanism allows the implant to be safely and accurately deployed with reduced
operator experience and in a greater variety of target locations.

                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      There has been a significant movement toward developing and performing
cardiovascular surgeries using a percutaneous approach. Through the use of one or
more catheters that are introduced through, for example, the femoral artery, tools and
devices can be delivered to a desired area in the cardiovascular system to perform
many number of complicated procedures that normally otherwise require an invasive
surgical procedure.     Such approaches greatly reduce the trauma endured by the patient
and can significantly reduce recovery periods.            The percutaneous approach is
particularly attractive as an alternative to performing open-heart surgery.
[0003]      Valve replacement surgery provides one example of an area where
percutaneous solutions are being developed. A number of diseases result in a
thickening, and subsequent immobility or reduced mobility, of heart valve leaflets. Such
immobility also may lead to a narrowing, or stenosis, of the passageway through the
valve. The increased resistance to blood flow that a stenosed valve presents can
eventually lead to heart failure and ultimately death.
[0004]      Treating valve stenosis or regurgitation has heretofore involved complete
removal of the existing native valve through an open-heart procedure followed by the
implantation of a prosthetic valve. Naturally, this is a heavily invasive procedure and
inflicts great trauma on the body leading usually to great discomfort and considerable
                                             - 1-

    WO 2013/172864                                                   PCT/US2012/061393
recovery time. It is also a sophisticated procedure that requires great expertise and
talent to perform.
[0005]      Historically, such valve replacement surgery has been performed using
traditional open-heart surgery where the chest is opened, the heart stopped, the patient
placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, the native valve excised and the replacement valve
attached. A proposed percutaneous valve replacement alternative method on the other
hand, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,168,614 (the entire contents of which are hereby
incorporated by reference) issued to Andersen et al. In this patent, the prosthetic valve
is mounted on a stent that is collapsed to a size that fits within a catheter. The catheter
is then inserted into the patient's vasculature and moved so as to position the collapsed
stent at the location of the native valve. A deployment mechanism is activated that
expands the stent containing the replacement valve against the valve cusps. The
expanded structure includes a stent configured to have a valve shape with valve leaflet
supports begins to take on the function of the native valve. As a result, a full valve
replacement has been achieved but at a significantly reduced physical impact to the
patient.
[0006]      However, this approach has decided shortcomings. One particular drawback
with the percutaneous approach disclosed in the Andersen '614 patent is the difficulty in
preventing leakage around the perimeter of the new valve after implantation. Since the
tissue of the native valve remains within the lumen, there is a strong likelihood that the
commissural junctions and fusion points of the valve tissue (as pushed apart and fixed
by the stent) will make sealing around the prosthetic valve difficult. In practice, this has
often led to severe leakage of blood around the stent apparatus.
[0007]      Other drawbacks of the Andersen '614 approach pertain to its reliance on
stents as support scaffolding for the prosthetic valve. First, stents can create emboli
when they expand. Second, stents are typically not effective at trapping the emboli they
dislodge, either during or after deployment. Third, stents do not typically conform to the
features of the native lumen in which they are placed, making a prosthetic valve housed
within a stent subject to paravalvular leakage. Fourth, stents are subject to a tradeoff
                                            -2-

   WO 2013/172864                                                      PCT/US2012/061393
between strength and compressibility. Fifth, stents cannot be retrieved once deployed.
Sixth, stents have an inherent strength that is not adjustable.
[0008]     As to the first drawback, stents usually fall into one of two categories: self
expanding      stents and    balloon   expandable stents.       Self-expanding     stents are
compressed when loaded into a catheter and expand to their original, non-compressed
size when released from the catheter.         These are typically made of Nitinol.     Balloon
expandable stents are loaded into a catheter in a compressed but relaxed state. These
are typically made from stainless steel or other malleable metals. A balloon is placed
within the stent. Upon deployment, the catheter is retracted and the balloon inflated,
thereby expanding the stent to a desired size.          Both of these stent types exhibit
significant force upon expansion. The force is usually strong enough to crack or deform
thrombosis, thereby causing pieces of atherosclerotic plaque to dislodge and become
emboli.    If the stent is being implanted to treat a stenosed vessel, a certain degree of
such expansion is desirable. However, if the stent is merely being implanted to displace
native valves, less force may be desirable to reduce the chance of creating emboli. An
additional concern related to displacing an aortic valve is the risk of conduction
disturbances (i.e. left bundle branch block) due to the close proximity of the conduction
pathways to the native valve structure.        Excessive radial force applied at the native
valve site increases the risk of irritation or damage to the conduction pathway and heart
block.
[0009]     As to the second drawback, if emboli are created, expanded stents usually
have members that are too spaced apart to be effective to trap any dislodged material.
Often, secondary precautions must be taken including the use of nets and irrigation
ports.
[0010]     The third drawback is due to the relative inflexibility of stents. Stents typically
rely on the elastic nature of the native vessel to conform around the stent. Stents used
to open a restricted vessel do not require a seal between the vessel and the stent.
However, when using a stent to displace native valves and house a prosthetic valve, a
seal between the stent and the vessel is necessary to prevent paravalvular leakage.
                                             -3-

   WO 2013/172864                                                     PCT/US2012/061393
Due to the non-conforming nature of stents, this seal is hard to achieve, especially when
displacing stenosed valve leaflets.
[0011]     The fourth drawback is the tradeoff between compressibility and strength.
Stents are made stronger or larger by manufacturing them with thicker members.
Stronger stents are thus not as compressible as weaker stents. Most stents suitable for
use in a valve are not compressible enough to be placed in a thin catheter, such as a
18Fr catheter. Larger delivery catheters are more difficult to maneuver to a target area
and also result in more trauma to the patient.
[0012]     The fifth drawback of stents is that they are not easily retrievable.        Once
deployed, a stent may not be recompressed and drawn back into the catheter for
repositioning due to the non-elastic deformation (stainless steel) or the radial force
required to maintain the stent in place (Nitinol). Thus, if a physician is unsatisfied with
the deployed location or orientation of a stent, there is little he or she can do to correct
the problem.
[0013]     The sixth drawback listed above is that stents have an inherent strength and
are thus not adjustable. As previously stated, stronger stents are made with stronger
members. Once a stent is selected and deployed, there is little a physician can do if the
stent proves to be too strong or too weak.
[0014]     Various embodiments of devices that solve these problems are introduced in
U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0271166 to Thill et al., entitled "Stentless Support
Structure," the contents of which is incorporated herein in their entirety. This publication
teaches a braided mesh tube that is capable of folding back and forth into itself to build,
in situ, a support structure that is strong enough to hold back the leaflets of a native
valve sufficiently to successfully deploy a replacement valve, thus obviating the need for
excision of the native valve. Advantageously, because of the inverting nature of these
devices, the braided mesh, in an elongated delivery configuration, does not need to
possess the strength to accomplish native valve displacement until the inversion
process occurs. This allows the mesh tube to be constructed such that, in the elongated
delivery state, the tube can be compressed into a very small catheter, such as a 18Fr or
                                            -4-

    WO 2013/172864                                                  PCT/US2012/061393
smaller catheter. Such a small catheter significantly reduces patient trauma and allows
for easy percutaneous, intraluminal navigation through the blood vessels.        It is to be
understood that terms like transluminal and percutaneous, as used herein, are expressly
defined as navigation to a target location through and axially along the lumen of a blood
vessel or blood vessels as opposed to surgically cutting the target vessel or heart open
and installing the device manually. It is further to be understood that the term "mesh" as
used herein describes a material constructed of one or more braided or woven strands.
[0015]      In order to accomplish the folding back and forth feature of this device, there
are preformed, circumferential folds in the device.           One embodiment has two
circumferential folds that are longitudinally spaced apart in the extended configuration.
One of these folds is preformed to fold inwardly, and the other is preformed to fold
outwardly. These preformed folds, when released out of a catheter, tend to return to a
folded configuration that has a z-like cross-section. This cross-section design results
not only because the inward pre-formed fold folds inwardly and the outward pre-formed
fold folds outwardly, but because these folds reverse longitudinal positions once folded.
If the inward preformed fold is distal of the outward preformed fold in the extended
position, in the folded position the inward preformed fold will be proximal of the outward
preformed fold. This design allows a valve on a distal end of the device to be drawn into
the device when folded, without requiring the valve itself to be inverted or everted.      In
one embodiment having two preformed folds, the inversion process thus results in a
three-layered configuration that could be significantly shorter than the extended length,
depending on the spacing of the folds.
[0016]      In the development of the devices described in the aforementioned publication,
U.S. Pat. Pub. 2006/0271166, it was found that, occasionally, it was advantageous to use
an additional device to hold the outermost layer of the implant axially in place while
inversion of a layer was being effected. This gave rise to the delivery tool shown and
described in U.S. Patent Publication 2008/0082165 to Wilson et al., entitled "Delivery Tool
For Percutaneous Delivery Of A Prosthesis." This delivery tool includes an expandable
mesh region that, when axially compressed, flares outwardly to form a bulbous or rounded
structure of increased radius. Further axial compression creates a flat, disc-like surface.
                                            -5-

    WO 2013/172864                                                    PCT/US2012/061393
In use, the device is extended through an implant prior to releasing the implant from the
delivery catheter. The device is then expanded to the disc-like configuration and pulled
proximally to act as a backstop at a desired target location, against which the implant is
delivered. Thus, the disc-like device prevents axial migration of the implant in a distal
direction if and when distal force is placed on the implant during inversion of the second or
subsequent layers into the first layer.
[0017]      It has been found, however, that in some cases, depending on target location
and patient anatomy, there is insufficient space in a distal axial direction beyond the
target location to efficiently use this delivery device. For example, some patients may
have limited left ventricular space, which may prohibit the use of the backstop device.
[0018]      There is thus a need for a device that is able to prevent axial migration of the
aforementioned      braided implant devices during inversion, but does not require
significant space distally beyond the target location.
                          BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0019]      The present invention meets the identified need by providing a delivery device
that holds a braided implant in a desired location during inversion of a subsequent layer
into a first layer. More specifically, the present invention provides a delivery device that
releasably attaches at or near a first fold location, hereinafter referred to as the "aortic
flare," which is a hinge point around which the inversion of the implant used with the
present invention occurs.
[0020]      Through attachment to the aortic flare, the delivery device of the present
invention enables precise positioning and inversion by limiting advancement of a portion
of the implant while continuing to advance the remainder of the device.               Hence,
inversion is effected at a location selected by the user, independent of patient anatomy
or geometric interference.      One embodiment of the invention achieves this precise
positioning through attachment to a distal end of the device.

   WO 2013/172864                                                      PCT/US2012/061393
[0021]      Two aspects of the present invention provide reliable performance of the
delivery device of the present invention. A first aspect is an attachment mechanism that
can be mounted to a braided device without requiring significant modification to the
function of the braided device.           This attachment     mechanism     provides device
stabilization during     the   support structure   inversion process.       This   attachment
mechanism provides both attachment to the device and a release capability in some
embodiments.         A second aspect of the present invention includes positioning
mechanisms that prevent movement of the device in the target location during the
inversion process.
[0022]      Another aspect of the present invention provides freedom of motion to the
support structure anchors as the device is being deployed, but automatically actuates
anchor locking mechanisms when the device has been advanced to the appropriate
position for the inversion process.       This automatic actuation reduces the need for
physician involvement or judgment in the tensioning and setting of the anchor
mechanisms. The nature of the mechanism also accounts for manufacturing and use
tolerances, precisely tuning the anchor locking mechanism to the selected valve and
delivery system.
[0023]      Yet another aspect of the invention provides a deployment device that allows
the positioning, implantation and deployment of a prosthetic valve such that the valve
achieves complete function prior to releasing the valve. The valve may be observed
and verified that it is functioning normally prior to release. If the valve is not functioning
as intended, the entire device may be quickly pulled back into the delivery device. In
some circumstances, the valve is able to be relocated and redeployed.
[0024]      Still another aspect of the invention provides a delivery device that includes a
limiter that may be set prior to or during the procedure. The limiter ensures that the
braided implant does not exit the delivery device more than a desired amount, prior to
inverting.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0052]     Referring now to the Figures and first to Figure 1, there is shown a distal end
of a delivery device 10 of the present invention. The delivery device generally includes
a delivery catheter 20, and a pusher catheter 30 slidably contained within the delivery
catheter 20.   The pusher catheter 30 is preferably a multi-lumen catheter containing
lumens for slidably containing and maintaining alignment of three attachment cables 40
(hereinafter "valve retention cables") (see Fig. 3), each of which has a releasable
grasping mechanism 50 at a distal end thereof. The delivery device 10 also includes at
least one positioning mechanism 60 used to aid the tool or implant 1 in achieving a
folded, deployed configuration from an extended, unfolded, navigation configuration. In
one embodiment, the at least one positioning mechanism 60 is attached to a distal end
of the delivery catheter 20.       In another embodiment, the at least one positioning
mechanism 60 is slidably contained within the delivery catheter 20, similar to the valve
retention cables 40.
[0053]     The delivery catheter 20 is an external sheath defining a single lumen for
housing the pusher catheter 30, the tool or implant 1, the valve retention cables 40, and
the positioning mechanisms 60. The delivery catheter 20, when loaded, houses a tool or
implant 1 near its distal end 22. The implant 1 is preferably an implant similar to those
taught and described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0271166.             The delivery
catheter 20 may be formed with a preset curve at its distal end. Positive results have
been achieved with a 180 degree preset curve.

    WO 2013/172864                                                   PCT/US2012/061393
[0054]     The pusher catheter 30 may include up to seven lumens.            Three lumens
slidably house the three valve retention cables 40.      In an embodiment used over-the
wire, a fourth lumen accommodates a guidewire.          In yet another embodiment, three
additional lumens slidably house three positioning mechanisms, described below.
[0055]     Figures 2a and 2b show two similar embodiments of the pusher catheter 30 of
the present invention defining seven lumens. The pusher catheter 30 includes a central
guidewire lumen 32, and three lumens 34 that contain either the valve retention cables
40 or the positioning mechanisms described below. The remaining three lumens 36
house the remaining valve retention cables or positioning mechanisms. In order to save
on space, the lumens 36 may be formed as external indentations, thereby relying on the
inner wall of the delivery catheter 20 to complete the lumen and contain the remaining
valve retention cables or positioning mechanisms.         In a preferred embodiment, the
lumens 34 contain the valve retention cables 40 and the lumens 36 contain the
positioning mechanisms 60. In this embodiment, the pusher catheter 30 may continue
to be advanced even if the positioning mechanisms 60 can no longer be advanced.
[0056]     In one embodiment, the positioning mechanisms are small enough to fit three
valve retention mechanisms, and an associated containment sheath, in a single lumen
36, leaving two other lumens 36 unused or available for use as irrigation channels.
[0057]     The releasable grasping mechanisms 50 may be similar to those shown and
described in U.S. Pat. Pub. 2008/0082165 (at Figs. 5-8).          Another embodiment of
releasable grasping mechanisms is shown in Figures 3 and 4.                  The grasping
mechanisms 50 are attached to commissural points on an implant 1 when the device 10
is loaded. The grasping mechanism 50 provide the ability to retract the implant back
into the device 10 in the event that the physician feels doing so is appropriate.
[0058]     Figure 3 shows a grasping mechanism 50 in an open configuration.            The
grasping mechanism 50 includes a hook 52 that slides within a mouth 54. The hook 52
defines a recess 56 sized to accommodate a component, such as a commissural point
or a braid, of the tool or implant 1. The mouth 54 defines a slot 58 that is also sized to
accommodate the component. Figure 4 shows that when the grasping mechanism 50 is
                                           - 11 -

in a closed configuration, the recess 56 and the slot 58 together define a passage 59
that traps the component therein.
[0059]      The grasping mechanism 50 is attached to a distal end of an valve retention
cable 40. The valve retention cable 40 includes a wire 42 attached to the hook 52 and
an elastomeric sheath 44 that is attached to the mouth 54. The wire 42 and the hook 52
are slidably contained within the sheath 44 and the mouth 54.              The sheath 44 is
elastomeric such that it is capable of being compressed longitudinally. This feature
prevents accidental release of a tool or component contained within the passage 59.
For example, when pulling a tool or implant back into the delivery sheath 20 during a
retrieval, a load is placed on the wire 42, causing the wire to stretch. If the sheath 44
were not compressed, the wire 42 could stretch enough to cause the hook 52 to exit the
mouth 54, thereby assuming the open configuration of Figure 3. However, because the
sheath 44 is compressed when the hook 52 is drawn into the mouth 54 during closing,
the sheath 44 elongates when the wire 42 is stretched, thereby maintaining the closed
configuration of Figure 4.
[0060]      The positioning mechanisms 60 aid in inverting the tool or component 1. In
one embodiment, shown in Figures 1, 5 and 6, the positioning mechanisms 60 connect
the the delivery catheter 20 with a first inversion pre-fold point (also referred to herein as
an "aortic flare") on the implant 1.
[0061]      The positioning mechanisms 60 may comprise a plurality of tethers 62 and
connectors 64. The tethers 62 may be any resilient strand-like material, flexible enough
to invert from a navigation configuration to a deployment configuration. In the navigation
configuration, as shown in Figure 1, the tethers extend proximally from the distal end of
the delivery catheter 20, to the connectors 64. In the deployment configuration, shown
in Figures 5 and 6, the tethers 62 extend distally from the distal end of the delivery
catheter 20 to the connectors 64.       In one embodiment, the connectors 64 are able to
grasp any individual braid or strand of an implant 1.          In another embodiment, the
connectors 64 are designed to grasp the intersection of two braids or strands. In yet
another embodiment, the connectors 64 are able to grasp discrete attachment points
(e.g. wire loops, sutures, etc.), that have been integrated into the mesh implant or tool 1.
                                             -12-

    WO 2013/172864                                                 PCT/US2012/061393
The length of the tethers 62 are at least the length of the material of the implant 1 that
extends distally of the connectors 64 when the implant 1 is loaded into the delivery
catheter 20. This way, the implant 1 remains completely within the delivery catheter 20
in the navigation configuration.
[0062]     In another embodiment, the positioning mechanisms 60 are similar in
construction to the valve retention cables 40 and releasable grasping mechanism 50.
However, because the strength requirements of the positioning mechanisms 60 are less
than those of the valve retention cables 40 and their releasable grasping mechanisms
50, the positioning mechanisms 60 may be smaller in diameter, thereby allowing a
smaller overall delivery device 10. Rather than being attached to the distal end of the
delivery catheter 20, as described above, the positioning mechanisms 60 of this
embodiment are slidably contained within the lumens 36 of the pusher catheter 30
shown in Figure 2.
[0063]     Referring to Figures 5 and 6, the device 10 is designed to be able to pass
over a guidewire 70 during navigation. A conical or otherwise tapered dilator tip 80
abuts against the distal end 22 of the delivery catheter 20 and is flush therewith. The
dilator 80 allows the device 10 to be passed through the vasculature with minimal
trauma. The dilator 80 is not physically attached to the delivery catheter 20, such that it
is easily moved distally during delivery of the implant 1 to avoid interference with the
deployment of the implant 1.
[0064]     Having described the various components of the present invention, the
various steps and configurations that occur during navigation and deployment of an
implant can now be explained.      Figure 1 shows the navigation configuration of the
device 10. In the navigation configuration, the implant 1 is loaded into the distal end of
the delivery catheter 20 such that the implant 1 is in an elongated, non-folded state.
The pusher catheter 30 is positioned within the delivery catheter 20 with its distal end 22
proximal of the implant 1. The valve retention cables 40 extend distally from the pusher
catheter 30 and are connected to commissural points of the implant 1 with the
releasable grasping mechanisms 50. The conical dilator 80 abuts against the distal end
                                         -13-

   WO 2013/172864                                                    PCT/US2012/061393
22 of the delivery catheter 20. During navigation, the entire device 10 and implant 1
travel over a guidewire 70 to the target location.
[0065]      Figure 5 shows the initial stages of deployment of the implant 1. The target
location has been reached and the delivery catheter 20 is retracted while the pusher
catheter 30 and valve retention cables (40)remain stationary relative to the target
location. Retracting the delivery catheter 20 causes the pusher catheter 30 to push the
implant 1 out of the distal end 22 of the delivery catheter. As the implant 1 exits the
delivery catheter 20 the implant 1 expands and the positioning mechanisms 60 are
advanced through the delivery catheter 20 until the tethers 62 become taut, or in the
case of the positioning mechanisms that are slidably contained within the lumens of the
pusher catheter 30, the positioning mechanisms 60 can no longer be advanced.
[0066]     As seen in Figure 6, further advancement of the pusher catheter 30 causes
implant material that is proximal of the connectors 64 to invert into the implant material
that is distal of the connector 64. This is because the positioning mechanisms 60 are
taut and do not allow further distal advancement of the implant 1. As such, the inversion
of the implant 1 is urged by the preformed fold in the implant, the expansion of the
memory metal making up the implant 1, and the restraint provided by the positioning
mechanisms 60.        Notably, the transition of the implant from initial advancement to
inversion happens automatically and is dictated by the length of the tethers 64.        As
such, operator experience is not required to initiate inversion. Nor is there any reliance
on anatomical structure to provide friction against the implant to initiate inversion.
[0067]     Once the implant 1 has been fully deployed, the implant 1 is fully functional
prior to release. This allows verification of proper operation of the implant 1 via one or
more imaging modalities prior to full release of the implant 1. If proper operation is not
achieved, the grasping mechanisms 50 can be used to pull the implant 1 back into the
delivery catheter 20 such that the implant may be either removed or redeployed.          If
proper operation is verified, the connectors 64 are actuated to release the braids or
strands of the implant 1. The pusher catheter 30 and the delivery catheter 20 are
withdrawn slightly while maintaining connection with the implant 1 and the device 10 via
the releasable grasping mechanism.        Subsequently, the grasping mechanisms 50 are
                                            -14-

    WO 2013/172864                                                  PCT/US2012/061393
actuated to release the commissural points of the implant 1. The pusher catheter 30 is
retracted into the delivery catheter 20 and the delivery catheter 20 and the guidewire 70
are withdrawn from the patient.
[0068]      Figures 7-21illustrate another embodiment of a delivery device 100 that is
generally similar to the previously described delivery device 10, especially where noted
with similar element numbers. However, the delivery device 100 includes a positioning
tether assembly 110, the distal end of which is seen best in Figures 7-10, having a
sliding release mechanism for releasing a connection to the implant 1.
[0069]      More specifically, the positioning tether assembly 110 includes a plurality of
tethers 104 that are each arranged in a generally closed loop. These looped tethers
104 pass through portions of the implant 1 and therefore can maintain the implant 1 in a
desired position during a procedure (e.g., can prevent distal movement of the implant 1).
The tethers can be disconnected from the implant 1 by releasing one end of each of the
tethers 104, effectively opening the loop shape.        In this respect, withdrawal of the
positioning tether assembly 110 also pulls the tethers 104 out of and away from the
implant 1.
[0070]      The release mechanism of the positioning tether assembly 110 is triggered by
advancing a sliding member 114 to the position seen in Figures 8 and 10 from the
retracted position seen in Figures 7 and 9. Note that the tethers 104 are connected to a
distal end 114B of the sliding member 114 (e.g., either fixed in place or pass through the
member 114 back to the proximal end of the positioning tether assembly 110), but for
illustrative purposes are not shown as such in Figures 9 and 10. Initially, the free ends
104B of the tethers 104 are located within a depression 114A of the sliding member 114
and are captured by a first slot 112A of an outer tether sheath 112. When the sliding
member 114 is advanced, the depression 114A is positioned beneath a wider, second
slot 112B, which allows the free ends 104B of the tethers 104 to be released.
[0071]      As best seen in Figure 9, the free ends 104B of the tethers 104 have a
generally larger size or diameter than the remaining portion of the tether 104 and can
have a variety of different shapes, such as rounded, spherical or even square. The first
                                            -15-

   WO 2013/172864                                                       PCT/US2012/061393
slot 112A has a width that is large enough to accommodate the diameter of the tether
104 but is smaller than the diameter of the free ends 104B, thereby allowing the tether
104 to laterally slide within the slot 112A without the free ends 104B from traversing
through.
[0072]      The second slot 11 2B is positioned distal to the first slot 11 2A and has a width
that is larger than the free ends 104B. In this respect, once the depression 114A aligns
under this second slot 112B, as seen in Figure 10, the free ends 104B are released,
thereby allowing the tethers 104 to assume a generally linear configuration, similar to
that in Figure 8.
[0073]      While two slots are shown, a single slot may alternately be used in another
embodiment.       Specifically, the single slot may be similar in size to slot 112A, but
extends to the distal end of the tether sheath 112. In this respect, the free ends 104B
are released when the depression 11 4A is advanced outside of the tether sheath 112.
[0074]      The positioning tether assembly 110 may be constructed with an overall
outside diameter that is small enough to be slidingly contained in one of the lumens 34
or 36 of the pusher catheter 30 shown in Figure 2a or 2b.
[0075]      Figures 11-22 show the proximal end or handle assembly 200 of the delivery
device 100. The handle assembly generally includes valve retention cable control group
210, a pusher catheter control 250, a drive mechanism 260, irrigation ports 280, and a
tether control assembly 300.
[0076]      The valve retention cable control group 210 includes a plurality of valve
retention cable controls 212, housed in a recess 214 of the handle 200, and a locking
pin 216. The individual valve retention cable controls 212 are best seen in Figures 12
14.
[0077]      Figure 12 shows an exploded view of an individual valve retention cable
control 212. The control 212 includes a housing 218, to which is attached a proximal
end of the elastomeric sheath 44 of the retention cable 40 (see Fig. 3).               Slidingly
contained within the housing 218 is a thumb slide 220, which is connected to the wire 42
                                            -16-

   WO 2013/172864                                                   PCT/US2012/061393
of the retention cable 40. Behind the thumb slide 220 is a spring-loaded catch 222. In
operation, pulling the thumb slide rearward toward the catch 222 pulls the wire 42
relative to the sheath 44, thereby retracting the hook 52 into the mouth 54 at the distal
end of the cable 40.      The catch 222 maintains the retention cable 40 in a closed
position. The hook 52 can be quickly released from the mouth 54 by depressing the
catch 222.
[0078]      Figure 14 shows the thumb slide 220 in the forward, open position.         The
corresponding open position of the distal end of the cable 40 is also shown. Figure 15
shows the thumb slide 220 in the rearward, closed position. The corresponding closed
position of the distal end of the cable 40 is also shown. Furthermore, a locking pin 216
has been inserted through the housing 218 and the thumb slide 220 to prevent
accidental release of the implant 1 held in the mouth 54 of the retention cable 40.
[0079]      Referring back to Figure 11, it is shown that there are three controls 212
arranged in the handle 200. It can also be seen that a single locking pin 216 passes
through the handle 200 and all three controls 212.            This locking pin 216 is a
precautionary feature that ensures none of the controls 212 are inadvertently opened.
Once the valve position and operation have been verified, the physician is then able to
unlock all three controls 212 by removing the single pin 216.
[0080]      Figure 15 is a partial view of the handle 200 of the device 100.     Figure 15
shows the pusher catheter control 250, which is shown as a sliding ring 250 that slides
over the handle 200. The ring 250 is connected through a slot 252 in the side of the
handle 200 to the pusher catheter 30. When the ring 250 is advanced to its most distal
position, it may be rotated to lock the pusher catheter relative to the valve retention
cables 40.
[0081]     The drive mechanism 260 is shown in Figure 16. The drive mechanism 260
includes a lead-screw 262 and a threaded nut combination 264.           The threaded nut
combination 264 includes a nut 266 contained within a knob 268 and a quick release
270. Rotation of the knob 268 causes the nut 266 to act against the lead-screw 262.
The knob 268 is axially fixed relative to the handle 200. The lead-screw 262 is slidingly
                                           -17-

    WO 2013/172864                                                   PCT/US2012/061393
contained within the handle 200. As such, when the nut 266 acts against the lead-screw
262, the lead-screw 262 advances or retracts in the handle 200. The lead-screw 262 is
connected at its distal end to the delivery catheter 20.       The rotatable threaded nut
combination 264 thus allows precise control over the relative motion between the pusher
catheter 30 and the delivery catheter 20. The quick release 270 may be in the form of a
button or lever that disengages the nut 266 from the threads of the lead-screw 262 to
allow the pusher catheter 30 and valve retention cables 40 to be quickly retracted into
the delivery catheter 20.
[0082]     It has been found that retracting an implant back jnto the delivery catheter 20
is more successful when done quickly. A slow retraction increases the risk that the
catheter may buckle. As such, the handle 200 has been designed to effect a quick
retraction of an implant back into the device 100 when necessary. This is accomplished
by ensuring the ring 250 is rotated into the locked position so that when the handle is
retracted relative to the delivery catheter , the pusher catheter 30 and the valve retention
cables 40 are fixed relative to each other and thus retracted simultaneously.
Depressing the quick release 270 while pulling on the knob 268 while holding the
delivery catheter 20 stable causes the implant to be quickly drawn back into the delivery
catheter 20.
[0083]     The various components of the tether control assembly 300 are shown in
Figures 17-21.     The tether control assembly 300 generally includes a tether release
controller 310 and a tether positioning mechanism 340.
[0084]     The tether release controller 310 is shown in Figures 17 and 18 and includes
a housing 312 and a control knob 314. The housing 312 is fixed to the proximal end of
the outer tether sheath 112 (See Figures 9 and 10) of the positioning tether assembly
110. The control knob 314 is able to slide axially, relative to the housing 312, and is
attached to the proximal end of sliding member 114 (Figures 9 and 10). Thus, when the
control knob 314 is in the forward position shown in Figure 18, the tethers are released.
When the control knob 314 is in the rearward position shown in Figure 17, the tethers
ends are trapped in the first slot 112A of the outer tether sheath 112.                In the
embodiment shown in the Figures, the control knob 314 can be turned in the closed
                                            -18-

    WO 2013/172864                                                   PCT/US2012/061393
position, thereby locking it closed. Also includes is a clip 320 which may be used to
prevent the control knob 314 from advancing to the open position in the event it is
accidentally actuated. The clip 320 is easily removed when it is desired to release the
tethers.
[0085]     Figures 19-21 show the tether positioning mechanism 340.              The tether
positioning mechanism is a slide-lock that includes a housing 342, a lever 344, and a
clamp block 346. The housing 342 passes over the outer tether sheath 112 and keeps
the tether sheath positioned between the lever 344 and the clamp block 346. When the
lever 344 is lowered to the closed position, shown in Figure 20, the outer tether sheath
112, and the tethers contained therein, are clamped between the lever 344 and the
block 346, and cannot slide. Thus the tether positioning mechanism 340 is fixed relative
to the outer tether sheath 112. When the lever 344 is in the open position, the tether
positioning mechanism 340 is able to slide over the outer tether sheath 112.
[0086]     Figures 22-29 illustrate how the delivery device 100 can be used to deliver an
implant 1 according to the present invention.       First, an implant 1 is loaded into the
delivery device 100. After the selected valve is rinsed, each of the three valve retention
cables 40 are individually attached to each of three wire form eyelets on the implant.
This is accomplished by opening the valve retention cable control 212, pushing the
thumb slide 220 forward to expose the hook 52 from the mouth 54.           The hook 52 is
placed through the wire form eyelet and the thumb slide 220 is retracted rearwardly until
it engaged the catch 222. Doing so locks the slide 220 and closes the hook 52 into the
mouth 54. It also compresses the outer elastomeric sheath 44 of the valve retention
cable 40 to maintain interference between the hook 52 and the mouth 54, even if a
pulling force is placed on the cable sufficient to stretch the cable, thereby preventing
accidental release during a retrieval procedure.
[0087]     After all three valve retention cables 40 are attached, the position tethers 104
are attached to the implant 1. (Alternatively, the position tethers 104 may be attached
prior to the valve retention cables 40). This is accomplished by threading each of the
three tethers 104 through the center of the implant and through a ventricular loop of the
implant's support structure at 120 degree intervals from the inside to the outside of the
                                            -19-

    WO 2013/172864                                                    PCT/US2012/061393
implant.    Once all three tethers 104 have been threaded, they are passed back up
through the valve and the three tethers 104 are locked within the slot 112A of the outer
tether sheath 112. Locking is accomplished by pulling the control knob 314 and rotating
it to the locked position shown in Figure 17.
[0088]       Next the pusher catheter 30 is pushed forward to capture the valve retention
cables 40. At the distal-most position of the pusher catheter control ring 250, the ring
250 is rotated to lock the position of the pusher catheter 30 relative to the valve retention
cables 40.
[0089]      The implant 1 is now ready for loading into the delivery catheter 20.        The
delivery catheter 20 is advanced by rotating the drive knob 268 toward the user, and the
implant 1 is slowly drawn into the distal end of the delivery catheter 20. While the
implant 1 is being loaded, the position of the implant is noted so an observation can be
made as to when the implant has achieved the orientation in which the implant would be
exposed enough from the delivery catheter 20 to be able to invert into itself. At this
point the tether positioning mechanism 340, which is in the unlocked position, is slid
down the sheath 112 until it contacts the delivery catheter manifold 282 (Figure 11) and
the lever 344 is moved to the locked position.
[0090]      Continued loading of the implant into the delivery catheter 20 causes the
tethers 104 and the tether sheath 112 to retract and the tether positioning mechanism
340 to move proximally relative to the delivery catheter manifold 282. The implant is
fully loaded whent the dilator tip 80 has been partially retracted into the delivery catheter
20 and there is a smooth transition between the dilator tip and the delivery catheter tip.
[0091]      As seen in Figure 22, a guidewire 70 is placed across the native aortic valve
of the patient and extends out through the vascular introducer at the femoral artery
access site. The proximal end of the guidewire is inserted into the dilator tip 80 of the
loaded delivery system and the system is advanced over the guidewire until the
guidewire is visible through the proximal end of the delivery system. The proximal end
of the guidewire is then held stationary in order to maintain the position of the wire in the
left ventricle of the patient and the delivery system is advanced into the vasculature
                                            -20 -

    WO 2013/172864                                                   PCT/US2012/061393
through the introducer and across the native aortic valve 4 (seen best in Figure 23).
The guidewire passes through lumen 32 of the pusher catheter 30.
[0092]      Turning to Figure 24, the delivery sheath 20 is proximally retracted to expose
a portion of the implant 1 and the tethers 104. This is accomplished by rotating the drive
knob 268.      As the implant 1 becomes exposed, it self-expands outward against the
native valve 4. During deployment, the operator maintains the implant position within
the native valve of the patient. If, however, the implant is pulled too high or pushed too
low relative to the native valve, the implant can be recaptured by reversing the direction
of the drive knob 268 rotation, which draws the implant back into the sheath 20 for
repositioning.
[0093]      As shown in Figure 25, next, the implant 1 is folded or inverted on itself by
restraining the implant with the tethers 104 and pushing a proximal portion of the implant
in a distal direction with the pusher catheter 110. More specifically , when the first layer
of the implant has been deployed, the tether positioning mechanism 340 will have
reached the delivery catheter manifold. This freezes the position of the ventricular loops
(the distal end) of the implant such that further advancement of the implant will result in
a shortening and flaring of the implant in preparation for valve invention.
[0094]      This flaring aspect of the valve deployment has been described as the
anchoring phase, as the implant has expanded to contact the native valve tissue and the
aortic flare of the device provides substantial resistance to migration.          Once the
anchoring phase has begun, the delivery catheter 20 is advanced through the access
site and the patient vasculature. Doing so aligns the distal tip of the delivery catheter
coaxial to the native valve with the curve of the delivery catheter 20 filling the outer
curvature of the native aortic arch.
[0095]      After the catheter 20 has been advanced, continued deployment of the valve
using the drive knob is used to produce implant invention.         The act of inverting the
implant also deploys the tissue valve component of the implant. Once the implant has
been inverted the valve begins to function, but that function is somewhat constrained
due to the proximity of the tethers and the valve control cables.

[0096]      After inversion has been accomplished, the user releases the tethers. First
the tether positioning mechanism 340 is released by releasing the lever 344, separating
it from the clamp block 346. The tether positioning mechanism 340 is free to float along
the outer tether sheath 112. The drive knob 268 is rotated to further back the delivery
catheter 20 away from the implant. Once the delivery catheter 20 is fully retracted, the
tethers 104 can be removed by rotating and releasing the tension in the control knob
314 of the tether release controller 310. Gently pulling on the tether release controller
310 will separate the tethers 104 from the implant.
[0097]      Once the tethers 104 have been removed, only the valve retention cables 40
remain connected to the implant 1, as seen in Figure 28.         As previously discussed,
these cables 40 are attached to a proximal feature on the implant (e.g., the commissural
points) and allow the physician to completely retract the implant 1 back into the delivery
device 100 if a problem arises during the delivery procedure. Specifically, in order to
observe full valve function without releasing the implant, the physician beings by rotating
the ring 250 away from the operator and sliding the ring 250 in a proximal direction,
retracting the pusher catheter 30. With the pusher catheter 30 retracted, the prosthetic
valve now begins to function fully. The remaining attachment of the delivery system to
the implant via the valve retention cables 40 has little effect on the functionality of the
implant.
[0098]      Once satisfied, the physician next releases the implant by pulling the locking
pin 216 at the proximal end of the handle assembly 200.          With the locking pin 216
removed, each of the three valve retention cable controllers 212 can be sequentially
released. This is accomplished by depressing the catch 222 and sliding the thumb slide
220 forward, releasing the implant 1. Each cable can be individually retracted into the
delivery catheter after it has been disengaged. When all three cables are released, the
valve is fully implanted and the delivery system may be removed from the vascular
introducer of the patient.
[0099]      Finally, the delivery device 100 and guidewire 70 is removed from the patient,
leaving only the functioning valve implant 1, as seen in Figure 29.
