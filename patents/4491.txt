    UREIDO-FUNCTIONALIZED AQUEOUS POLYMERIC DISPERSION
    The present invention is a divisional application from Australian patent application number
    2014204440, which claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No.
    61/860,012, filed 30 July 2013, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.
  5 Background of the Invention
    The present invention relates to a stable aqueous dispersion of polymer particles
    functionalized with ureido groups.
    A common problem associated with aqueous based binders for coatings formulations such as
    acrylic latexes is adhesion to substrates coated with solvent based alkyd paints. The
 .0 incompatibility of the two disparate types of coatings results in undesirable peeling of the
    fresh coat.
    It would therefore be an advance in the art to discover a coatings formulation that overcomes
    the problem of poor adhesion of coating formulations that are incompatible with alkyd
    coatings.

    second domains of the polymer particles correlate with improved alkyd adhesion, as the
    following examples demonstrate.

    A first monomer emulsion was prepared by mixing deionized water (DI water, 495 g),
    Disponil FES-993 surfactant (FES 993, 82.5 g, 30% active), butyl acrylate (BA, 456 g), ethyl
    acrylate (EA, 570 g), methyl methacrylate (MMA, 764.65 g), phosphoethyl methacrylate
    (PEM, 47.5 g, 60% active), acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate (AAEM, 38.0 g), methacrylic
  5 acid (MAA, 4.75 g), and n-dodecylmercaptan (2.38 g). A second monomer emulsion was
    prepared by mixing DI water (25 g), FES-993 (2.6 g, 30% active), BA (20 g), and MMA
    (80 g).
    To a 5-L, four necked round bottom flask equipped with a paddle stirrer, a thermometer, N 2
    inlet, and a reflux condenser was added DI water (700 g) and FES-993 (13.4 g, 30% active).
 .0 The contents of the flask were heated to 86 'C under N 2 with stirring and a solution of
    Actrene inhibitor (0.30 g, 5% aqueous solution of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine
    N-oxide) in DI water (10.0 g) was added to the flask, followed by addition of 8.4% aqueous
    sodium carbonate (25 g). A portion of the first monomer emulsion (81 g) was then added to
    the flask followed by addition of 14.8% aqueous ammonium persulfate (NaPS) dissolved
 .5 (27 g). After the reaction temperature leveled off, a solution of a mixture of 0.15% aqueous
    ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (19.8 g) and 1% aqueous ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
    tetrasodium salt (EDTA, 2.9 g) was added to the flask. Two co-feed solutions were then fed
    to the flask over a period of 85 min. The first co-feed was a solution of 85% t-amyl
    hydroperoxide (4.5 g), FES-993 (1.2 g) and DI water (101.0 g); and the second co-feed was a
  0 solution of isoascorbic acid (3.08 g) and DI water (105.0 g) (1.17g/min).
    The remaining first monomer emulsion was divided into two portions and fed into the flask
    according to the following schedule: Two minutes after the start of co-feed addition, a first
    portion of the remaining first monomer emulsion (930 g) was fed to the flask over 35 min at
    86 'C; for the first 10 min of the feed, the feed rate was kept at 15.5 g/min. For the remaining
25  25 min, the feed rate was increased to 31.0 g/min. The second portion of first monomer
    emulsion (1449.8 g) was mixed with a 45% aqueous solution of KOH (23.5 g) diluted with
    DI water (50 g). This KOH-neutralized second portion of the first monomer emulsion was
    then further divided into a 580-g portion and a 943.3-g portion. To the 580.0-g portion was
    added a solution of ureido methacrylate (UMA, 38.0 g, 50% solution in water) in DI water
30  (25.0 g); the mixture was fed into the flask over 20 min (32.2 g/min). The remaining 943.3-g
    portion was then fed into the flask over 30 min (31.4 g/min). After the addition of the first
    monomer emulsion was complete, the emulsion container was rinsed with DI water (30.0 g)

    and the rinse water was added to the flask. When the co-feed additions were complete, the
    reaction mixture was held at 86 'C for 15 min, then allowed to cool to 60 'C.
    The second monomer emulsion was then added to the flask, and the jar containing the
    emulsion was rinsed with DI water (10.0 g), which was then added to the flask. A solution of
  5 t-butyl hydroperoxide (0.5 g, 70% aqueous) in DI water (8 g) was added to the flask followed
    by addition of a solution of isoascorbic acid (0.4 g) in DI water (12 g). After the exothermic
    reaction reached peak temperature, a solution of t-butyl hydroperoxide (0.5 g 70%) in DI
    water (25 g) and a solution of isoascorbic acid (0.5 g) in DI water (25 g) were fed into the
    flask over 30 min. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool. A solution of 29%
 .0 ammonia (31.0 g) in DI water (25 g) was then added to the flask. The temperature was raised
    to 45 'C, at which time the following reagents were added to the flask: DOWEXTM 1x2
    CL-16-100 Ion Exchange Resin (120 g, A Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company or Its
    Affiliates), tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP, 4.5 g), EDTA (3 g), Tamol 983 Dispersant
    (41.0 g), Rhodafac RS-960 Surfactant (34.6 g), 29% aqueous ammonia (6.2 g),
 .5 TERGITOL TM 15-S-20 Surfactant (18.75 g, A Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company
    or Its Affiliates), and DI water (150.5 g). A solution of ACRYSOL TM RM-8W Rheology
    Modifier (5.0 g, A Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company or Its Affiliates) in DI water
    (10.0 g) was then added. When the temperature reached 40 'C, the following additives were
    added in the order listed: a solution of Capstone FS-63 Fluorosurfactant (8.57 g) in DI water
 .0 (10 g), a solution of 3% KIO3 in DI water (14.4 g), a 1%aqueous solution of Cu(N0 3)2
    (3.2 g) in DI water (5 g), a solution of ROCIMA TM BT-2S Biocide (10.3 g, 19.2% active, A
    Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company or Its Affiliates) in DI water (5 g), a solution of
    KORDEK TM LX-5000 Microbicide (2.1 g, 50% active, A Trademark of The Dow Chemical
    Company or Its Affiliates) in DI water (25 g), and Tego Foamex 810 Defoamer (0.44 g).
25  The consequent polymer was then filtered through a 100-mesh screen to remove any gel. The
    polymer solid, particle size, pH, and Brookfield viscosity were then measured.

  5 by mixing DI water (52 g), FES-993 (8.5g, 30% active), BA (20 g), and MMA (160 g), and
    50% aqueous UMA (40 g).
    To a 5-L, four-necked round bottom flask equipped with a paddle stirrer, a thermometer, N 2
    inlet, and a reflux condenser was added DI water (700 g) and FES-993 (13.4 g, 30% active).
    The contents of the flask were heated to 86 'C under N2 and stirring was initiated. A solution
 .0 of 5% Actrene inhibitor (0.30 g) in DI water (10.0 g) was added to the flask, followed by a
    solution of sodium carbonate (2.1 g) dissolved in DI water (25 g). A portion of the first
    emulsion monomer emulsion (81 g) was then added, followed by addition of a 14.8% a

    then fed into the flask over 30 min (29.8 g/min). After addition of the first monomer
    emulsion was complete, the emulsion container was rinsed with DI water (30.0 g) and the
  5 rinse water was added to the flask. When the co-feeds were complete, the reaction mixture
    was held at 86 'C for 15 min and then allowed to cool to 60 'C.
    The second monomer emulsion (Table 2) was added to the flask and the jar containing the
    emulsion was rinsed with DI water (10.0 g), which was then added to the flask. A solution of
    t-butyl hydroperoxide (0.5 g, 70% aqueous) in DI water (8 g) was added to the flask followed
 .0 by addition of a solution of isoascorbic acid (0.4 g) in DI water (12 g). After the exothermic
    reaction reached peak temperature, a solution of t-butyl hydroperoxide (0.5 g 70%) in DI
    water (25 g) and a solution of isoascorbic acid (0.5 g) in DI water (25 g) were fed into the
    flask over 30 min. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool. A solution of 29%
    ammonia (31.0 g) in DI water (25 g) was then added to the flask. The temperature was raised
 .5 to 45 'C, at which time the following reagent were added to the flask: DOWEXTM 1x2
    CL 16-100 Ion Exchange Resin (120 g), TSPP (4.5 g), EDTA (3 g), Tamol 983 Dispersant
    (41.0 g), Rhodafac RS-960 Surfactant (34.6 g), 29% aqueous ammonia (6.2 g),
    TERGITOL TM 15-S-20 Surfactant (18.75 g), and DI water (150.5 g). A solution of
    ACRYSOL TM RM-8W Rheology Modifier (5.0 g) in DI water (10.0 g) was then added.

    Adhesion test panels were prepared by applying a Forest Green high gloss alkyd from Duron
    Inc. to a black vinyl substrate using a Byk Gardner 7 mil Dow Latex Film Applicator. The
    alkyd panels air dried in a vented hood for 5 d and were then placed in a controlled
  5 temperature and humidity room (72 'F (22.2 'C), 50% Humidity) to continue drying for three
    months. Formulations for Examples 1a, 2a, 3a and Comparative 1a were then applied
    individually to an alkyd panel using a Byk Gardner 3 mil Bar Film Applicator and allowed to
    dry for 24 h.

   The paint formulation of Comparative Example 1a shows more than 65% removal of the
   dried coating; in contrast the compositions that fall within the scope of the present invention
   show little or no removal of the dried alkyd coating by the ASTM DF-3359 cross hatch tape
   pull method. The results demonstrate that the presence of ureido functionality in both the
 5 first and the second stage of a biphasic two-stage polymer significantly improves alkyd
   adhesion over the two-stage polymer that has ureido functionality in the first stage only.
   Though not bound by theory, it is believed that even small amounts of ureido in a
   noncompatible relatively high Tg second phase causes improved adhesion through hydrogen
   bonding between the exposed ureido groups and the alkyd groups.
