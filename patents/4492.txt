                                            TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]         The present invention generally relates to improving the accuracy and/or
 5 precision of nitric oxide therapy, reducing the dilution of inhaled nitric oxide, and/or ensuring
   mixing within the patient's nose.
                                              BACKGROUND
   [0002]         Nitric oxide (NO) gas, when inhaled, dilates blood vessels in the lungs,
   improving oxygenation of the blood and reducing pulmonary hypertension. Because of this,
10 some provide nitric oxide as a therapeutic gas in the inspiratory breathing gases for patients
   with pulmonary hypertension.
   [0003]         Typically, inhaled NO is delivered in a carrier gas from a high pressure source
   (e.g., a pressurized cylinder) to the patient at, or near, ambient pressure by means of a
   respiratory tube for ICU ventilator bound/dependent or anesthesia patients or a nasal cannula
15 for spontaneously breathing patients. Delivering an accurate and consistent dose to the patient
   through a nasal cannula can be particularly challenging when the flow rate is pulsatile, for
   example, because dilution of the dose can occur.
   [0004]         Accordingly, a need exists for new methods and apparatuses for preventing
   dilution of dosing within the delivery conduit of a nitric oxide delivery apparatus, as well as
20 methods of manufacturing such apparatuses.
                                                 SUMMARY
   [0005]         Aspects of the present invention relate to improved nasal cannulas that
   minimize retrograde flow and/or permeation of oxygen, air, and/or other gases during NO
   therapy while allowing NO delivery to one or both nares of the nostril. Such cannulas can
25 reduce dilution of the delivered dose by using cannula materials and/or coatings that limit
   oxygen diffusion through the cannula walls and/or utilize cannula configurations that prevent
   mixing of co-delivered 02 and NO and/or reduce retrograde flow through the patient end of
   the cannula.

                                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0089]          The present invention generally relates to, amongst other things, systems,
   devices, materials, and methods that can improve the accuracy and/or precision of nitric oxide
   therapy by, for example, reducing the dilution of inhaled therapeutic gases such as nitric oxide
 5 (NO) and/or limiting mixing of the inhaled therapeutic gases prior to delivery into the patient's
   nose. As described herein, NO dilution can occur because of various factors such as, but not
   limited to, NO mixing with oxygen and/or air. To reduce the dilution of an intended NO dose,
   various exemplary nasal cannulas, pneumatic configurations, methods of manufacturing, and
   methods of use, etc. are disclosed. For example, the various exemplary nasal cannulas,
10 pneumatic configurations, methods of manufacturing, and methods of use, etc. of the present
   invention can reduce mixing of NO with oxygen and/or air (e.g., prior to being delivered into
   the patient's nose, etc.) thereby reducing dilution of intended NO doses.
   [0090]          Due to the unique nature of NO delivery, many factors need to be considered to
   ensure accurate and precise delivery of doses of NO to the patient. Unlike the administration of
15 other gases, such as oxygen (02), NO dosing can be particularly susceptible to dilution
   because, amongst other things, the dose volume may be less than 1 ml (e.g. a substantially
   small dose that can be lost to ambient) and/or NO can be reactive with 02 present in ambient
   air and/or co-administered 02 producing nitrogen dioxide (N02). Further, the timing of NO
   delivery can also be more critical (e.g., for efficacy) than the timing of other gases (e.g., 02
20 delivery), so a need exists to reduce NO dilution and ensure that the beginning of a patient's
   breath can be accurately determined as soon as possible and/or to ensure that the NO dose
   waveform does not significantly distort while traveling through the nasal cannula from the NO
   delivery device to the patient. Further, patient comfort may need to be factored into the design
   of the nasal cannula, for example, because the nasal cannula may be used for prolonged
25 periods of time.
   [0091]          Various cannulas, systems, and methods of the present invention can use,
   modify, and/or be affiliated with various systems for delivering pharmaceutical gas to a patient
   and/or for delivering a pulse of pharmaceutical gas to a patient. For example, the various
   cannulas, systems, and methods of the present invention can use, modify, and/or be affiliated
30 with at least the therapeutic gas delivery systems illustratively depicted in FIGS. 33A-34H.
   The various cannulas, systems, and methods of the present disclosure can use, modify, and/or
   be affiliated with the teachings of U.S. Patent No.: 7,523,752 entitled "System and Method of

     WO 2014/089188                                                           PCT/US2013/073082
                                                     13
   Administering a Pharmaceutical Gas To a Patient", the content of which is incorporated herein
   by reference in its entirety.
   [0092]           Referring to FIG. 1, typically, using a delivery system 100 NO can be delivered
   to a patient via a nasal cannula 101. Nasal cannula 101 can receive NO at relatively low
 5 volumetric percent concentrations in a carrier gas from, for example, a therapeutic gas (e.g.,
   NO) delivery device 103 and/or nasal cannula 101 can receive oxygen and/or ambient air (at
   times referred to simply as oxygen, 02, etc.) from an oxygen/ambient air supply 105. A
   commonly used carrier gas is nitrogen because nitrogen is non-reactive with NO, but other
   inert carrier gases such as helium can be used.
10 [0093]           Delivery of the NO/N 2 gas mixture (at times referred to simply as nitric oxide,
   NO, etc.) to the patient typically requires that the NO gas travel from a high pressure NO
   source (e.g., a pressurized cylinder, pressurized cylinder affiliated with NO delivery device
    103, etc.) to the patient at, or near, ambient pressure, for example, via a delivery tube for ICU
   ventilator bound/dependent and/or anesthesia patients and/or via a nasal cannula for
15 spontaneously breathing patients. It will be understood that various techniques and/or
   embodiments of the invention disclosed herein can be used for a delivery tube and/or a nasal
   cannula as well as other like apparatuses such as nasal pillows and/or nasal masks, to name a
   few. For ease, at times only a cannula is shown and/or described. This is merely for ease and is
   in no way meant to be a limitation.
20 [0094]           This above described transit of the NO, ideally, will be devoid of contact with
   other gasses, such as ambient air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc., until the gas enters the patient's
   upper respiratory tract. However, in practice, this may not be easily achieved. By way of
   example, oxygen and/or ambient air can enter delivery system 100 at a number of points such
   as, but not limited to:
25      e During the transit time within delivery device 103 (e.g., due to oxygen diffusion
            through pneumatic interfaces such as elastomeric O-rings into the inner pneumatics of
            the delivery device, etc.);
        e During the NO gas transit through nasal cannula 101 (e.g., by way of diffusion across
            the cannula wall, nosepiece, connectors, reducer, bond joints, etc.);

                                                    14
       e   During the inhalation/exhalation cycle when a driving pressure gradient can reverse
           flow in the nasal cannula NO supply lumen producing mixing within nasal cannula 101
           with ambient air and/or exhaled gas;
       e   During the inhalation/exhalation cycle when NO and Air/02 get mixed in the patient
 5         nares;
       e   During the connection of the high pressure source (e.g., a pressurized cylinder, etc.) to
           the delivery device (e.g., as cylinder replacement can trap small amounts of gas in the
           delivery pneumatics, etc.); and
       e   During the manufacturing cylinder filling operation of the high pressure NO source in
10         which a substantially pure mixture of NO and carrier gas can be sought, but may not be
           easily achieved.
   [0095]          The dilution of NO during pulsed NO therapy can be problematic because only
   a substantially small volume of NO may be delivered to the patient. For example, the NO
   containing gas can be administered in pulses that may be less than one (1) milliliter (ml). With
15 substantially small pulse volumes, even small volumes of retrograde flow and/or diffused gases
   can be significant, for example, because the small NO dose may be easily diluted. Of course
   larger volumes of NO can also be diluted.
   MINIMIZATION OF NO/02 CONTACT DUE TO 02 DIFFUSION:
   MINIMIZATION OF NO TRANSIT TIME
20 [0096]          One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to nasal cannulas that
   address sources of NO/02 contact (e.g., one or more of the above sources of NO/02 contact)
   and thereby dilution (e.g., by mixing of NO with 02, etc.) of the intended NO dose by
   minimizing NO contact time with 02, via minimizing transit time through the cannula,
   minimizing the transit of oxygen across the cannula walls, and/or minimizing the amount of
25 02 coming in contact with NO. Referring to FIG. 1, addressing at least dilution of intended
   NO doses, described below in greater detail, oxygen transit can be minimized across any
   lumina wall of cannula 101 such as, but not limited to, cannula walls associated with a trigger
   lumen 104, NO lumen 106, 02/air lumen 108, and/or any combination and/or further
   separation thereof, to name a few. Also, addressing at least dilution of intended NO doses,
30 oxygen transit can be minimized across any wall of cannula 101, such as but not limited to,
   cannula walls associated with a cannula nosepiece 102, a keying member 110, reducer 112,

                                                   15
   connection piece 114, oxygen connection piece 116, and/or any combination and/or further
   separation thereof, to name a few.
   Small ID NO Lumen
   [0097]          In one or more embodiments, cannulas can be provided that include a smaller
 5 inside diameter (ID) delivery tube/lumen for NO to, for example, reduce dilution of the
   intended NO doses. This smaller ID tube can reduce the transit time of the NO molecules
   through the cannula. This in turn can reduce the time available for mixing with oxygen which
   can be diffusing across the walls of the cannula and oxidizing the internal NO into NO2.
   [0098]          By way of example, to reduce dilution of intended NO doses by minimizing NO
10 transit time through the cannula, the ID for delivery tube/lumen for NO can be about 0.01
   inches to about 0.10 inches and/or about 0.03 inches to about 0.08 inches. In exemplary
   embodiments, the ID of the delivery tube/lumen for NO can be selected to ensure reduced
   transit time of NO (e.g., reducing NO dilution, etc.) while not resulting in significant
   backpressure and/or NO pulse shape distortion and/or NO waveform distortion (discussed
15 below in greater detail). To reduce transit time as well as not significantly cause backpressure
   and/or distortion, the ID for delivery tube/lumen for NO may not be substantially smaller than
   about 0.03 inches, for example, for a cannula having a length of about 6 feet to 8 feet. For
   shorter lengths a smaller ID may be used and/or for longer lengths a larger ID may be used as
   resistance and/or distortion can be a function of both tube ID and tube length.
20 [0099]          In exemplary embodiments, the ID of shorter tubes/lumens for NO delivery
   (e.g. such as the cannula nares, shorter nasal cannulas, etc.) can have a substantially smaller
   tube ID than for delivery tubes/lumen for NO, which may also have a substantially small ID as
   described above, without significant backpressure and/or NO pulse shape and/or waveform
   distortion occurring.
25 [00100]         In exemplary embodiments, the potential for time of exposure of NO to 02 can
   be minimized using other techniques such as, but not limited to, increasing the velocity of
   delivery of NO through the NO lumen. The velocity of NO through the NO lumen can be
   increased by, for example, increasing the pressure gradient within the system and/or by
   reducing the diameter of the tube. Although the NO velocity can be increased to reduce the
30 exposure time of NO to 02, the velocity can be required to be minimized so that the pulse
   shape is not substantially distorted, the patient does not experience discomfort, and/or by
   factoring in any other competing metric.

   [00101]          It will be understood that the any of above teachings (e.g., small ID for the
   delivery tube lumen for NO, etc.) can be combined with any of the other pneumatic
   configurations, cannula configurations, and/or teachings and/or embodiments described herein.
   For example, the above teachings (e.g., small ID for the delivery tube/lumen for NO, etc.) can
 5 be used with the below described mono-lumen cannulas, dual-lumen cannulas, tri-lumen
   cannulas, quad-lumen cannulas, and/or any other teachings and/or embodiments described
   herein.
   Materialsto Limit Oxygen Diffusion and/or Remove 02 and/orN02
   [00102]          Currently, many use polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and/or silicone as a common
10 material for constructing nasal cannulas; however, oxygen can diffuse through the lumen walls
   of these nasal cannulas. To minimize the oxygen contact occurring due to oxygen diffusion,
   permeation, and/or transmission across the cannula's walls, cannula wall materials can be
   selected that minimize the oxygen diffusion rate, permeability rate, and/or oxygen transmission
   rate (OTR). In exemplary embodiments, the cannula wall can include a material with a low
15 oxygen diffusion coefficient, permeability rating, and/or oxygen transmission rate (OTR). By
   way of example, the cannula wall can include a material that can have an oxygen transmission
   rate (OTR) from about 0.001 to about 10, for example, using the following units:
                                                  (cc) (mil)
                                          (24 hrs)(100 in 2 )(ATM)
           where:
            "cc" refers to the cubic centimeters (ml) of oxygen that crosses a square of material;
20          "mil" refers to 1 mil (0.001" thickness) of the square of material;
            "ATM" refers to the number of atmospheres of ambient pressure;
            "24 hrs" refers to the duration allowed for oxygen flow; and
            "100 in 2" refers to the surface area of the square of material.
   [00103]          At times, when describing oxygen diffusion, permeation, and/or transmission
25 across the cannula's walls and/or cannula's materials, reference may only be made to at least
   one of diffusion rates, diffusion coefficients, permeability rates, permeability ratings, and/or
   OTR. It will be understood that reference to any of the above terms, when applicable, can be
   used with and/or replaced by any of the above terms, and the like. For ease, at times only one
   and/or some of the above terms are described. This is merely for ease and is in no way meant
30 to be a limitation.

   [00104]        In exemplary embodiments, cannula materials (e.g., material for the cannula
   tubing, the cannula nosepiece, etc.) can be adjusted and/or varied to address 02 permeation
   along with patient comfort.
   [00105]        In exemplary embodiments, cannulas can be constructed using polyurethane
 5 and/or similar soft material. In exemplary embodiments, the polyurethane and/or similar soft
   material can include an additive to enhance the resistance to oxygen diffusion and/or tube
   coaxially located about at least some of the cannula for NO delivery filled with a gas providing
   resistance to oxygen diffusion. The cannulas can be constructed by coaxially coating a tube
   and/or co-extruding two or more materials (e.g., to form the tube, etc.). Of course other
10 methods and/or techniques for construction are within the scope of the disclosure.
   [00106]        Examples of at least some materials which can be used for construction and/or
   that can have desired oxygen permeation properties include, but are not limited to, polymers
   such as polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyamide (PA),
   polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), fluorinated polyurethane, Nylon 6, Nylon 12, and/or similar
15 materials, to name a few. Further, PVC can be used as the cannula material with one or more
   materials and/or additives, such as oxygen resistant polymers, incorporated to reduce the
   oxygen permeation, diffusion coefficient, and the like. Oxygen resistant polymers can be
   incorporated with the polyurethane, PVC, and/or other cannula materials, for example, through
   co-extrusion. By way of example, such an extrusion can be achieved with co-extrusion dies

   trade name Saran®), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), Nylon 6, Nylon 12, and/or any
   homogenous and/or single material extrusions with low oxygen permeability can be used for
   the cannula material. Other materials are envisioned with these properties and the use of
   substitute low oxygen permeation extrusion compatible material is within the scope of this
 5 invention.
   [00109]         Co-extrusions of two or more polymers: In exemplary embodiments, a tube
   in-tube and/or multilayered sandwich configurations can be constructed using co-extrusions of
   two or more polymers. For example, two or more polymers, with at least one having low
   oxygen permeation properties, can be co-extruded (e.g., using common co-extrusion methods
10 known in the art) to construct a tube-in-tube or multilayered sandwich configuration. The low
   oxygen permeation layer can include the polymers disclosed herein (e.g., such as those listed in
   the previous section) and/or other polymers with similar characteristics. Since these polymers
   may or may not co-extrude well with other polymers, it may be necessary to extrude an
   intermediate or so called tie-layer polymer. Exemplary co-extruded polymers can include, but
15 are     not     limited     to,     PVC/EVOH/PVDC,           PVC/EVOH/PFDF,         fluorinated
   polyurethane/EVOH/PVDC          and   fluorinated   polyurethane/EVOH/PVDF,       PVC/PVDC,
   Polyurethane/PVDC, PVC/Nylon 6, PVC/Nylon 12, PVC/PVDC/Nylon 6, PVC/PVDC/Nylon
    12, Polyurethane/PVDC/Nylon 6, Polyurethane/PVDC/Nylon12, tie layer polymers, any
   combination and/or separation thereof, and/or any other material that can be used with co
20 extrusions of two or more polymers.
   [00110]        In exemplary embodiments, co-extrusions can be layered in a specific order, for
   example, to reduce oxygen permeation and/or diffusion and/or for construction purposes. For
   example, if an adhesive used (e.g., in the joining of components of the cannula, etc.) bonds
   PVC to PVC then the outer layer of a co-extrusion exposed to such adhesive can be PVC.
25 Further, additional polymers (e.g., which may have reduced properties when in contact with
   water vapor) such as, but not limited to, EVOH can be sandwiched inside hydrophobic and/or
   water resistant outer and/or inner extrusion layers to minimize the contact of the internal
   compound with water vapor.
   [00111]         Surface treatment/surface coatings over tubing: In exemplary embodiments,
30 surface coatings (e.g., surface treatments, surface coatings, etc.) for low oxygen permeation
   can be applied to nasal cannula construction. Such coatings can include, but are not limited to,
   vacuum deposited silicon dioxide (silica) and/or aluminum (e.g., oxides of aluminum, etc.)

     WO 2014/089188                                                          PCT/US2013/073082

   coatings heated above their sublimation temperature that can be deposited in thin layers a few
   microns (or less) thick. For example, silica coatings can be about 0.001 microns to about 10
   microns and/or about 0.01 microns to about 1 micron, and/or about 0.04 microns.
   [00112]          In exemplary embodiments, silica coatings can be deposited on plastic in layers
 5 that can be substantially thin enough such that flexibility of the plastic may not be materially
   affected. It will be understood that any reasonable technique can be used for deposition of such
   materials. For example, low cost deposition can be achieved using chemical vapor deposition
   treatment. Of course other deposition methods for these coatings can also be used such as, but
   not limited to, E-beam and Thermal Evaporation, DC Magnetron Sputtering, Plasma-Assisted
10 Reactive Sputtering, any combination and/or further separation thereof, and/or any technique
   capable of deposition.
   [00113]          In exemplary embodiments, other coatings such as, but not limited to, thermoset
   epoxy-amine coatings, epoxy-amine coatings, etc. can be used. Coatings can be applied and/or
   provided using techniques described herein and/or known techniques.
15 [00114]          Blends: In exemplary embodiments, materials can be blended together to obtain
   the beneficial properties of one or the other materials and/or used as the cannula material. In
   exemplary embodiments, Nylon 6 and EVOH, which can adhere to each other in co-extrusions
   without the need for a tie layer, can be used as a blended cannula material. Other blends can
   include, but are not limited to, Nylon 6 with amorphous nylon and Nylon 6 with HDPE. Of
20 course other blends can be used.
   [00115]          In exemplary embodiments, a later material can be coated over an earlier
   material. By way of example, when two materials are not compatible with co-extrusion due to
   different melt temperatures, one polymer can be extruded first and the second polymer can be
   heated and coated over the first in a secondary operation.
25 [00116]          Scavengers/getters: In exemplary embodiments, scavengers can be coated to
   the inside of the lumen (e.g., by baking off the liquid in a liquid suspension of the scavenger to
   the inside of the lumen, by condensing out the scavenger on the inside of the lumen by
   evaporative processes, by absorbing/adsorbing to the inside surface of the lumen using a liquid
   or gasous scavenger source, by chemically bonding the scavenger to the inside surface of the
30 cannula, etc.) and/or the scavenger can be packaged within the device connector and/or
   nosepiece, for example, as a plug (e.g., a plug with at least one hole to allow flow of gas
   through it, etc.) to scavenge oxygen and/or nitrogen dioxide. Such scavengers can include, but

     WO 2014/089188                                                          PCT/US2013/073082

   are not limited to, compounds such as activated alumina, ascorbic acid, and/or any other
   scavenging compound. Potential drawbacks of such an approach include the finite lifespan of
   the scavenging material. This drawback can be overcome by factoring in use duration of the
   cannula into the design. At least one additional potential drawback can be that any plug
 5 configuration for gas transit through a scavenger may distort the gas waveform. In light of this
   plugs described may be designed to minimize such waveform distortion. Any method can be
   used to coat the inside of the lumen. By of example, a liquid that is concentrated with a
   scavenger (e.g., ascorbic acid) can be passed through the tube and then dried on such that it
   may then be deposited on the inner wall of the tube.
10 [00117]         In exemplary embodiments, activated alumina can be used in the cannula, for
   example, as a coating in the inside of the lumen, as a plug fitting, and/or used in any other way,
   for example, for the capture of nitrogen dioxide. With a thin layer of alumina coated to the
   inside of the lumen, the effect can not only be a reduction of the oxygen permeation rate, but
   can also be successful for capture of nitrogen dioxide. Activated alumina and/or other
15 scavengers can also be made in the form of a plug fitted into the tube, for example, in an area
   close in proximity to the nostrils of the patient. The plug may be designed to minimize pressure
   drop and/or to maintain the shape of nitric oxide pulse wave. The high surface area of activated
   alumina can effectively scrub nitrogen dioxide from the gas mixture. Further, the scavenger
   can also be located in the device, for example, at the device connector. In this fashion, the
20 scavenger can be part of the cannula and/or may be removable (e.g., such that it may be
   removed when changing the cannula) and/or the design life of the scavenger can be matched to
   anticipated and/or actual use duration of the cannula.
   [00118]         It will be understood that the invention is not limited to activated alumina and
   that any material with a high surface area, substantial nitrogen dioxide scrubbing capability,
25 proper pore sizes, enough physical strength so that the shape could be maintained, and/or that
   may not generate powders and/or other materials that may shed or decouple from the cannula
   can act in the capacity of the scrubbing material. It is further understood that internal filtering
   may be used to contain shedding compounds to prevent aspiration in the respiratory system.
   Examples of scrubbing materials include, but are not limited to, zeolites, silica-alumina,
30 activated carbon/coal, and adsorbents that can have solid base sites on the surface. For ease, at
   times, activated alumina is described as a scrubbing material. This is merely for ease and is in
   no way meant to be a limitation.

   [00119]         In exemplary embodiments, a reducing agent can be coated on the surface of the
   scrubbing material, for example, to enhance its ability to capture and/or reduce nitrogen
   dioxide to nitric oxide. Such reducing agents include, but are not limited to, ascorbic acid.
   [00120]         In exemplary embodiments, additives can be added to the polymer to change the
 5 permeation/barrier properties such as, but not limited to, oxidizable plastic (e.g. PET or
   polyamide), nanoclays, any combination and/or further separation thereof, and/or any other
   additive. Additives can work to scavenge the oxygen and/or provide a barrier to permeation
   within the polymer matrix, either of which can result in reduced oxygen permeating through
   the material. Oxidizable plastics (e.g. PET or polyamide) can react with the oxygen that may
10 be permeating through the polymer matrix. Oxygen that may be permeating through the
   membrane can react with the oxidizable plastic prior to getting through the cannula and/or
   reacting with NO. Nanoclays (e.g., that may tend to have a plate like morphology) can provide
   a barrier to permeation, for example, when adequately dispersed within the polymer matrix.
   When dispersed, diffusion can be required to occur around the plates, which can result in a
15 tortuous path through the polymer thereby effectively reducing the gas permeability.
   [00121]         It will be understood that the any of above teachings (e.g., materials, etc.) can
   be combined with any of the other pneumatic configurations, cannula configurations, and/or
   teachings and/or embodiments described herein. For example, the above teachings (e.g.,
   materials, etc.) can be used with the below described mono-lumen cannulas, dual lumen
20 cannulas, tri-lumen cannulas, quad lumen cannulas, and/or any other teachings and/or
   embodiments described herein.
   CONFIGURATIONS
   RETROGRADE FLOW
   [00122]         Referring to FIGS. 2A-2B, it was surprisingly found that another source of
25 dilution can be caused by a phenomenon (e.g., retrograde flow, cross-flow, etc.) in which
   ambient air and/or exhaled gas flows into the nasal cannula (e.g., at and/or near cannula
   nosepiece 200). This gas flow into the nasal cannula can be between two cannula nares (e.g.,
   cannula nares 202/203) displacing resident nitric oxide gas and/or pushing the nitric oxide gas
   out of the cannula so the displaced and/or pushed out nitric oxide may not be delivered to the
30 patient and/or may mix with the gas flow and/or other gases, thereby diluting the intended NO
   dose. Further, retrograde flow can depend on factors such as, but not limited to, the pressure
   difference between the nares during both inhalation and exhalation. The pressure difference

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   22
   between the nares can vary depending on factors such as, but not limited to, the person's
   breathing pattern, occlusions and/or partial occlusions in the person's nostrils (e.g., as shown in
   FIG. 12), placement of the nasal nares, and the degree of misbalance between the nasal flow
   during breathing, to name a few. Accordingly, one or more embodiments of the present
 5 invention relate to nasal cannulas that can minimize the retrograde flow and/or dilution
   resulting from retrograde flow in the nasal cannula.
   [00123]         As shown in Figure 2A, during normal pulsed delivery, NO flows out of both
   nares 202/203 of cannula nosepiece 200. However, during at least the static phase between
   pulses, retrograde flow can occur. For example, during the static phase ambient or exhaled air
10 can flow in a circular motion and/or reversed flow in through one cannula nare 202 and out the
   other cannula nare 203 as shown in FIG. 2B. This retrograde flow can result in dilution and/or
   washout of NO in the nasal nares and/or flow path, which can cause a delay and/or reduction in
   the delivered dose. Furthermore, this retrograde flow can result in the oxygen in air and/or
   exhaled gas stream mixing with the NO to a greater degree and/or reacting with nitric oxide in
15 the nasal cannula which may cause NO2 formation that dilutes the NO concentration.
   Accordingly to reduce retrograde flow (e.g., that may result in NO2 formation that dilutes the
   NO doses and that can act as a known respiratory irritant, etc.), the volume of potential nitric
   oxide mixing with either exhaled gas and/or ambient gas may be minimized.
   [00124]         Noting the above, the amount of dilution resulting from retrograde flow can be
20 dependent on the volume of the lumen associated with NO delivery (e.g., the NO lumen;
   combined NO and triggering lumen; combined NO, triggering, and 02/air lumen; etc.) at the
   cannula nosepiece (e.g., flow path) where retrograde flow may occur. The segment where
   retrograde flow may occur can have any shape. For ease, this segment where retrograde flow
   occurs is, at times, described as being "U" shaped, and the like. This is merely for ease and is
25 in no way meant to be a limitation.
   [00125]         In exemplary embodiments, optimized ID dimensions (e.g., ID size, ID shape,
   etc.) of the lumen associated with NO delivery (e.g., the NO lumen; combined NO and
   triggering lumen; combined NO, triggering, and 02/air lumen; etc.) at the nosepiece (e.g., flow
   path) can be selected to reduce the volume of the "U" shaped region thereby minimizing the
30 potential volumetric exchange associated with retrograde flow and/or dilution resulting from
   retrograde flow. Further, in exemplary embodiments, such optimal ID dimensions can vary
   depending on the volume of NO gas delivered. By way of example, a nitric oxide delivery

     WO 2014/089188                                                          PCT/US2013/073082
                                                    23
   device can deliver pulses of NO-containing gas with a minimum dose volume of 0.35 ml. In
   order to ensure volumetric dosing accuracy, it may be preferable that no more than a small
   percentage (e.g., 10%, 5%, 20%, etc.) of the dose can be lost due to retrograde flow.
   [00126]         One or more embodiments of the present invention limits the internal volume of
 5 this "U" shape to be no more than a small percentage (e.g., 10%, 5%, 20%, etc.) of the
   minimum dose volume (e.g., 0.035 ml for a 0.35 ml pulse of therapeutic gas) to ensure that if
   NO loss occurs it is an acceptable amount of NO loss due to retrograde flow (e.g., loss to
   ambient during the exhalation phase). Following the above example, for a 10% minimum dose
   volume of 0.035 ml, the lumen ID within the "U" segment may be no more than 0.046 inches
10 given a prong length of 0.315 inches and a prong spacing of 0.63 inches. Therefore, a lumen
   ID significantly larger than 0.046 inches may not be advantageous to maintaining dose volume
   accuracy for minimum dose volumes of 0.35 ml.
   [00127]         It will be understood that the mathematics of this construct can be modified by
   variations in systems such as, but not limited to, systems with larger or smaller minimum dose
15 volumes appropriately, systems with different prong lengths, and/or systems prong spacing, to
   name a few. One skilled in the art can perform the required calculations to determine the ID
   required to provide a desired volume in the "U" shaped segment so that it does not exceed 10%
   of the dose volume. Furthermore, depending on the required accuracy for the dosing, the
   internal "U" volume or other volume available for cross-flow can be, but is not limited to, less
20 than 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% of the dose
   volume, to name a few.
   [00128]         For example, if the "U" shape consists of two nares and a backplane, the
   maximum dimensions such that the "U" volume does not exceed 20% of the minimum dose
   volume can be calculated using the following formula, wherein backplane refers to the length
25 of the lumena inside the nosepiece and/or which forms the base of the "U" shape:
             Minimum Dose Volume >           5[27r (Prong Diameter/2) 2 * (Prong Length) +
                                          7(Backplane Diameter/2) 2 * (Backplane Length)]
30 [00129]         Thus, if the minimum dose is known, the dimensions of the cannula "U" section
   can be calculated. For dosing accuracies other than 20%, the volume ratio factor of 5 can be
   changed accordingly with the volume ratio factor being equal to [100 / (dose accuracy %)].

     WO 2014/089188                                                          PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   24
   [00130]        In exemplary embodiments, during exhalation and/or prior to inhalation (e.g.,
   sensed and/or detected by the delivery device, etc.) the U-shaped volume in the nosepiece can
   be purged with a pulse of NO substantially equal to the U-volume. This can cause the U
   volume to be substantially filled with NO (e.g., after exhalation). Further, this NO filling the
 5 U-volume can be delivered to the patient during the next inhalation, for example, ensuring
   early delivery of NO to the patient to provide optimal clinical efficacy (e.g., discussed below).
   [00131]        In exemplary embodiments, retrograde flow can be reduced by at least reducing
   the ID of the NO delivery lumen within the nasal prong (e.g., NO flow path) so that the
   resistance to flow through the NO lumen at the nasal prong can be increased. Noting this
10 configuration, under the same pressure differential, the flow within the NO lumen of the nasal
   prongs can be reduced as compared to prongs with larger lumen. This can result in reduced
   cross flow under at least these conditions, for example, because the smaller ID NO lumen can
   produce gas flow resistance which can be inversely proportional to the fourth power of lumen's
   radius by Poiseuille's Law.
15 [00132]        In exemplary embodiments, retrograde flow can be reduced by using valves
   and/or check valves, for example, as discussed below in greater detail.
   [00133]        At times, the NO lumen described herein may be described as being optimized
   for a minimum pulse volume of 0.35 ml and/or allowed 10% dosing error resulting in an
   allowable U-shaped volume in the NO lumen (e.g., of 0.035 ml). In exemplary embodiments,
20 changes in this minimum pulse volume and/or the optimal pulse volume range may impact at
   least the NO lumen size. For example, should the minimum pulse volume be smaller due to,
   for example, higher nitric oxide concentrations being used, the inner diameter of the NO lumen
   and/or "U" volume may be decreased to ensure the 10% error goal. For example, the NO
   lumen and/or "U" volume may be decreased taking into account the various metrics for
25 optimization such as, but not limited to, pulse shape. Further, for example, should the
   minimum pulse volume be increased due to, for example, the use of lower concentration nitric
   oxide, then the inner diameter of the NO lumen and/or "U" volume may be increased. For
   example, the NO lumen and/or "U" volume may be increased taking into account the various
   metrics for optimization such as, but not limited to, pulse shape. It will be understood that if
30 the NO lumen and/or "U" volume is too large (e.g., about 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml) then small
   volume pulses may not be able to be delivered accurately, delivery may be delayed, dilution
   may occur, and/or other problems may occur due to the unique nature of NO delivery.

   MINIMIZING DELAYAND/OR DISTORTION
   [00134]          For nitric oxide delivery systems (e.g., that may pulse nitric oxide gas to
   patients) to have optimal clinical efficacy it may be necessary to deliver a pulse or flow of
   nitric oxide to the patient as early in the inspiratory phase as possible and/or with a desired
 5 flow waveform (e.g., pulse shape). Noting this, pneumatic delays may be and/or should be
   minimized because, for example, pressure signals from the patient can be used as an indication
   of patient inspiratory effort and/or the beginning of patient inspiration. Also, distortion of pulse
   or flow waveforms may be and/or should be minimized because, for example, waveform shape
   and/or timing may be tied to clinical efficacy. Accordingly, one or more embodiments of the
10 present invention relate to nasal cannula configurations that minimize the delay and/or
   distortion of pressure signals, for example, when in transit through the cannula from the patient
   back to the device and/or that minimize distortion of flow waveforms.
   [00135]          In exemplary embodiments, the lumen of the cannula affiliated with triggering
   (e.g., the triggering lumen; combined triggering and NO lumen; combined triggering, NO, and
15 02/air lumen; etc.) can be configured to minimize the delay and/or distortion of pressure
   signals when in transit through the cannula. To minimize the delay and/or distortion of
   pressure signals when in transit through the cannula, the cross-section of the lumen affiliated
   with triggering can be selected to reduce delay and/or distortion and/or the cross-sectional size
   can be increased and/or maximized to reduce delay and/or distortion.
20 [00136]          In exemplary embodiments, the lumen of the cannula affiliated with NO
   delivery (e.g., NO lumen; combined NO and triggering lumen; combined NO, triggering, and
   02/air lumen; etc.) can be configured to minimize distortion of flow waveforms. To minimize
   distortion of flow waveforms the cross-section of the lumen affiliated with NO delivery can be
   increased and/or maximized and/or the shape of the cross-section can be selected to reduce
25 delay and/or distortion. Further, in exemplary embodiments, to minimize distortion of flow
   waveforms the lumen affiliated with NO delivery can be made having reduced compliance,
   i.e., having increased stiffness. For example, to minimize distortion of flow waveforms the
   lumen affiliated with NO delivery can be made of a substantially rigid material. The rigidity of
   the material can be selected for reducing compliance while still factoring in at least patient

   [00137]          In at least some embodiments the cannula can be configured such that one
   lumen can be for delivering NO and be for triggering (e.g., mono-lumen cannulas, dual-lumen
   cannulas, etc.). Such configurations can require optimizing the lumen for both NO delivery and
   for triggering to have minimal dilution of NO doses as well as allow the trigger signal to
 5 propagate to the device without attenuation substantially over the spectral band of human
   breathing (e.g., 0-4 Hz). This can be substantially difficult as these can be competing metrics
   for optimization. For example, in order to deliver a pulse and/or flow of NO early in the
   inspiratory phase, reduce pneumatic delays, reduce distortion of flow waveforms, reduce delay
   and/or distortion of pressure signals, reduce the volume of NO mixing and/or NO oxidation at
10 the nosepiece, and/or address any other desired property (e.g., for a combined NO/triggering
   lumen) several competing metrics of the lumen ID can be optimized such as, but not limited to:
               a. Reduce N02 formation -> Reduce lumen ID;
               b. Maintain volumetric NO dosing accuracy -> Reduce lumen ID;
               c.   Reduce NO flow distortion - > Increase lumen ID; and
15             d. Minimize trigger signal attenuation or delay - > Increase lumen ID.
   [00138]          In exemplary embodiments, cannulas of the present invention that have
   combined NO/triggering lumen configurations can require compromise of the optimal
   geometry (e.g., shape, size, etc.) of the NO/Trigger lumen to, for example, deliver pulses
   and/or flows of NO early in the inspiratory phase, reduce pneumatic delays, reduce distortion
20 of flow waveforms, reduce delay and/or distortion of pressure signals, reduce the volume of
   NO mixing at the nosepiece, and/or NO oxidation at the nosepiece. Such compromise may be
   required for cannulas of the present invention that have combined NO/triggering lumen (e.g.,
   mono-lumen cannulas, dual-lumen cannulas, etc.). However, cannulas configurations of the
   present invention that have at least three lumens (e.g., tri-lumen cannula, quad-lumen cannula,
25 etc.), as discussed below, can allow for lumens dedicated to both NO delivery and to the
   trigger signal and can, in at least some instances, allow for a dedicated 02/air delivery lumen.
   As such, for cannulas of the present invention with dedicated lumens for NO delivery and
   triggering (e.g., tri lumen cannulas, quad-lumen cannulas, etc.) the optimized NO lumen can be
   smaller than the optimized trigger lumen since it may be beneficial to have a larger trigger
30 lumen to ensure at least minimal signal attenuation while it may be beneficial to have a smaller
   NO lumen to reduce at least dilution of NO. As such, cannulas of the present invention having
   combined NO/triggering lumens (e.g., mono-lumen, dual-lumen cannulas, etc.) and cannulas of

     WO 2014/089188                                                            PCT/US2013/073082
                                                     27
   the present invention having dedicated NO delivery lumens and dedicated triggering lumens
   (e.g., tri-lumen cannulas, quad-lumen cannulas etc.) can have different geometries when
   optimized.
   [00139]         By way of example, in addition to ensuring the accuracy of volumetric dosing
 5 (e.g., described above with respect to minimizing dilution resulting from retrograde flow), the
   ID of combined NO/triggering lumens can be designed to reduce and/or not produce gas flow
   distortion and/or undue signal propagation delay, for example, from the patient to the device
   (e.g., described above with respect to minimizing delay and/or distortion of pressure signals).
   Such distortion and/or delay may occur as pneumatic tubes may behave as first order
10 pneumatic low pass filters and attenuate higher frequency signal components. Modification of
   the inner diameters can change the band pass characteristics of the filtering effect. However, as
   noted earlier, the inner diameter (e.g., at the U) can be fixed to a certain maximum ID based on
   the required dose delivery accuracy of the system.
   [00140]         In light of at least the above, in exemplary embodiments, to minimize the
15 effects of the potentially frequency attenuated pressure signal: (1) the upstream (close to
   device) diameter of the combined NO/triggering lumen of cannulas of the present invention
   can be adjusted to widen (e.g., optimize) the band pass characteristics of the cannula and/or (2)
   triggering of the initiation of pulse delivery of NO (e.g., by the delivery device) may have the
   typical threshold pressure trigger strategy (e.g., the pressure signal may be attenuated and/or
20 delayed by the pneumatic filtering effect of the cannula construct) and therefore it may be
   advantageous to supplement/replace this threshold pressure trigger with a pressure slope based
   triggering strategy based on a pattern of sloping pressure indicative of patient effort. Such a
   pressure slope based triggering strategy in the presence of significant signal attenuation can be
   more responsive (e.g., faster) to patient effort. It will be understood that to minimize the effects
25 of the potentially attenuated/delayed pressure signal the downstream diameter of the combined
   NO/triggering lumen of cannulas of the present invention can be adjusted to widen (e.g.,
   optimize) the band pass characteristics of the cannula; however, this may produce an
   undesirable side effect of the cannula nosepiece size being increased, which in turn may make
   the cannula less comfortable to the patient.
30 [00141]         In   exemplary    embodiments,      the   upstream   diameter    of the   combined
   NO/triggering lumen can be adjusted to widen the band pass characteristics of the cannula to
   ensure that unneeded compressible volume may be unavailable upstream of the nose piece

     WO 2014/089188                                                          PCT/US2013/073082

   restriction (e.g., 0.046 inch ID restriction, etc.). This can reduce the compressible volume in
   the cannula and/or effectively increases the band pass characteristics of the cannula.
   [00142]         In exemplary embodiments, triggering of dose delivery (e.g., by the delivery
   device) can be based on a pattern of sloping pressure indicative of patient efforts and/or the
 5 slope can be reduced in magnitude by the filtering characteristics of the tubing, however, the
   slope can still be present for algorithmic triggering decisions (e.g., by the delivery device). In
   exemplary embodiments, triggering methodologies can be based not on pressure thresholds,
   rather triggering methodologies can be based on pressure slope trends that can also be
   employed to improve overall timely delivery of dosing to the patient. It will be understood that
10 such a triggering implementation can be optional.
   MONO-LUMEN CANNULA
   [00143]         Referring to FIG. 3A, in exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula can have at
   least one lumen (i.e. a mono-lumen cannula 300) that can deliver nitric oxide in the same
   lumen as used to deliver oxygen and/or trigger a delivery device 303. Using mono-lumen
15 cannula 300, in a single lumen, oxygen and/or ambient air flow 305 can be delivered to a
   patient with doses of NO 307 intermittently pulsed into the flow. This same lumen may also be
   used for triggering. Using this technique, retrograde flow can be substantially reduced, for
   example, because the 02 and/or air can effectively clear the cannula nosepiece after each NO
   pulse and or because the single lumen can be a closed system at the device upon valve closure
20 and thus flow into the cannula lumen can be prevented. However, using this technique, oxygen
   and/or air 305 can be in contact with NO 307 within the lumen of cannula 300 and react (e.g.,
   forming N02) thereby diluting the intended NO dose.
   [00144]         In exemplary embodiments, a carrier gas can be used buffer (e.g., insulate) the
   NO from 02 and/or a carrier gas can be used to increase the effective volume of the delivered
25 dose, for example, to reduce the transit time of NO in the cannula. This buffer gas can be
   diffused into the NO dose and/or surround the NO dose (e.g., spatially before and after).
   [00145]         Referring to FIG. 3B, in exemplary embodiments, to reduce dilution of NO 307
   with oxygen and/or air 305 within the NO/02 lumen, a buffer agent 309 can be delivered
   between NO 307 and oxygen 305. By way of example, first oxygen can be delivered through
30 the NO/02 lumen, then a buffer agent (e.g., an inert gas, nitrogen gas, etc.) can be delivered,
   then NO can be delivered, then another buffer agent can be delivered, and then oxygen can be

     WO 2014/089188                                                          PCT/US2013/073082
                                                    29
   delivered. The buffer agent can reduce interaction between NO and oxygen thereby reducing
   dilution of NO, for example, caused by NO2 formation.
   [00146]         In exemplary embodiments, when using a buffer gas to transport the NO within
   the cannula the amount of contact between NO with 02 and the time of contact can be
 5 minimized without substantially distorting the shape of the NO pulse dose. In exemplary
   embodiments, the buffer gas can be substantially devoid of 02 such that it can act as a buffer
   to any entrained 02 and/or it can increase the volume of delivered gas thereby decreasing the
   time that the NO dose in the cannula. In exemplary embodiments, the buffer gas can include
   oxygen, however, the diameter of the cannula lumen can be small enough so that the cross
10 section of the NO dose exposed to 02 can be minimized and/or the diameter can be large
   enough to ensure that the pulse shape of the dose may not be substantially distorted.
   [00147]         In exemplary embodiments, a buffer gas can be provided by using the 02
   depleted gas mixture remaining after an oxygen concentrator system has removed the 02 from
   air.
15 [00148]         It will be understood that the buffer disclosed can be used with any multi-lumen
   cannula (e.g., dual-lumen cannula, tri-lumen cannula, quad-lumen cannula, etc.) where NO and
   02 may be delivered in the same lumen. For example, a dual lumen cannula can have a trigger
   lumen and combined NO/02 lumen wherein NO may be intermittently pulsed into 02 with a
   buffer separating the NO and 02.
20 [00149]         In exemplary embodiments, the inner diameter of the mono-lumen (e.g.,
   combined NO/02 lumen, combined NO/02/Trigger lumen, etc.) can be configured to be
   substantially small, for example, to reduce residual gas mixing. As discussed above, lumens
   that include different functions (e.g., NO delivery, triggering, 02 delivery, etc.) can have
   competing metrics for optimization. For optimization, the dimensions of the cross-section of
25 the mono-lumen can require a compromise between at least some of these competing metrics.
   For example, because the mono-lumen has a combined NO/triggering lumen and/or combined
   NO/02/Trigger, the optimal geometry (e.g., shape, size, etc.) of the mono-lumen can require
   compromise between at least some competing metrics to, for example, deliver pulses and/or
   flows of NO early in the inspiratory phase, reduce pneumatic delays, reduce distortion of flow
30 waveforms, reduce delay and/or distortion of pressure signals, reduce the volume of NO
   mixing at the nosepiece, and/or NO oxidation at the nosepiece. Considering at least the
   competing metrics for optimization, in at least some embodiments, the inner diameter of the

     WO 2014/089188                                                        PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   30
   mono-lumen (e.g., combined NO/02 lumen, combined NO/02/Trigger lumen, etc.) can be less
   than about 0.07 inches.
   DUAL-LUMEN CANNULA
   [00150]         Referring to FIG. 4, in exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula can have at
 5 least two lumens (i.e. a dual-lumen cannula 400) that can deliver nitric oxide in a separate
   lumen (e.g., NO lumen 404) than the at least one lumen 406 that can deliver oxygen (e.g., from
   oxygen/air supply 405) and/or that can trigger the delivery device (e.g., delivery device 403).
   The NO lumen can carry therapeutic gas comprising NO from NO delivery device 403 to the
   patient (e.g., at cannula nosepiece 402). The two lumens can be aggregated into a single
10 cannula nosepiece (e.g., cannula nosepiece 402) that can have separate flow paths for each
   lumen.
   [00151]         In exemplary embodiments, the lumen (e.g., of the dual-lumen cannula) that
   carries the nitric-oxide containing gas can have a substantially small inner diameter that may
   be smaller than the other lumen(s) (e.g., the triggering lumen, oxygen lumen, etc.). In at least
15 these embodiments, having a substantially small inner diameter for the lumen that carries NO
   the cannula can reduce dilution by at least the following mechanisms: (i) minimizing mixing of
   oxygen and NO because of a reduction in retrograde flow into the small ID NO carrying lumen
   due to the smaller ID; (ii) minimizing the bulk volume of gas mixing because the volume of
   NO gas per unit length can be reduced by having a small ID NO caring lumen; and/or (iii) the
20 small ID NO carrying lumen can produce a narrow jet of gas flow which can effectively
   minimize 02/NO mixing during NO delivery and/or can minimize 02/NO mixing during NO
   delivery until much further into the nasal cavity. Similar mechanisms for reducing dilution can
   be accomplished by reducing the ID of the lumen for NO delivery used in other multi-lumen
   cannulas described herein (e.g., tri-lumen cannulas, quad-lumen cannulas, etc.).
25 [00152]         In exemplary embodiments, the diameter of the small lumen can be minimized
   such that it can be as small as reasonably possible without producing confounding upstream
   effects on the flow delivery mechanics of the device. For example, in one or more
   embodiments, the NO lumen may have an ID in the range from about 0.01 inches to about 0.10
   inches and/or about 0.03 inches to about 0.08 inches. Further, in one or more embodiments, the
30 oxygen lumen and/or trigger lumen (e.g., dedicated trigger lumen, etc.) may have an ID in the
   range from about 0.05 inches to about 0.20 inches and/or about 0.08 inches.

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082
                                                    31
   [00153]         Referring to FIGS. 5A-5B, in exemplary embodiments, a dual-lumen cannula
   can have a first lumen 502 for oxygen delivery and a second lumen 504 for delivery of NO and
   transmitting the pressure signal for the trigger sensor of delivery device 505. In this
   configuration, first lumen 502 can carry oxygen from an oxygen conserver/concentrator 507 to
 5 the nosepiece 506 of the cannula. Second lumen 504 can deliver NO from the nitric oxide
   delivery device to the patient and/or can deliver the pressure-based triggering signal from the
   patient to trigger sensor of the nitric oxide delivery device. Both lumens can be constructed to
   connect (e.g., tee) to both nares 508/510 and thus be in unobstructed fluid communication with
   both nares 508/510.
10 [00154]         The first lumen for carrying oxygen can be constructed with a lumen inner
   diameter geometry consistent with industry norms. For example, a nasal cannulas with rated 6
   LPM oxygen delivery capacity can have an oxygen lumen inner diameter of approximately
   0.08 inches at, or near, the nosepiece. Accordingly, in one or more embodiments, the oxygen
   lumen can have an inner diameter in the range of about 0.05 inches to about 0.20 inches and/or
15 about 0.08 inches.
   [00155]         The second lumen for carrying NO and triggering can be constructed based on
   compromise of competing metrics (e.g., as discussed above). For example, because the second
   lumen combines carrying NO and triggering, the optimal geometry (e.g., shape, size, etc.) of
   the second lumen can require compromise between at least some competing metrics to, for
20 example, deliver pulses and/or flows of NO early in the inspiratory phase, reduce pneumatic
   delays, reduce distortion of flow waveforms, reduce delay and/or distortion of pressure signals,
   reduce the volume of NO mixing at the nosepiece, and/or NO oxidation at the nosepiece.
   Considering at least the competing metrics for optimization, in at least some embodiments, the
   geometry of the combined NO/Trigger lumen of the dual-lumen cannula can be in the range of
25 about 0.08 inches. In exemplary embodiments, the internal diameter of the second lumen can
   be dictated by volumetric dosing accuracy considerations, the second lumen can have an ID in
   the range of about 0.01 inches to about 0.10 inches, and/or the second lumen can have an ID in
   the range of about 0.01 inches to about 0.06 inches with upstream tubing that can be adjusted
   to optimize (e.g., widened, etc.) the band pass performance of the system.
30 [00156]         In exemplary embodiments, a dual-lumen cannula can have a first lumen for
   NO delivery and a second lumen for delivery of 02 and transmitting the pressure signal for the
   trigger sensor of delivery device. In this configuration the NO lumen can be substantially small

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   32
   (e.g., having similar dimensions to the NO lumen described below in a tri-lumen cannula)
   and/or the combined 02 and triggering lumen can have an inner diameter in the range of about
   0.07 inches to about 0.14 inches and/or about 0.03 inches to about 0.08 inches at the nosepiece.
   In exemplary embodiments, a dual-lumen cannula can have a first lumen for NO and 02
 5 delivery and a second lumen for transmitting the pressure signal for the trigger sensor of
   delivery device. In this configuration, the first lumen for NO and 02 delivery can utilize
   similar techniques for delivering NO and 02 in the same lumen, for example, as described
   herein with reference to a mono-lumen cannula.
   TRI-LUMEN CANNULA
10 [00157]         Referring to FIGS. 6A-7, in exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula can
   have at least three lumens (i.e. a tri-lumen cannula 600): one lumen that can deliver nitric oxide
   in a lumen (e.g., NO lumen 604), for example, from a delivery device (e.g., delivery device
   603); another lumen that can be for triggering (e.g., triggering lumen 606), for example, the
   delivery device (e.g., delivery device 603); and another lumen that can deliver 02 in a lumen
15 (e.g., 02 lumen 608), for example, from an 02/air source (e.g., conserver and/or concentrator
   605). The three lumens can be aggregated into a single cannula nosepiece (e.g., cannula
   nosepiece 602) that can have separate flow paths for each lumen and/or at least one lumen.
   [00158]         The NO lumen can be a dedicated lumen that can carry therapeutic gas
   comprising NO from NO delivery device 603 to the patient (e.g., via nares 610/612 at cannula
20 nosepiece 602). The oxygen lumen can be a dedicated lumen that can carry an oxygen
   enriched gas (e.g., such as oxygen-enriched air, substantially pure oxygen, etc.) from an
   oxygen source to the patient (e.g., via nares 610/612 at cannula nosepiece 602). The oxygen
   source can be an oxygen pulsing device (e.g., such as an oxygen conserver) and/or a constant
   flow oxygen device (e.g., such as an oxygen concentrator) and/or can be a port on the NO
25 delivery device that delivers the oxygen-enriched gas. The trigger lumen can be a dedicated
   lumen that allows propagation of triggering signals from the patient to NO delivery device 603.
   [00159]         In exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula can connect the oxygen lumen to
   an oxygen source (e.g., an oxygen pulsing device, an oxygen conserver, a constant flow
   oxygen device, oxygen concentrator, etc.) and/or the nasal cannula may not connect the oxygen
30 lumen to an oxygen source (e.g., for patients who are not receiving supplemental oxygen). For
   patients who are not receiving supplemental oxygen, the oxygen lumen may be removed and/or
   may be partially removed. For example, the oxygen lumen may be partially preserved to

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082

   support the oxygen side of the cannula which goes around the patient's head while the lumen
   portion providing the connection to an oxygen source (e.g., an oxygen pigtail off of the
   reducer) may be removed. Removal and/or partial removal of the oxygen lumen can similarly
   be done for other multi-lumen cannulas described herein (e.g., dual-lumen cannulas, quad
 5 lumen cannulas, etc.).
   [00160]          Referring to FIGS. 6C and 7, an exemplary cannula can include three lumens at
   the nosepiece (e.g., nose bridge fitting, etc.) and/or the pneumatic paths and/or lumina can be
   separated by partitions and/or diaphragms that may be within the nosepiece and/or nares of the
   cannula. The NO supply can traverse the nosepiece through a lower gas resistance source to
10 higher resistance orifices that can be included into the nares of the cannula. In exemplary
   embodiments, each lumen may be separated by a diaphragm partition within the nosepiece of
   the cannula and/or within the nares of the cannula to prevent mixing of the fluid streams in the
   separate lumens.
   [00161]          The three lumens can be extruded through a single die producing a multi-lumen
15 tube, can be extruded in a single multicavity extrusion, can be extruded separately and affixed
   together in a paratube arrangement disclosed herein, and/or using any other reasonable
   technique. Similar techniques can be used for other multi-lumen cannulas described herein
   (e.g., dual-lumen cannulas, quad-lumen cannulas, etc.).
   [00162]          Referring to FIG. 7, in exemplary embodiments, the NO delivery lumen/tube
20 604 can decrease in inner diameter (ID) at least once when just about to, and/or just after,
   entering the nasal cannula nosepiece 602. Accordingly, in one or more embodiments, the
   pneumatic resistance may be greater in the nares of the nasal cannula than in the tubing
   carrying the NO from the NO delivery device to the cannula nosepiece. In exemplary
   embodiments, the smaller ID tubing of the dedicated NO delivery lumen can allow for
25 advantages such as, but not limited to:
       e    Short gas transit times;
       e Reduced inspiratory/expiratory phase retrograde flow of ambient air into the lumen
            (e.g., reduced according to Knudsen diffusion which states that diffusion rate is
           proportionate to the mean free path length of the gas molecule which can be reduced
30         with smaller ID);

     WO 2014/089188                                                              PCT/US2013/073082
                                                      34
        e  Increased gas resistance to flow (e.g., smaller ID tubing produces gas flow resistance
           which can be inversely proportional to the fourth power of tubing radius by Poiseuille's
           Law); and
        e  Reduced volume in the tee'd loop of the NO delivery lumen.
 5 [00163]         The above can reduce the potential for retrograde flow, reduce the volume of
   retrograde flow, and/or reduce the contact and/or contact duration between NO and other
   gasses including oxygen in the cannula, to name a few. This in turn can reduce the dilution of
   NO and/or thereby increase the precision of the delivered NO dose. Accordingly, in exemplary
   embodiments, the ID of the NO lumen can be about 0.01 inches to about 0.10 inches and/or
10 about 0.07 inches.
   [00164]         The ID of the NO lumen can decrease from a maximum ID to a minimum ID,
   for example, to at least reduce cross flow and/or increase patient comfort. In exemplary
   embodiments, the ratio of the minimum ID to the maximum ID of the NO lumen can be, but is
   not limited to, 1:1, 1:1.2, 1:1.3, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, 1:3.5, 1:4, 1:4.5, 1:5, 1:5.5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8,
15  1:9, and/or 1:10, to name a few. Similar ratios of the minimum ID to the maximum ID of the
   NO lumen can be used for other multi-lumen cannulas (e.g., dual-lumen, tri-lumen, quad
   lumen cannula, etc.) described herein that can have dedicated lumens for NO delivery and/or
   combined NO delivery and triggering lumens.
   [00165]         The trigger lumen ID can be comparatively much larger than the NO lumen ID.
20 The trigger lumen ID can be substantially larger so that trigger pressure drop on inhalation can
   be transmitted through this cannula lumen with the smallest possible loss of signal magnitude
   and/or phase delay to the NO delivery device which in turn can use this pressure signal to
   deliver pulsed NO. Accordingly, in exemplary embodiments, the ID of the trigger lumen can
   be about 0.05 inches to about 0.20 inches and/or about 0.08 inches. In exemplary
25 embodiments, the ratio of the ID of the NO lumen to the ID of trigger lumen can be, but is not
   limited to, 1:1, 1:1.2, 1:1.3, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, 1:3.5, 1:4, 1:4.5, 1:5, 1:5.5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9,
    1:10, 1:12, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, and/or 1:30, to name a few.
   [00166]         The oxygen lumen can also be larger than the NO lumen, for example, to
   minimize oxygen flow resistance and/or to reduce gas flow speed at the nares which can serve
30 to interfere with the triggering pressure signal due to gas flow effects (e.g., such as from
   Bernoulli's principle) and/or to reduce high frequency (e.g., auditory range) resonance with

   high speed oxygen transit to reduce the "noise" associated with oxygen delivery. Accordingly,
   in exemplary embodiments, the ID of the oxygen lumen can be about 0.05 inches to about 0.20
   inches and/or about 0.08 inches. In exemplary embodiments, the ratio of the ID of the NO
   lumen to the ID of the oxygen lumen can be, but is not limited to, 1:1, 1:1.2, 1:1.3, 1:1.5, 1:2,
 5  1:2.5, 1:3, 1:3.5, 1:4, 1:4.5, 1:5, 1:5.5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:12, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, and/or
    1:30, to name a few.
   QUAD-LUMEN CANNULA
   [00167]          Referring to FIGS. 8A-8D, in exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula can
   have at least four lumens (i.e. a quad-lumen cannula 800): two lumens that can deliver nitric
10 oxide in a lumen (e.g., NO lumen 804A and 804B), for example, from a delivery device (e.g.,
   delivery device 803); another lumen that can be for triggering (e.g., triggering lumen 806), for
   example, the delivery device (e.g., delivery device 803); and another lumen that can deliver 02
   in a lumen (e.g., 02 lumen 808), for example, from an 02/air source (e.g., conserver and/or
   concentrator 805). The four lumens can be aggregated into a single cannula nosepiece (e.g.,
15 cannula nosepiece 802) that can have separate flow paths for each lumen and/or at least one
   lumen.
   [00168]          In exemplary embodiments, like the pneumatic configurations discussed above,
   this configuration can separate the pneumatic paths of the NO, oxygen, and trigger. Further, in
   exemplary embodiments, the NO flow delivery paths to each nostril can be kept separate and
20 distinct and/or have their own pneumatic delivery source at the NO delivery device.
   [00169]          Referring to FIG. 8D, an exemplary quad-lumen cannula having the above
   configuration can be constructed at the cannula nosepiece wherein the quad-lumen cannula can
   fuse the lumen of the cannula into a single umbilical between the cannula nosepiece and the
   device, for example, as may be similarly done with the tri-lumen cannula. Similar to the tri
25 lumen cannula (e.g., as described referring to at least FIG. 7), NO delivery lumen/tube 804A
   and 804B can decrease in inner diameter (ID) at least once when just about to, and/or just after,
   the tubing enters the nasal cannula nosepiece 802. Accordingly, in one or more embodiments,
   the pneumatic resistance may be greater in the nares of the nasal cannula than in the tubing
   carrying the NO from the NO delivery device to the cannula nosepiece.
30 [00170]          In exemplary embodiments, the dimensions of the triggering lumen 806, oxygen
   lumen 808, NO lumens 804A and 804B can be similar to the respective lumens in the tri-lumen

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082
                                                    36
   cannula and/or the geometry of these lumens can provide similar benefits as those described
   above with respect to the tri-lumen cannula.
   [00171]         Further to the above benefits, the quad-lumen cannula configuration can,
   amongst other things, prevent movement of gas through the connected (e.g., tee'd) delivery
 5 loop of the NO supply line during exhalation. This can reduce NO/oxygen contact and/or
   reduce or substantially eliminate cross flow. In at least some instances, use of the quad-lumen
   cannula can require dedicated pneumatic circuitry for each NO lumen.
   [00172]         In exemplary embodiments, the quad lumen cannula configuration can include
   two triggering lumens (e.g., one two each nostril) as well as an NO delivery lumen and an 02
10 delivery lumen. Of course other configurations are within the scope of the invention.
   CHECK VALVES AND VALVES
   [00173]         In one or more embodiments, a nasal cannula (e.g., single lumen cannula, multi
   lumen cannula, any of the nasal cannulas disclosed herein, etc.) can include one or more check
   valves that can be located in, and/or in fluid communication with, the nitric oxide delivery line.
15 Further, in exemplary embodiments, one or more check valves located in, and/or in fluid
   communication with, the nitric oxide delivery line can be combined with any of the multi
   lumen configurations described. Check valves can be used to, amongst other things, prevent
   retrograde gas movement into the NO supply lumen during inhalation/exhalation. Check valves
   can be any low cracking pressure check valve which can be placed at some point in, and/or in
20 fluid communication with, the NO delivery path. Such check valves can include, but are not
   limited to, duckbill valves, umbrella valves, and/or any other valve.
   [00174]         Referring to FIG. 9A, exemplary duck bill valve 902 and/or referring to FIGS.
   9B-9C exemplary umbrella valves 904 are illustratively depicted that can be used in
   accordance with nasal cannulas of the present invention. These check valves can be miniature
25 check valves, for example, so they can have the dimensions to fit in the NO delivery lumen
   and/or be in fluid communication with the NO delivery lumen and/or they may be constructed
   out of the lumen itself by appropriately shaping and/or slitting the lumen outlet during the
   molding and/or manufacturing process.
   [00175]         Referring to FIG. 10, in one or more embodiments, the NO delivery cannula
30 and/or lumen can have a small flapper and/or umbrella check valve 1000 that can be located at
   the cannula nosepiece 1002 and/or that can allow pulses of NO to be delivered to the general

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   37
   nose/mouth area during device NO pulsing. This configuration can allow NO to flow into
   either and/or both open nares upon inhalation and/or can restrict retrograde flow into the NO
   lumen (e.g., during exhalation). The 02 and/or trigger lumen can be combined or kept separate
   from the NO lumen, for example, to reduce any adverse signal-to-noise ratio impact on the
 5 performance of the trigger lumen due to oxygen flow. Such a configuration with the flapper
   valve can prevent retrograde flow of oxygen into the NO delivery path thereby reducing the
   potential for dilution of the dose. A diaphragm and/or other barrier can separate the NO
   delivery line from the 02/trigger line at the cannula nosepiece, for example, to prevent mixing.
   [00176]         In one or more embodiments, the nasal cannula can incorporate an impermeable
10 and/or semi-permeable membrane that can be movable or fixed and/or can be actively or
   passively moved when needed. Further, the membrane can separate the NO containing gas or
   material from the 02 containing gas or material, for example, until the NO needs to be
   delivered to the patient. This membrane can reduce the contact time, surface area, and/or
   diffusion rate between the NO and 02 containing gases. This can reduce the formation of N02,
15 which can dilute the intended NO delivery concentration.
   [00177]         Referring to FIG. 11 A, in one or more embodiments of the invention, a
   normally-closed valve 1100 (e.g., a duck bill valve, flap valve, pressure valve, etc.) at the
   substantially at, and/or near, the end of the NO containing cannula, NO lumen, and/or
   nosepiece of the cannula can prevent air from contacting the NO containing gas inside the
20 cannula, for example, until the valve opening may be triggered (e.g. by a drop in pressure
   caused by inhalation by the patient or by the positive pressure caused by the delivery device as
   it attempts to deliver the NO containing gas to the patient). When the valve opening is
   triggered, the NO can then be delivered to the patient.
   [00178]         In one or more embodiments, a system can be used and/or provided to expel the
25 gas or other NO containing material that come in contact with 02 containing gas or material,
   which can have otherwise formed N02 in this mixture. The system can subsequently allow
   another part of the NO containing gas or material that has minimal or no N02 to be delivered
   to the patient.
   [00179]         Referring to FIG. 1 IB, in one or more embodiments of the invention, the system
30 and/or nasal cannulas can include and/or be in fluid communication with an electromechanical
   valve system 1104 that can actuate, for example, to pump out a fixed or adjustable amount of

     WO 2014/089188                                                           PCT/US2013/073082
                                                     38
   gas mixture that might contain N02 through a separate orifice than the cannula opening to the
   patient. The system can then actuate to pump the NO containing gas or material to the patient.
   [00180]          It will be understood that the any of above teachings (e.g., check valves, check
   valve configurations, membranes, valves, electromechanical valve systems, etc.) can be
 5 combined with any of the other pneumatic configurations, cannula configurations, and/or
   teachings and/or embodiments described herein. For example, the above teachings (e.g., check
   valve configurations, etc.) can be used with the mono-lumen cannulas or multi-lumen cannulas
   described herein and/or any other teachings and/or embodiments described herein.
   MINIMIZING NO/02 CONTACT DURING CONNECTION TO SO URCE
10 [00181]          One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to nasal cannulas
   and/or systems that reduce NO/02 contact during the connection of the high pressure source
   (e.g., a pressurized cylinder, etc.) to the delivery device (e.g., one or more of the above sources
   of oxygen/NO contact) and thereby dilution of the intended NO dose using a three way valve.
   For example, nasal cannulas and/or systems of the present invention can include a three way
15 valve with one port to ambient that can be configured so that the three way valve opens to
   ambient upon connection of the canister to remove (e.g., blow off) the oxygen.
   PROPORTIONAL NOSTRIL DELIVERY
   [00182]          Referring to FIGS. 12-13, one or more embodiments of the present invention
   relate to nasal cannulas and/or systems that address the problem of drug loss (e.g., to the
20 ambient environment) when delivering a gaseous drug (e.g., in the form of pulsed nitric oxide,
   etc.) through a nasal cannula due to at least a partially occluded nasal passage (e.g., as shown
   in FIG. 12). By way of example of such a problem, if one side of the nose (e.g., nose 1201) is
   occluded (e.g., occlusion 1203) and the drug is being delivered to both sides of the nose
   through a cannula/delivery system 1200 which does not discriminate how much of the drug
25 goes to either nostril (e.g., nostrils 1205), then there can be drug loss due to the occluded
   nostril. In addition, there may be other undesired consequences such as the reaction of the
   unused therapy gas with other materials and/or compounds that may come in contact with the
   gas.
   [00183]          This inadequate dosing can be a particular problem when delivering the drug
30 therapy in set limited quantities, such as when pulsed (e.g., when delivered synchronous to a
   patient's breathing pattern and rhythm) through a single lumen exiting the delivery device that
   in turn may then be split at some point downstream before reaching the patient. Further, this

     WO 2014/089188                                                           PCT/US2013/073082
                                                    39
   can be a particular problem because, when pulsing the drug dose through a single lumen that is
   then split, the dose can be equally or substantially equally split in the two streams without
   consideration for the blockage in the nose downstream of the split. Thus a significant part (e.g.,
   up to half) of the dose may not be delivered to the patient and/or may remain in the vicinity of
 5 the blocked or obstructed nares.
   [00184]          One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to nasal cannulas
   and/or systems that solves or minimize the above problem by, for example, providing for the
   roughly proportional delivery of the therapy to each nares with the delivery being proportional
   to the flow of air and gas in the nares and/or inversely proportional to the resistance in the
10 nares. This can be achieved by using the driving force of the patient's breathing, which can be
   generally and roughly proportional to the flow rate of air/gas into each of the nares, to
   proportionally split and/or pull the therapy gas into the patient's nose and subsequently into the
   patient's lungs. This system can deliver the dose to a patient in such a way as to ensure that the
   designed, set, or adequate dose can be delivered proportional to the flow of air in each nostril
15 (or inversely proportional to the resistance of each nostril) such that the partial or full blockage
   (whether permanent or transient) of either or both nostril doesn't affect the amount of drug
   delivered to the patient.
   [00185]         For example, the cannula/lumen can be designed to deliver a desired quantity of
   the therapeutic gas such that the delivered dose can be injected and/or delivered into a flowing
20 stream of inspiratory air, driven by the patient's breathing, with such flow splitting,
   downstream of the point of delivery of the drug, proportional to the amount of air going into
   each nostril or simply delivered to one onestril if the other nostril's flow is below a
   predetermined threshold such that the delivered drug can also be split proportional and/or
   roughly proportional or directed to one or the other nostril in an all or none configuration based
25 on the higher flowing nostril to the said flow of gas. The flow of air in a stream to the patient
   can be achieved by having a flow path from the ambient air (e.g. through a simple hole in the
   nose piece of the cannula) to each nostril such that this flow path crosses the delivery
   point/area/volume of the drug before moving on to the split point leading to each nostril.
   [00186]         In exemplary embodiments, exemplary cannula/lumen configurations can allow
30 the NO delivery to each nostril by injecting NO into a flow of ambient air going to each nostril
   (e.g., as shown in FIG. 13) and/or configurations can allow a beneficial cross flow between the
   two nares that can be designed and/or used to help guide NO to the unclogged nostril (e.g., as

     WO 2014/089188                                                             PCT/US2013/073082
                                                     40
   shown in FIG. 12). The delivery cannula/lumen can be designed to ensure the therapeutic gas
   cannot be entrained or streamed out of the path of flow of air into the patient. The delivery
   cannula/lumen and the flow path of inspiratory air to the patient can be designed to ensure that
   the delivery of the drug into the stream of air cannot be hampered or accelerated by creation of
 5 backpressure or partial lower pressure or other disruptive flow patterns at the point of injection
   of the drug into the ambient stream of air. The delivery cannula/lumen, the flow path of
   inspiratory air, the split of the air flow into the nostrils, and the individual lumen pieces in the
   nares can be designed to ensure that there can be adequate flow of air versus other sources of
   air or oxygen to the patient such that the drug can be entrained and carried into the nares
10 proportional or substantially proportional to the flow of air in the nostrils.
   INDEPENDENT NOSTRIL DELIVERY
   [00187]          One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to nasal cannulas
   and/or systems that address the problem of inadequate dosing due to a partially or completely
   blocked nostril by, for example, detecting and/or determining the amount of driving force in
15 each nostril and adjusting the amount of drug delivered to each of the nares. This can be
   accomplished by using valves, baffles, flaps, and/or any other device to ensure proportional
   and/or substantially proportional dosing in each nostril.
   [00188]          Addressing at least the above, dual channel systems (e.g., that may work with
   multi-lumen cannulas such as quad-lumen cannulas) can utilize at least two independent flow
20 channels: one to each nostril. In exemplary embodiments, these independent flow channels can
   have drug flows tailored to the inspiratory draw of each nostril, for example, by configuring
   the flow channels to deliver flow proportional to the draw of each nostril with total flow to
   both nostrils summing to the appropriate dose and/or by configuring the flow channels to
   deliver to the single working (e.g., high flow draw nostril) if the flow draw of the occluded
25 nostril falls below a preset threshold.
   [00189]          Referring to FIGS. 14A-14B, in order to implement such a dual channel system,
   it may be necessary to have two independent flow delivery channels coupled by a single
   (global) controller module (e.g., a control module associated with a delivery device, etc.). Each
   of these delivery channels can require a pressure and/or flow signal from the particular nostril
30 of interest as well as the ability to deliver the gas to the nostril. By way of example, as
   illustrated in FIG. 14A, cannula 1400 can have separate sensing lumens 1402 and delivering
   lumens 1404 for each nostril (e.g., a dual lumen cannula, tri-lumen cannula, quad-lumen

     WO 2014/089188                                                        PCT/US2013/073082
                                                  41
   cannula, etc.). By way of another example, as illustrated in FIG. 14B, cannula 1410 can have
   combined sensing and delivering lumens 1412 for each nostril in which the triggering or breath
   detection signal can be determined and/or detected and drug delivered through the same lumen
   of the cannula (e.g., a single lumen cannula, dual-lumen cannula, etc.) as illustrated in FIG.
 5  14B.
   [00190]         Referring to FIG. 15, in exemplary embodiments, pneumatics systems 1500
   (e.g., the delivery device) for the cannula may need to be implemented in order to support the
   above configurations of lumens (e.g., as described above) and/or may require configurations
   having (1) a pressure sensor(s) 1502 and/or integral flow sensor(s) 1504 which can monitor
10 each channel independently or in pneumatic isolation and/or (2) a flow delivery mechanism(s)
   which might have software controlled (on-off type) solenoid valve(s) and/or software
   controlled proportional solenoid valve(s) 1506. Configurations using a pressure and/or flow
   sensor(s) can include a dedicated pressure and/or flow sensor for each delivery channel and/or
   a valve switched pressure and/or flow sensor(s) which can alternate between delivery channels
15 and/or determine and/or detect pressure and/or flow readings for each channel in isolation.
   Pressure and/or flow can be measured (e.g., using pressure sensor(s) 1502, integral flow
   sensor(s) 1504, etc.) independently and/or differentially using one or more sensors. Further,
   one or more valves can actuate (e.g., independent, in tandem, proportionally, etc.) to deliver
   the appropriate amount of therapeutic gas.
20 [00191]         In exemplary embodiments, the pneumatics channels can be controlled by a
   controller and/or an embedded (global) controller module that can be capable of independent
   control of both channels, for example, to ensure proper overall dosing. This controller can
   receive input from the pressure or flow sensor(s) (e.g., two separate pressure sensors, a single
   pressure sensor that can obtain the two pressure measurements in isolation, etc.) and can
25 control both solenoid valves to achieve the proper dosing regimen.
   MANUFACTURING OF MULTI-LUMEN NASAL CANNULAS
   [00192]         As described above, the individual lumen of a multi-lumen cannula can be
   separately manufactured and then affixed to each other (e.g., paratube arrangement, etc.)
   and/or the multiple lumina can be extruded through a single die producing a multi-lumen tube.
30 [00193]         According to one or more embodiments, the multi-lumen nosepiece of the
   multi-lumen cannulas described herein can be manufactured using molding techniques. For

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   42
   example, the cannula can be manufactured to have a triple lumen cannula nosepiece for
   separate oxygen, nitric oxide, and triggering lumina.
   [00194]         Referring to FIG. 16, in one or more embodiments, nosepiece 1602 for a tri
   lumen cannula can include three lumens, two lumens with inner diameters of about 0.08 inches
 5 (e.g., for oxygen lumen 1608 and/or triggering lumen 1066) and one lumen with a smaller
   inner diameter of about 0.045 inches (e.g., for nitric oxide lumen 1604). This configuration
   may not be readily molded by typical injection molding techniques, for example, as the small
   lumen may require an injector pin (of outer diameter about 0.045 inches) which may be too
   small to be robust (e.g., able to withstand substantially large numbers of shot pieces without
10 bending) in a molding tool designed to last for many uses.
   [00195]         Referring to FIG. 17, to manufacture the multi-lumen cannula nosepiece a
   mold(s) can be used that can have at least two halves (e.g., 1701 and 1702) in urethane, PVC,
   silicone, and/or other low durometer elastomer with the internals of the large lumen 1704 and
    1705) (e.g., oxygen lumen, trigger lumen, etc.) being defined by larger injector/core pins (outer
15 diameter of about 0.08 inches) and with small half lumen indents (e.g., 1706 and 1708)
   defining the outline of the small lumen (e.g., NO lumen). These two halves can then be folded
   and bonded together, preferably with a bonding technique which does not produce residue or
   flash such as RF welding and/or solvent bonding, to form a whole nosepiece.
   [00196]         In exemplary embodiments, to circumvent the injector pin limitation with the
20 small ID lumen being defined by indents in the halves, the two halves can be molded flat in
   one shot, for example, with a webbing (e.g., webbing 1709) holding the halves together and
   providing gross alignment during the folding and bonding process. The molded halves can, in
   some instances, include integral holes and mating cylindrical tabs or other complementary
   members (e.g., tab 1710 and tab mate 1712) so that the halves can be properly aligned when
25 folded together. The webbing can also be optional, for example, if appropriate complementary
   indexing members on the two halves ensure that the two portions forming the outer wall of the
   NO lumen can be properly aligned. The assembled nosepiece can allow for three lumen inputs
   and can be connected (e.g., tee'd) to each lumen input within the internals of the nosepiece
   proper. Of course the nosepiece can be constructed using any reasonable technique. By way of
30 example, a nosepiece with a substantially small NO lumen can also be constructed using liquid
   silicon rubber injection molding (e.g., a low pressure molding technique in which a more

     WO 2014/089188                                                           PCT/US2013/073082
                                                     43
   robust mold tool may be achieved), and/or using a low pressure molding technique. Further, a
   nosepiece with a substantially small NO lumen can be constructed using micromolding
   techniques known in the art which may be used for high resolution production of small parts
   including parts with small mold pins. By way of example a nosepiece with a substantially
 5 small NO lumen can be constructed using micro-molding techniques known in the art.
   [00197]          Referring to FIG. 18 a perspective view of the nare (e.g., nare 1716) of the
   multi-lumen cannula nosepiece of FIG. 17 is illustratively depicted after the two halves have
   been assembled.
   [00198]          The lumen ID can be adjusted as described above. For example, the ID of the
10 oxygen lumen can range from about 0.05 inches to about 0.20 inches, the ID of the trigger
   lumen can range from about 0.05 inches to about 0.20 inches, and the ID of the NO lumen can
   range from about 0.01 inches to about 0.10 inches. In one or more embodiments, the IDs of the
   oxygen lumen and the trigger lumen can both be in the range from about 0.07 inches to about
   0.09 inches and/or about 0.08 inches and the ID of the NO lumen can be in the range from
15 about 0.035 inches to about 0.055 inches and/or about 0.045 inches.
   [00199]          Referring to FIG. 19A-19B, within and/or before nare 1900 the small NO lumen
    1902 can exit proximal to and/or within the larger trigger lumen 1904, for example, so that any
   tip blockage of the larger trigger lumen (for which there may not be a purge capability) can be
   blown out/expelled by the function of the NO pulse. The geometry can be designed to ensure
20 that all, and/or substantially all, NO in the larger trigger lumen can reach the respiratory system
   during inspiration and/or not be left behind so that it may be swept out during exhalation.
   EXEMPLARY NASAL CANNULA
   [00200]          Referring to FIG. 20, in accordance with exemplary embodiments, a nasal
   cannula 2001 is shown that includes three separate lumina for the delivery of oxygen,
25 delivering NO, and for breath triggering. The nasal cannula can include a nosepiece 2002 for
   interfacing with the patient's nose. NO lumen 2003 and triggering lumen 2004 can carry NO to
   the patient and transmit the pressure signal, respectively. NO lumen 2003 and trigger lumen
   2004 can both be tubes (e.g., D-shaped tubes), such that their combined tubes appear as a
   single tube "paratube" 2003/2004. Paratube 2003/2004 can connect to the NO delivery device
30 by nasal cannula connection piece 2014. Nasal cannula 2001 can further include keying

      WO 2014/089188                                                             PCT/US2013/073082

   member 2010, reducer 2012, and/or oxygen connection piece 2016 discussed in greater detail
   below.
    [00201]          Referring to FIG. 21A, the "paratube" can be formed by two tubes (e.g., two D
    shaped tubes). By way of example, the D-shaped tubes can be extruded separately and/or
 5 joined in a later operation, for example, by adhering (e.g., adhesive, glue, etc.) and/or bonding
    (e.g., heating, melting, etc.) to form a single paratube which can appear to be a single tube.
   Further, the flat interface between the tube halves can be altered to have a tongue and groove
   type configuration enabling easy alignment of the tubes relative to each other for a subsequent
   bonding operation. By way of another example, the D-shaped tubes can be extruded in one
10  operation and later split at the ends (e.g., using a splicer). Further, the D-shaped tube extrusions
   can be of the same materials and/or of different materials. For example, the D-shaped NO tube
   can be constructed of oxygen resistant materials and/or the other D-shape tube can be
   constructed of PVC and/or other commonly used materials for tube construction. Paratube
   2003/2004 can connect to the NO delivery device by nasal cannula connection piece 2014.
15  [00202]          Referring to FIGS. 21B and 21C, in exemplary embodiments, the inner diameter
    of the tubes (e.g., NO lumen 2003, trigger lumen 2004, oxygen lumen 2008, combined lumens,
   etc.) and/or paratube can include geometric protrusions (e.g., nubs, ribs, etc.) and/or inserts
    (e.g., tabs, etc.) to prevent complete tube occlusion, for example, due to kinking of the tube
    and/or tube compression. This geometric protrusions can be radially spaced such that they can
20 be symmetrically and/or asymmetrically located within the tube and/or paratube.
    [00203]          Referring to FIGS. 20 and 22A-22E, nasal cannula connection piece 2014 can
   be constructed to ensure fluid communication between the patient and the device. The
   connection piece can be plugged into the device and/or can be designed such that
   unidirectional connection may be required (e.g., such that it cannot be installed backwards).
25 Further the connection piece can include additional features such as, but not limited to, a color
    stamped and/or differentially reflective area that can be used with IR sensing/detection to
   confirm insertion and/or the connection piece can include a strain relief component 2202 (e.g.,
    as shown in FIGS. 22C-22E), that may be integral to the connection piece, to prevent kinking
    of the tubing, for example, as the tubing exits the connector. Of course, other techniques can be
30 used to ensure intersection sensing/detection. Nasal cannula connection piece 2014 can include
   ribbing and/or substantially soft exteriors to aide in at least handling and removal of elements;
    strain reliefs, for example, that can be for preventing kinking. Nasal cannula connection piece

     WO 2014/089188                                                           PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   45
   2014 can be constructed to ensure that seating of the connector in its socket can be sensed or
   seen by the user; to name a few.
   [00204]         Referring to FIGS. 20 and 23, in exemplary embodiments, oxygen connection
   piece 2016 can allow for connection to external oxygen supply devices such as, but not limited
 5 to, oxygen conservers and/or concentrators. Oxygen connection piece 2016 can be designed
   with industry standard dimensions, for example, to ensure ease of use and/or connection with
   oxygen supply devices. Further, oxygen lumen 2008 can connect to an oxygen conserver or
   other oxygen delivery device by oxygen connection piece 2016.
   [00205]         Referring to FIGS. 20 and 24, the NO lumen 2003, trigger lumen 2004, and
10 oxygen lumen 2008 each can have a smaller inner and/or outer diameter by the cannula
   nosepiece 2002 than at the relative connection pieces 20<removed-date>. Accordingly, a reducer
   2012 may be used to connect portions of the nasal cannula lumina that have different
   dimensions and/or cross sectional profiles. Further, reducer 2012 may also be used to terminate
   the oxygen lumen, for example, when no oxygen pigtail is provided, when receiving ambient
15 air into the cannula and/or when the nasal cannula is not attached to an oxygen source, to name
   a few.
   [00206]         In exemplary embodiments, tubes (e.g., NO lumen 2003, trigger lumen 2004,
   oxygen lumen 2008, combined lumens, etc.) can be attached to cannula nosepiece 2002 and/or
   device connector (e.g., connection pieces 20<removed-date>) using any technique such as, but not
20 limited to, bonding, adhesives (e.g., epoxy, cyanoacrylate, etc.), solvent bonding, insert
   molding, and/or by any other technique.
   [00207]         Referring to FIG. 24, reducer 2012 can allow for a transition between, and/or
   connection between, tubes of different dimensions (e.g., different outer diameters, different
   inner diameters, etc.) so tubing, for example, closest to the patient, can be optimized for patient
25 comfort (e.g., increasing flexibility, reducing outer diameter dimensions, etc.) and/or so that
   the pneumatic performance of each lumen of the cannula can be optimized using multiple
   diameters, for example, to optimize patient comfort by minimizing the tubing diameters
   located proximal to the patients head.
   NOSEPIECE
30 [00208]         Referring to FIGS. 25A-25Q various views of various exemplary cannula
   nosepieces 2002 are illustratively depicted. FIG. 25A shows the side of cannula nosepiece
   2002 in which the oxygen lumen 2008 connects to cannula nosepiece 2002. FIG. 25B shows

     WO 2014/089188                                                        PCT/US2013/073082
                                                  46
   the two D-shaped openings for the NO lumen 2003 and the trigger lumen 2004. FIG. 25C
   shows each prong of the nasal cannula connection piece having a central lumen for NO and
   two exterior lumina for oxygen and triggering.
   [00209]         In exemplary embodiments, the cannula nosepiece and/or at least some of the
 5 cannula nosepiece and/or cannula can have a material properties (e.g., durometer, etc.) selected
   to provide the comfort while ensuring the structural and pneumatic integrity (e.g., of the
   cannula nosepiece, at least some of the cannula nosepiece, at least some of the cannula, etc.).
   For example, to provide comfort while ensuring structural and pneumatic integrity, the cannula
   nosepiece and/or at least some of the cannula nosepiece and/or cannula can have about 30 to 70
10 durometer and/or about 50 durometer (Shore A).
   [00210]         In exemplary embodiments, cannula nosepiece 2002 can include three lumens
   in a "tornado" 2515 design that can allow sufficient rigidity for the nasal nares, yet allows the
   nares to be partially compressible, for example, because the dividing lines for the oxygen
   lumen 2008 and triggering lumens 2004 can be offset (e.g., not aligned through the center of
15 the NO delivery lumen 2003). This compressibility can allow for the nasal prong to be more
   flexible and comfortable than other tri-lumen cannula prong designs.
   [00211]         In exemplary embodiments, the tornado can also encapsulate the smaller NO
   lumen 2004, the nasal nares can be designed to ensure optimal and/or a desired insertion
   distance, and/or to increase comfort the nasal cannula can be tapered from base to end and/or
20 can be arcuate (e.g., inwards towards the nasal openings). In exemplary embodiments, this
   optimal and/or desired insertion distance can be about 0.1 inches to about 0.6 inches and/or
   about 0.40 inches.
   [00212]         In exemplary embodiments, the outlet geometry of the oxygen lumen (e.g., at
   the cannula nosepiece) can be designed to reduce auditory frequency noise (e.g., about 20 hz to
25  15 khz) by, for example, tapering of the outlet of the oxygen lumen. Further, noise reduction
   can also be achieved by modification of the durometer of the oxygen carrying lumen to prevent
   auditory range oscillation and noise due to oxygen flow and/or by selecting a geometry of the
   oxygen lumen that does not generate noise (e.g., vibration, resonance, etc.).
   [00213]         Referring to FIGS. 26A-26C, cross-sectional views show various exemplary
30 configurations for nasal cannula nares. For example, FIG. 26A illustratively depicts a
   "tornado" pattern. FIGS 26B-26D illustratively depict additional configurations that can
   include at least some of the benefits disclosed for the "tornado" configuration. For example,

     WO 2014/089188                                                         PCT/US2013/073082
                                                   47
   other configurations can allow sufficient rigidity for the nasal nares and can allow the nares to
   be partially compressible and/or other configurations that can provide at least some of the
   above benefits disclosed are within the scope of this invention.
   [00214]         In exemplary embodiments, the outer diameter of the cannula nosepiece nares
 5 can be minimized to increase patient comfort. Taking into account this outer dimension, the
   dimensions of the various lumens (e.g., trigger lumen, NO lumen, 02 lumen, etc.) can be
   selected to not only be optimized (e.g., as discussed herein) but can also be limited in size to
   account for patient comfort. For example, although it may be beneficial for optimization to
   have nares with a larger outer diameter (e.g., an outer diameter of about 0.25 inches or larger),
10 the nares of the cannula may have an outer diameter of less than and/or about 0.2 inches for
   patient comfort.
   [00215]         By way of example, taking into account patient comfort as well as at least some
   and/or all of the metrics for optimization disclosed herein, a tri-lumen cannula (e.g., with a
   length of about 7 feet) can have tubing with an NO lumen having an ID of about 0.069 inches,
15 a trigger lumen having an ID of about 0.089 inches, and an 02 lumen having an ID of about
   0.089 inches with at least some of the lumens reducing at the cannula nosepiece (e.g., having a
   backplane length of about 0.59 inches) and/or reducing (e.g., reducing again) at the nares (e.g.,
   having a length of about 0.47 inches) of the cannula nosepiece. For example, at the cannula
   nosepiece the NO lumen can be reduced to an ID of about 0.049 inches, the trigger lumen can
20 have an ID of about 0.089 inches, and/or the 02 lumen can have an ID of about 0.089 inches.
   Still following the above example, at the nares of cannula nosepiece the NO lumen can be
   reduced to an ID of about 0.038 inches, the trigger lumen can be reduced to an ID of about
   0.079 inches, and/or the 02 lumen can be reduced to an ID of about 0.079 inches. Further,
   prior to the reducer and/or connection piece the NO lumen can have an ID of about 0.069
25 inches, the trigger lumen can have an ID of about 0.089 inches, and the 02 lumen can have an
   ID of about 0.132 inches.
   [00216]         By way of example, taking into account patient comfort as well as at least some
   and/or all of the metrics for optimization disclosed herein, a tri-lumen cannula (e.g., with a
   length of about 3 feet) can have tubing with an NO lumen having an ID of about 0.064 inches,
30 a trigger lumen having an ID of about 0.084 inches, and an 02 lumen having an ID of about
   0.084 inches with at least some of the lumens reducing at the cannula nosepiece (e.g., having a
   backplane length of about 0.59 inches) and/or reducing (e.g., reducing again) at the nares (e.g.,

   having a length of about 0.47 inches) of the cannula nosepiece. For example, at the cannula
   nosepiece the NO lumen can be reduced to an ID of about 0.044 inches, the trigger lumen can
   have an ID of about 0.084 inches, and/or the 02 lumen can have an ID of about 0.084 inches.
   Still following the above example, at the nares of cannula nosepiece the NO lumen can be
 5 reduced to an ID of about 0.036 inches, the trigger lumen can be reduced to an ID of about
   0.074 inches, and/or the 02 lumen can be reduced to an ID of about 0.074 inches. Further,
   prior to the reducer and/or connection piece the NO lumen can have an ID of about 0.064
   inches, the trigger lumen can have an ID of about 0.084 inches, and the 02 lumen can have an
   ID of about 0.127 inches.
10 [00217]          By way of example, taking into account patient comfort as well as at least some
   and/or all of the metrics for optimization disclosed herein, a tri-lumen cannula (e.g., with a
   length of about 15 feet) can have tubing with an NO lumen having an ID of about 0.074 inches,
   a trigger lumen having an ID of about 0.094 inches, and an 02 lumen having an ID of about

15 backplane length of about 0.59 inches) and/or reducing (e.g., reducing again) at the nares (e.g.,
   having a length of about 0.47 inches) of the cannula nosepiece. For example, at the cannula
   nosepiece the NO lumen can be reduced to an ID of about 0.054 inches, the trigger lumen can
   have an ID of about 0.094 inches, and/or the 02 lumen can have an ID of about 0.094 inches.
   Still following the above example, at the nares of cannula nosepiece the NO lumen can be
20 reduced to an ID of about 0.04 inches, the trigger lumen can be reduced to an ID of about
   0.084 inches, and/or the 02 lumen can be reduced to an ID of about 0.084 inches. Further,
   prior to the reducer and/or connection piece the NO lumen can have an ID of about 0.074

   [00219]          By way of example, taking into account patient comfort as well as at least some
   and/or all of the metrics for optimization disclosed herein, a quad-lumen cannula (e.g., with a

   TRAMPOLINE
20 [00224]         In exemplary embodiments, cannula nosepiece 2002 can include a flexible
   support bridge or "trampoline" 2517 that can cushion the nasal septum. Flexible support bridge
   2517 can provide increased patient comfort by, for example, increasing the surface area of
   contact between the cannula and the nasal septum and/or patient comfort can be increased
   because the prong bridge can be designed to deflect away from the nasal septum.
25 [00225]         In exemplary embodiments, flexible support bridge 2517 can be an element
   (e.g., free floating element) that may be supported on both ends by the prongs of the nasal
   cannula. Rather than having a patient nose (e.g., nasal septum) rest on a central bridge member
   2518 commonly found in nasal cannulas (e.g., that separates the nares of a nasal cannula; a
   hard plastic connection, sometimes curved, between the nares of a nasal cannula; etc.) flexible
30 support bridge 2517 can be an element (e.g., additional to central bridge 2518, traversing at
   least some of central bridge 2518, traversing from one nare to another nare, etc.) contacting the
   patient's septum thereby providing at least increased comfort to the patient. In exemplary

     WO 2014/089188                                                        PCT/US2013/073082
                                                  52
   embodiments, flexible support bridge 2517 can "give" and/or "bend" towards central bridge
   member 2518 when the cannula is worn. The "give" and/or "bending" of flexible support
   bridge 2517 can smooth transient forces on the nasal septum due to patient movement or
   cannula movement. The "give" and/or "bending" can also increase surface area of contact with
 5 the nasal septum, which in turn can reduce the force on the nasal septum at any one point
   thereby improving comfort (e.g., as comfort may be adversely affected by increasing point load
   on the nasal septum).
   [00226]         In exemplary embodiments, flexible support bridge 2517 can restrict the depth
   of insertion of the nasal nares, for example, as mentioned above, to an optimal and/or desired
10 insertion distance of about 0.1 inches to about 0.6 inches and/or about 0.40 inches. By way of
   example, this distance can be shorter than the nasal nares length extending from central bridge
   2518.
   [00227]         In exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula nosepiece can include a tab 2519
   between the nares (e.g., extending from central bridge 2518) that can allow the nasal cannula
15 connection piece to sit properly on the upper lip. Tab 2519 can provide an additional measure
   of patient comfort by, for example, orienting the nares so the nares point inwards towards the
   nostril openings and/or can distribute force on the upper lip over a larger surface area thereby
   improving patient comfort.
   [00228]         Referring to FIGS. 20 and 27, in exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula can
20 include a keying member 2010, described in further detail below. In exemplary embodiments,
   keying member 2010 can be a bolo and/or can be part of a bolo that can be included that can be
   used to adjust the length of the cannula section proximal to the nosepiece, for example, to
   increase patient comfort by ensuring the cannula fits around the head of the wearer.
   [00229]         In exemplary embodiments, the nasal cannula can further include ear pads that
25 can, for example, slide over and/or be built into the cannula tubing at the point where the
   cannula tubing wraps the ears to improve comfort and/or the ear pads can be foam tube
   extrusions which may have axial slits so they can slide over the cannula tubing.
   [00230]         Although this exemplary nasal cannula may be described as having certain
   components, any and all of these components may be optional, may be eliminated, and/or can
30 be combined and/or further separated. Furthermore, the nasal cannula may have any of the
   other components or materials otherwise described herein.

   CANNULA KEYING
   [00231]          During the purging and/or washout procedure that can be used to clear the nasal
   cannula of air and other gases prior to NO delivery, air/gases can be purged by flowing NO
   containing gas through the nasal cannula. However, due to the reaction of NO and the oxygen
 5 in the air, this washout procedure can produce N02. Accordingly, it can be important that the
   patient not be wearing the nasal cannula during the purging and/or washout procedure, for
   example, so that the N02 cannot be administered to the patient.
   [00232]          Referring back to FIG. 20, one or more embodiments of the present invention
   can provide a keying element 2010 on the nasal cannula. Such a keying element may be
10 affixed close to the nares of the nasal cannula, such as within 5-25 inches of the nares of the
   cannula. One or more exemplary embodiment of such a keying element can be seen referring
   to element 2010 as shown in FIG. 20. The keying element can be provided as a bolo that can
   sit on a patient's chest and/or neck when the cannula is worn by the patient.
   [00233]          Referring to FIG. 28, keying element 2010 may need to be plugged into the NO
15 delivery device 2803 with a key slot or keyhole 2804 and/or this may need to be done during
   the washout procedure. Due to the proximity of the keying device and the nares, the nares of
   the nasal cannula cannot be in the nares of the patient's nose when the keying element is
   plugged into the NO delivery device.
   [00234]          In one or more exemplary implementations of a NO delivery device with a
20 keyhole and a nasal cannula with a keying element, the NO delivery device can perform the
   following functions:
                a. The NO delivery device can prompt the patient to remove the cannula and insert
                    the keying element contained on the cannula into a keyhole in the NO delivery
                    device.
25              b. The keyhole can detect the presence of the key in the keyhole. Exemplary
                    methods for detecting the presence of the key include, but are not limited to,
                    electronic detection (e.g. light beam detector, actuated switch, IR detection,
                    magnetic detection, etc.) or mechanical detection (e.g. microswitch)
                c. The NO delivery device can ensure that the key is in the keyhole before
30                  performing the washout procedure and can be programmed to not perform the
                    maneuver if the key is not in the keyhole.

                                                   54
               d. The NO delivery device can then perform the washout procedure and inform the
                   user of the completion of the procedure.
               e. The NO delivery device can allow the user the remove the key from the keyhole
                   for initiation of NO therapy.
 5 [00235]         In exemplary embodiments, the keying element and/or key slot can be used to
   ensure that the patient is not wearing the nasal cannula during the purging and/or washout
   procedure. In exemplary embodiments, the keying element and/or key slot can be used to
   ensure authenticity of at least the cannula, expiration of at least the cannula. For example, the
   keying element and/or key slot can be used to limit the number of cannula uses and /or not
10 allow patients to re-use the cannula. For another example, in the event of a need to ensure
   patients not use the cannula, the keying element and/or key slot can be used prevent users from
   using defected cannula.

   EXAMPLES
   [00237]         Referring to FIGS. 29-30, an example of retrograde flow during inspiratory
   breath along with pulsed delivery is shown at FIG. 29 and an example of retrograde flow
25 during both inspiratory and expiratory breath is shown at FIG. 30.
   [00238]         Referring to FIGS. 31 and 32A, 32B, and 32C, the retrograde flow for various
   nasal cannula configurations was tested. Typical nasal cannulas that deliver to both nares result
   in significant retrograde flow as shown in Test 1 of FIG. 31. The nasal cannula configuration
   of Test 1 is shown in FIG. 32A. For Test 2, the interconnect between the two nares was
30 occluded to increase the distance between the nares to approximately 19 inches in the hopes
   that would eliminate the retrograde flow. The nasal cannula configuration of Test 2 is shown in
   FIG. 32B. As shown in Test 2 of FIG. 31, while the total volume of retrograde flow could be

   reduced, it was not eliminated. Further occluding the pathway with a 7 foot distance between
   the nares, as shown in FIG. 32C, had minimal further impact, as shown in Test 3 of FIG. 31.
   Surprisingly, it was found that the only way tested that completely eliminated the retrograde
   flow was when separate circuits were used for the NO delivery to each of the nares (i.e. a dual
 5 channel delivery system).

   July 19, 2013 as Appendix 1, titled "Exploratory Evaluation of Nitrogen Dioxide Formation in
   Candidate Nitric Oxide Delivery Lumena," examined the concentration of N02 anticipated to
   be present in the iNO delivery lumen of tri-lumen cannulas made of various materials.
10 Appendix 1 attached to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/856,367, filed July 19, 2013 is
   incorporated by reference herein in its entirety; to the extent it is not inconsistent with the
   present invention. The experimental technique involved the flowing of 2440 ppm nitric oxide
   (balance nitrogen) gas through multiple tubes (of three material types) arranged in parallel such
   that proximal (based on the circuit without the tubes) and distal readings of the effluent N02
15 content could be taken using a CAPs N02 bench. Parallel tubes were used to improve the
   signal-to-noise ratio (i.e. to magnify the N02 signal strength) of the data and a final
   mathematical calculation of individual tube N02 change was obtained. The flow of nitric oxide
   through the parallel tubing banks was set to equate to a residence time of 7.57 min/tube (e.g.,
   based on a 50 kg patient with dosing set to 0.003 mg/kg*hr with an iNO delivery tube of 84
20 inches length and 0.076 inches inner diameter). The "per tube" expected N02 rise for the three
   material types tested is shown in below.

   METHODS OF TREATMENT
   [00240]         The invention herein can reduce retrograde flow, ensure accurate dose delivery,
   and/or minimize N02 formation and used in conjunction with a delivery device can be used for
25 the treatment and or prevention of Pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD and/or
   Pulmonary hypertension as PAH and/or Pulmonary hypertension secondary to IPF and/or
   Pulmonary hypertension secondary to sarcoidosis.
   [00241]         For safe and effective use the disclosed cannula may be used with the disclosed
   delivery device, and the like, and/or nitric oxide. One skilled in the art will appreciate that

     WO 2014/089188                                                           PCT/US2013/073082
                                                    56
   using a cannula other than the disclosed cannula along with the disclosed delivery device, and
   the like, and/or nitric oxide may increase safety risks and/or reduce and/or eliminate effective
   use. Accordingly, the cannula of present invention may be necessary for delivering nitric oxide
   for PAH, IPF, and/or COPD.
 5 [00242]          Any of the nasal cannulas described herein can be used in nitric oxide therapy to
   treat appropriate diseases. For example, the cannulas can be for pulsed NO therapy to treat
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). For
   these diseases, the delivery of the appropriate dose amounts and appropriate dose timing may
   be very important. For COPD, the NO may need to be pulsed early in inspiration, such as the
10 first half of inspiration. If NO is, for example, not delivered in the right amount or at the right
   time, reversal of hypoxic vasoconstriction can occur, which could worsen the patient's
   condition. Furthermore, the dose amount can be very important for PAH because sudden
   discontinuation of therapy can lead to serious events such as rebound hypertension. Thus,
   significant dilution of the NO dose should be minimized for these diseases. Any of the cannula
15 materials, configurations or methods described herein can be used to minimize dilution of the
   NO dose during NO therapy.
   [00243]          In exemplary embodiments, lumens (e.g., tubes) of the cannula can carry
   backwards towards the patient and/or can be affixed to each other so as to produce a
   substantially singular element umbilical between the cannula nosepiece and the device, which
20 can provide a cross-section. It will be understood that when describing a plurality of lumens
   (e.g., two lumens, three lumens, four lumens, etc.) all of the lumens can be included in a single
   cannula.
   [00244]          In exemplary embodiments, elements of the cannula can be manufactured using
   any of the techniques disclosed herein and/or using techniques known in the art. For example,
25 cannula lumens (e.g., tubes), nosepiece, key member, connectors, reducers, any combination
   and/or further separation thereof, and/or any element of cannulas described herein can be
   manufacturing using extrusion techniques, molding techniques, and/or using any other
   manufacturing technique.
   [00245]          It will be understood that the each lumen the nasal cannula and/or collective
30 nasal cannula lumen cross-section can be any shape such as, but not limited to, to circular,
   parabolic, ellipsoidal, square, rectangular, triangular, and/or any other cross-section and/or or
   any other regular or irregular shape to minimize dose dilution. For ease, at times the geometry

   no way meant to be a limitation. When one or more cross-sectional areas are not circular, then
   the ratio of inner diameters can be the square root of the ratio of the surface areas of the two
 5 lumina sections.
   [00246]         It will be understood that any of the above can be used for pulsed and/or non
   pulsed delivery of a therapeutic gas (e.g., NO). For example, any of the above embodiments
   referencing pulsed delivery of a therapeutic gas, when applicable, can be used with non-pulsed
   delivery of a therapeutic gas, and vice versus. For ease, at times, reference may be made to
10 pulsed or non-pulsed. This is merely for ease and is in no way meant to be a limitation.
