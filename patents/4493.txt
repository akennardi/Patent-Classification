CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]                      This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/437,952,
filed December 22, 2016, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]              The present invention relates to the field of earthmoving machines. Specifically, the
present invention relates to an equalizer for a mining shovel.
[0003]              A conventional rope mining shovel includes a boom, a handle moveably coupled to
the boom, a dipper that is coupled to the handle, an equalizer that is coupled to the dipper, and
a hoist rope that is coupled to the equalizer. The hoist rope passes over a boom sheave
coupled to an end of the boom, and is reeled in and paid out by a hoist drum. The equalizer
aligns the hoist rope to be tangent to the boom sheave, reducing wear on the rope. The
equalizer is a plate fabrication, having a plurality of apertures and windows for weld access.
[0004]               During a hoist phase, the rope is reeled in by the hoist drum, lifting the dipper upward
through a bank of material and liberating the material to be dug.                 To release the material
disposed within the dipper, a dipper door is pivotally coupled to the dipper. When not latched to
the dipper, the dipper door pivots away from a bottom of the dipper, thereby freeing the material
out through a bottom of the dipper.
SUMMARY
[00051               In accordance with one construction, an equalizer for a mining machine includes an
equalizer main body that is a single cast piece, an internal chamber defined by the main body
configured to retain lubrication, and a bushing disposed within the internal chamber. The
bushing includes an opening. The equalizer further includes a pin disposed partially in the
internal chamber and extending through the opening.
[0006]               In accordance with another construction, an equalizer for a mining machine includes
an equalizer main body, an internal chamber defined by the main body, a bushing disposed
within the internal chamber, the bushing including an opening configured to receive a pin, a pin

extending through the opening, an end cap coupled to the main body, a sealing structure
coupled to the end cap and pressed against the pin, and lubrication sealed within the internal
chamber.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0014]                FIG. 1 illustrates a power shovel 10. The shovel 10 includes a mobile base 15, drive
tracks 20, a turntable 25, a revolving frame 30, a boom 35, a lower end 40 of the boom 35 (also
called a boom foot), an upper end 45 of the boom 35 (also called a boom point), tension cables
50, a gantry tension member 55, a gantry compression member 60, a sheave 65 rotatably
9827619_1 (GHMatters) P107862.AU

                                                         3
mounted on the upper end 45 of the boom 35, a dipper 70, a dipper door 75 pivotally coupled to
the dipper 70, hoist ropes 80 (one shown), a winch drum (not shown), a dipper handle 85, a
saddle block 90, a shipper shaft 95, and a transmission unit (also called a crowd drive, not
shown). The rotational structure 25 allows rotation of the upper frame 30 relative to the lower
base 15. The turntable 25 defines a rotational axis 100 of the shovel 10. The rotational axis 100
is perpendicular to a plane 105 defined by the base 15 and generally corresponds to a grade of
the ground or support surface.
[0015]               The mobile base 15 is supported by the drive tracks 20. The mobile base 15
supports the turntable 25 and the revolving frame 30. The turntable 25 is capable of 360
degrees of rotation relative to the mobile base 15. The boom 35 is pivotally connected at the
lower end 40 to the revolving frame 30. The boom 35 is held in an upwardly and outwardly
extending relation to the revolving frame 30 by the tension cables 50, which are anchored to the
gantry tension member 55 and the gantry compression member 60. The gantry compression
member 60 is mounted on the revolving frame 30.
[0016]               The dipper 70 is suspended from the boom 35 by the hoist ropes 80. The hoist ropes
80 are wrapped over the sheave 65 and are coupled to an equalizer 110, which is coupled to the
dipper 70. The hoist ropes 80 are anchored to the winch drum (not shown) of the revolving
frame 30. The winch drum is driven by at least one electric motor (not shown) that incorporates
a transmission unit (not shown). As the winch drum rotates, the hoist ropes 80 are paid out to
lower the dipper 70 or pulled in to raise the dipper 70. The dipper handle 85 is also coupled to
the dipper 70. The dipper handle 85 is slidably supported in the saddle block 90, and the saddle
block 90 is pivotally mounted to the boom 35 at the shipper shaft 95. The dipper handle 85
includes a rack and tooth formation thereon that engages a drive pinion (not shown) mounted in
the saddle block 90. The drive pinion is driven by an electric motor and transmission unit (not
shown) to extend or retract the dipper handle 85 relative to the saddle block 90.
[0017]               An electrical power source (not shown) is mounted to the revolving frame 30 to
provide power to a hoist electric motor (not shown) for driving the hoist drum, one or more crowd
electric motors (not shown) for driving the crowd transmission unit, and one or more swing
electric motors (not shown) for turning the turntable 25. Each of the crowd, hoist, and swing

                                                           4
motors is driven by its own motor controller, or is alternatively driven in response to control
signals from a controller (not shown).
[0018]               With reference to FIG. 2, the dipper 70 includes a first mating projection 115 (e.g., a
lug) and a second mating projection 120 (e.g., a lug) that each extend from a back wall 125 of
the dipper 70. The equalizer 110 is generally disposed between and is coupled to the first and
second mating projections 115, 120.
[0019]               With reference to FIGS. 2-4, the equalizer 110 includes a main body 130 that is a
single cast piece having a first end 135 and an opposite, second end 140. The cast piece does
not include apertures or holes for weld access. As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the main body
130 defines an internal chamber 145 that is open at the first end 135. The chamber 145 is
formed during the casting process. A pin 150 extends through the first end 135 and into the
open chamber 145. In the illustrated construction, the pin 150 is an induction hardened pin
having an end 155 that projects out of the main body 130 and fits into one of the first and second
mating projections 115, 120. Other constructions include different types, shapes, and sizes of
pins 150 than that illustrated.
[0020]               With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the equalizer 110 includes a bushing 160
disposed within the chamber 145. The bushing 160 includes an opening 165 to receive the pin
150, and to facilitate rotation of the pin 150 relative to the main body 130. In the illustrated
construction the bushing 160 is a standard manganese bushing, although other constructions
include different bushings. For example, in some constructions the bushing 160 is a plain
spherical bushing.
[0021]               With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the equalizer 110 includes an end cap
170 coupled to the first end 135 of the main body 130. In the illustrated construction, the end
cap 170 is a generally disc-like structure having an outer diameter that is identical or
substantially identical to an outer diameter of the first end 135 of the main body 130. However,
other constructions include different shapes and sizes than that illustrated.
[0022]               As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the end cap 170 includes an outer circumferential
surface 175 that faces away from the first end 135, and a smaller, inner circumferential surface
180 that faces toward the first end 135. In the illustrated construction, a first sealing structure
9827619_1 (GHMatters) P107862.AU

                                                         5
185 (e.g., polyurethane, etc.) is provided along the inner circumferential surface 180 within a
circumferential notch 190 in the end cap 170. When the end cap 170 is coupled to the main
body 130 (e.g., with fasteners or other structures), the first sealing structure 185 presses against
the first end 135, thereby sealing the end cap 170 to the main body 130.
[0023]               With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the end cap 170 further includes a recess
195 defined by a first circumferential surface 200 that extends transverse to both the outer
circumferential surface 175 and the inner circumferential surface 180, and a second
circumferential surface 205 that extends parallel to both the outer circumferential surface 175
and the inner circumferential surface 180. The recess 195 extends circumferentially about the
pin 150.
[0024]               With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the equalizer 110 includes a seal carrier
210 disposed at least partially within the recess 195. The seal carrier 210 includes a carrier
body 215, and a second sealing structure 220 (e.g., polyurethane, etc.) provided within a
circumferential notch 225 in the carrier body 215. The second sealing structure 220 is a piston
seal that presses against the pin 150, thereby sealing the seal carrier 210 to the pin 150. As
illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the seal carrier 210 is a floating radial seal, in that there remains a
radial gap 230 in the recess 195 between the carrier body 215 and the first circumferential
surface 200. The seal carrier 210 therefore "floats" within the recess 195, and remains sealed
against the pin 150 even if the bushing 160, for example, experiences radial wear (e.g., in some
instances up to an inch) and the pin 150 deflects radially in one direction.
[0025]               With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the end cap 170 further includes a third
sealing structure 235 (e.g., polyurethane, etc.) that is provided within a circumferential notch 240
along the second circumferential surface 205. The third sealing structure 235 is a face seal that
presses against the carrier body 215 of the seal carrier 210, thereby sealing the end cap 170 to
the seal carrier 210.
[0026]               With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the equalizer 110 includes lubrication 245
(illustrated schematically in FIG. 3 generally as a pool or collection of lubrication within at least a
portion of the internal chamber 145). In some constructions, the lubrication 245 is oil, although
other constructions include different types of lubrication (e.g., grease, etc.). The lubrication 245
9827619_1 (GHMatters) P107862.AU

                                                            6
is free to flow, for example, around and alongside the pin 150, and into spaces between the pin
150 and the bushing 160 and generally throughout the internal chamber 145.
[0027]               While only one end of the equalizer 110 is illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the equalizer
110 of the illustrated construction is symmetrical about a plane extending transverse to an axis
250 (FIG. 3) that passes through both the first and second ends 135, 140 and through the pin
150. Thus, all of the features illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 are also present at an opposite end of
the equalizer 110, such that the internal chamber 145 is an internal, central space within the
equalizer 110 that is large enough to contain lubrication 245 for lubricating bushings 160 at both
ends of the equalizer 110.
[0028]               With continued reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the first sealing structure 185, the second
sealing structure 220, and the third sealing structure 235 work in conjunction to seal the
lubrication 245 within the equalizer 110 and within the internal chamber 145. Thus, even if the
lubrication 245 flows axially past the bushing 160, the lubrication 245 will be inhibited or
prevented from escaping past the end cap 170.
[0029]                In some constructions, the lubrication 245 moves from one end of the equalizer 110
to the other, or from one location in the equalizer 110 to another, based purely on movement of
the shovel 10 itself, or upon movement of the pin 150 and the main body 130. Thus, at least in
some constructions, the equalizer 110 does not include a mechanism to generate movement of
the lubrication 245. Additionally, the lubrication 245 slows the wear of the bushing 160, the pin
150, and/or of other components and surfaces within the equalizer 110. Thus, the equalizer 110
requires less maintenance and down-time as compared with an equalizer 110 without the added
lubrication 245.
[0030]                FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate an equalizer 310 according to another construction. Similar
to the equalizer 110, the equalizer 310 includes a main body 330 that is a single cast piece
having a first end 335 and an opposite end (not shown). The main body 330 defines an internal
chamber 345 that is open at the first end 335. The internal chamber 345 is formed during the
casting process. A pin 350 extends through the first end 335 and into the open chamber 345.
The equalizer 310 also includes a bushing 360 disposed within the chamber 345. The bushing
360 includes an opening 365 to receive the pin 350, and to facilitate rotation of the pin 350
relative to the main body 330. The equalizer 310 also includes an end cap 370 coupled to the
9827619_1 (GHMatters) P107862.AU

                                                           7
first end 335 of the main body 330. The end cap 370 includes an outer circumferential surface
375 that faces away from the first end 335, and a smaller, inner circumferential surface 380 that
faces toward the first end 335. The end cap 370 further includes a recess 395 defined by a first
circumferential surface 400 that extends transverse to both the outer circumferential surface 375
and the inner circumferential surface 380, and a second circumferential surface 402 that extends
parallel to both the outer circumferential surface 375 and the inner circumferential surface 380.
The recess 395 extends circumferentially about the pin 350.
[0031]               With continued reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, the equalizer 310 includes a sealing
structure 405 disposed at least partially within the recess 395. In the illustrated construction, the
sealing structure 405 includes a corrugated, polyurethane body 410 that is coupled (e.g.,
vulcanized) at a first, radial outer end 415 (FIG. 6) to the first circumferential surface 400, and is
coupled (e.g., vulcanized) at a second, radial inner end 420 (FIG. 6) to a metal rail 425. In the
illustrated construction the metal rail 425 has a U-shaped cross-section defining a notch 430.
The notch is sized and shaped to receive a further sealing structure (e.g., polyurethane, etc. not
shown), which extends out of the notch 430 and presses against the pin 350.
[0032]               With continued reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, the equalizer 310 also includes
lubrication (not shown) disposed within the internal chamber 345 of the main body 330. In some
constructions, the lubrication is oil, although other constructions include different types of
lubrication (e.g., grease, etc.). The lubrication is free to flow alongside the pin 350, and into
spaces between the pin 350 and the bushing 360.
[0033]               With continued reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, the sealing structure 405 (and further
sealing structure) seals the lubrication within the equalizer 310 and within the internal chamber
345. Thus, even if the lubrication 445 flows axially past the bushing 360, the lubrication 445 will
be inhibited or prevented from escaping past the end cap 370.
[0034]               Similar to the equalizer 110, in the equalizer 310 all of the features illustrated in
FIGS. 5 and 6 are also present at an opposite end of the equalizer 310, such that the internal
chamber 345 is an internal, central space within the equalizer 310 that is large enough to
contain lubrication for lubricating bushings 360 at both ends of the equalizer 310.
9827619_1 (GHMatters) P107862.AU

                                                             8
[0035]                FIGS. 7-9 illustrate an equalizer 510 according to another construction. Similar to the
equalizers 110 and 310, the equalizer 510 includes a main body 530 that is a single cast piece
having a first end 535 and an opposite end (not shown). The main body 530 defines an internal
chamber 545 that is open at the first end 535. The internal chamber 545 is formed during the
casting process. A pin 550 extends through the first end 535 and into the open chamber 545.
The equalizer 510 also includes a bushing 560 disposed within the chamber 545. The bushing
560 includes an opening 565 to receive the pin 550, and to facilitate rotation of the pin 550
relative to the main body 530. The equalizer 510 also includes an end cap 570 coupled to the
first end 535 of the main body 530. The end cap 570 includes a thrust plate 574 and a radial
seal (e.g., elastomeric) 578 coupled to the thrust plate 574. In the illustrated construction, the
thrust plate 574 is formed at least partially from MoS 2 , and includes mounting apertures 582 for
insertion of screws or other fasteners to affix the thrust plate 574 to the main body 530. Other
constructions include different materials, as well as different locations for mounting apertures
582 than that illustrated. As illustrated in FIG. 8, the equalizer 510 also includes a garter spring
586 that assists in pressing the radial seal 578 against the pin 550, and an O-ring 590 that is
coupled to a radially exterior surface 594 of the thrust plate 574.
[0036]               With reference to FIG. 9, in the illustrated construction, the equalizer 510 further
includes a spacer element 598 (illustrated schematically) disposed within the internal chamber
545 at the first end 535. The spacer element 598 is disposed between the end cap 570 and the
bushing 560. The spacer element 598 may be welded in place or otherwise inserted and/or
affixed in place, such that the spacer element 598 inhibits or prevents the bushing 560 from
moving and sliding toward the radial seal 578. In the illustrated construction, the spacer element
598 is a spacer plate. In other constructions, the spacer element 598 is a snap ring, rope bead
(e.g., welded to an inside of the equalizer main body 530), or other element that inhibits or
prevents the bushing 560 from moving and sliding toward the radial seal 578.
[0037]               While various constructions of sealing structures have been described above for the
equalizers 110, 310, 510, in other constructions the equalizers 110, 310, 510 include other
sealing structures or combinations of sealing structures (e.g., O-rings, gaskets, etc.) to seal
lubrication within the equalizer 110, 310, 510.

[0038]               Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain
preferred constructions, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or
more independent aspects of the invention as described.
