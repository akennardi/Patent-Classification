   One example embodiment is a method executed by a computer system
   that reduce error of a discrete event system (DES). The method models
 5 the DES with a Petri net that has an initial marking Me that represent a
   distribution of parts of the DES. The method constructs a co-language
   marking of an initial marking MJ of the Petri net and calculates a vector
   indicating a number of tokens changed by a fault in a set of faults in a
   place of the Petri net. A marking is calculated based on the co-language
10 marking and vector. When the calculated marking is determined to be a
   co-language marking of the initial marking Mo, the Petri net is initialized
   with the marking Mo to eliminate the effect all the faults. The error of the
   DES can then be reduced by arranging the parts according to the
   calculated marking Mo.

                                BACKGROUND
10 Many practical applications       in manufacturing,     logistic and other
   industries can be considered as discrete event systems (DES) whereby
   one or more upstream events trigger some downstream events. For
   example, in a manufacturing plant, an event can be a completion of an
   assembling part, a movement of certain parts from one work cell to
15 another by an automatic guided vehicle (AGV), or a welding job by a
   robot, and etc. The productivity of the manufacturing plant depends
   heavily on the smooth transitions of these events in a predictable manner.
   However, equipment malfunctions and breakdowns are unavoidable.
   When one essential component has a breakdown, the production line may
20 be significantly affected. It is often necessary to stop the production line
   and fix the specific fault or broken event, otherwise it is difficult to
   continue due to the complexity in structure, organization, scale and
   technology of complex DESs. It is necessary to improve the robustness of
   DESs that are prone to fault occurrences.
                                          1

  Therefore, new method and systems that improve quality of the DES, i.e.,
  reduce the impact of faults on the system, is highly desirable to meet the
  demanding operational needs of complex manufacturing, logistics and
  other industries.

   marking Mo is obtained by M =M +f,8,.            When the     marking Mo is
10 determined to be a co-language marking of the initial marking M          , i.e.,
   the marking Mo has the same sequence of events with the marking M 0 ,
   the Petri net is initialized with the marking Mo to eliminate the effect all
   the faults. The error of the DES can be reduced by arranging the parts
   according to the marking M 0 .

                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Example embodiments relate to apparatus and methods that improve
   quality and reduce the impact of faults on a discrete event system (DES).
   A discrete event system is a system whose state evolution depends
   entirely on the occurrence of discrete events over time, such as "button
 5 pressed", "threshold exceeded", etc.
   Example embodiments described herein provide examples of DES as
   being a manufacturing system that contains production lines, stationary
   robots and mobile robots. Example embodiments, however, are not
   limited to manufacturing system or a particular type of industrial system.
10 Various industrial automated systems, communication systems and
   computer-based systems, such as production lines with buffers, machine
   shops,    automated      assembly    lines,   multi-robot   assembly    system,
   multiprocessor      system,    parallel   computer    architectures,   chemical
   processes,    logistics   system   etc.,   that have properties      of process
15 synchronization,      asynchronous      events, concurrent     operations,  and
   conflicts or resource sharing can all be recognized as DESs and can be
   executed as part of an example embodiment.
   A fault is an event that changes the state of a DES unexpectedly. For
   example, a robot suspends or fail to carry out its operation in a
20 manufacturing system. In a real-world system, faults are inevitable. The
   occurrence of faults changes the state of the DES and may lead to
   unexpected behavior of the DES.
   Robustness is a property of a DES, representing the ability of the DES
   that resists the impact of faults. Given a set of faults, a DES is more
                                            7

   robust, i.e., has better quality, if the probability of occurrence for a fault
   that impacts the DES is low.
   Conventional methods to achieve DES robustness are mainly based on
   observation of faults in the DES. However, in practical applications,
 5 some necessary observations for the diagnosis of certain faults are
   difficult or expensive. The cost to diagnose a fault may be higher than the
   loss caused by the fault. Therefore, the methods may not be cost effective.
   Petri nets are graphical and mathematical tools for modeling, formal
   analysis, and design of DESs. A Petri net is a bipartite directed graph
10 with places and transitions as two different types of nodes and directed
   arcs that connect the nodes of different types. A number of tokens are
   assigned in each place. The distribution of tokens in a Petri net is called
   its marking.
   In modeling of the DES with a Petri net, the tokens represent parts of
15 DES; the places represent status of the parts of the DES, such as
   "working", "idle", "queueing", "failed", etc.; the transitions represent
   events that may occur in the DES, i.e., the passage from one condition to
   another, such as end of a task, failure, repair, and etc.
   The number of tokens in a place is used to identify the number of parts
20 lying in the status denoted by that place, so the marking shows the state
   of   the   DES;     and   directed    arcs  describe   preconditions   and/or
   postconditions for the transitions.
   In a DES, a "part" may be a physical object or a portion of a physical
   object where different conditions can be defined. For example, a robot
25 may be a physical object, but within the robot, then may be to arms that
   can function separately under separate working conditions. In this case,
                                           8

   the physical object (the robot) would have 2 "parts". In another example,
   a cutter that has only one function and can be taken as one part.
   One advantage of using Petri nets is that a same Petri net model can be
   used for systematic construction of a DES, and for analysis of behavior
 5 properties and performance evaluation of the DES.
   In order to improve the robustness of the DES and solve the problems or
   difficulties  mentioned above,       example embodiments       focus on the
   behavior, i.e., the occurrence of events, rather than the states of a DES
   which rely on the observation of the DES. The DES is modelled as a Petri
10 net and the impact of potential faults on the DES is eliminated or reduced
   by tactically initializing the Petri net with an appropriate marking.
   Example embodiments include methods and systems that model the DESs
   with Petri nets and classify the faults into disturbing faults and inessential
   faults according to their impact on the transition sequences of the Petri
15 net. A fault is characterized as inessential if the fault neither enables a
   transition nor disables the same of the Petri net. Otherwise the fault is
   characterized as disturbing.
   Example embodiments identify the faults as inessential or disturbing by
   computing a value of a disabling function and a value of an enabling
20 function. The identifying of the faults is performed by solving integer
   linear programming problems (ILPPs)             instead of enumerating     all
   reachable markings, and thus uses less computer resources to execute the
   computation. The example method further reduces storage requirement in
   the respective storage devices of the computer system and speeds up
25 runtime.
                                           9

   The robustness of the DES is improved against a set of potential faults by
   designing and initializing the DES with an ideal marking. The setting of
   the ideal initial marking transforms all disturbing faults into inessential
   ones that do not impact the behavior of the DES. By arranging the parts
 5 in DES according to the ideal initial marking in the Petri net, the
   occurrence of errors in the DES is eliminated.
   Such example embodiments            provide a significant     advantage   over
   conventional solutions. For example, the robustness of the DES is greatly
   improved since none of the potential faults can make impact on the DES
10 by initializing the Petri net with the ideal initial marking. Furthermore,
   the robustness of the DES is achieved without carrying out fault
   observation that may be expensive. Moreover, less computing resources
   are consumed by formulating the complex optimization problem as an
   integer linear programming problem to solve.
15 Example embodiments include methods and systems that model, analyze
   and control the DES with a Petri net and reduce errors of the DES by
   converting disturbing faults into inessential ones so that they do not
   impact on the behavior of the system.
   In one example embodiment, the DES is modelled as a Petri net. A co
20 language marking is constructed for the initial marking of the Petri net.
   An n-dimensional vector is calculated indicating a number of tokens
   changed by a fault in a set of faults in places of the Petri net. A marking is
   obtained from the co-language marking and the n-dimensional vector.
   The obtained marking is determined to be a co-language marking of the
25 initial marking. The quality of the DES is improved by assigning the parts
   of the DES according to the obtained marking that converts all the
   potential faults into inessential faults.
                                           10

   With different initial markings, the potential faults have different impact
   on the DES. For a general situation that an ideal initial marking does not
   exist, i.e., the impact of the potential faults cannot be eliminated
   completely by designing an initial marking, example embodiments
 5 compute an optimized marking to decrease the probability of the
   occurrence of a disturbing fault, and thus reduce the impact of the faults
   on the Petri net.
   Example embodiments include methods that reduce the impact of the
   faults in a fault set on a discrete event system (DES) that is modeled by a
10 Petri net.
   In one example embodiment, a marking is computed that generates a
   minimal probability of occurrence of the faults in the set of faults. The
   impact of the faults on the DES is reduced by initializing the Petri net
   with the computed marking.
15 By the initial marking optimization, the probability of the occurrence of a
   disturbing fault is greatly decreased. The system is more robust against
   the potential faults with the optimized initial marking.
   Figure 1 shows a method 100 to improve quality of a discrete event
   system (DES) in accordance with an example embodiment.
20 Consider an example in which a computer system includes a computer
   and an electronic device that communicates with the computer via one or
   more networks. The computer includes a processor and a discrete event
   system (DES) improver. The electronic device includes a processor and a
   DES improver. The DES improver in the computer and/or the electronic
25 device executes methods to improve quality of a discrete event system
   (DES).
                                          11

   As shown in FIG. 1, block 110 states modeling of a DES as a Petri net.
   By way of example, the Petri net has places, transitions, and arcs
   therebetween. Each place contains one or more tokens. The tokens
   represent the parts of the DES. The places represent status of the parts of
 5 the DES. The transitions represent events in the DES, and the arcs
   represent preconditions and / or post conditions for the transitions. The
   Petri net has an initial marking MO that represent a status distribution of
   the parts in the DES.
   Block 120 states constructing a co-language marking M,, for the initial
10 marking MO of the Petri net.
   By way of example, a co-language marking M,, of the initial marking
    M 0 is constructed by the computer system.
   Block 130 states calculating a vector 6,,,,       with i-th entry indicating a
   number of tokens changed by a fault f in a set of faults F in i-th place of
15 the Petri net.
   By way of example, a vector      k',, is calculated by the computer system to
   indicate the maximal number of tokens changed by a fault f in a set of
   faults F.
   Block 140 states obtaining a marking MO       = M, +
20 By way of example, a marking MO is obtained by the computer system.
   The relationship between the marking MO and the co-language marking
   M,, is defined by M    = M,, + Ann
                                           12

   Block 150 states determining the marking M; is a co-language marking
   of the initial marking.
   By way of example, the marking M; is determined to be a co-language
   marking of the initial marking M, if a fault f' that causes a state change
 5     =M    - M0 does not enable a transition at the initial marking m0 .
   Block 160 states reduce error of the DES by arranging the parts of the
   DES according to the marking M; in the Petri net..
   By way of example, the Petri net is initialized, by the computer system,
   with the marking M,. With the initial making M, the faults in the set of
10 faults are turned into inessential ones that do not alter the behavior of the
   Petri net. By arranging the parts of the DES according to the marking M;,
   the robustness of the DES is then increased since all the faults in the DES
   cannot affect its behavior.
   Figure 2 shows a method to reduce impact of faults on a discrete event
15 system in accordance with an example embodiment.
   Block 210 states calculating a marking that generates a minimal
   probability of occurrence of a fault.
   By way of example, a marking M, is calculated to minimize the
   probability of the occurrence of the disturbing faults in a set of potential
20 faults F.
   Block 220 states reducing the impact of the faults on the discrete event
   system (DES) by initializing a Petri net with the marking.
                                         13

   By way of example, the Petri net is initialized with the marking Mo.
   Since the probability of the occurrence of the disturbing faults are
   minimized, the impact of the faultsf on the (DES) is reduced accordingly.
   In one example embodiment, a Petri net is taken as an integrated
 5 formalism for modeling, analysis and control of a DES. The behavior of
   the DES is defined as the set of feasible transition sequences of the Petri
   net, in other words, the language of the Petri net.
   By way of example, a Petri net system /V = (N,MO) is defined as a net
   structure N and an initial marking Mo. A net structure N = (P, T, F, W) is a
10 four-tuple, where P ={p,P      2  , ... p}   (n>0) is a non-empty finite set of
   places, and T = {tIt 2 ,,   (m >0) is a non-empty finite set of transitions
   with PnT=0.
   In what follows, V is directly said to be a Petri net for the sake of
   simplification. n and m are used to denote the numbers of places and
15 transitions in a net, respectively.
   By way of example,          Fc(PxT)u(TxP) denotes           the flow relation.
    W:(PxT)u(TxP)-+ N={O,1,2,...} is a weight function with W(x,y)>0 if
    (x,y) E F, otherwise W(x,y)=0. Let x e PuT be a transition or place, the
   preset and postset of x is defined as 'x={yePuT(y,x)eF}                    and
20  x ={y   ePuTl(x,y)EF}, respectively.
   By way of example, a marking ME N" denotes the state of a net system.
   M(p) is the number of tokens in place p at M. Transition t is enabled at
   M if Vp E' t, M(p) ;s:W(p,t),    and t is disabled otherwise.   (N,M) is used
   to denote the set of transitions that are enabled at M in a net N, or S(M)
25 in the case of no confusion regarding a net structure.
                                              14

   Only enabled transitions can fire. A marking M is reachable from the
   marking M by firing a transition t, denoted by M[t)M', if t E 8(M) and
    Vp EP, M'(p)= M(p) -W(p,t) +W(t,p) holds. If a sequence of transitions
           =  ttt ... t (t  E-T ) fires sequentially from M and the system reaches
 5 M     ,  i.e., M[tq )Mi[t, )M 2   [tk )M' , transition sequence a is said to be
   feasible at M, and M is said to be reachable from M, which is denoted
   as M[u)M' or M[g) if M' is of no interest. R(N,M) is used to represent
   the set of markings reachable from M in net N.
   By way of example, the dynamics of a Petri net is characterized by its
10 state evolutions. Matrix B          = [W(t,p) - W(p,t)] is used to describe the flow
   relation, which can be regarded as the composition of two independent
   matrices: input matrix B- and output matrix B* . Matrix B*                   = [W(t, p)]
   describes the flow relation T xP , and Matrix B-              = [W(p, t)] indicates the
   flow relation Px T. In the case that M[o)M' holds, the state evolution of
15   V  =  (N,M) should satisfy the equation in (1):
                           M'= M +(B* -B-)u= M +Bd                   (1)
   where de N", is called the firing vector of transition sequence a ET* and
   its j -th entry denotes the occurrence times of transition t in g.
   By way of example, the behavior of a Petri net is defined as the language,
20 i.e., set of feasible transition sequences that it generates.
   Definition 1 The language generated by a Petri net V = (N,MO) is a set of
   feasible transition sequences at M0 , denoted by £(N,M0 ) = {a|Mu[a)M',
   M'e R(N,M0 )}. A marking M is called a co-language marking of M0 if
                                                 15

    E(N, M)=iL(N,MO). M(N,MO)= {M          IKE(N, M) = L(N, MO)} is the set of co
   language markings of Mo.
   By way of example, given a net structure N        = (P, T, F, W), N' = (P', T', F',
    W') is a subnet of N if P' c P, T' c T, and F and W' are the restriction
 5 of F and W to P' x T respectively. A T, -included subnet is the net
    (P,T,F',W'), where T, ( T. B, is used to denote the incidence matrix B
   restricted to P x T .
   By way of example, a Petri net A=(N,MO) is said to be structurally
   bounded if for any Mo E N" , there exists an integer k E N such that
10  VM   E R(N,M),    Vp E P, M(p),<k holds. Example embodiments assume
   that all the Petri nets are structurally bounded.
   A fault is an event that changes the state of a DES unexpectedly. The
   faults in a DES are described as unobservable transitions or failures on
   the original transitions and places if the DES is modeled with a Petri nets.
15 Both of the unobservable transitions and the failures are regarded as
   unexpected changes on states of the Petri net.
   By way of example, if the state of g           evolves from M to Mf without
   firing any transition in T, a fault f occurs and M is a faulty state.
   By way of example, M is a reachable marking of Petri net PV= (N,MO).
20  f  = Mf -M   is used to denote the state change caused by fault f , i.e.,
    fE   Zn ( Z={0,±1,±2,...} ) and its i -th entry f(p,) denotes the token
   change due to    f  in the place p,. By the notions of Petri nets, the number
   of tokens in a place is non-negative. A fault f is feasbile at M, denoted
                                            16

   by M[f), at the condition that          Vp e P, M(p); O, where M[f)M                and
   Mf = M +f, otherwise f is infeasible at M .
   Figure 3 shows a graph 300 illustrating a Petri net in accordance with an
   example embodiment.
 5 By way of example, V is the Petri net shown in the graph 300 with three
   transitions and five places. The initial marking of A           is M  =(2,1,0,1,0)T.
   Marking M     = (0,3,1,2,1)' is a reachable marking from M, by firing ttt 2 .
   Suppose     that   there    are   two   faults f,    and    f 2  . Fault   f, with
    j =(0,-1,0,0,0)' is feasible at M , and after        f4 occurs, the state of N
10 reaches    Mf   =(0,2,1,2,1)"   . While    fault f 2 with f 2 =(-1,0,0,0,0)'          is
   infeasible at M due to M(p,)      = 0.
   Ideally, a transition sequence a occurring in a Petri net N!= (N,M,) is in
   its language, i.e., u EE(N,M,).        However, faults occur in the DES and
   result in unexpected behavior. For short, the impact of a fault on behavior
15 of a Petri net is denoted as impact of a fault.
   In an embodiment for example, f and f 2 are two potential faults in Petri
   net g    as shown in Figure 3 with f1 =(0,-2,0,0,0)' and f           =(0,1,0,0,    0)'.
   Both f, and f 2 are feasible at marking M=(0,3,1,2,1)T . Suppose that
   M[f,)My     and M[f 2 )M2 , i.e., Mf =(0,1,1,2,1)          and M     =(0,4,1,1,1).
20 According to the state evolution of N,           transition sequence         t tt 3
                                                                              = 2        is
   feasible at M and M,        while u is not feasible at Mf,, i.e., a is disabled
   by the occurrence of fault f. On the other hand, since the feasibility of
   no transition is impacted by the occurrence of f 2 at marking M, f 2 does
   not impact the behavior of Y.          Based on the facts above, faults can be
                                            17

   divided into two categories: inessential and disturbing with respect to the
   behavior of a system.
   Definition 2 In a Petri net A" = (N, MO), assume that fault f occurs at
   marking M e R(N,MJ) with M[f)M.          . f is said to be inessential if
 5  C(N,M)  = L(N,M,), otherwise f is disturbing.
   By way of example, in a Petri net Nr=(N,MO), the occurrence of an
   inessential fault at a reachable marking M transfers IV from state M to
   M,.. As far as the behavior of the DES is concerned only, the occurrence
   of an inessential fault does not disturb the DES. However, a disturbing
10 fault possibly alters the behavior of a system, i.e., the occurrence of a
   disturbing fault in A may generate a transition sequence that does not
   belong to its language L(N,MO) . It is significant to minimize the
   probability of the occurrence of a disturbing fault such that a system is
   disturbed as less as possible.
15 By way of example, an assumption is made that a feasible fault can occur
   at any time, but at most one fault occurs in a system. This assumption is
   reasonable due to two facts.       Firstly, two or more faults occurring
   synchronously is trivial and negligible in most cases.       Secondly, the
   occurrences of two or more faults can be regarded a composite fault in
20 terms of their consequences. For example, a composite fault f, with
      = f+ f    is taken into consideration       if faults f; and f2 occur
   simultaneously.
   To reduce the probability of the occurrence of a disturbing fault, the
   inessential faults should be identified first and a method is developed to
25 identify the same.
                                         18

   By way of example, given a Petri net A        = (N,MO), let M c R(N,Mo) be a
   reachable marking, and f be a feasible fault at M, whether or not f is
   inessential at M are determined as follows.
   By way of example, the occurrence of a disturbing fault influences the
 5 behavior of a system by two ways: enabling or disabling transitions.
   Suppose that F is a set of faults and the state of Petri net A"=(N,M)
   evolves from marking M to Mf after the occurrence of fault f E.Y,            i.e.,
   M[f)M1 .
   If there exists a transition t ET and a transition sequence a ET* Satisfying
10 M[a)M', M1 [u)M', t E(M') and t oF(M'), t is said to be disabled by f
   at M. A disabling-function is defined as A-: FxR(N,MO) -+ {0,1}, where
    A-(f,M) =1 if f disables any transition at M, otherwise A (f,M)       =  0.
   If there exists a transition t E T and a transition sequence a E T* Satisfying
   M[U)M', M1 [u)M', t o E(M') and t e E(M'), t is said to be enabled by f
15 at M. An enabling-function is defined as A*: Fx R(N,M) -+{0,1}, where
    A*(f,M) =1 if f enables any transition at M, otherwise A*(f,M)       =  0.
   Proposition 1 A fault f is inessential at marking M if and only if
    A*(f,M)=0       and A-(f,M)=O.
   By way of example, let a, e T* be a transition sequence and tE T be a
20 transition. a denotes the transition sequence that t fires sequentially after
     1,, i.e., a = o-t. Suppose that M[f)Mf .
   Proof 1: In the case that A*(f,M)      = 0, for all g, satisfying M[u-)M' and
   Mf[I)M' , $t e T such that t o E(M') and t e (M)            . That is to say,
                                           19

    vt E (m), t E(M),        which indicates that Va      Ecl(N,M),     T EIL(N,M 1 ).
   Similarly, we can have Vu EL(N,M 1 ) , u EL(N,M) if A-(f,M)=0 .
   Thus, if A*(f,M)=o        and A-(f,M)=O,         C(N,M)=      L(N,M) , i.e.,   f is
   inessential at M.
 5 Proof 2: If   f is inessential at M, L(N,M 1 )    = L(N,M). Thus, V( 1 e T* and
    t ET,  M[g 1 )M' and t E.F(M') imply M,[uj)M' and t ES(M').             Then, we
   have A*(f, M)= 0 . In the same way, we can prove that A-(f, M)= 0.
   Whether f is inessential at M can be determined by A*(f,M)                      and
    A-(f,M). For a fault f that increases or decreases tokens in places only,
10  A-(f,M) and A*(f,M) can be trivially determined.
   Proposition 2       In a Petri net N  = (N,MO), let f be a fault occurring at
   M e R(N,MO) and M[f)Mf.
           1. A (f,M)=0 if f;;O (VpEP, f(p); O);
           2. A*(f,M)=O if     fe;0  (vpcEP, f(p)(O);
15 Proof: Suppose A-(f,M) =1 with        f>0,  i.e., there is a transition t e T and a
   transition sequence ac T* such that M[i)M', Mo[a)M , t e E(M') and
    t o 8(M') . According to the state equation of N , for any transition
   sequence g that satisfies M[u)M' and M[u)M , M;               = M'+f ;M holds,
   which implies Vt EF(           , t ES(M') . No transition t and transition
20 sequence u satisfy M[u)M' , Mf[a)M' , t E- (M)                 and to S(M') . It
   contradicts the assumption that t is disabled by f                  at M   .  Thus,
    A-(f, M) = 0 if f;;O. Similarly, it can be proved that A*(f, M) = 0 if f- O.
                                           20

   Proposition 2 shows that no transition will be enabled by faults that
   decrease tokens only, and also, no transition will be disabled by faults
   that just increase tokens.
   Example embodiments consider more general cases that tokens are
 5 decreased and increased by a fault in different places simultaneously.
   Given a Petri net     N = (N,M0 ) with N   =  (P,T,F,W), for any M E R(N,M 0 ),
    al E- N" is defined with   d,(i)= min{M'(p,)|M' e R(N,M)}, ie      N=
    {1,2, ,.n}.
   Corollary 1 Given a Petri net V = (N,MO), fault f occurs at a reachable
10 marking M. A-(f,M)= 0 if and only if Vp, e P, f(p,)          - d,(i).
   Proof 1: Assume that Vp, EP, f(pi) -d(i), i.e., dM(i))-f(p,). Let M,
    M2 E R(N,M)      be two reachable markings with Mt)M2 , where t E T. For
   all p, e P , due to M 2 (p)       d (i) , M(p,) W(p,,t)+dM(i) holds, which
   indicates t EES(M,) where M,      = M, + f. Accordingly,    f does not disable t
15 at any reachable marking. Since t is arbitrary, one concludes that
    A-(f,M)=0      if Vp, e P, f(p,))-d(i).
   Proof 2: Suppose that 3M' e R(N,M),          3p EP satisfies M'(p) < -f(p). Due
   to M' E R(N,M) , there is a transition sequence                a   with M[a)M'
   necessarily. However, g is infeasible at M,        = M +f since the system will
20 not reach a marking where the number of tokens in place p is negative.
   At least one transition is disabled by     f if 3 p E P, 3M' e R(N,M) such that
   M'(p)<-f(p).        It can be concluded that A-(f,M)=0           only if Vp, eP
    f(p,)>-d     i).
                                            21

   By way of example, consider the Petri net A shown in Fig. 3. Increasing
   the token in p 2 or p, by one does not impacts N , while a fault that
   increases one token in both p 2 and p, impacts AT. To characterize a fault
   that enables a transition, the transitions that may be enabled by the fault
 5 need to be located. To simplify description, (= A(P',v) EZ is used to
   denote the mask of vector VE Zn with place set P'<c P, where 3(i) = v(i) if
    p , EP', otherwise 3(i) = 0.
   In Petri net NV=(N,M,),       that fault    f enables transition t at marking M
   can be detailed as follows:        t E T, 3a E T* such that M[f)M1 , M[U)M',
10 M[a)M', t o E(M) and t e S(M ).
   By way of example, let f be a fault with            f    = A('t,f). Assume f occurs
   at    M    instead    of   f   ,   i.e.,    M[f')M
                                                         J,
                                                               and    M [u)M
                                                                         J,    J
                                                                                  ,  then
    A('t,M )= A('t,M 1 ) , that indicates tEE(M',) if tES(MI) . Thus,                   f
   enables a transition t only if      f    = A('t,f) enables it. In other words, to
15 decide whether a fault enables a transition t or not, the places in 't have
   to be considered only.
   Proposition 3 Given a Petri net g            =  (N,MO) with N       = (P,T,F,W), let f
   be a feasible fault at marking M with A-(f,M)= 0. Fault                      f enables
   transition t at M if and only if EM' ER(N,M) such that Ep E t
20 M'(p)<B-(p,t) and A('t,M'+f);) B-(:,t).
   Proof 1: It is obvious that t is enabled by the occurrence of f .
   Proof 2: Suppose that N reaches Mf after the occurrence of f . That f
   enables t at marking M indicates 3M' ER(N,M), t o S(M') and t eE(M )
   where M'     = M' +f.   Note that t o S(M') implies 3p E' t , M'(p) < B-(p, t)
                                              22

   and t e S(M ) means A('t,M'+f))              B-(:,t) due to M'(p,)= M'(p,)+f(p,).
   Thus,     f enables t if and only if 3M' e R(N,M) such that                         Ep E t
   M'(p)<B-(p,t) and A('t,M'+f)               B-(:,t).
   By way of example, consider two faults f and f 2 in NV=(N,MO) with
 5  A('t,fl) A('t,f 2 ), where t ET. If f, enables t at marking M, there exists
   marking       M' e R(N,M)      satisfying     that    3p E t , M'(p)< W(p,t) , and
    A('t,M'+fl),          B-(:,t)   .    By     A('t,f 1)      A('t,f 2 )  ,    for   Vpe't,
   M(p)+f 2 (p))W(p,t), which indicates that              f enables t necessarily.

   By      way    of    example,       suppose      that     uE En      is   a   vector   with
10  uti)= W(p,,t)-M(p) , Vp, E' t . Let          f be a fault that occurs at M and
   M[f)M1      .  Obviously, t remains disabled at M                    if 3p , e' t such that
    f(p,) < u(i).
   In    N=(N,MO)       with N=(P,T,F,W) , for                any     (t,M)E(TxR(N,M))
   let     iM, =A('t,B(:,t)-M)        ,   U(t,M)={ti,        M' eR(N,M),toS(M')}           and

   Theorem 1 Given a Petri net V=(N,MO) with N= (P,T,F,W), let                          f be a
   feasible fault at a reachable marking M. Fault f is inessential at M if
   and only if f      -da  and Vt e T, fu^EUM(tM) such that A('t,f)u~.
   Proof 1: Suppose that f               -d     and VteT ,           u E Um(t,M) such that
20  A('t,f))tC. According to Corollary 1, f?--d                indicates A (f,M) = 0. For
   any t E T , that $u-e Um(tM) such that A('t,f)u)'                   implies that, for all
   M'e R(N,M) with t o(M') , 3pi E' t satisfies M'(p,)+f(i)<B-(p,t), i.e.,
    $M'cER(N,M)      such that 3p E't, M'(p)<B-(p,t) and A('t,M' +f)                    B-(:,t).
                                                23

   By Proposition 3, no transition is enabled by f and A*(f,M) =0. Thus,
   f is inessential due to Proposition 1.
   Proof 2: In the case that   f is inessential at  M, we have A-(f,M)      = 0 and
   A*(f,M)=0.       Since A-(f,M)=0,    f>-d      is true based on Corollary 1.
 5 Due to A*(f,M)=0 , no transition is enabled by              f . For all t e T ,
     M' e R(N,M) such that pE't, M'(p)<B-(p,t) and A('t,M' +f)               B(:,t).
   That is to say, for all u-EU,,(t,M) , A('t,f)gu- does not hold. Thus,
   f  -- d   and VtET, Eu E U,(tM) such that A('t,f)>-u.
   Based on Theorem 1, whether a fault is inessential at marking M can be
10 determined by comparing it with d            and vectors in U,,(t,M) , t eT.
   Intuitively, da    and U,(t,M) can be obtained by enumerating all the
   reachable markings. However, it is inefficient and time consuming for a
   system with large scale. In cases that enumerating all the reachable
   markings are infeasible, example embodiments compute d              and U,(t,M)
15 by an algorithm based on constructing a basic reachability graph.
   Figure 4 shows a method 400 to compute d          and U.,(t,M) in accordance
   with an example embodiment.
   By way of example, the transition set T of a Petri net is partitioned into
   explicit transition set TE and implicit transition set T.
20 Definition 3 Given a Petri net NF = (N,MO), a basis partition of T is a pair
    c   (TE, I) satisfying that T,_ T, TE= T \T 1 ; and the T, -induced subset is
   acyclic.
   By way of example, given a Petri net V = (N,MO) , a basis partition
   ;c = (TEI)    ,  a   marking    M ,   and    a   transition   t ETE  ,  the   set

    E(t,M) =a      T,* M[u)M',M'B-(:,t)} is called the set of explanations of t
   at m , and it is defined XI, (t,M)= {a e X(t, M) |1    eEY(t,M): d d}.
   Set Y,, (t,M)   ={d EN" Il E Z,, (t,M)} is the corresponding set of minimal
   explanation vectors. B-(:,t), B(:,t)) are used to denote the corresponding
 5 column of t in B- and B respectively.
   Definition 4 Given a Petri net            V=(N,M,)     and a basis partition
    ;=  (TE3,I), the basis marking set M(N,M0 ,w) is defined as follows:
   MO e M(N,MO, ) ;
   If M EM(N,M0 ,ff), then Vt eTE , IV  &Y,,    (t, M), (M' = M +B,      B(:, t))
10 M' e M(N, MO, z) .
    A marking M in M(N,M,7c) is called a basis marking of Nr with
   respect to 7c =(TEI).
   Theorem 2        Given a Petri net N  =(N,M 0 ),   a basis partition c = (TETI),
   and a marking M , it holds M eR(N,MO)<-3M6 eM(N,M,;c),3u ET, ,
15 M=Mh B, 'd.
   By only computing a subset of reachable markings, i.e., the basis
   markings, a basis reachability graph can be constructed. All reachable
   marking can be represented by a set of linear equations associated with
   basis markings.
20 In an example embodiment, d. and U,(t,M) are computed by Algorithm
    1 shown in Figure 4, in which d(i) and V(ti,t) are obtained by solving
   interger linear programming problems (ILPPs) in (2) and (3) instead of
   enumerating all the reachable markings.

   markings with |MB              and MMB,   Ez       i E1,2,.  .. ,z .
   As shown in one embodiment in Figure 4, given a Petri net N                           = (N,M)
   with N    = (P, T, F, W) and an arbitrary basis partition 7c            = (T  I),   kB is the
   set of basis markings. Suppose that there are                     z  markings in MB , ' '.
10  |AB =       ME       B, i E 11,2,...,z}. Fault      f  occurs at marking M.
   First, all entries of d       can be found by (2). Next, for each transition t1 ,
   iteration is applied to obtain U,(tiM) . The iteration is begin with
    A('tj,-dM).    Since A('tj,-dM) ;O, any fault fs; A('tj,-dm) does not enable
   any transition by Proposition 2. For any u^ satisfying V(u; ti)                =  0, t, is not
15 enabled by fault fs-u~. Obviously, 3i' EU, (t,M) such that d' >                     . Thus, u'

   is deleted and u* is added as a potential element in Um(ti,M). For any u~,
   if Ep, E't1 such that u(i) = B(i, j), t1 is not enabled by increasing tokens in
    p,. For the reason, u- is deleted from U(ti,M).
   In the case that only a single fault need to be identified, example
 5 embodiments provide an efficient approach by solving two ILPPs only.
   Figure 5 shows a method 500 to determine if a fault is inessential in
   accordance with an example embodiment.
   In one embodiment for example, let IMB=z,                     EMB, i       1,2,...,Z, be
   the z basis markings in MB for N              = (N,M) with respect to wc=(TE, I) .

   variables.
 5 As mentioned above, whether f is inessential at M can be determined by
    A*(f,M)    and A-(f,M).          If A*(f,M)=1         or A-(f,M)=1,       then the fault is
   disturbing. Otherwise, the fault is inessential. Therefore, for a bounded
   Petri net NA=(N,M)            , whether a fault f is inessential at a reachable
   marking M can be determined by Algorithm 2 shown in Fig. 5.
10 Example embodiments understand that only the occurrences of disturbing
   faults weaken the robustness of a system. By adjusting initial markings, a
   disturbing fault can be transformed into an inessential one. In ideal cases,
   all disturbing        faults    can be transformed into               inessential     ones by
   initializing the system with an appropriate marking, which is called an
15 ideal initial marking.
                                                     28

   Figure 6 shows a method 600 to compute an ideal initial marking in
   accordance with an example embodiment.
   In one embodiment for example, consider the Petri net KN=(N,M)
   shown in Figure 3 with an initial marking Mo      = (2,1,0,1,0). Suppose that
 5       IF={f,f
             2 ,f ,f }
                  3 4  is a set of potential    faults with     f=(,-1,0,0,0)         T
    f  =(0,-2,0,0,0)',  f =(0,0,-1,O0,0) and  =(0,0,1,,0)T.      The faults      f 2 , f3
   and f 4 are disturbing at any marking at which they are feasible. The
   behavior of NV is impacted by their occurrence.
   However, if Ni is initialized with marking M'      = (2,2,1,0,O)T , L(N,MO)=
10  L(N,M ) and none of the four faults is disturbing at any reachable
   marking from M' , which means the system is more robust if it is
   initialized with M' instead of Mo.
   In one embodiment for example, given a Petri net N       = (N,MO), let F be a
   set of potential faults, and S(M) denote the set of inessential faults at Mo,
15 i.e., f is inessential at Mo if f ES(M0 ), otherwise f is disturbing at Mo.
   The problem to find an ideal initial marking is formulated as to decide the
   existence of an initial marking MO e M(N,MO)           such that           c S(M'),
   where M(N,MO) is the co-language set of Mo.
   An intuitive way to solve the problem is to enumerate the markings in
20  M(N,M)       and calculate S(MO) for all M' EM(N,M)          and compare F
   with S(MO) to find a suitable marking. Unfortunately, the method is
   infeasible since a complete marking enumeration of M(N,M) and the
   computation of S(MO) are time-consuming.
                                         29

   Based on Theorem 1, for NJ            =   (N, MO), there exits S(M)     = {f I f -d    ,
    Vt e T,    -E Um(t,M 0 ) such that A('t, f)        u}.
   Proposition 4 Suppose that (N,M) and (N,M,) are two Petri nets with
   different initial markings. M -d0                  =Mi   -d   holds if M, e M(N,M)
 5 where d (i)= min{M(p,)|M'ER(N,Mj)}, iEN,, jE(0,1).
   By way of example, suppose a marking M' E R(N,MI) and M'= M, +B-.
   There exists a marking MeR(N,M)                        such that M=M0 +B-o&due to
    £(N, MO)=         (N,MI)    ,     and Mo-M            =M-M'     which    implies   that
    du0 (p)-dmI(p)= M(p)-M,(p),               VpE P. Thus, Mo - d      = Mi -d    holds.
10 By way of example, given a Petri net N                    =(N,M)   with N=(P,T,F,W),
   let d,    =N" with dM (i)=min{M'(p,)|M'e R(N,M0 )} and M,                   = M -d      .
   According to Proposition 4, VM'                  M(N,M0 ), M')MM by d 3O, where
    d,(i)= min{M(p,)|MER(N,M')}, i e Nn . The marking M. is called the
   minimal co-language marking of Mo.
15 Proposition 5       Let M, and M        2  be two co-language markings of Mo in
     V=(N,MO).     For a fault f , A*(fM          2 )=1 if A+(f,M)=1     and M1 <M 2
   Proof: Suppose that M, (M        2  and a is an arbitrary transition sequence that
   is feasible from M, . Obviously,            (T   is feasible at M 2 and M> M;, where
   Ml[o-)M and M 2 [u)M . If a transition t is enabled by fault f at marking
20 M , t is enabled by f at marking M due to M>M2. Thus, A*(f,M 2 )=1
   if A*(f,MI)=1 and M 1<M        2
                                                   30

   Theorem 3        Let F be a set of potential faults in Petri net A       = (N,MO)
   with N    = (P,T, F,W), and ,B, be a n -dimensional vector whose i -th entry
   indicates the maximal number of tokens in place p, decreased by
   potential faults, i.e.,      I.mi(i)=-min({f(p,)|f e.F}u{0})      . Suppose that
 5 M'= M. +in        , where M. is the minimal co-language marking of Mo.
   There exists a marking M' EM(N,MO) such that F ; S(M') if and only if
    F (;; S(M') and M' E M(N, MO).
   Proof 1: It is obvious in the forward direction.
   Proof 2: Suppose that there exists MO e M(N,MO) such that F _;S(M;).

   obvious that M )M'. Let         f =M'- M. and f-=M'-Mo. According to
   Proposition 2, it is obtained A-(f'*,M.)=0          and A*(f-,M )=0 due to
    f>o and f -;o . That is to say,             T eEL(N,M.)         a e E(N,M') and

   M' e M(N, MO) if M' EM(N,M)            . Based on Proposition 5,          VfE fE,

    F ; S(M'). It is concluded that 3M' e M(N, MO) such that .F _ S(M') only
   if F _;-S(M') and M' EM(N,MO).
20 According to Theorem 3, by checking M only,                 it can be determined
   whether there is an initial marking M' satisfying the conditions M' E
    M(N,M)      such that F cS(M'), where M(N,M)             is the co-language set
   of Mo.
                                           31

     In an example embodiment, given a Petri net A             = (N,Mo) and a fault set
    F, the steps to obtain an ideal initial marking are explicated as follows.
   First, calculate the minimal co-language marking M, of Mo. Let                 MB   be
   the set of basis markings of N with respect to a basis partition c = (TE,           I).
 5 Suppose that there are           z    markings in MB   ,  i.e.,      B  z , M' E MB
    i E {1,2, ,z).  For a bounded Petri net, M, 1 (p,) can be obtained by solving
   the problem in (6):
                           max        Mo(Pi) -(i
                           s.t.       i=a1M1,+a2     +... + azMb + B, ,        (6)
                                       i=1
   where      i e N", a, e {0,1} is a boolean variable, B, is the incidence matrix
10  B restricted to Px T,, 2,EN1 T        1
                                            .
   Then, check every fe F to obtain the vector                 aln ,   whose i -th entry
   indicates the maximal number of tokens that can be decreased by faults in
   place p,, i.e.,   /am, (i)= -min({f(p,)If eF} u{0}).
   Next, set the initial marking as M'= M, +,,i,          and check whether Mo is a
15 co-language marking of Mo. Let f be a fault with                  f   =M'-M.     If f'
   does not enable any transition at marking Mo , M' is a co-language
   marking of Mo.
   Finally, check each fault fEE F to determine whether f enables any
   transition at M'. Provided no fault enables any transition at M', marking
20  M' is the ideal initial marking, otherwise there is no ideal initial marking.
                                                32

   In Figure 6, the method to obtain an ideal initial marking is formulated as
   Algorithm 3. The return value NAN indicates that such an ideal initial
   marking does not exist.
   In the ideal cases, an ideal initial marking can be obtained such that all
 5 potential faults are inessential at all reachable markings. However, there
   may be no such ideal initial markings in a general case. Example
   embodiments solve the problem by optimizing the initial markings to
   minimize the probability of the occurrence of a disturbing fault for the
   cases that no ideal initial marking exists.
10 Figure 7 shows a graph 700 illustrating reachable markings in accordance
   with an example embodiment.
   In one example embodiment, consider the Petri net IV= (N,MO) shown in
   Figure 3. Suppose there are six potential faults -F= {f,f2,f3,f,ff}with
                                                                                  T
    f =(0,  1,0,0,0)            ,    , )T  , f   ( ,O_1,OO)     ,     (OO,1,OO)
15  h=(,,,1,0)' and       6 =(0,,1,-1,O)T.
   As shown in Fig. 7, in the case that A[ is initialized with MO   = (2,1,0,1,0)T'
   there are six reachable markings Me         , M,    M2 , M3,    M 4 and M5 .
   Correspondingly, if the system is initialized with M'       =(2,2,1,0,0)T , the
   reachable markings are M', M , M,, M;, M and M .
20 Figure 8 shows a table 800 illustrating feasibility of faults at different
   markings in accordance with an example embodiment.
   In Figure 8, the feasibility of each fault in 'F at different reachable
   markings is enumerated. As can be seen from Figure 8, the potential
   faults have different impact on the system with different initial markings.
25 In the case that the system is initialized with MO, f2 and f3 are disturbing
                                          33

   at all markings at which they are feasible. Whereas only f, are disturbing
   at MI', M' and M4 if the initial marking is Mo. In conclusion, the impact
   of faults varies according to the initial markings.
   Example embodiments evaluate the robustness of a DES by the
 5 probability of the occurrence of a disturbing fault. Two assumptions are
   made for the calculation of the probability of the occurrence of a
   disturbing fault.
   One assumption is: If fault f              is feasible, the probability of its
   occurrence P, is known in advance. This assumption is easy to be
10 satisfied in practical applications since the probability of occurrence of a
   fault is a common parameter of the components in a real-world system.
   The other assumption is: Let       (t,t2) e T x T be a pair of transitions, for any
   M such that t, e E(M) and      t2  e e(M),   the relative probability of firing t,
   and  t2 (the ratio of the firing probability of t, and t2) is stationary and
15 known.      This  assumption       is   a   common      setting   associated   with
   probabilistic inference.
   In one embodiment for example, 7P is used to denote the relative
   probability of firing t. Thus, at any marking M where t is enabled, the
   probability of firing  t is denoted in (7):
20                       P(t,M)=                               (7)
   Note that, in a Petri net V    =  (N,MO), the probability of the occurrence of
   a disturbing fault f is associated with the probability of markings at
                                             34

   which f is feasible. To quantify the probability of the occurrence of a
   disturbing fault, the probability of a marking M being reached is needed.
   By way of example, suppose that M ER(N,M,) is a reachable marking.
   Let Rf (N,M) g R(N,M) be a set of markings that can reach M by firing
 5 one transition, i.e., R, (N,M)    =   {M| Ee T, M't)M}. PM is used to denote the
   relative probability of M being reached when the system is initialized
   with Mo . The relative probability          'PM   can be calculated by equation (8):
                           RM  =                       -P(t,M') --P,(8

15 initial  marking      M' E M(N,M)                    such      that     VM E M(N,M)
    P(M ,.F)<;P(M,.F). That is, the probability of the occurrence of a
   distrubing fault with the optimal initial marking MO is no more than that
   with any other co-language initial markings.
   In one embodiment for example, given a set of potential faults ,F in
20  KN=(N,M 0 ), the optimal initial marking M' for V can be obtained by
   solving the ILPP problem in (10):

   Figure 9 shows a graph 900 illustrating a manufacturing system in
   accordance with an example embodiment.
 5 Example embodiments elaborate the Algorithm 3 in Figure 6 with a
   manufacturing system shown in Fig. 9.                                  The manufacturing system
   contains two production lines, three types of stationary robots modeled by
   p,    p  7   and p, , and two types of mobile robots, denoted by {p 19 ,P 20 } and
   {p2 1 ,p 22 }, respectively.
10 By way of example, the manufacturing system in Figure 9 has a
   reachability space containing 1393559 markings with initial marking
   MO =(12,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,                                    7,15,3,3,4,4)T . By basis
                                                            37

   partition (TE, TI)              where T         = {t3 ,t6 ,ti1  , t13 } ,    there are only 618 basis
   markings.
   By way of example, suppose that the mobile robots are unreliable. Three
   kinds of faults are considered.
 5 The first kind of faults is robot suspending, i.e., the token numbers in
   certain places are decreased, f =(00,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
    0,0, -1,0       ,0  ,O)T and       f   =(0,0      ,0,0,0 ,0 ,0,0 ,0,0,0 ,0,0,0 ,0,0,0,0,0,
    0 , 0 , -1)T denote one robot in p,, and p, breaking down, respectively.
    fJ=2-f2        represents that there are two robots in p22 breaking down
10 simultaneously.
   The second kind of faults taken into account is the mobile robots breaking
   in unexpectedly, i.e., the token numbers in certain places are increased.
   Let f4=(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,                                               O)T  and
    f   = (0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1,0)T
15 The third kind of faults is the case that one breaking-in robot (p 2 1 ) causes
   an obstruction and leads to two robots (p, ) to be suspended. It is denoted
   by f6=(O0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-2,0,1,0).                                          Thus, all
   potential faults are F={f, f 2 , f 3 , f 4 , f5 , f6 }
    f2,   f and f6 are disturbing at all markings where they are feasible. To
           3
20 find out whether there is an ideal initial marking, the minimal co
   language marking M. should be calculated.
   By solving equation (6), M.=(12,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,
    15,2,3,2,4)T. The maximal number of tokens that can be decreased by
                                                               38

   faults is P3, =(0,0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-2,0,0,-2).
   Then, the possible ideal initial marking is M' =(12,0,0,0, 0,0,0,2,3,12,
    0,0,0,0,0,0,7,15,4,3,2,6)T.
   Figure 10 shows a table 1000 illustrating the set Um(t,MO) in accordance
 5 with an example embodiment.
   By way of example, the set Um(t,MO) for each transition t e T at M' is
   calculated. Part of Um(tM ) are listed in Figure 10 to identify the faults of
    .F. Since Vt  ET,  iu E Um(t,M ) such that A('t,f);u, all the six faults are
   inessential at M'. Thus, M' is the ideal initial marking.
10 Figure    11  shows    a table   1100 illustrating   faults  and  occurrence
   probability in accordance with an example embodiment.
   Example embodiments illustrate the approach to obtain an optimal initial
   marking in the case that no ideal initial marking exists.
   In one embodiment for example, consider the Petri net V=(N,M)
15 shown in Fig 3. The potential faults and their occurrence probabilities are
   shown in Figure 11. Suppose that the firing probability of every feasible
   transition is equal, i.e.,   =t    = 'Ft,. The probability of Me R(N,M) to
   be reached follows the equations in (14):

   By way of example, vector d                  and set Uf(t,M0 ) are obtained by
   Algorithm 1 in Figure 4. The optimal initial marking MO                =  (2,2,1,0,0)  is
   calculated directly by solving equation (10).
 5 In one embodiment for example, the DES modelled by the Petri net in
   Figure 3 is simulated with the faults in Figure 11 to compare the
   robustness of (N,M0 ) with that of (N,M ). Ten thousand simulations for
   each DES are carried out with assumption that there are 1000 transition
   firings for each simulation.
10 By way of example, in the case that the Petri net is initialized with MO               =
    (2,1,0,1,0), 286 disturbing faults occur in the 10000 simulations with that
   the    average   number    of transition         firings    before    disturbing    fault
   occurrences is 492.
   If the initial marking is MO       =   (2,2,1,0,0),   there are 194 disturbing fault
15 occurrences in the 10000 simulations and the average number of transition
   firings before disturbing fault occurrences is 487.
                                               40

   By the initial marking optimization, the probability of the occurrence of a
   disturbing fault is decreased by 32% . Obviously, the system is more
   robust against the given faults if it is initialized with M instead of Mo.
