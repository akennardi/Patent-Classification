BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0005]           A "Lysosomal Storage Disorder" or "LSD" is a disorder in which lysosomal
function has been disrupted due to lysosomal enzymatic failure. There are approximately
fifty LSDs, and all are rare inherited diseases in which genes for lysosomal proteins have
been mutated. Individually, the frequency of each is less than 1:100,000, but collectively, the
frequency is about 1:5,000 - 1:10,000. The defective enzyme can result in the accumulation
of lipids, glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides in the lysosome. LSDs include, without
limitation, Niemann Pick Type C (NPC), Wolman, Niemann Pick Type A, Farber, Tay
Sachs, mucopolysaccharide IIIB (MSIIIB) and tripeptidyl-peptidase I (CLN2 or Batten)
diseases.
[0006]           LSDs are often fatal within a few months or years of birth. The symptoms
include developmental delay, movement disorders, abnormal bone growth, pulmonary and
cardiac problems, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, dementia, seizures, blindness and/or
deafness.
[0007]           Intracellular vesicular traffic is integral to the operation of lysosomes and
endosomes. The accumulation of undegraded substrates impacts the lysosome and endosome
function. Lysosomes are involved in a number of cellular processes: phagocytosis,
exocytosis, autophagy, immunity, receptor recycling, neurotransmission, signaling
intracellularly, bone biology and pigmentation. Disruption in any one of these processes can
have severe and usually fatal consequences (Parkinson-Lawrence, E. et al. (2010) Physiology
25:102).
[0008]           A review of the LSDs and their associated clinical phenotypes has yielded
generalizations regarding those phenotypes: 1) each disorder manifests a range of symptoms,
which depend on the impact of the genetic mutation; 2) across disorders, there can be
phenotypic similarities depending on the affected tissues and the similarity of the
accumulated substrates; and 3) there can also be symptoms that distinguish the various
disorders (Parkinson-Lawrence et al., supra).
[0009]           There is no cure for LSDs. However, there is some therapy that has thus far
demonstrated limited results in abatement of symptoms. Specifically, enzyme replacement
therapy (ERT) and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be useful in slowing
progression in certain types of LSDs (van Gelder, CM et al. (2012) Expert Opin.
Pharmacother. 13(16):2281-99). Additionally, substrate reduction therapy and small
molecule chaperones have been also proposed for the treatment of some LSDs.

[0010]          The traditional accepted function of tocopherols is lipid antioxidants. Due to
their physical characteristics and lipid solubility, tocopherols are mostly localized in
membranes acting as radical quenchers, avoiding, for example, the oxidation of unsaturated
phospholipids. The maintenance of membrane lipid composition and homeostasis is essential
for proper function, transport, and protein docking. In the food industry, tocopherols are used
to avoid oils becoming rancid.
[0011]          Ubiquinione or Q1O is a fat-soluble, electron-transporting co-enzyme found in
the electron-transport chain in mitochondria. Ubiquinone is a quinone which cyclically can
change from an oxidized to a reduced form. Tocopheryl quinones act as poor mitochondrial
decouplers, because they compete with Ubiquinione, inhibiting the transference of electrons
between complex III and complex I and complex II. Alpha tocopheryl quinone has been used
in human clinical trials for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, a mitochondrial disorder, with
positive results of improving neurological function.

symptoms in the mouse model of Niemann-Pick C," J. Appl. Genet. 45(4):461-7(2004),
describe the improvement in lifespan and motor skills in NPC 1 mice upon administration of
a-tocopherol. Narashima et al. "Niemann-Pick Cl-like 1 mediates alpha-tocopherol
transport" Mol. Pharmacol. 74(l):42-9 (2008), describe studies demonstrating that a
tocopherol is absorbed in the intestine via the Niemann-Pick Cl-like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter.

bis(trifluoromethyl)tocopherols" Chem. Pharm. Bull 43(9):1466 (1995), describe synthesis of
tocopherol analogues with a halogenated side chain or chromanol ring. Koyama et al. (1995)
were studying the spin relaxation times (T 2) on fluorine NMR as an indication of how and
where the analogues were incorporated into liposomes. Likewise, Koyama et al. "Synthesis
of fluorine analogs of vitamin E. 1111. Synthesis of 2-[4,8-dimethyl-12

discotic liquid crystal phase.
[0015]          Gille et al. "Tocopheryl quinones and mitochondria," Mol. Nutr. Food Res.

mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting Complex III. Miillebner et al. "Modulation of the
mitochondrial cytochrome bc l complex activity by chromanols and related compounds,"
Chem. Res. Toxicol. 23(1):193-202 (2010), also demonstrate that tocopheryl quinones can
inhibit mitochondrial electron transfer. Yu et al. "Altered cholesterol metabolism in
Niemann-Pick Type C1 mouse brains affects mitochondrial function," J. Biol. Chem.
280(12):11731-39 (2005), teach that when the mitochondrial membrane potential is
decreased, ATP synthesis is decreased.
[0016]           There has also been research in relation to the treatment of LSDs with
cyclodextrins. Rosenbaum et al., "Endocytosis of j-cyclodextrins is responsible for
cholesterol reduction in Niemann-Pick type C mutant cells," PNAS Early Edition
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0914309107 (2010), describe studies that demonstrate
that treatment of NPC- cells with cyclodextrin results in enhanced exocytic transport of
cholesterol to reduce cholesterol accumulation in those mutant cells. Davidson et al.
"Chronic cyclodextrin treatment of murine Niemann-Pick C disease ameliorates neuronal
cholesterol and glycosphingolipid storage and disease progression," PLoS ONE 4(9):e6951
(2009), describe chronic treatment of NPC mutant mice with cyclodextrin delayed clinical
disease onset, delayed neurodegeneration, and increased lifespan.
[0017]           Thus, there are studies that report that a-tocopherol, related compounds or
cyclodextrin can improve LSD symptoms. Nonetheless, there continues to be a clear and
urgent need for the development of further pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of LSDs.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0018]           The subject application provides novel tocopherol derivatives and tocopheryl
quinone derivatives useful in the decrease of lysosomal substrate accumulation, the
restoration of normal lysosomal size, and the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders
(LSDs) and diseases associated with, resulting from, or caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.
The novel derivatives can, in one embodiment, be metabolically stable.
[0019]           In one embodiment, the subject invention comprises a tocopheryl quinone
derivative with side chain modifications that, in some embodiments, confer improved
pharmacokinetics. These compounds, in some embodiments, can exhibit the properties set
forth herein, including, without limitation, modulation of mitochondrial potential, modulation
of intracellular calcium ion concentration and restoration of some LSDs phenotypes. Also,
the subject compounds and compositions, in a number of embodiments, can be used with
                                                  4

    WO 2014/078573                                                         PCT/US2013/070156
cyclodextrins which will improve efficacy; in some cases, such improvement may be
synergistic. The length of the aliphatic side chain is such that the compound's lipophilicity is
maintained or augmented. Halogenation at the end of the compound (at the end of the side
chain) can decrease the compound's ability to be oxidized. The side chain modification is
typically terminal tri-halogenated methyl groups.
[0020]          In another embodiment, the subject invention provides pharmaceutical
compositions comprising the tocopheryl quinone derivatives and a pharmaceutically
acceptable vehicle. The subject compound and/or compositions can be administered to
individuals having LSD, or those who are otherwise in need thereof, to reduce symptoms
related to impaired lysosomal lipid engorgement. The subject tocopheryl quinone derivatives
at the proper dose can also improve mitochondrial ATP production, thereby restoring normal
mitochondrial function.
[0021]          The subject invention also provides a tocopheryl derivative having side chain
modifications. The modifications are typically terminal tri-halogenated methyl groups.
These compounds can manifest the properties described herein including, without limitation,
improved lysosomal function, endosome-vesicle transfer and exocytosis, improved
pharmacokinetics, and, when combined with a cyclodextrin, a synergistic effect.
[0022]          In a further aspect, the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition
comprising the subject tocopherol derivatives. This composition can be administered to
individuals in need thereof, including those with LSD, for the improvement of lysosomal
function and the treatment of associated diseases including LSD.
[0023]          The compounds and compositions of the subject invention demonstrate a
number of improvements over the prior art. In particular, the compounds and compositions
can be found to reduce substrate accumulation in several LSDs relative to prior art
compounds. There can be reduced pathological changes in the ultrastructure of LSD cells
when observed with electron microscopy. They can also modulate intracellular Ca2
concentration and improve mitochondrial function.
[0024]          The compounds and compositions of the subject invention can also
demonstrate improved pharmacokinetics in biological samples and in vivo. The increased
metabolic stability in vivo can improve central nervous system (CNS) penetration and
exposure (by increasing the effective concentration of these compounds in the brain).
Additionally, the increased lipophilicity of the subject compounds can increase membrane
fluidity, thereby restoring lipid homeostasis and lysosomal size.

    WO 2014/078573                                                           PCT/US2013/070156
[0025]          Finally, it has been found that when the subject compounds are used in
combination with a cyclodextrin, the solubility of the subject compounds in aqueous mixtures
or solutions is improved. As a result, the increased solubility can improve the efficacy of
both the subject compounds and the cyclodextrin, resulting in enhanced lysosomal function.
The use of cyclodextrin in combination with the subject compounds can produce a synergic
effect. This effect in turn permits the reduction of dosage of both the subject compound and
the cyclodextrin, thereby reducing side effects in an individual to whom the mixture has been
administered. The foregoing improved properties can be detected or measured using methods
known in the art.

[0044]           A "pharmaceutical composition" means a composition comprising a
pharmaceutical agent, a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and optionally other components
such as stabilizers, preservatives, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and the like. The
"pharmaceutical agent" is the tocopheryl quinone derivative and/or the tocopherol derivative
described herein.
[0045]           The pharmaceutical compositions of the subject invention can be prepared by
known methods of combination of compounds in admixture with a pharmaceutically
acceptable vehicle. Suitable vehicles and their formulation in pharmaceutical compositions
are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (16th ed. Osol, E. ed., Mack Easton
Pa. (1980)). Essentially pure or pure pharmaceutical agents can be admixed with a
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and other components to produce a pharmaceutical
composition using current Good Manufacturing Practices.
[0046]           An "essentially purified" agent is one that is substantially free from matter that
is not of interest. With increasing preference, an essentially purified molecule is at least 80%
pure, at least 90% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 97% pure, at least 98% pure, and at least
99% pure. A "pure" agent is one that has been purified to homogeneity, i.e., is 100% pure.
[0047]           The invention includes essentially purified or pure tocopheryl quinone
derivative and/or tocopherol derivative, and their inclusion in pharmaceutical compositions.
[0048]           Additionally, stabilizers that can increase shelf life can be included in the
pharmaceutical composition. Suitable stabilizers can include monosodium glutamate and 2
phenoxyethanol. Further, preservatives can be added so as to prevent contamination with
bacteria and permit multidose vials. Suitable preservatives can include phenoxyethanol and
formaldehyde.
[0049]           A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is slowly metabolized macromolecule
including, without limitation, proteins, polysaccharides, polyglycolic acids, amino acid
copolymers, and like carriers well known in the art.
[0050]           "Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle" refers to the water, saline, glycerol,
ethanol, etc. used for dissolution, suspension, or mixing of components in the pharmaceutical
composition.
[0051]           The term "effective amount" or "therapeutically acceptable amount" for
therapeutic treatment refers to an amount of agent sufficient to substantially improve
lysosomal exocytosis in affected cells or tissues, and/or substantially improve clinical
symptoms of the LSD at issue. It is believed that the effective amount(s) can be found within
                                                  9

    WO 2014/078573                                                         PCT/US2013/070156
a relatively large, non-critical range. Routine experimentation can be used to determine
appropriate effective amounts.
[0052]           Methods of administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the subject
invention to an individual can be carried out by any suitable means, including parenteral, e.g.,
intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal, intrathecal, transdermal
(topical), transmucosal; and rectal and oral administration. In a preferred embodiment, the
pharmaceutical composition is administered orally. In another embodiment, the
pharmaceutical composition administered via infusion. In another embodiment, the
pharmaceutical composition is injected directly into the central nervous system (CNS) to
bypass the blood brain barrier.
[0053]           The dosage administered depends on the route of administration. Generally,
however, a dosage range of about 5 to about 300 mg/kg body weight of a subject can be
useful. In one embodiment, the dosage range is about 10 to about 250 mg/kg. These dosage
ranges (and others listed herein) include all of the dosage amounts around and between the
stated values, including decimal values. Appropriate dosages can be determined using
experimentation known to the technically skilled research scientist or clinician. Such

[0054]           "Cyclodextrins" are cyclic oligosaccharides used in pharmaceutical, drug
delivery, food, agricultural and chemical industries, and environmental engineering. They are
typically 6, 7 and 8-membered rings respectively denoted as a-, 0- and y-cyclodextrins.
Cyclodextrin assists in moving cholesterol out of lysosomes in LSDs. Examples of
cyclodextrins that could be suitable in the subject invention include, without limitation,
hydroxypropyl P-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) and methyl-o-cyclodextrin (MPCD). In the subject
invention, the hydrophobic cholesterol molecule lodges within the cyclodextrin ring which is
then removed from the cell.
[0055]           "Biological sample" means a fluid or tissue of an individual that commonly
contains cells with impaired lysosomal function as evidenced by accumulation of substrate,
enlarged liposomes and reduced mitochondrial ATP production. Biological samples include,
without limitation, blood, plasma, serum, white blood cells, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF),
myelomas, tears, saliva, milk, urine, lymph fluid, respiratory secretions, and genitourinary or
intestinal tract secretions.

[0060]          Compounds having structures [1] and [2] can be used to improve

Pharmaceuticalcompositions
[0068]          Once prepared, a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutically appropriate
form and optionally including pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, diluents,
complexation agents, or additives, will be administered to the patient requiring therapy and/or
prophylaxis. Administration to patients can, for example, be via oral and/or parenteral
administration routes. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be
                                                 13

    WO 2014/078573                                                           PCT/US2013/070156
administered in any manner or employing any mode that will achieve effective concentrations
of the compounds in the brain or central nervous system of the patient.
[0069]           Thus, in one embodiment, the compound is formulated into a stable, safe
pharmaceutical composition for administration to a patient. The composition can be prepared
according to conventional methods by dissolving or suspending an amount of the compound
ingredient in a diluent. The amount might be between about 0.1 mg and about 1000 mg per
ml of diluent of the compound. A buffer may be added; optionally, a carbohydrate or
polyhydric alcohol tonicifier and/or a preservative may also be added. Other excipients may
also be present, if desired, to maintain the overall tonicity of the tocopherol derivative or
other contemplated compound.
[0070]           The terms buffer, buffer solution, and buffered solution, when used with
reference to hydrogen-ion concentration or pH, refer to the ability of a system, particularly an
aqueous solution, to resist a change of pH on adding acid or alkali, or on dilution with a
solvent. Characteristic of buffered solutions, which undergo small changes of pH on addition
of acid or base, is the presence either of a weak acid and a salt of the weak acid, or a weak
base and a salt of the weak base. The stability of a formulation may be enhanced by
maintaining the pH of the formulation in a range of approximately 5.0 to approximately 9.5.
The buffer may, for example, be selected from an acetate buffer, a phosphate buffer, or a
glutamate buffer.
[0071]           Of greater relevance to a formulation comprising a compound of the invention
for longer-term storage (i.e., with shelf-life in mind) is minimizing the Oxygen concentration.
In one embodiment, Oxygen is essentially excluded from the formulation, so that reaction
over time of the compound with oxygen cannot occur.
[0072]           Carriers or excipients can also be used to facilitate administration of a
compound according to the invention. Examples of carriers and excipients include, without
limitation, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars such as lactose, glucose, or
sucrose, or types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, polyethylene glycols, and
physiologically compatible solvents.
[0073]           A stabilizer may also be included in a pharmaceutical composition according
to the invention. Exemplary stabilizers include carbohydrates and polyhydric alcohols.
[0074]           A preservative may be added to a pharmaceutical composition described
herein to inhibit microbial growth to avoid consequent spoilage of the composition by
microorganisms. The amount of the preservative is not great, however, as it may affect the
overall stability of the inventive compound. Preservatives, as well as each of the other

components of pharmaceutical compositions are known in the art and are, for example,
described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" as well as Pharmaceutical Dosage
Forms: Parenteral Medications, Vol. 1, 1992, Avis et al. Ed., Mercel Dekker, New York,
N.Y. 1992, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.
[0075]          Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, diluents, complexation
agents, and/or additives may be chosen to enhance the stability of a compound according to
the invention, facilitate synthesis or formulation of a pharmaceutical composition comprising
the compound, and/or to enhance the bioavailability of the compound.
[0076]          For example, carrier molecules such as cyclodextrin and derivatives thereof
are well known in the art for their potential as complexation agents capable of altering the
physicochemical attributes of drug molecules. For example, cyclodextrins may stabilize (both
thermally and oxidatively), reduce the volatility of, and alter the solubility of, active agents
with which they are complexed. Accommodation of one molecule within another is known
as complexation and the resulting product is referred to as an inclusion complex.
[0077]          Alternatively, the pharmaceutically appropriate form of the inventive
tocopherol derivative compound may be formulated so as to enhance the stability and
bioavailability of the compound.
[0078]          One oral controlled release structure is enteric coating of a solid dosage form.
Enteric coatings promote the compounds remaining physically incorporated in the dosage
form for a specified period when exposed to gastric juice, yet the enteric coatings are
designed to disintegrate in intestinal fluid for ready absorption. Delay of absorption is
dependent on the rate of transfer through the gastrointestinal tract, and so the rate of gastric
emptying is an important factor. For some administrations, a multiple-unit type dosage form,
such as granules, may be useful.
[0079]          Examples of preferred tocopherol derivative compounds of the present
invention and/or compositions and/or complexes thereof exhibit advantageous
pharmaceutical properties: they may be readily formulatable, are chemically and physically
stable, readily water soluble, have low hygroscopicity, and/or exhibit good shelf life.
[0080]          Aspects and embodiments of the present invention will now be described in
the Examples. Further aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

Example 2 - Reduction of Cholesterol Levels in Wild Type and in NPC Fibroblast upon
Treatment with delta Tocopherol and Analo2ues
[00101]           The half maximal effective concentration (EC-50) for delta-tocopherol and
five analogues was measured in wild type and NPC 3123 cells. Figure 1A illustrates that as
delta-tocopherol and analogue concentrations increased in wild type cells, serum cholesterol
levels dropped. Further, in NPC cells (Figure 1B), the cholesterol level drop was substantial
relative to the control (no delta-tocopherol). The IC50 for phenotypic cholesterol elimination
in NCP fibroblasts upon exposure to NCGC00250218 was in the range of 10 PM. The most
significant change was seen with the "X-analogue" or NCGC00250218. Indeed, CF 3
tocopherol was more potent that delta-tocopherol (6-T).

Example 3 - Filipin Staining Assay for the Evaluation of Cholesterol Levels in Wild
Type and in NPC Fibroblast Cells upon Treatment with delta-Tocopherol and
NCGC00250218 (X-analogue).
[00102]         Filipin, a histochemical dye for cholesterol, was used to detect cholesterol in
wild type fibroblasts and NPC fibroblasts. Control fibroblasts, i.e., wild type and NPC
fibroblasts, were treated only with filipin and no delta-tocopherol or analogues. Experimental
samples were NPC cells that received either the X-analogue or delta-tocopherol. Figure 2
shows that NPC cells treated with filipin and X-analogue (20 PM) have less cholesterol than
NPC cells treated with filipin and delta-tocopherol (40 PM). Thus, treatment of NPC cells
with X-analogue significantly reduces cholesterol level relative to cells treated with delta
tocopherol, even though the latter was used at double the concentration as the former.
Example 4 - Brain and Plasma Pharmacokinetics upon Oral Administration of X
analogue to Balb/c Mice.
[00103]         The X-analogue was administered to female Balb/c mice so as to study time
concentration curves in brain and plasma. The Figure 3A tables set forth the results. The
peak mean concentration of X-analogue in serum occurs at approximately 2-4 hours; while
the peak concentration in brain occurs at or after 72 hours. These results are also illustrated
in the graph of Figure 3B.
Example 5 - Effect of Different Administration Routes and Doses for X-Analo2ue.
[00104]         The X-analogue was administered per os (PO) or intraperitoneal (IP) to female
Balb/c mice so as to observe the effect in brain and plasma of administration route and dose.
The results are set forth in Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C. In plasma (Figure 4A), the PO route was
seen to be more productive in generating a higher level of X-analogue. Surprisingly, the
lower dose (10 mg/kg) of administered X-analogue produced a higher plasma concentration
(ng/mL) than the higher dose (250 mg/kg). In brain (Figure 4B), the PO route was again
observed to be more productive in generating a higher level of X-analogue. The different
doses (10 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg) for PO administration produced approximately the same
brain concentration outcome. Figure 4C shows the comparison of plasma vs. brain at 250
mg/kg. Thus, synthetic modulation of the aliphatic chain including CF 3-functional groups
yielded molecules with improved pharmacokinetics. Of note, natural enzymes do not have
the capacity to oxidize fluoroaliphatic chains.

[00105]         Initial in vivo studies indicated that a single administration of CF 3-tocopherol
(NCGC00250218) in Niemann Pick C mice elevates the production of cholesterol esters in
the brain, which constitutes a sign of restoration of cholesterol homeostasis. Furthermore, a
long-term pharmacokinetic study (up to 42 days after single I.P. dose of 100 mg/kg) has been
completed (data not shown).
Example 6 - Exposure to the CF3-tocopherol NCGC00250218 activates cholesterol
metabolism
[00106]         Like other natural occurring tocopherols, NCGC00250218 is most likely to
have good bioavailability, but, for easy handling of NPC mice and for comparison of brain
levels with previous pharmacokinetics experiments, I.P. administration was carried out.
Based on previous experience with HPCD, compound and cholesterol-ester levels were
measured after 72 hours exposure. It was found that exocytosis of lysosomal trapped
cholesterol activates cholesterol metabolism increasing levels of cholesterol esters in brain
and 24-hydroxycholesterol in plasma. A dose of NCGC00250218 was selected that would
allow reaching brain concentrations similar to its IC50 in fibroblast (-10 pM). The results
are shown in Figures 5A and 5B.
[00107]         Additional studies with NCGC00250218 can be carried out to evaluate the
kinetics of cholesterol turnover, measuring the elevation of cholesterol esters at 24 and 48
hours after 300 mg/kg single dose IP administration. Furthermore, the dose can be reduced to
determine the minimum dose of NCGC00250218 that will produce cholesterol turnover.
These results, together with the long term pharmacokinetic studies described, allow
neurodegenerative and survival studies.
[00108]         Studies described herein, thus, show that CF 3-tocopherol: decreases
cholesterol accumulation in NPC patient cells (fibroblast and neurons); reduces enlarged
lysosome in NPC cells; increases intracellular Ca 2 and enhances lysosomal exocytosis;
shows cholesterol metabolism turnover in NPC mice upon single administration; and has
good brain penetration and an exceptionally long half-life (about 20 to 30 days). Indeed, the
long half-life of CF 3-tocopherol allows the compound to reach the brain. It also allows for
the possibility of administration over time - via infusion, for example, or low (micromolar
range) daily, weekly, or even monthly oral concentrations. Thus, CF 3 -tocopherol can be
orally bioavailable and safe (based on large daily dosing in a rat model, up to 5 g/kg, without
measurable or observable side effects). It is not metabolized as quickly.
