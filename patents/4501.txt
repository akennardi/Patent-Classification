                                           ABSTRACT
The airfoil icing controller apparatuses, methods and systems ("AIC") transforms weather and
flight parameter data via AIC components into icing determinations and icing avoidance
optimized flight plans based on airfoil type. In one implementation, the AIC comprises a
processor and a memory disposed in communication with the processor and storing processor
issuable instructions to receive anticipated flight plan parameter data, obtain weather data based
on the flight plan parameter data, obtain atmospheric data based on the flight plan parameter
data, and determine a plurality of four-dimensional grid points based on the flight plan
parameter data. The AIC may then determine a percent power increase (PPI) required by the
aircraft to overcome power loss due to icing conditions. With dynamic, (near) real-time icing
information and/or predictive icing forecast specific to airfoil type, the AIC may allow aircraft
to effeciently avoid areas where PPI is greater than a predetermined percentage and/or avoid
areas where dangerous icing may occur.

 2                            AIRFOIL ICING CONTROLLER (AIC)
 3  [0019]          In some embodiments, the AIRFOIL ICING CONTROLLER ("AIC") as
 4  disclosed herein transforms weather and flight parameter data via AIC components into icing
 5  avoidance optimized flight plans based on airfoil type.         In one implementation, the AIC
 6  comprises a processor and a memory disposed in communication with the processor and storing
 7 processor-issuable instructions to receive anticipated flight plan parameter data, obtain weather
 8  data based on the flight plan parameter data, obtain atmospheric data based on the flight plan
 9  parameter data, and determine a plurality of four-dimensional grid points based on the flight
10  plan parameter data. The AIC may then determine a percent power increase (PPI) required by
11 the aircraft to overcome power loss due to icing conditions.           With (near) real-time icing
12  information and/or predictive icing forecast specific to airfoil type, the AIC may allow aircraft
13  to avoid areas where PPI is greater than a predetermined percentage and/or avoid areas where
14  icing may occur.
15  [0020]          Icing forecasting methods may focus on general categories of aircraft, such as
16 aircraft size, and real-time icing information rely primarily on pilot reports (PIREPS), other
17 subjective/observational data, and local sensors for determining icing airspace regions.     In one
18  embodiment, an array of sensors both local and remote may be periodically polled by an aircraft
19  itself, directly by the AIC, and/or the like.   The polled array of sensors may include, for
20  example, sensors for measuring altitude, heading, speed, pitch, temperature, barometric
21  pressure, the water content of the atmosphere and/or clouds, fuel consumption, fuel remaining

       WO 2014/106269                                                         PCT/US2013/078541
                                                      5
 1 for flight, number of passengers, aircraft weight, and/or the like. The AIC as disclosed herein
 2 utilizes unique predictive determination components of icing per unique airfoil type and utilizes
 3 these predictive components to generate a comprehensive forecasting map display and/or
 4 overlay that is not merely a generalized icing projection for aircraft of a broad-spectrum type,
 5 but is the specification of icing to any airfoil known to the AIC, providing an accurate, model of
 6 icing over a specified spatial/temporal area.
 7 [0021]         Icing determination may rely on sensors located on an aircraft to determine when
 8 icing has occurred. This method fails to give advance warning aircraft personnel to potential
 9 icing hazards and may not give sufficient notice for course correction to improve icing
10 conditions. In some scenarios, an aircraft advancing into icing conditions may lose altitude
11 and/or be forced to terminate a specific flight plan without adequate notification of impending
12 icing conditions. Icing forecasts may rely on weather conditions alone to determine if icing may
13 occur and may apply only a generalized aircraft type to forecasting methods, an example of
14 which might be that a small aircraft may experience more significant icing than a larger aircraft
15 or require a greater power increase in icing conditions. However, airfoils, generally defined as
16 curved surface structures that provide aircraft with positive lift to drag ratios, under identical
17 weather conditions may ice differently, without respective to other aspects of aircraft
18 construction and/or size 101. In one example, a medium size propeller plane 102 may form ice
19 encasing the endpoint of its airfoil requiring a PPI of 0.3548. In this example under duplicate
20 weather conditions, a large passenger aircraft 103 may experience only slight icing of its airfoil,
21 requiring a much smaller PPI of 0.0051. Lastly, in this example, under these replicated weather
22 conditions, a small private aircraft 104 may experience larger ice formation on its airfoils than
23 the passenger aircraft and require a PPI of 0.0880, which is greater than that of the passenger

      WO 2014/106269                                                         PCT/US2013/078541
                                                    6
 1 aircraft, but less than that of the medium-sized propeller aircraft. By way of example, the terms
 2 "small", "medium", and "large" have been employed to describe diverse aircraft generalized in
 3 Figure 1. The AIC, however, may be indeterminate of aircraft size, purpose, and/or the like. In
 4 this embodiment, the AIC uses airfoil type to determine how, where, under what conditions,
 5 and/or the like of icing occurrence. In some embodiments, the AIC may associate aircraft with
 6 their known airfoil types. In some embodiments, the AIC may maintain information exclusive
 7 to airfoils. In some embodiments, the AIC may use aircraft type reciprocally with airfoil type.
 8 [0022]          In some embodiments of the disclosure, the AIC 201 may maintain a data
 9 repository 210 of aircraft PPI. In some embodiments, the data repository may be organized by
10 aircraft type. In some embodiments, the data repository may be organized by airfoil type. In
11 some embodiments, data tables of aircraft and airfoil types may be linked by information keys,
12 associating aircraft and airfoil types.      In other embodiments, the aircraft and/or airfoil
13 parameters for use by the AIC may be stored with respect to a PPI module, such as that
14 disclosed with respect to Figure 16 (e.g., PPI Component 1649; AIC data store 1619, Weather
15  1619h, Aircraft 1619i, Airfoil 16191; and/or the like); Figures 15A-F (e.g., an example PPI
16 hardware module); and/or the like. The PPI component and/or data repository may be internally
17 searchable to the AIC by a database query language and/or platform. In some embodiments, the
18 AIC may allow external sources to query the data repository. In this embodiment, aircraft types
19 are independently input 202 to the PPI data repository, which is maintained internally to the
20 AIC. Weather data and/or modeling such as the Global Forecasting System (GFS) and Rapid
21 Refresh (RAP) may be made available to the AIC through satellite transmission 270, weather
22 station input 280, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the AIC may reduce weather data to
23 determinate icing factors.      In some embodiments, the AIC may request specific numerical

      WO 2014/106269                                                         PCT/US2013/078541
                                                     7
 1 weather input that is icing condition related. In some embodiments of the AIC, weather input is
 2 continuous and/or updated at systematic intervals. In the example of Figure 2, airline operations
 3 230 may request both predictive and (near) real-time icing data 208 from the AIC. In this
 4 example, the operational request contains the aircraft type(s) for which icing conditions should
 5 be predicted. In some embodiments, the AIC may contain user profile information under which
 6 a user, having created a profile with the AIC, may provide identifying information other than
 7 aircraft type.   In some embodiments, the AIC may store user information in a profile data
 8 repository 290 and access aircraft type(s) and/or other user information based on identifying
 9 input data.    The AIC may then submit operational data, such as airfoil type and location,
10 localized and real-time weather data, such as temperature, cloud liquid water, and median
11 droplet size, and/or the like 204 to the PPI data repository 210 which may then return PPI(s) 205
12 needed for requested aircraft and/or conditions. The AIC may return 209 this output to the
13 airline operations as requested. In one example, commercial and/or private airline services 240
14 may request predictive and/or (near) real-time localized icing information.              In some
15 embodiments, this request may contain aircraft type and other user information.           In some
16 embodiments, this request may contain identifying information to access user profile data stored
17 in a AIC profile data repository. The AIC may submit the relevant operational and weather data
18 to the PPI data repository and receive PPI(s) as described, returning output to the requestor 240.
19 In some embodiments, in-house and/or third party flight planning tools 250 may request 211
20 predictive icing conditions over a region for one or more aircraft types. In some embodiments,
21 the flight planning tools may have and/or share user profile information of a profile data
22 repository with the AIC in making this request. In some embodiments, the AIC may return a
23 PPI grid overlay for the requested region 212. In some embodiments, the AIC may return a

      WO 2014/106269                                                            PCT/US2013/078541
                                                     8
 1 flight path over PPI grid overlay for the requested region, according to flight path request
 2 parameters, as described in Figures 6-6A. In some embodiments, the AIC may return multiple
 3 paths and/or PPI grid overlays for the requested regions.           In another example, air traffic
 4 controllers 260 may request predictive localized icing data 213 for its common regional aircraft
 5 from the AIC. As in other examples, this request may provide all necessary input data singly
 6 and/or with identifying information with which the AIC may access stored profile information
 7 from a profile data repository. The AIC may submit the necessary inputs and return a regional
 8 icing grid overlay 214 and/or PPI(s) for all aircraft type which may have been named in the data
 9 request or which may be part of an accessed profile. In some embodiments, the AIC may use
10 request data to maintain and/or update a profile data repository to assist in future data requests
11 from sources for which a profile has been created. In some embodiments, the AIC may use
12 request data to create user profile data for sources for which no profile data previously existed.
13 [0023]         Figure 3 shows an alternate embodiment of AIC data flow in which data requests
14 are received from like sources 330, 340, 350, 360, such as in Figure 2 and which aircraft/airfoil
15 type 302, aircraft specific icing 305, location/region, weather data such as temperature, cloud
16 liquid water, median droplet size 304, and/or the like is input to the AIC. In this embodiment, a
17 PPI data repository 310 may store aircraft/airfoil type in the manner(s) described in Figure 2,
18 and may be used as an input source to the AIC. In this embodiment, data requests such as 306
19 308 311 313 are fulfilled through the AIC, with data requests providing either input singly
20 and/or with identifying user information to access profile data from a profile repository 390, as
21 may be maintained by the AIC as described in Figure 2.                In some embodiments of the
22 disclosure, the data repositories storing PPI, aircraft/airfoil type, and/or user profile information
23 may be separate from, but accessible to, the AIC. As in Figure 2, the AIC may provide similar

      WO 2014/106269                                                          PCT/US2013/078541
                                                     9
 1 outputs 307 309 312 314 to requesting parties. The AIC may maintain/update its profile data
 2 repository with information from processed requests.
 3 [0024]          In Figure 4, one embodiment of the AIC's PPI calculation component is put forth.
 4 In this embodiment, an icing request is initiated to the AIC 401.      The AIC may request the
 5 aircraft type(s) 402.      In some embodiments, the AIC may use provided identifying user
 6 information as part of a user profile maintained by the AIC to determine aircraft type(s). In this
 7 embodiment, the AIC maintains a PPI data repository, which may be internal or external to the
 8 AIC, of aircraft types and/or airfoil types which may be maintained in separate tables or
 9 repository with information keys linking types.        In all subsequent aspects of the diagram,
10 reference aircraft and/or airfoil may be singular or plural, i.e. the AIC may be considered to
11 process multiple types in each request or the AIC may process a single type in a request. The
12 AIC may query the PPI data repository 403 to determine if the aircraft type is already known to
13 the system. If the aircraft type is not stored in the PPI 404, the AIC may assign an aircraft type
14 405 by creating a new or finding an existing matching record in the PPI that conforms to the
15 aircraft specifications. If the aircraft is not associated with a known airfoil type 406, the AIC
16 may request that an airfoil type be associated with the aircraft 407 and request an airfoil
17 identification.    If the airfoil type identified is not in system 408, the AIC may issue an
18 insufficient data notice 409 and request the parameters of the airfoil type 410.       If the input
19 parameters of the airfoil match a known airfoil type, the input airfoil is recorded as the existing
20 airfoil type 412. If the input parameters of the airfoil do not match an existing type, the AIC
21 may create a new record in the PPI data repository with the input airfoil parameters 413. If the
22 aircraft type is known and/or the airfoil type is known, and/or the AIC has input new
23 aircraft/airfoil types in the PPI, the AIC may request gridpoints and time to calculate icing data

                                               10
 1 414. The AIC may execute a query on its icing component for the requested points and time
 2 415.   The AIC may then determine the PPI necessary for input aircraft under the defined
 3 conditions, as predicted by the AIC weather model.       The following non-discursive PPI

24 In all subsequent aspects of the diagram, reference aircraft and/or airfoil may be singular or
25 plural, i.e. the AIC may be considered process multiple types in each request or the AIC may
26 process a single type in a request. As in Figure 4, the component processes the initial request
27 501 and aircraft type 502 and queries a PPI data repository 503.      In this embodiment, if the
28 requested aircraft type is not known to the AIC, the AIC may use an airfoil based on the aircraft
29 size in which the largest PPI may eventually be generated 505. In this embodiment, the AIC
30 may assign this airfoil to the aircraft for icing calculation purposes 506. The PPI calculation
31 proceeds through requesting gridpoints and time 507, querying the AIC weather model 508, and

 3 [0026]         Figure 6 shows an example of how the AIC may be incorporated into existing
 4 and/or prospective flight planning tools, such as AviationSentry Online@. The AIC may be
 5 included with online services, with desktop services, with mobile applications, and/or the like.
 6 In this embodiment of the disclosure, a flight planning tool has an interface 601 representative
 7 of an online flight planning service with user profile information. As an interactive element
 8 602, the AIC may allow users to factor icing prediction into flight path creation. The AIC may
 9 allow users to consider several ways of incorporating icing prediction into their flight path
10 considering their flight requirements 603.    In this example, the AIC may offer shortest path
11 generation where icing may not be a considering factor in flight path creation, icing
12 circumvention    where icing       avoidance is  a serious   flight  consideration,  some icing
13 circumvention with emphasis on shortest path generation where icing avoidance warrants some
14 consideration, but may not be a primary goal and/or the like. The AIC may then generate a
15 regional icing forecast within the specified flight path region 604 and suggest flight path
16 alterations with respect to the level of icing circumvention desired. In this embodiment, the
17 AIC outputs a color-coded map overlay where black may represent no necessary PPI, green
18 may represent mild PPI, yellow may represent moderate necessary PPI, and red may represent
19 severe necessary PPI.
20 [0027]         Figure 6A shows one example of an expanded logic flow diagram of flight path
21 considerations when the AIC is part of an integrated flight planning tool. In one embodiment of
22 the disclosure, the flight planning service may access/input user profile information 605 which
23 may include such information as the type of aircraft and/or flight service such as passenger 606,

 1 private 607 and/or commercial cargo/transport 608, the consideration of which may influence
 2 icing avoidance (i.e. commercial cargo transport may prioritize shortest path with minimal
 3 evasion while passenger may emphasize discursive icing circumvention over speed or
 4 directness).    The AIC may request additional user profile information for flight path
 5 construction 609. In some embodiments of the disclosure, such information may include the
 6 origin grid point and departure time of the flight, the destination grid point, and/or the
 7 maximum travel time the flight can utilize in constructing its path 611. In some embodiments
 8 of the disclosure, the AIC may infer user information from previously stored user profile data
 9 and/or prior flight path generation 612. In some embodiments, this information may include the
10 aircraft type, its fuel requirements, its standard flying altitude, previous planned flight paths,
11 and/or the like 613. In some embodiments, user profile and flight creation information that is
12 both input and/or inferred by the AIC may be used to update the user profile data for future AIC
13 use 614.     In some embodiments of the disclosure, the AIC may use other stored profile
14 information where similar parameters resulted in successful flight path creation.          In some
15 embodiments of the disclosure, the AIC may use additional input, such as those from sources
16 external to the flight planning tool, such as historical flight plan data and/or the like. The AIC
17 may then calculate the grid size of the region 615 over which the AIC may consider flight path
18 creation, using input such as the origin, destination, maximum flight time, and/or facilities of
19 the aircraft and/or type of flight. In some embodiments of the disclosure, two dimensional grid
20 space may be considered for initial path planning purposes.          In some embodiments of the
21 disclosure, three dimensional grid space may be considered for path planning purposes.           In
22 some embodiments of the disclosure, two dimensional grid space may be considered for initial
23 path planning purposes, which may then be integrated with additional dimensional information

      WO 2014/106269                                                            PCT/US2013/078541

 1 as necessary to accurately determine available grid space inside which the flight path may still
 2 meet flight path parameters.
 3 [0028]         In some embodiments of the disclosure, this initial input component may then be
 4 followed by AIC PPI calculation 616 of the generated geospatial grid region, some examples of
 5 which have been described in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5. The AIC may create a PPI overlay to the
 6 generated grid region 618 and may request additional information about the desired parameters
 7 of the flight path through this grid region 618. In some embodiments of the disclosure, these
 8 parameters may include schedule-based path-finding (shortest path immediacy), schedule-based
 9 but with circumvention of acute icing (shortest path avoiding high hazard icing areas),
10 discursive icing circumvention (navigating out of icing areas), and/or any combination of or
11 intermediate stage to these parameters 619. The AIC may then use available input as described
12 in the input component to determine all flight path creation parameters 620. The AIC may then
13 create a flight path over the PPI grid region 621, considering flight path creation parameters
14 619.    The AIC may then provide the user the proposed flight path as a terminal overlay,
15 standard or high definition map overlay and/or the like 622, as is applicable to the flight
16 planning tool.    If the flight path is satisfactory 623, the user may then exit the flight path
17 planning component of the AIC as an incorporated flight planning tool option.                In some
18 embodiments of the disclosure, the AIC may allow the user to export the determined flight path
19 to other media, save the flight path to the user profile, share the flight path with additional users,
20 and/or the like.    In some embodiments of the disclosure, if the proposed flight path is not
21 satisfactory 623, the AIC may allow the user to modify flight path creation parameters 624. In
22 some embodiments of the disclosure, the user may re-enter a flight path creation component as
23 specified earlier. In some embodiments of the disclosure, users may be allowed to visually

 3 [0034]         In some embodiments, the AIC server may issue PHP/SQL commands to query a

18 [0036]           Various embodiments of the AIC may be used to provide real-time, pre-flight
19 and/or in-flight icing reporting, planning and response.     The integrated, unified icing system
20 provided by the AIC may be used in flight equipment and/or ground equipment. The AIC may
21 provide weather/aviation      decision support (e.g., via graphical displays) and/or provide
22 alerts/triggers.   Although it is discussed in terms of re-routing in time of increased icing, in
23 some embodiments, the AIC may identify more efficient paths based on real-time updates
24 where there is decreased icing over a shorter physical distance, and may update a flight plan
25 accordingly. The AIC identifies 4D areas for flight hazards, and a user may choose or set their
26 profile based on particular hazards (e.g., a passenger airline would have a different hazard/icing
27 profile than an air freight company, and a large airliner would have a different profile from a
28 small plane or helicopter). Various cost calculations and risk calculations may also be used in
29 determining alerts and/or flight paths. In some embodiments, real-time feedback may come
30 from plane-mounted instrument sensors and provide updates to predicted icing.                Such

 1 information may be used to refine components for icing determination.           Although examples
 2 were discussed in the context of jet airliners, it is to be understood that the AIC may be utilized
 3 for low-level services, such as helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as high speed
 4 and/or military aircraft, and may even have potential ground applications, especially in
 5 mountainous terrain. The AIC may work with air traffic control, particularly in management of
 6 routing. In some embodiments, the AIC may receive input from and render output directly to
 7 avionics systems to guide planes.
 8 [0037]         Many pilots view aircraft icing as one of the most dangerous in-flight hazards.
 9 Prior to the AIC, icing forecasts have been one-size-fits-all. Different aircraft accumulate ice
10 differently even in the same meteorological environment, and thus a generic icing forecast may
11 not be useful to a pilot. The AIC addresses this situation by providing a universal and objective
12 quantitative metric for aircraft performance loss and applying it to ice accumulation for specific
13 airfoils.  In some embodiments, an icing component, module or program, such as NASA
14 LEWICE, may be used to generate the accumulations and a computational fluid dynamics
15 (CFD) component, module or program to analyze the resulting performance losses, and the AIC
16 generates aircraft-specific icing forecasts.
17 [0038]         In some embodiments, ice accumulation on aircraft surfaces may depend on many
18 aerodynamic (e.g., body shape, body size, angle attack, exposure time, and flight speed) and
19 meteorological variables (e.g., air temperature, liquid water content (LWC), and median volume
20 droplet (MVD) size).        In some embodiments, the AIC, utilizing one or more various
21 thermodynamic analysis (TdA) components, modules, and/or programs (e.g., LEWICE 3.2.2
22 software) may evaluate the thermodynamics of supercooled droplets as they impinge on a body
23 given aerodynamic, flight, and atmospheric inputs and compute the resulting ice shape(s).

 2 performance changes. In some embodiments, a CFD component may solve equations of motion
 3 for the resulting airflow. In some embodiments, the Percent Power Increase (PPI) metric may
 4 be determined and/or computed from CFD results, providing an elegant way to quantify the
 5 post-icing performance change. For additional detail, see McCann, D.W. and P.R. Kennedy,

 1 [0042]         In some implementations of the AIC, this elegant relationship may be utilized to
 2 determine performance loss with ice accumulation on any airfoil. For example, Figures 12 and
 3  13 show ice accumulation and resulting PPI values on a Beechcraft King Air airfoil and a
 4 Boeing 737 airfoil, respectively.    Figure 12 shows ice (red) accumulation, e.g., 1201, on a
 5 Beechcraft King Air airfoil using the inputs, e.g., 1202, in the figure.             The resulting
 6 performance change is also shown, e.g., 1203.     Figure 13 shows ice (red) accumulation, e.g.,
 7  1301, on a Boeing 737 airfoil using the inputs, e.g., 1302, in the figure.           The resulting
 8 performance change is also shown, e.g., 1303.
 9 [0043]         In some embodiments of the AIC, aircraft-specific icing forecasting may be a two
10 element process.     The AIC creates numerous ice accumulation simulations modifying the
11 meteorological variables for each aerodynamic configuration.           The combinations of air
12 temperature, LWC, and MVD are may be limited by choosing representative values for each
13 variable. For example, supercooled liquid water exists only in a finite range of air temperatures
14 (OC to -40C).      With temperatures less than about -20C ice shapes are similar because
15 supercooled drops freeze quickly. Similarly, cloud liquid water amounts rarely exceed 2 g m 3 .
16 While most icing occurs with small droplet sizes, supercooled large drops pose a significant
17 icing threat, so the AIC may test ice shapes over a fairly large droplet size range. Properly
18 implementated parameters provide significant ranges of variables to analyze.         The AIC may
19 select/recieve representative values to ensure sufficient granularity yet limit the time necessary
20 to create a PPI profile or determine a PPI value given a particular input set. A TdA component
21 may create an ice shape for the chosen meteorological and aerodynamic configuration. In some
22 implementations, a CFD component may analyze the resulting ice shape for the airfoil's
23 performance. Various implementations may do hundreds or thousands of iterations to converge

      WO 2014/106269                                                           PCT/US2013/078541
                                                    23
 1 on a suitable solution. The AIC may be configured to create PPI profiles for as many aircraft as
 2 desired, or even for every available aircraft. Initially, PPI profiles may be generated for popular
 3 aircraft, both in terms of ownership and in terms of airfoil shapes and sizes used by
 4 manufacturers.
 5 [0044]         In some embodiments, aircraft-specific icing forecasts can be implemented with
 6 any forecast of air temperature, LWC, and MVD. Forecast air temperature may be determined
 7 or computed by numerical weather forecast (NWF) components.               For example, a VVICE
 8 module may be utilized that post-processes any numerical model for the LWC and VD. The
 9 VVICE module parameterizes vertical motions then uses straight-forward cloud physics
10 relationships to create the cloud parameters (additional detail may be found in McCann, D.W.,
11 2006: Parameterizing convective vertical motions for aircraft icing forecasts. Proc. 1 2 th Conf. on
12 Aviation, Range, and Aerospace Meteorology, Amer. Meteor. Soc., Boston MA., the entirety of
13 which is hereby incorporated by reference).
14 [0045]         In some embodiments, to produce an aircraft-specific forecast, the AIC makes a
15 three-dimensional lookup table for every aircraft type for which a PPI profile was created. A
16 user may specify an aircraft type, and the AIC interpolates the appropriate PPI profile table at
17 every grid point, horizontally, vertically, and in time. If the selected aircraft type is not in the
18 AIC database, the AIC may be configured with relatively more flexible tables based on aircraft
19 size. Thus, the AIC can create horizontal maps at the user's requested altitude, cross sections
20 along the user's requested flight path, and/or other useful displays.
21 [0046]         By providing aircraft-specific icing forecasts, the AIC may remove much of the
22 ambiguity inherent in previous one-size-fits-all icing forecasts. In particular, there may be a
23 unique situation in which a particular aircraft may be more vulnerable to icing than a traditional

       WO 2014/106269                                                         PCT/US2013/078541

 1 forecast indicates.   By providing icing hazards in quantitative terms, the AIC forecasts give
 2 more detail than previously available and pilots may utilize to the Percent Power Increase
 3 metric directly since increasing power is one of the ways a pilot can combat the effects of icing.
 4 [0047]         Moreover, by being aircraft-specific, the AIC forecasts may create goodwill with
 5 users. Knowing the icing forecasts are tailored to their aircraft type, users can better utilize and
 6 rely on forecasts as meaningful to them. This also creates less doubt about how to interpret the
 7 forecasts.
 8 [0048]         Figure 14 illustrates an example PPI component installation. In one embodiment,
 9 an aircraft 1401 may have installed an AIC containing a PPI component 1402 for the
10 determination of an instantaneous percent-power-increase value for a given input set. The PPI
11 component may be configured, as in the current example, as an integrated hardware component
12 containing one or more hardware logic circuits for determining a PPI value. In alternative
13 embodiments, portions (or, in some cases, substantially all) of the PPI value determination may
14 be performed by the AIC utilizing software commands substituted for one or more of the PPI
15 component integrated hardware logic circuits. An example PPI component and configuration is
16 disclosed herein and particularly with respect to Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figures 15A-F.
17 [0049]         In one configuration,     airplane   1401 may provide an electrical signal to
18 a i r f oi De s i gnI   N terminal 1403 representing the aircraft or airfoil design on which the
19 PPI value determination is to be made. For example, if the current aircraft in which the PPI
20 component is installed is a Boeing 737, the aircraft flight control software may signal a value of
21 "101" on airf     oilDesignIN, that value representing the current aircraft type. The value
22 "101"    may be expressed       as three electrical voltages     ("high-low-high")    across three
23 airfoilDesign IN            hardware    input   pins.    By   utilizing  three   input   pins,   the

 2 configurations (e.g., "000", "001", "010", "100", "110", "101", "111").        By way of further
 3 examples, in one embodiment "110" may represent a Beechcraft Super King 200 aircraft, "111"
 4 may represent a default medium-body airframe, etc.        In alternative embodiments, additional
 5 hardware input pins or other serial communication input may be utilized to allow the PPI
 6 component to determine instantaneous PPI values for a limitless number of aircraft and/or
 7 airfoil designs.
 8 [0050]         In one embodiment, aircraft 1401 may provide the PPI component 1402 with
 9 input, using currentCWTRIN terminal 1404, representing the current atmospheric water
10 droplet density. The value provided may be electrical signals representing an integer value. For
11 example, if the aircraft water density sensor determines that the current water density about the
12 aircraft is .002, the aircraft may signal the integer value of "2" (representing .002 * 1000) to
13 currentCWTRIN.           In one embodiment, the value "2" may be represented as a 16-bit value
14 (e.g., "0000 0000 0000 0010") signaled as 16 high-or-low voltages across an equivalent number
15 of hardware input pins. Additionally, airplane 1401 may similarly signal a current ambient
16 temperature      value     for    the  temperature     about    the     plane   to     PPI   input
17 current Tempe rature_IN terminal 1405.
18 [0051]         As disclosed herein, the PPI component configuration discussed with respect to
19 Figure 14 may be utilized to determine an instantaneous PPI value for a current airframe and
20 ambient condition inputs.      However, other PPI component configurations may be utilized in
21 association with the other embodiments of the AIC discussed herein. For example, if the PPI
22 component is configured to provide a PPI value for a point in space an aircraft will encounter
23 after 10-minutes of further flight time (e.g., a future point/time), then the values provided to

 1 currentCWTRIN           and currentTemperatureIN              may be estimated values for that
 2 time/location.   In further embodiments, the discrete PPI value determinations by the PPI
 3 component may be utilized to perform an optimized flight-path determination. For example, the
 4 PPI component may be repeatedly utilized to determine PPI values for all points in a 3-D space.
 5 In an alternate embodiment, the PPI component may have multiple input/output terminals
 6 and/or accept an array of inputs and provide an array of outputs on one or more input/output
 7 terminals. As such, the PPI component embodiment described herein may be utilized with the
 8 other components of the AIC to perform any or all of the embodiments of the AIC described
 9 herein.
10 [0052]         Additionally, it should be noted that the signal inputs/outputs disclosed herein are
11 representative of example PPI component inputs/outputs. For example, a PPI input for aircraft
12 type may be represented as a single aircraft designator, an airfoil designator, an aircraft airfoil
13 configuration (e.g., a representation of airfoil geometry such as, for example, a height and angle
14 of curvature), a default designator (e.g., "medium aircraft"), and/or the like.        Further, the
15 percent-power-increase output value determination may be made by the PPI component on the
16 basis of inputs other than those illustrated herein without departing from the disclosure. For
17 example, the PPI component may utilize the instantaneous or expected aircraft altitude in lieu of
18 temperature, may utilize a cloud density forcast in lieu of water droplet density, and/or the like.
19 [0053]         Figure 15A shows an example PPI hardware component. In one embodiment, an
20 aircraft flight planning system and/or the like may provide electrical inputs to the PPI
21 component. Thereafter, the one or more electrical inputs may be processed by the logic circuits
22 (for example, integrated ASIC's, FPGA's, and/or the like) to produce a percent-power-increase
23 value representing the PPI for the given aircraft and input parameters. In one embodiment, the

 4 One type of program is a computer operating system, which, may be executed by CPU on a
 5 computer; the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer
 6 information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information
 7 technology systems include: input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into
 8 and out of a computer; memory storage into which data may be saved; and processors by which
 9 information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect
10 data for later retrieval, analysis, and manipulation, which may be facilitated through a database
11 program. These information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access
12 and operate various system components.

 1 [00153]        Networks     are  commonly     thought to    comprise    the  interconnection   and
 2 interoperation of clients, servers, and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted
 3 that the term "server" as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer, other
 4 device, program, or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote
 5 users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting "clients."
 6 The term "client" as used herein refers generally to a computer, program, other device, user
 7 and/or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and
 8 processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other
 9 device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests,
10 and/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly
11 referred to as a "node." Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information
12 from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of
13 information from a source to a destination is commonly called a "router." There are many forms
14 of networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks
15 (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as
16 being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may
17 access and interoperate with one another.

 6 travel to effectuate communications, operations, storage, etc. The computer systemization may
 7 be connected to a power source 1686; e.g., optionally the power source may be internal.
 8 Optionally, a cryptographic processor 1626 and/or transceivers (e.g., ICs) 1674 may be
 9 connected to the system bus. In another embodiment, the cryptographic processor and/or
10 transceivers may be connected as either internal and/or external peripheral devices 1612 via the
11 interface bus I/O. In turn, the transceivers may be connected to antenna(s) 1675, thereby
12 effectuating wireless transmission and reception of various communication and/or sensor
13 protocols; for example the antenna(s) may connect to: a Texas Instruments WiLink WL1283
14 transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.1 In, Bluetooth 3.0, FM, global positioning system (GPS)
15 (thereby allowing AIC controller to determine its location)); Broadcom BCM4329FKUBG
16 transceiver chip (e.g., providing 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, FM, etc.); a Broadcom

19 typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer
20 systemization's circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various

 6 understood that in alternative embodiments, any of the above components may be connected
 7 directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and/or organized in numerous variations
 8 employed as exemplified by various computer systems.
 9 [00156]       The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute
10 program components for executing user and/or system-generated requests. Often, the processors
11 themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units, such as, but not limited to:
12 integrated system (bus) controllers, memory management control units, floating point units, and
13 even specialized processing sub-units like graphics processing units, digital signal processing
14 units, and/or the like. Additionally, processors may include internal fast access addressable
15 memory, and be capable of mapping and addressing memory 1629 beyond the processor itself;
16 internal memory may include, but is not limited to: fast registers, various levels of cache
17 memory (e.g., level 1, 2, 3, etc.), RAM, etc. The processor may access this memory through the
18 use of a memory address space that is accessible via instruction address, which the processor
19 can construct and decode allowing it to access a circuit path to a specific memory address space
20 having a memory state. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as: AMD's Athlon, Duron
21 and/or Opteron; ARM's application, embedded and secure processors; IBM and/or Motorola's
22 DragonBall and PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Core (2) Duo,

 2 (printed) electronic and/or optic circuits) to execute stored instructions (i.e., program code)
 3 according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates
 4 communication within the AIC controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should
 5 processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and/or capacity, distributed processors
 6 (e.g., Distributed AIC), mainframe, multi-core, parallel, and/or super-computer architectures
 7 may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater
 8 portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.
 9 [00157]        Depending on the particular implementation, features of the AIC may be achieved
10 by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST's R8051XC2 microcontroller; Intel's MCS
11 51 (i.e., 8051 microcontroller); and/or the like. Also, to implement certain features of the AIC,
12 some feature implementations may rely on embedded components, such as: Application
13 Specific Integrated Circuit ("ASIC"), Digital Signal Processing ("DSP"), Field Programmable
14 Gate Array ("FPGA"), and/or the like embedded technology. For example, any of the AIC
15 component collection (distributed or otherwise) and/or features may be implemented via the
16 microprocessor and/or via embedded components; e.g., via ASIC, coprocessor, DSP, FPGA,
17 and/or the like.   Alternately, some implementations of the AIC may be implemented with
18 embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal
19 processing. An example AIC component (e.g., PPI Component 1649) substantially in the form
20 of a field-programmable gate array configured as an integrated circuit for performing the
21 features of the PPI component may be found with respect to Figures 15A-F.            It should be
22 appreciated that the example PPI hardware component disclosed is provided to enhance the
23 reader's understanding of the instant disclosure and is but one embodiment of the AIC disclosed

 2 alternative integrated circuits, hardware description language statements (e.g., VHDL, Verilog,
 3 and/or the like), programming language commands, and/or the like, embodiments of the
 4 disclosed PPI hardware component represented as alternative hardware designs and/or software
 5 or software/hardware combinations are possible based on this disclosure.
 6 [00158]         Depending on the particular implementation, the embedded components may
 7 include    software   solutions,  hardware   solutions,  and/or   some   combination   of both
 8 hardware/software solutions. For example, AIC features discussed herein may be achieved
 9 through implementing FPGAs, which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable
10 logic components called "logic blocks", and programmable interconnects, such as the high
11 performance FPGA Virtex series and/or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx.
12 Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the
13 FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the AIC features. A hierarchy of programmable
14 interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the AIC system
15 designer/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic
16 blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and
17 XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or simple mathematical
18 operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be
19 circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the AIC may be
20 developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC
21 implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate AIC controller
22 features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation

 5 electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride,
 6 lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and/or the like. Other types of AC or
 7 DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells, in one embodiment, the case
 8 provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell
 9  1686 is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the AIC
10 thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example, the power
11 source 1686 is connected to the system bus component 1604. In an alternative embodiment, an
12 outside power source 1686 is provided through a connection across the I/O 1608 interface. For
13 example, a USB and/or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the
14 connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.

 2 rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory 1629 will include ROM 1606, RAM 1605,
 3 and a storage device 1614. A storage device 1614 may be any conventional computer system
 4 storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a
 5 magneto-optical      drive;  an   optical  drive    (i.e., Blueray, CD   ROM/RAM/Recordable

 7 Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); solid state memory devices (USB memory, solid state
 8 drives (SSD), etc.); other processor-readable storage mediums; and/or other devices of the like.
 9 Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.
10                                     Component Collection
11 [00169]         The memory 1629 may contain a collection of program and/or database
12 components and/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s) 1615
13 (operating system); information server component(s) 1616 (information server); user interface
14 component(s) 1617 (user interface); Web browser component(s)              1618 (Web browser);

16 server component(s) 1620 (cryptographic server); the AIC component(s) 1635; and/or the like
17 (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from
18 the storage devices and/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although
19 non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are
20 stored in a local storage device 1614, they may also be loaded and/or stored in memory such as:
21 peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM,
22 various forms of memory, and/or the like.

 2 [00170]         The operating system component 1615 is an executable program component
 3 facilitating the operation of the AIC controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access
 4 of I/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and/or the like. The operating
 5 system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS
 6 X (Server); AT&T Plan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's
 7 UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
 8 and/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and/or the like); and/or the like
 9 operating systems. However, more limited and/or less secure operating systems also may be
10 employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft DOS, Microsoft Windows
11 2000/2003/3.1/95/98/CE/Millenium/NT/Vista/XP          (Server), Palm OS, and/or the like. An
12 operating system may communicate to and/or with other components in a component collection,
13 including itself, and/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other
14 program components, user interfaces, and/or the like. For example, the operating system may
15 contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user,
16 and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses. The operating system, once executed
17 by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I/O, peripheral
18 devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and/or the like. The operating
19 system may provide communications protocols that allow the AIC controller to communicate
20 with other entities through a communications network 1613. Various communication protocols
21 may be used by the AIC controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as,
22 but not limited to: multicast, TCP/IP, UDP, unicast, and/or the like.

 2 [00171]       An information server component 1616 is a stored program component that is
 3 executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server
 4 such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet
 5 Information Server, and/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of
 6 program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI)
 7 (Objective-) C (++), C# and/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, dynamic (D)
 8 hypertext markup language (HTML), FLASH, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report
 9 Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, wireless application protocol
10 (WAP), WebObjects,       and/or the    like. The    information   server may     support   secure
11 communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText
12 Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer
13 (SSL),   messaging   protocols  (e.g., America Online      (AOL)     Instant Messenger    (AIM),
14 Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN)
15 Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering
16 Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence
17 Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence
18 Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and
19 Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and/or the like. The information
20 server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the
21 manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components.
22 After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a
23 particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at

      WO 2014/106269                                                           PCT/US2013/078541

 1 specified locations on the AIC controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For
 2 example, a request such as http://123.124.125.126/myInformation.html             might have the IP
 3 portion of the request "123.124.125.126" resolved by a DNS server to an information server at
 4 that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the
 5 "/myInformation.html" portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing
 6 the information "myInformation.html." Additionally, other information serving protocols may
 7 be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port 21, and/or the like. An
 8 information server may communicate to and/or with other components in a component
 9 collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server
10 communicates with the AIC database 1619, operating systems, other program components, user
11 interfaces, Web browsers, and/or the like.
12 [00172]        Access to the AIC database may be achieved through a number of database bridge
13 mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through
14 inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects,
15 etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into
16 appropriate grammars as required by the AIC. In one embodiment, the information server would
17 provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web
18 form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The
19 entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to
20 generate queries directed to appropriate tables and/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may
21 generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join/select
22 commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the
23 bridge mechanism to the AIC as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the

                                                  66
 1 results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation
 2 of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then
 3 provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.
 4 [00173]        Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or
 5 provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or
 6 responses.
 7                                         User Interface
 8 [00174]        Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation
 9 interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and
10 speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, and status.
11 Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and
12 windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access,
13 capabilities, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system
14 resources, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user
15 interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS/2,

 1 [00175]        A user interface component 1617 is a stored program component that is executed
 2 by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with,
 3 and/or atop operating systems and/or operating environments such as already discussed. The
 4 user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and/or operation
 5 of program components and/or system facilities through textual and/or graphical facilities. The
 6 user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and/or operate a
 7 computer system. A user interface may communicate to and/or with other components in a
 8 component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user
 9 interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and/or the like. The

20 into PDAs, cellular telephones, and/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate
21 to and/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of

 2 communications, requests, and/or responses. Also, in place of a Web browser and information
 3 server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar operations of both. The
 4 combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to
 5 users, user agents, and/or the like from the AIC enabled nodes. The combined application may
 6 be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.
 7                                           Mail Server

 9 a CPU 1603. The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited
10 to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution
11 of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++),
12 C# and/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and/or

18 executed by a CPU 1603, cryptographic processor 1626, cryptographic processor interface
19  1627, cryptographic processor device 1628, and/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces
20 will allow for expedition of encryption and/or decryption requests by the cryptographic
21 component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional
22 CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and/or decryption of provided

      WO 2014/106269                                                        PCT/US2013/078541

 1 data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty
 2 Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and/or decryption. The cryptographic component may
 3 employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509
 4 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access
 5 protection, public key management, and/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate
 6 numerous (encryption and/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to:
 7 checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International
 8 Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash
 9 operation), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and
10 authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and
11 Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA),           Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure
12 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and/or the like. Employing such encryption security
13 protocols, the AIC may encrypt all incoming and/or outgoing communications and may serve as
14 node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The
15 cryptographic component facilitates the process of "security authorization" whereby access to a
16 resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects
17 authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may
18 provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique
19 signature for a digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and/or with
20 other components in a component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. The
21 cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of
22 information across a communications network to enable the AIC component to engage in secure
23 transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of

 1 resources on the AIC and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it
 2 may act as a client and/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic
 3 component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program
 4 components, and/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate,
 5 generate, obtain, and/or provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications,
 6 requests, and/or responses.
 7                                        The AIC Database
 8 [00182]        The AIC database component 1619 may be embodied in a database and its stored
 9 data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored
10 program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may
11 be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase.
12 Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of
13 related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the
14 combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as
15 dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships
16 generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys
17 represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More
18 precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the "one" side of a one-to-many
19 relationship.
20 [00183]        Alternatively, the AIC database may be implemented using various standard data
21 structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table,
22 and/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and/or in (structured) files. In
23 another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore,

      WO 2014/106269                                                          PCT/US2013/078541

 1 Poet, Zope, and/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are
 2 grouped and/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object
 3 collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to
 4 relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have
 5 other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the AIC database is
 6 implemented as a data-structure, the use of the AIC database 1619 may be integrated into
 7 another component such as the AIC component 1635. Also, the database may be implemented
 8 as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated
 9 and/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions
10 of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and/or imported and thus decentralized and/or
11 integrated.
12 [00184]        In one embodiment, the database component 1619 includes several tables 1619a-1.
13 A User table 1619a may include fields such as, but not limited to: userid, ssn, dob, firstname,
14 lastname, age, state, addressfirstline, addresssecondline, zipcode, deviceslist, contactinfo,
15 contact type, altcontactinfo, altcontact type, user equipment, user-plane, user-profile,
16 and/or the like. An Account table 1619b may include fields such as, but not limited to: acct id,
17 acct_user, acct history, acct_access, acct-status, acct-subscription, acctjprofile, and/or the like.
18 [00185]        A Profile table 1619c may include fields such as, but not limited to: prof id,
19 prof assets, prof history, prof details, profileaircraft, and/or the like. A Terrain table 1619d
20 may include fields such as, but not limited to: terrainid, terraindetails, terrainjparameters,
21 terrain var, and/or the like. A Resource table 1619e may include fields such as, but not limited

20 [00187]        In one embodiment, the AIC database may interact with other database systems.
21 For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search AIC
22 component may treat the combination of the AIC database, an integrated data security layer
23 database as a single database entity.

      WO 2014/106269                                                        PCT/US2013/078541
                                                   74
 1 [00188]        In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives,
 2 which may serve to update the AIC. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables
 3 depending upon the environments and the types of clients the AIC may need to serve. It should
 4 be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative
 5 embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective
 6 database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables).
 7 Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over
 8 several computer systemizations and/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the
 9 decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and/or distributing the
10 various database components 1619a-1. The AIC may be configured to keep track of various
11 settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.
12 [00189]        The AICAIC database may communicate to and/or with other components in a
13 component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the AIC
14 database communicates with the AIC component, other program components, and/or the like.
15 The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.
16                                            The AICs
17 [00190]        The AIC component 1635 is a stored program component that is executed by a
18 CPU. In one embodiment, the AIC component incorporates any and/or all combinations of the
19 aspects of the AIC discussed in the previous figures. As such, the AIC affects accessing,
20 obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and/or the like across various
21 communications networks. The features and embodiments of the AIC discussed herein increase
22 network efficiency by reducing data transfer requirements by the use of more efficient data
23 structures and mechanisms for their transfer and storage. As a consequence, more data may be

 1 transferred in less time, and latencies with regard to transactions, are also reduced. In many
 2 cases, such reduction in storage, transfer time, bandwidth requirements, latencies, etc., will
 3 reduce the capacity and structural infrastructure requirements to support the AIC's features and
 4 facilities, and in many cases reduce the costs, energy consumption/requirements, and extend the
 5 life of AIC's underlying infrastructure; this has the added benefit of making the AIC more
 6 reliable. Similarly, many of the features and mechanisms are designed to be easier for users to
 7 use and access, thereby broadening the audience that may enjoy/employ and exploit the feature
 8 sets of the AIC; such ease of use also helps to increase the reliability of the AIC. In addition, the
 9 feature sets include heightened security as noted via the Cryptographic components 1620, 1626,
10  1628 and throughout, making access to the features and data more reliable and secure.
11 Additionally, the AIC enables more efficient and safe flight planning and routing, including
12 real-time dynamic responsiveness to changing weather conditions.
13 [00191]         The AIC component may transform weather data input via AIC components into
14 real-time and/or predictive icing feeds and displays, and/or the like and use of the AIC. In one
15 embodiment, the AIC component 1635 takes inputs (e.g., weather forecast data, atmospheric
16 data, models, sensor data, and/or the like) etc., and transforms the inputs via various
17 components (a Tracking component 1644; a Pathing component 1645; a Display component
18  1646; an Alerting component 1647; a Planning component 1648; a PPI component 1649; an
19 input component 1650; an icing component 1651; a CFD component 1652; a TdA component
20  1653; an NWF component 1654; and/or the like), into outputs (e.g., predictive flight path icing,
21 percent     power   increase   needed,   real-time   airfoil-specific    icing   data,  flight  path
22 modifications/optimizations, icing alerts, and/or the like).

 1  [00192]       The AIC component enabling access of information between nodes may be
 2  developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to:
 3 Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C#
 4  and/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and
 5 object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web
 6  application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's
 7 ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX;                    (D)HTML;      Dojo, Java;  JavaScript;
 8 jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP);
 9  SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and/or the like), WebObjects, and/or the like. In one
10  embodiment, the AIC server employs a cryptographic             server to encrypt and decrypt
11  communications. The AIC component may communicate to and/or with other components in a
12  component collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the AIC
13  component    communicates     with the AIC database,       operating   systems,  other program
14  components, and/or the like. The AIC may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or
15 provide program component, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or
16 responses.
17                                       Distributed AICs
18  [00193]       The structure and/or operation of any of the AIC node controller components may
19 be combined, consolidated, and/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development
20  and/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of
21 ways to facilitate deployment and/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the
22  components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components
23 on demand in an integrated fashion.

      WO 2014/106269                                                        PCT/US2013/078541
                                                  77
 1 [00194]        The component collection may be consolidated and/or distributed in countless
 2 variations through standard data processing and/or development techniques. Multiple instances
 3 of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated
 4 on a single node, and/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing
 5 and/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across
 6 multiple controllers and/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances
 7 and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication
 8 techniques.
 9 [00195]        The configuration of the AIC controller will depend on the context of system
10 deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and/or use of the
11 underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration.
12 Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and/or integrated program
13 components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and/or results in some
14 combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated,
15 obtained, and/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from
16 the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and/or provide data. This may be
17 accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but
18 not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable
19 communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and/or the like.
20 [00196]        If component collection components are discrete, separate, and/or external to one
21 another, then communicating, obtaining, and/or providing data with and/or to other components
22 may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such
23 as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed)

 1 Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE),
 2 and/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote
 3 application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation
 4 (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and/or the like. Messages sent between discrete
 5 component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a
 6 singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation
 7 and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as
 8 lex, yacc, XML, and/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities,
 9 which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.
10 [00197]        For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP
11 post command, e.g.:
12                        w3c -post http:// ... Valuel
13
14 [00198]        where Valuel is discerned as being a parameter because "http://" is part of the
15 grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a
16 grammar, a variable "Valuel" may be inserted into an "http://" post command and then sent.
17 The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and/or
18 otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as
19 processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and/or instantiated,
20 it itself may process and/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab)
21 delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and/or the like structured data. In another
22 embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and/or
23 readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse
24 (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message

      WO 2014/106269                                                        PCT/US2013/078541

 1 parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data,
 2 and/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and
 3 requirements of system deployment.
 4 [00199]        For example, in some implementations, the AIC controller may be executing a
 5 PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") socket server via the information
 6 server, which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send
 7 data, e.g., data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication, the
 8 PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device, parse the received JSON
 9 encoded text data to extract information from the JSON-encoded text data into PHP script
10 variables, and store the data (e.g., client identifying information, etc.) and/or extracted
11 information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language ("SQL").
12 An exemplary listing, written substantially in the form of PHP/SQL commands, to accept
13 JSON-encoded input data from a client device via a SSL connection, parse the data to extract
14 variables, and store the data to a database, is provided below:
15    <?PHP
16    header('Content-Type:     text/plain');
