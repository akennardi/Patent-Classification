                                             ABSTRACT
         A device that assists with equalizing air pressure within a bottle with the atmospheric air
pressure as liquid is being poured from the bottle and includes one or more relatively short air
tubes. The air tubes are situated with an upper inlet rim of the air tubes located flush with or
relatively near the bottle rim. Whether an insert or integrated into the manufacture of a
container, the one or more air tubes that extend partially into the container allow air to pass into
the container as the liquid exits the container. The pressure equalizer not only minimizes or
prevents the common glugging effect, but it allows liquid from a bottle to be poured smoothly at
any angle and orientation. A cap incorporating a detachable pressure equalizer is also
described.

Invention title:      Pressure equalization apparatus for a bottle and methods
                      associated therewith
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of
performing it known to us:

         PRESSURE EQUALIZATION APPARATUS FOR A BOTTLE AND METHODS
                                  ASSOCIATED THEREWITH
Field of the invention
[0001]         The present disclosure is related to a device that assists with equalizing air
pressure within a bottle with the atmospheric air pressure, as liquid is being poured from
the bottle.
Cross-Reference to Related Applications
[0001A]        The present application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No
2014213555, which claims priority from US Patent Application No 13/967,860 filed 15
August 2013, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their
entirety for all purposes.
Background to the invention
[0002]         A person pouring liquid from a bottle is often faced with the liquid pouring
erratically and even splashing due to "glugging" (that is, uneven flow during pouring)
caused by unbalanced pressures between the atmospheric air pressure outside the bottle
and the air pressure within the bottle. Referring now to Fig. 1, a bottle 100 is shown in a
cross-sectional view, wherein the cross-sectional alignment is taken along line 1-1 of the
top elevation view of the bottle 100 depicted in Fig. 2. The bottle 100 includes a bottle wall
104 having an exterior surface 108. The bottle wall 104 includes a base 112 and extends
from the base 112 to the top 116 of the bottle 100. The top 116 of the bottle 100 further
includes a bottle opening 120 that leads to the bottle interior 124. The bottle interior 124 is
defined by an interior surface 128 of the bottle wall 104. The bottle 100 has a bottle length
BL, wherein the bottle length BL is defined herein as the height of the bottle interior 124;
that is, the distance between the interior surface 128 of the bottle wall 104 at the deepest
portion of the base 112 of the bottle 100 and a top edge 132 of the bottle rim 136 at the top
116.
[0003]         Referring now to Fig. 3, an enlarged cross-sectional view of an upper portion
140 of the bottle 100 is shown. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, a variety of
sealing mechanisms may be used to seal a bottle. By way of example, a threaded cap
may be used to seal the bottle. Such a configuration is illustrated in Fig. 3, wherein a
threaded cap 148 is depicted directly above the bottle 100. The upper portion 140 of the
bottle 100 includes a bottleneck 152. Threads 156 along the exterior surface 108 of the
bottleneck 152 are configured to engage threads within cap 148.
 --  Afl1  1 6    ,1')rA lnA~ar')        1

[0004]       Still referring to Fig. 3, the bottleneck 152 includes a substantially constant
bottleneck diameter      DBottleneck. The bottleneck 152 itself extends from the bottle rim 136 to
a location where the bottle 100 begins its taper outward. That is, where the diameter of
the bottle 100 increases from the bottleneck diameter             DBottleneck. Accordingly, the
bottleneck 152 has a bottleneck length         LBottleneck that is defined as the distance between
the bottle rim 136 and the bottleneck base 160, which is the location where the bottleneck
diameter   DBoUleneck no longer remains substantially constant.

[0005]          Prior devices for attempting to provide for smooth fluid pouring have
performance issues, require significant materials, and/or have other limitations, such as
extending above the bottle top, thereby complicating or even preventing
recapping/resealing of the bottle. Accordingly, there is a need for other devices to address
the glugging problem associated with pouring liquids from a bottle.
Summary of the invention
[0006]          It is to be understood that the present disclosure includes a variety of different
versions or embodiments, and this Summary is not meant to be limiting or all-inclusive.
This Summary provides some general descriptions of some of the embodiments, but may
also include some more specific descriptions of other embodiments.
[0007]         One or more embodiments of the one or more present disclosures are directed
to a device that assists with equalizing air pressure within a bottle with the atmospheric air
pressure, as liquid is being poured from the bottle. Various embodiments of the pressure
equalizers described herein can accommodate various bottle shapes, bottle sizes, liquids,
and pouring angles. By way of example, the pressure equalizers are suitable for
beverages, chemicals, solutions, suspensions, mixtures, and other liquids. In its most
basic form, the pressure equalizer comprises two main fluid flow paths: (a) a channel that
allows liquid to pass out of the bottle; and (b) one or more air tubes or air ducts to allow air
to enter the bottle.
[0008]          Furthermore, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to
equalizing air pressure within bottles, but rather may be utilized to equalize air pressure in
any container or vessel. As a couple of non-limiting examples, embodiments of the
present disclosure may be employed to equalize air pressure in cartons, jugs, or any other
hollow or concave structure for storing, pouring, and/or dispensing liquids.
[0009]         At least one embodiment described herein utilizes one or more relatively short
air tubes, as compared to the bottle length. The air tubes function by pressure differential
and are not required to be in contact with an air cavity at the bottom of the bottle of liquid.
In at least one embodiment, the pressure equalizer comprises at least one air tube with an
air tube rim located substantially flush with the top of the bottle, or at least within 5% of the
bottle rim relative to the length of the bottleneck. Unlike an insert used for alcohol bottles
at a bar where the insert appears to be meant to slow the flow of liquid, embodiments
described herein increase the flow of liquid and better facilitate air/gas entry into the
bottle. More particularly, the pressure equalizers described herein mitigate or prevent the
glugging effect that occurs when liquid is attempting to exit a bottle at the same time that
air is attempting to enter the bottle. At least some embodiments of the pressure equalizers
can be incorporated directly into a current bottle mold design, a new bottle mold, or as an
 rm   A01qfq19ir    ,_1 12)0ArOr12

inserted device. The device, regardless of how it is incorporated into a bottle, involves
one or more air tubes that extend partially into the bottle and allow air to pass into the
bottle as the liquid exits the bottle. This device not only minimizes or prevents the common
glugging effect, but it can allow liquid from a bottle to be poured smoothly at any angle.
[0010]          Accordingly, a bottle insert for substantially equalizing atmospheric air
pressure with air pressure within a bottle when pouring a liquid from the bottle is provided,
the bottle having a bottle length BL, the bottle including a bottleneck and a bottle opening
having an opening diameter, the bottleneck having an interior bottleneck wall and a
bottleneck length LBottieneck extending between a bottle opening rim at the bottle opening to
a bottleneck base at a top of a bottle taper of the bottle, the bottle opening rim
circumscribing the bottle opening, the bottle insert comprising:
                a perimeter member adapted for contacting at least a portion of the interior
         bottleneck wall; and
                an air tube attached to the perimeter member, the air tube including an upper
         inlet rim and a lower end edge, the air tube including an air tube length    LAir Tube
         extending between the upper inlet rim and the lower end edge, wherein the upper
         inlet rim is configured for positioning within a rim proximity distance of about 0% to
         5% of the bottleneck length LBottleneck above or below the bottle opening rim, and
         wherein the air tube length LAir Tube is equal to or greater than the bottleneck length
         LBottleneck  and equal to or less than about 25% of the bottle length BL.
[0011]          In at least one embodiment, the perimeter member engages the bottle by a
friction fit. In at least one embodiment, the air tube comprises a flared portion. In at least
one embodiment, the flared portion includes a flared portion base that does not extend
distally beyond the bottleneck base. In at least one embodiment, the bottle insert further
comprises at least one additional air tube. In at least one embodiment, the at least one
additional air tube includes a length equal to or greater than the bottleneck length       LBottleneck
and equal to or less than about 25% of the bottle length BL.
[0012]          One or more additional embodiments may comprise an air inlet channel in fluid
communication with an air tube. Accordingly, a bottle insert for substantially equalizing
atmospheric air pressure with air pressure within a bottle when pouring a liquid from the
bottle is provided, the bottle having a bottle length BL, the bottle including a bottleneck and
a bottle opening having an opening diameter, the bottleneck having an interior bottleneck
wall and a bottleneck length      LBottleneck extending between a bottle opening rim at the bottle
opening to a bottleneck base at a top of a bottle taper of the bottle, the bottle opening rim
circumscribing the bottle opening, the bottle insert comprising:

             an air inlet channel adapted for contacting at least a portion of the interior
        bottleneck wall and extending circumferentially around at least a portion of the
        interior bottleneck wall, the air inlet channel including a perimeter member
        contacting at least a portion of the interior bottleneck wall, the air inlet channel
        including a distal base and an interior channel wall located substantially parallel to
        at least a portion of the perimeter member and offset radially to the interior of the
        perimeter member by the distal base; and
             an air tube attached to the air inlet channel and having a distal end extending
        equal to or less than about 25% of the bottle length BL at least a portion of the air
        tube in fluid communication with the air inlet channel.
[0013]        In at least one embodiment, a top of the air inlet channel is situated within a
rim proximity distance above or below the bottle opening rim, the rim proximity distance
equal to or less than about 5% of the bottleneck length     LBottleneck. In at least one
embodiment, the bottle insert further comprises at least one additional air tube wherein the
at least one additional air tube has an air tube diameter    DAirTube  between about 2% to 50%
of the opening diameter of the bottle. In at least one embodiment, the bottle insert further
comprises at least one additional air tube, the at least one additional air tube fluidly
contiguous with the air inlet channel. In at least one embodiment, the bottle insert further
comprises a flow block within the air inlet channel and situated between the air tube and
the at least one additional air tube.
[0014]       One or more additional embodiments are directed to a liquid containment and
delivery device that mitigates the glugging phenomena. Accordingly, a liquid containment
and delivery device is provided, comprising:
        (a) a bottle having a bottle length BL, the bottle including a bottleneck and a bottle
             opening having an opening diameter, the bottleneck having an interior
              bottleneck wall and a bottleneck length LBottleneck extending between a bottle
             opening rim at the bottle opening to a bottleneck base at a top of a bottle taper
             of the bottle, the bottle opening rim circumscribing the bottle opening; and
        (b) a pressure reliever comprising an air tube attached to the interior bottleneck
             wall, the air tube including an upper inlet rim and a lower end edge, the air
             tube including an air tube length LAirTube extending between the upper inlet rim
             of the air tube and the lower end edge of the air tube, wherein the upper inlet
              rim is positioned within about 0% to 5% of the bottleneck length       LBottleneck above
             or below the bottle opening rim, and wherein the air tube length        LAir Tube is
             equal to or greater than the bottleneck length LBottleneck and equal to or less
             than about 25% of the bottle length BL.

[0015]         In at least one embodiment, the air tube comprises a flared portion. In at least
one embodiment, the flared portion includes a flared portion base that does not extend
distally beyond the bottleneck base.
[0016]        One or more embodiments include a pressure equalizer that includes an air
tube having a flared portion. Accordingly, an article for holding and pouring a liquid is
provided, comprising:
              a bottle including a bottle wall having an interior surface defining a chamber,
        the chamber extending between a bottle opening and an interior bottom of the
         bottle, wherein the bottle opening is located at an end of a bottleneck of the bottle,
        the bottleneck including a bottleneck diameter smaller than a chamber diameter
         located along a bottle length extending between the bottle opening and the interior
         bottom; and
              a pressure equalizer located within the bottleneck and including at least one
         air tube with a flared proximal end having an inlet rim situated within a rim
         proximity distance of the bottle opening, the rim proximity distance equal to about
         5% of the bottleneck length.
[0017]         In at least one embodiment, the air tube has an air tube length no greater than
about 25% of the bottle length. In at least one embodiment, a distal portion of the air tube
extends into a handle of the bottle. In at least one embodiment, multiple air tubes are
used and are situated substantially equidistant around an interior perimeter of the
bottleneck. In at least one embodiment, the article further comprises a cap, the cap being
detachably connected to the pressure equalizer for installation in the bottleneck when the
cap is applied to the bottle.
[0018]         In accordance with some embodiments, the air inlet tube variations can be
combined. As an example, it is possible to combine one relatively small circular air inlet
tube with one rectangular air inlet tube of larger size and two small triangular tubes that
curve, all in one pressure equalizer device.
[0019]         In use, if a bottle does not include a pressure equalizer that is integrally made
with the bottle, an embodiment of a pressure equalizer insert can be inserted into the
bottleneck of the subject bottle. The bottle is then tilted to pour the liquid contained in the
bottle. While pouring the liquid, air enters the bottle via the one or more air tubes of the
pressure equalizer as liquid exits the bottle via the open space situated around the one or
more air tubes.

fashion, and encompasses embodiments in which components are linked directly, as well
as embodiments in which additional components are placed between the two linked
components.
[0021]        As used herein, "at least one," "one or more," and "and/or" are open-ended
expressions that are both conjunctive and disjunctive in operation. For example, each of
the expressions "at least one of A, B and C," "at least one of A, B, or C," "one or more of A,

Detailed description
[00113]       One or more embodiments of the present disclosure include a pressure
equalizer insert for placement in a bottle to allow a liquid to be poured from the bottle while
at the same time substantially equalizing air pressure within the bottle with atmospheric air
pressure. As a result, the liquid can be poured from the bottle without the typical glugging
phenomena that generally accompanies pouring liquid from a bottle that does not possess
the pressure equalizer. One or more additional embodiments include bottles having
bottlenecks with the pressure equalizer device integrally formed within the bottle during
manufacture of the bottle. For example, a plastic bottle, carton, or jug can be
manufactured with the pressure equalizer device integrally formed in the bottleneck of the
bottle, top of the carton, or neck of the jug when the bottle, carton, or jug is produced. The
various embodiments of the present disclosure are described in the text below and are
illustrated in the attached drawings.
[00114]          Referring now to Fig. 4A, a bottle 100 is shown that includes an
embodiment of a pressure equalizer 400 inserted into the bottle 100. More particularly,
Fig. 4A depicts a bottle 100 and a pressure equalizer 400 in a cross-sectional view,
wherein the cross-sectional alignment is taken along line 4A-4A of the top elevation view
of the bottle 100 and pressure equalizer 400 depicted in Fig. 5. The pressure equalizer

400 is located, at least in part, in the bottleneck 152 of the bottle 100. In at least one
embodiment, the pressure equalizer 400 includes at least one air tube 404. As depicted in
Figs. 4A-10, the pressure equalizer 400 is shown with four air tubes 404; however, it is to
be understood that embodiments of the pressure equalizer 400 may include more or less
than four air tubes 404. More specifically, and as will be discussed in more detail below,
one or more embodiments include a single air tube 404, while other embodiments include
two or more air tubes 404. Accordingly, the number of air tubes 404 may vary for a given
application.
[00115]        With continued reference now to Figs. 4A-10, each air tube 404 is sized to
have an air tube diameter DAirTube of between about 2% to 50% of the bottleneck diameter
DBottleneck. Here it is noted that for pressure equalizers using small air tubes, multiple air
tubes are preferably used for situations where the air tube diameters                         DAirTube  are at or
around 2% of the bottleneck diameter              DBottleneck.  Although air tubes may occupy the entire
interior space of the bottleneck (as shown in Figs. 42 and 43 and discussed below), for
any given air tube 404 the diameter or equivalent diameter (allowing for different shaped
air tubes, also discussed below) for the air tubes 404 preferably does not exceed 50% of
the bottleneck diameter        DBottleneck.  In addition, any given air tube 404 should not be so
small as to induce capillary rise of the liquid within the bottle. Accordingly, by way of
example and not limitation, a bottle having a bottleneck diameter                        DBottleneck (that is, an
inside diameter) of approximately 0.875 inches could receive a pressure equalizer 400
with a variety of number and size air tubes, such as air tubes 404 whose diameters vary
between about 0.0018 inches (2% of 0.875 inches) and about 0.438 inches (50% of 0.875
inches).
[00116]         Referring still to Figs. 4A-10, and in accordance with at least one embodiment
of the present disclosure, the air tubes 404 include an upper inlet rim 408 and a lower end
edge 412. Accordingly, the air tubes 404 have an air tube length LAirTube extending
between the upper inlet rim 408 and the lower end edge 412. In at least one
embodiment, the upper inlet rim 408 is configured for positioning substantially even with
the bottle rim 136. Alternatively, in at least one embodiment the upper inlet rim 408 of the
air tubes 404 is situated within a rim proximity distance 414 of about 5% of the bottleneck
length LBottleneck either above (as best seen in Fig. 4B) or below (as best seen in Fig. 4C) of
the bottle rim 136. In addition, in at least one embodiment, the air tube length                          LAirTube is
equal to or greater than the bottleneck length               LBottleneck  and equal to or less than about 25%
of the bottle length BL (i.e.,    LBottleneck : LAirTube   :  2 5%BL).      Accordingly, by way of example
and not limitation, a bottle having a bottleneck length                  LBottleneck Of 1.0 inch and a bottle
length BL of 8.0 inches could receive a pressure equalizer 400 that includes one or more
air tubes 404 whose upper inlet rim 408 is within 0.05 inches (5% of 1.0 inch) above or
.  m  A01qfq19ir  ,_1 12n0ArfO12                l 1

below the bottle rim 136, and whose air tube length            LAir Tube  is greater than or equal to 1.0
inch (the value of the bottleneck length LBottleneck) and less than or equal to about 2.5
inches (25% of 8.0 inches).
[00117]        Referring now to Figs. 8 and 9, perspective views of pressure equalizer 400
are shown. As described above, the pressure equalizer 400 includes a plurality of air
tubes 404, and more specifically, four air tubes 404 are shown arranged substantially
equidistant around the circumference and within a perimeter member 416. For
embodiments wherein the pressure equalizer 400 is an insert, the perimeter member 416
is configured to fixedly engage (e.g., by friction fit, threads, welding, adhesive, and/or
fastener) the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152 of the bottle 100. Alternatively, if
the pressure equalizer 400 is integrally formed as part of the bottle 100, then the air tubes
404 may be positioned directly around the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152.
[00118]        Referring now to Fig. 10, in at least one embodiment the thickness of the
perimeter member 416 includes a portion of the wall of the air tube 404. More particularly,
each air tube 404 includes a tube wall thickness          TAir Tube Wall.   The tube wall thickness  TAir
Tube Wall forms a portion of the perimeter member 416. Or, said differently, a portion of the
perimeter wall thickness      TPerimeterwaii forms a portion of the air tube 404.
[00119]       As noted above, pressure equalizers with one or more air tubes comprise
various embodiments of the present disclosure. With reference now to Figs. 11 and 12, a
pressure equalizer 1100 is shown comprising a plurality of air tubes 404, and more
specifically, three air tubes 404. The air tubes 404 of pressure equalizer 1100 are situated
substantially at equal distances from one another around the circumference of the
perimeter member 416. Again, for an insert, the perimeter member 416 is adapted to
engage at least a portion of the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152 of a bottle 100.
If made integrally with the bottle 100, then the three air tubes 404 of pressure equalizer
 1100 are attached to a portion of the interior surface 128 of the bottle wall 104 of the
bottleneck 152 of a bottle 100.
[00120]        Referring now to Figs. 13 and 14, and in accordance with at least one
embodiment, a pressure equalizer 1300 is shown that includes a plurality of air tubes
 1304, wherein the air tubes have a cross-sectional shape other than circular. More
specifically, the air tubes 1304 comprises a perimeter section 1308 having an arc 1310
that substantially matches the curvature of a portion of the perimeter member 416 (for an
insert) or the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152 (for an integrally formed pressure
equalizer). The air tubes 1304 further include a substantially planar interior portion 1312.
In cross section, the air tubes 1304 are substantially that of a segment of a circle.
Although of a different cross-sectional shape, the air tubes 1304 preferably include an
.   m A01q0q12r8q_1 12n0ArfO12                l 9

equivalent diameter (by measuring the cross-sectional area of the air tube 1304 and
solving for an equivalent diameter) that resides within the prescribed range of about 2% to
50% of the bottleneck diameter    DBottleneck- In addition, the length of the air tubes 1304
preferably also be within the prescribed values given above (that is,       LBottleneck LAir Tube :
2 5 %BL).  Use of a portion of the perimeter member 416 as part of the air tubes 1304 is
advantageous because less materials are used in the manufacturing process.
[00121]          Referring now to Figs. 15 and 16, in at least one embodiment a pressure
equalizer 1500 comprises air tubes 404 that include curved portions along their
longitudinal length, such as along distal portions of their length. Such distal curved
portions 1504 may provide advantageous routing of air as fluid exits the liquid flow
channel of the pressure equalizer and air enters the bottle through the air tubes 404.
[00122]      With reference now to Fig. 17, and in accordance with at least one
embodiment of the present disclosure, a bottle in the form of a jug 1700 is shown that
includes a pressure equalizer 1704 comprising a single air tube 404 having a curved distal
portion 1504. The curved distal portion 1504 extends into a handle 1708 of the jug 1700.
Accordingly, a single air tube located opposite the side of pour can prevent the glugging
effect. Figs. 18 and 19 illustrate top and bottom perspective views, respectively, of an
insert type of pressure equalizer 1704.
[00123]       Referring now to Figs. 20-23, and in accordance with at least one
embodiment, a series of pressure equalizers are shown that include a single air tube
having cross-sectional area shapes different from a circle. More particularly, Figs. 20 and
21 illustrate a pressure equalizer 2000 with air tubes 2004, wherein the air tubes 2004
comprise a substantially rectangular cross-sectional area shape. Figs. 22 and 23 illustrate
a pressure equalizer 2200 with air tubes 2204, wherein the air tubes 2204 comprise a
substantially triangular cross-sectional area shape. Here, it noted that the air tubes 2004
and 2204 comprise a perimeter portion 2008 and 2208 that substantially match the
curvature of a portion of the perimeter member 416. That is, an arc 1310 is associated
with the perimeter portions 2008 and 2208 that substantially match the curvature of a
portion of the perimeter member 416 (for an insert) or the interior surface 128 of the
bottleneck 152 (for an integrally formed pressure equalizer).
[00124]       Referring now to Figs. 24 and 25, a pressure equalizer 2400 is shown that
includes a single air tube 404, wherein the air tube is interiorly offset from perimeter wings,
the perimeter wings constituting modified perimeter member. For pressure equalizer
2400, the air tube 404 resides along struts 2408 that interconnect the air tube 404 to a first
perimeter wing 2404a and a second perimeter wing 2404b. As with other embodiments
described herein, for embodiments wherein the pressure equalizer 2400 is an insert, the

perimeter wings 2404a and 2404b are configured to fixedly engage (e.g., by friction fit,
threads, welding, adhesive, and/or fastener) the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152
of the bottle 100. Alternatively, if the pressure equalizer 2400 is integrally formed as part
of the bottle 100, then struts 2408 interconnect the air tube 404 to the interior surface 128
of the bottleneck 152.
[00125]      For the various embodiments of the pressure equalizers described above, the
cross-sectional areas of the air tubes are depicted as being substantially constant from the
upper inlet rim 408 to the lower end edge 412 of each air tube 404. However, it is to be
understood that the cross-sectional areas may vary. Moreover, with reference now to
Figs. 26-29, and in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present disclosure, a
pressure equalizer 2600 is provided having one or more air tubes 2604, wherein the air
tubes 2604 include a proximal end 2608 with a flared portion 2612. Accordingly, because
of the presence of the flared portion 2612, the cross-sectional area of the air tube 2604
decreases along at least a portion of the longitudinal length of the air tube 2604. That is,
from the upper inlet rim 408 to the flared portion base 2616. In at least one embodiment,
the flared portion 2612 extends distally no further than the bottleneck base 160 of the
bottleneck 152. From the flared portion base 2616 of the flared portion 2612 to the lower
end edge 412 of the air tubes 2604, the air tubes 2604 have a substantially constant air
tube diameter    DAir Tube that resides within the prescribed range of about 2% to 50% of the
bottleneck diameter      DBottleneck. In addition, the length of the air tubes 2604 preferably also
be within the prescribed values given above (that is, LBottleneck         LAirTube s 2 5%BL). Use of a
flared portion 2612 as part of the air tubes 2604 is advantageous because it assists in
routing the liquid away from the top of the air tubes, thereby mitigating the top of the air
tubes from being flooded by the liquid exiting the container, allowing air to more easily
enter the air inlet tubes.
[00126]      With reference now to Figs. 28 and 29, the pressure equalizer 2600 is depicted
as an insert. Accordingly, for embodiments wherein the pressure equalizer 2600 is an
insert, the perimeter member 416 is configured to fixedly engage (e.g., by friction fit,
threads, welding, adhesive, and/or fastener) the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152
of the bottle 100. Alternatively, if the pressure equalizer 2600 is integrally formed as part
of the bottle 100, then the air tubes 2604 are positioned directly around the interior surface
 128 of the bottleneck 152.
[00127]      Referring now to Fig. 30, and in accordance with at least one embodiment of
the present disclosure, a bottle 100 is shown that includes pressure equalizer 3000 that
includes a single air tube 3004. As best seen in Fig. 31, the single air tube 3004 includes
a flared portion 2612. In at least one embodiment, the flared portion includes an arc 1310
associated with a perimeter portion 3008 that substantially matches the curvature of a
.r-  AO1q0q129r9_-1 12AOArOr12;             I ai

portion of the perimeter member 416 (for an insert) or the interior surface 128 of the
bottleneck 152 (for an integrally formed pressure equalizer). Use of a flared portion 2612
as part of the air tube 3004 is advantageous because a single air tube 3004 can be
associated with a bottle without a handle and the liquid can be poured without glugging
and without regard to the direction that the bottle is oriented.
[00128]       Referring now to Figs. 32 and 33, in at least one embodiment a pressure
equalizer 3200 includes a perimeter air inlet channel 3204 and one or more air tubes
3208. The air tubes 3208 are in fluid communication with the perimeter air inlet channel
3204 to facilitate flow of air from the perimeter air inlet channel 3204 to the one or more air
tubes 3208 when liquid is being poured from a bottle having the pressure equalizer 3200.
As shown in Fig. 32, the perimeter air channel 3204 includes a perimeter member 416, a
base 3300 (as best seen in Fig. 33), and an interior channel wall 3216 that is substantially
parallel to the perimeter member 416, but offset radially to the interior of the perimeter
member 416. The base 3300 may be a sloped region between the perimeter member 416
and the interior channel wall 3216. Again, for embodiments wherein the pressure
equalizer 3200 is an integral portion of a bottle, the perimeter member 416 may be a
portion of the bottle wall 104, such as a portion of the bottleneck 152. In at least one
embodiment, an upper rim 3228 of the perimeter air inlet channel 3204 substantially
corresponds to the bottle rim 136 when the pressure equalizer 3200 is associated with a
bottle 100.
[00129]       Referring now to Fig. 33, in at least one embodiment, the upper extent 3304 of
the air tube 3208 terminates at the base 3300 of the perimeter air channel 3204.
Alternatively, the upper extent 3304 of the air tube may be situated above the base 3300
of the perimeter air channel 3204, but below the upper rim 3228 of the perimeter air
channel 3204.
[00130]       As depicted in Fig. 32, a channel top 3220 of the perimeter air inlet channel
3204 may be open. Alternatively, at least portions of the channel top 3220 may be closed
(not shown) while one or more other portions of the channel top are open.
[00131]       Still referring to Figs. 32 and 33, in use, regardless of the direction the bottle is
oriented for pouring of the liquid relative to the one or more air inlet tubes 3208, air can
enter the bottle via the perimeter air inlet channel 3204 and the one or more air tubes 3208
as fluid is poured from the bottle via exit channel 3224.
[00132]       Referring now to Figs. 34-37, in at least one embodiment, a pressure equalizer
3400 includes a plurality of air tubes 3208 fluidly interconnected to a perimeter air channel
3204, wherein the perimeter air channel 3204 may comprise one or more flow blocks
3404. More particularly, the pressure equalizer 3400 includes a plurality of air tubes 3208
 rm  AO1qfq19r  q-1 12)OArOr12             15

that are interconnected to the perimeter air channel 3204 at its base 3300. The perimeter
air channel 3204 includes flow blocks 3404 for preventing migration of liquid around the
perimeter air channel 3204 when a bottle using the pressure equalizer 3400 is tipped for
pouring a liquid from the bottle. At least one air tube of the plurality of air tubes 3208 is
situated circumferentially between the flow blocks 3404 around the perimeter air channel
3204.
[00133]       Referring now to Figs. 38 and 39, in at least one embodiment of the present
disclosure, a pressure equalizer 3800 is shown that includes a plurality of air tubes 3804.
Although not required, the air tubes are shown clustered within approximately one half of
the bottleneck 152. The air tubes 3804 preferably have an air tube length         LAirTube within
the prescribed values given above (that is, LBottleneck    5 LAir Tube 2 5%BL). In addition, each
of the air tubes 3804 preferably has an air tube diameter DAirTube of between about 2% to
50% of the bottleneck diameter       DBotleneck. For the pressure equalizer 3800 shown in Figs.
38 and 39, there are ten separate air tubes 3804 shown. However, it is to be understood
that greater or fewer than ten separate air tubes 3804 are within the scope of the present
embodiment. The air tubes 3804 may have uniform air tube diameters, or they may have
differing air tube diameters. In addition, one or more of the air tubes 3804 may have flared
portions. At least a portion of the upper inlet rim 408 of the air tubes 3804 is preferably
situated within a rim proximity distance that is less than or equal to 5% of the bottleneck
length LBottleneck.
[00134]       Referring still to Figs. 38 and 39, and as with other embodiments described
and shown herein, when in use, air may enter the bottle 100 through one or more of the air
tubes 3804. In addition, liquid may exit the bottle 100 through one or more of the air tubes
3804 as air enters other air tubes 3804. However, the existence of multiple air tubes 3804
facilitates separate flow paths for air to enter the bottle 100, thereby enabling air to find a
path into the bottle 100 while the liquid exits the bottle 100.
[00135]       With reference to Fig. 39, the pressure equalizer 3800 is depicted as an insert.
Accordingly, for embodiments wherein the pressure equalizer 3800 is an insert, the
perimeter member 416 is configured to fixedly engage (e.g., by friction fit, threads,
welding, adhesive, and/or fastener) the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152 of the
bottle 100. Alternatively, if the pressure equalizer 3800 is integrally formed as part of the
bottle 100, then the air tubes 3804 are positioned around a portion of the interior surface
 128 of the bottleneck 152, and a number of the air tubes 3804 may be connected or
interconnected to each other, particularly those air tubes 3804 residing within the inner
interior portion of the bottleneck 152 and not situated directly adjacent the interior surface
 128 of the bottleneck 152.

[00136]       Referring now to Figs. 40 and 41, in at least one embodiment of the present
disclosure, a pressure equalizer 4000 is shown that includes a plurality of air tubes 4004.
The pressure equalizer 4000 has particular application to situations wherein a high volume
and/or a high flow rate of liquid is anticipated. As can be seen, the plurality of air tubes
4004 occupies a significant portion of the bottleneck 152. The air tubes 4004 preferably
have an air tube length     LAir Tube within the prescribed values given above (that is,  LBottleneck <
LAirTube i 2 5%BL).    In addition, each of the air tubes 4004 preferably has an air tube
diameter   DAir Tube of between about 2% to 50% of the bottleneck diameter      DBottleneck.  For
the pressure equalizer 4000 shown in Figs. 40 and 41, there are nineteen separate air
tubes 4004 shown. However, it is to be understood that greater or fewer than nineteen
separate air tubes 4004 are within the scope of the present embodiment. The air tubes
4004 may have uniform air tube diameters, or they may have differing air tube diameters.
In addition, one or more of the air tubes 4004 may have flared portions.
[00137]       With reference to Fig. 41, the pressure equalizer 4000 is depicted as an insert.
Accordingly, for embodiments wherein the pressure equalizer 4000 is an insert, the
perimeter member 416 is configured to fixedly engage (e.g., by friction fit, threads,
welding, adhesive, and/or fastener) the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152 of the
bottle 100. Alternatively, if the pressure equalizer 4000 is integrally formed as part of the
bottle 100, then the air tubes 4004 are positioned around a portion of the interior surface
 128 of the bottleneck 152, and a number of the air tubes 4004 may be connected or
interconnected to each other, particularly those air tubes 4004 residing within the inner
interior portion of the bottleneck 152 and not situated directly adjacent the interior surface
 128 of the bottleneck 152.
[00138]       Referring still to Figs. 40 and 41, and as with other embodiments described
and shown herein, when in use, air may enter the bottle 100 through one or more of the air
tubes 4004. In addition, liquid may exit the bottle 100 through one or more of the air tubes
4004 as air enters other air tubes 4004. However, the existence of multiple air tubes 4004
facilitates separate flow paths for air to enter the bottle, thereby enabling air to find a path
into the bottle 100 while the liquid exits the bottle 100.
[00139]       Referring now to Figs. 42 and 43, in at least one embodiment of the present
disclosure, a pressure equalizer 4200 is shown that includes a plurality of air tubes 4204
that resided within an air tube assembly 4208. As with pressure equalizer 4000, the
pressure equalizer 4200 has particular application to situations wherein a high volume
and/or a high flow rate of liquid is anticipated. As can be seen, the plurality of air tubes
4204 occupy a significant portion of the bottleneck 152. The air tubes 4204 preferably
have an air tube length     LAir Tube within the prescribed values given above (that is, LBottleneck

LAir Tube s 2 5 %BL).    In addition, each of the air tubes 4204 preferably has an air tube
diameter     DAir Tube (or equivalent air tube diameter as described herein) of between about
2% to 50% of the bottleneck diameter          DBottleneck. For the pressure equalizer 4200 shown in
Figs. 42 and 43, there are three concentric rings of air tubes with a further central air tube.
The air tubes 4204 may have substantially uniform cross-sectional areas, or they may
have differing cross-sectional areas with differing shapes. In addition, the air tubes 4204
residing within the air tube assembly 4208 may form a pattern or they may be randomly
arranged. In addition, one or more of the air tubes 4204 may have flared portions.
[00140]         With reference to Fig. 43, the pressure equalizer 4200 is depicted as an insert.
Accordingly, for embodiments wherein the pressure equalizer 4200 is an insert, the
perimeter member 416 is configured to fixedly engage (e.g., by friction fit, threads,
welding, adhesive, and/or fastener) the interior surface 128 of the bottleneck 152 of the
bottle 100. Alternatively, if the pressure equalizer 4200 is integrally formed as part of the
bottle 100, then the air tubes 4204 are positioned around a portion of the interior surface
 128 of the bottleneck 152, and a number of the air tubes 4204 may be connected or
interconnected to each other, particularly those air tubes 4204 residing within the inner
interior portion of the bottleneck 152 and not situated directly adjacent the interior surface
 128 of the bottleneck 152. Sidewalls between the air tubes 4204 may be shared.
[00141]         Referring still to Figs. 42 and 43, and as with other embodiments described
and shown herein, when in use, air may enter the bottle 100 through one or more of the air
tubes 4204. In addition, liquid may exit the bottle 100 through one or more of the air tubes
4204 as air enters other air tubes 4204. However, the existence of multiple air tubes 4204
facilitates separate flow paths for air to enter the bottle, thereby enabling air to find a path
into the bottle 100 while the liquid exits the bottle 100.
[00142]         Referring now to Fig. 44, and in accordance with at least one embodiment of
the present disclosure, a carrier cap 4400 is shown that incorporates a cap 148 with a
pressure equalizer, such as any one of the pressure equalizers described herein. By
attaching a pressure equalizer to the inside of a bottle cap 148, a snap-capper or a rotary
chuck capping machine can install the pressure equalizer at the same time as the bottle is
being capped, using the same machinery. Such a configuration provides time and cost
savings for utilization of the pressure equalizers described herein. The pressure equalizer
insert is attached to the cap in a similar way as the safety strip that is currently used to
secure caps on bottles, such as two-liter beverage bottles. Accordingly, caps with
pressure equalizer inserts are operatively associated with a bottle 100 when the caps 148
are applied with capping machines that insert the pressure equalizers with the caps 148
after filling the bottles 100. The bottle 100 is then ready for use by the consumer, and the
previously installed pressure equalizer is in place for mitigating glugging when the liquid is
.-    Afl1qfl19irL,,1  19flArf '1            IR

poured from the bottle 100. Accordingly, in use, the pressure equalizer breaks free from
the cap 148 when the consumer twists off the cap 148 for the first time in the same way
that the consumer breaks the safety strip.
[00143]      Referring now to Figs. 45A-C, another embodiment of a container 45 will be
described in accordance with at least some embodiments of the present disclosure.
Although the term "container" will be used with respect to this and other embodiments, it
should be appreciated that term "container" as well as the term "bottle" used herein can
both be used to refer to any liquid holding and/or dispensing unit.
[00144]      The container 45, in some embodiments, corresponds to traditional gable top
packaging. In this embodiment, the container 45 comprises an integral pressure equalizer
4500. The pressure equalizer 4500 may be manufactured such that its outer surfaces
which are exposed above the top of the container 45 are similar or identical to traditional
spout fitments that are ultrasonically welded to the container 45. Accordingly, the
pressure equalizer 4500 may be configured to be ultrasonically welded to the container 45
and, therefore, can become an integral part of the container 45.
[00145]      One difference between the container 45 and other bottles discussed herein is
that the container 45 does not comprise a "neck" per se. However, the "bottle length" of
the container 45 may be equal to the entire length of the container 45 from its base to its
top most portion within the cavity of the container 45. The "bottleneck length" of the
container 45 may be equal to the height of the tilted opening of the container (e.g., from
top of outer rim to bottom of outer rim).
[00146]      In some embodiments, the inner surfaces of the pressure equalizer 4500 may
be similar to other pressure equalizers discussed herein. As can be seen in Figs. 45B-C
and 46A-C, the pressure equalizer 4500 may comprise an air tube 4504, which extends
from an upper inlet rim 4508 to a lower end edge 4512. The air tube 4504, in some
embodiments may be cylindrical. In some embodiments, the air tube 4504 comprises a
cross-sectional shape other than circular (e.g., elliptical, square, rectangular, triangular,
etc.) . In some embodiments, the air tube 4504 may have a tapered portion whereby the
cross-sectional area of the air tube 4504 closer to the upper inlet rim 4508 is larger than
the cross-sectional area of the air tube 4504 closer to the lower end edge 4512.
[00147]      Another aspect of the pressure equalizer 4500 is that the outer surface 4524
may be configured to emulate traditional spout fitments that are integrated into containers
similar to container 45. In particular, the outer surface 4524 of the pressure equalizer
4500 may comprise one or more threads 4516 at its top most portion as well as a rim 4520
positioned at some point below the threads 4516. The rim 4520 may extend beyond the
outer circumference of the threads 4516 and the rim 4520 may comprise a thickness that
.r-  A01q0q129r9_-1 12A0ArOr12;         IQ

is comparable to the thickness of the wall of the container 45. In some embodiments, a
transition feature 4528 resides between the threads 4516 and the rim 4520, although a
transition feature 4528 is not required.
[00148]      An inner surface 4532 of the pressure equalizer 4500 may be similar to the
inner surfaces of other pressure equalizers discussed herein in that the inner surface 4532
may be generally cylindrical in nature except where the cylinder is disrupted by the air
tube 4504 which is integrated into the perimeter member. The difference with this
pressure equalizer 4500 is that the perimeter member comprises an outer surface 4524
with features which are configured to receive a screw-on-lid rather than to slide into the
neck of a container.
[00149]       In some embodiments, the air tube 4504 extends beyond the rim 4520 but is
not more than three times longer than the length between the rim 4520 and top of the
pressure equalizer 4500. In some embodiments, the air tube 4504 may not have a length
greater than twice the length of the inner cylindrical surface 4532 of the perimeter
member.
[00150]      Another aspect of the present disclosure is that the pressure equalizers
descried herein do not necessarily have to be designed as inserts for containers. Rather,
the pressure equalizer 4500 provides but one example of a pressure equalizer which is a
spout fitment that can be ultrasonically welded to (or otherwise connected to) the container
45.
[00151]      With reference now to Figs. 47A-C, a container 47 similar to container 45 will
be described in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. Container 47
also comprises an integrated pressure equalizer 4700. As can be seen in Figs. 47B-C and
48A-C, the pressure equalizer 4700 may have an outer surface 4724 that is similar or
identical to the outer surface 4524 of pressure equalizer 4500. Specifically, the outer
surface 4724 of pressure equalizer 4700 may comprise threads 4716, a rim 4720, and a
transition feature 4728 located between the threads 4716 and rim 4720. The pressure
equalizer 4700 may be configured to be integrated into the container 47 during the
container 47 manufacturing process rather than being inserted into the container 47 after it
has been manufactured.
[00152]      The pressure equalizer 4700 differs from pressure equalizer 4500, however, in
that pressure equalizer 4700 comprises a plurality of air tubes 4704 located on the inner
surface 4732 of the perimeter member. Each of the air tubes 4704 may comprise an
upper inlet rim 4708 and a lower end edge 4712. In some embodiments, the air tubes
4704 extend beyond the rim 4720 but are not more than three times longer than the length
between the rim 4720 and top of the pressure equalizer 4700. In some embodiments, the

air tubes 4704 may not have a length greater than twice the length of the inner cylindrical
surface 4732 of the perimeter member.
[00153]      In some embodiments, the length of each air tube 4704 may be the same
within a machining tolerance. In some embodiments, the length of one air tube 4704 may
differ from the length of at least one other air tube 4704. In some embodiments, the
lengths of two or more air tubes 4704 may differ from each other as well as at least one
other air tube 4704. In some embodiments, the air tubes 4704 are positioned
symmetrically around the inner surface 4732 of the pressure equalizer 4700, while in other
embodiments the air tubes 4704 may be positioned asymmetrically around the inner
surface 4732.
[00154]      Figs. 49A-B depict yet another container 49 in accordance with at least some
embodiments of the present disclosure. The container 49 may be similar or identical to
the jug 1700. However, as can be seen in Figs. 50A-C, the pressure equalizer 4900
designed for the container 49 may be specifically designed to conform to the inner
surfaces of the container 49. More specifically, the container 49 may comprise a plurality
of internal depressions or features along its bottleneck. In some embodiments, the
pressure equalizer 4900 may comprise a number of external features cut into the
tops/outer surface(s) of the air tubes 4904. As a non-limiting example, for conforming with
the interior of the container 49, the pressure equalizer 4900 may comprise a first tapered
section 4908 just below the top surface of the pressure equalizer 4900. Below the first
tapered section 4908 there may be a first outer surface 4912 that partially cut into the air
tubes 4904. The first outer surface 3912 may comprise a first diameter that conforms with
an upper-most diameter of the bottleneck in container 49.
[00155]      A first transition feature 4916 may be provided that separates the first outer
surface 4912 from a second outer surface 4920. In some embodiments, the first transition
feature 4916 comprises a stair-step feature and the second outer surface 4920 comprises
a second diameter that is larger than the first diameter of the first outer surface 4912.
Furthermore, the second diameter may conform with a second diameter of the bottleneck
in container 49. It should be appreciated that the container 49 comprises additional
internal features, the outer surface of the pressure equalizer 4900 may be cut, molded, or
otherwise manufactured to conform therewith.
[00156]      In some embodiments, the pressure may further comprise a rim 4924 that
locks into a notch established in the interior of the container 49. The rim 4924 may further
comprise one or more notches 4928 if the internal nature of the container 49 requires such
a feature to conform therewith. Other features may be incorporated into the exterior of the
pressure equalizer 4900 depending upon the type of container or bottle into which
.r-  A01q0q129r9_-1 12A0ArOr12           ? I

pressure equalizer 4900 is inserted.
[00157]       Another aspect of the present disclosure will now be discussed in connection
with Figs. 50A-B. In some embodiments, the pressure equalizer 4900 may be
compressed or squeezed by forces applied on its outersurface such that the diameter of
the pressure equalizer 4900 at any circumference is reduced. In particular, Fig. 50A
shows the pressure equalizer 4900 in a first state or pinched state. Fig. 50B shows the
pressure equalizer 4900 in a second state or un-pinched state. By providing the pressure
equalizer 4900 with the ability to temporarily deform under pressure and then return to its
original geometry when the pressure is removed, the pressure equalizer 4900 can be
more easily inserted into the bottlenecks of various containers or bottles. Furthermore,
where a pressure equalizer 4900 is provided with one or more features on its outer
surface, it is advantageous to pinch the pressure equalizer 4900 and then insert the
pressure equalizer 4900 into the container 49. Once inserted, the pressure equalizer
4900 can be released, thereby allowing the pressure equalizer 4900 to return to its initial
geometry and recess itself into the depressions/ features within the inside of the container
49.
[00158]       In some embodiments it may be desirable to provide a pressure equalizer
4900 that is constructed of a material that is capable of deforming elastically under
compression or tension such that its largest external feature can fit within the smallest
internal feature of the container's 49 bottleneck. More specifically, the pressure equalizer
4900 may be at least partially constructed of a polymer such as plastic, rubber, and the
like. Even more specifically, the pressure equalizer 4900 may be constructed of any
recyclable material and the type of material selected for manufacturing the pressure
equalizer 4900 may be based on the material(s) used to construct the container/bottle. In
some embodiments, the material used for the pressure equalizer 4900 may correspond to
the same material used to make the container 49. More specific examples of materials
that may be used to construct the pressure equalizer 4900 and other pressure equalizers
described herein include, without limitation, polyethylene (high-density and low-density),
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC), epoxy, polyamide (PA) or nylon,
rubber, synthetic rubber, cellulose-based plastics, glass, or combinations thereof.
[00159]       Another aspect of the present disclosure will now be discussed in connection
with Figs. 51A-52B. In particular, a modified container 51 is depicted having a pressure
equalizer 5100 integrated thereto. Details of the pressure equalizer 5100 are depicted in
Figs. 52A and 52B.
.r-  A01q0q129r9_-1 12A0ArOr112        ?

[00160]       In some embodiments, the container 51 comprises a neck and shoulder as in
prior art containers, except that a portion of the neck is removed and the pressure
equalizer 5100 is mounted to the remaining lower portion of the container 51. By
removing a portion of the neck, the amount of material required to produce the container
51 can be reduced. Furthermore, the most common point of failure in containers is the
neck portion. By removing a portion of the neck, the strength of the container 51 (e.g., as
measured by withstanding compression forces applied at the top of the container 51) is
greatly increased, thereby enabling thinner sidewalls and further reducing the amount of
material required to manufacture the container 51.
[00161]       It should be appreciated that any of the pressure equalizers described herein
may be used to greatly decrease the amount of material required to manufacture the
container as a whole. In particular, while additional materials may be needed to construct
the various component parts of the pressure equalizer, those additional materials are
more than offset by the amount of material savings that can be realized for the container
as a whole, thereby reducing the overall amount of material used to manufacture a
container.
[00162]       Indeed, even without using pressure equalizers as described herein, wall
thickness and other innovations have reduced weight and plastic (particularly PET)
consumption, creating 500 ml bottles that weigh as little as 9.2 grams and have and
interior bottleneck diameter of approximately 21.8 mm. In accordance with at least some
embodiments of the present disclosure, however, a pressure equalizer can be used to
further reduce the amount of material required to produce a 500 ml bottle made from PET
(or a similar plastic/resin). As one non-limiting example, by implementing a pressure
equalizer as described herein, the bottleneck diameter may be reduced to approximately
 11.5 mm and the undesirable glugging can be avoided. Furthermore, by employing a
pressure equalizer as described herein, the overall weight of a 500 ml bottle made from
PET can be reduced by approximately 8.5 to 14.5 percent (e.g., have a weight of
approximately 8.42 grams to approximately 7.87 grams). Indeed, a 500 ml bottle can be
achieved with significantly less material, even though more material is included at the
bottleneck vis-a-vis the pressure equalizer. These material savings result in substantial
savings to bottle manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of containers.
Meanwhile, the container now has the ability to pour liquids accurately and without glug,
whereas if a container were manufactured with the smaller bottleneck of approximately
 11.5 mm without a pressure equalizer, it would take significantly longer for fluid to pour
from the container.
[00163]      One or more of the pressure equalizer designs described herein may be
capable of reducing material requirements by up to 20 percent as compared to the most

aggressive current container designs. In particular, certain embodiments of a pressure
equalizer described herein have been shown to achieve 500 ml containers that are 20
percent lighter than current state-of-the-art 500 ml containers manufactured with similar
materials. As material costs continue to increase, any amount of material savings without
negatively impacting the container's performance is seen as a monumental step forward.
[00164]      Another advantage is that a smaller diameter bottleneck or opening may be
employed even when the container has hard or rigid sidewalls along its body. In other
words, the pressure equalizer may allow liquids (even highly viscous ones) to exit the
container through a smaller opening without requiring the sidewalls to be highly
deformable. This essentially means that structural integrity of the container can be
maintained while simultaneously decreasing the diameter of the bottleneck/opening.
[00165]      As can be seen in Fig. 51A, the pressure equalizer 5100 may comprise a
flange 5104. The flange 5104 may be used as the point of connection between the
pressure equalizer 5100 and the rest of the container 51. In some embodiments, the
pressure equalizer 5100 may be produced in one manufacturing step and the body and
neck of the container 51 may be produced in a separate manufacturing step. The flange
5104 provides the point of contact between the pressure equalizer 5100 and the container
51 and may be the point where the pressure equalizer 5100 is connected to the container
51 (e.g., via ultrasonic welding, heat-based welding, radio frequency welding, gluing, or
the like).
[00166]      In some embodiments, the pressure equalizer 5100 and its component parts
may be constructed of a material that is similar or identical to the material used to
construct the container 51. The component parts of the pressure equalizer 5100, in some
embodiments, may include the flange 5104 that separates an upper portion 5204 from a
lower portion 5208 of the pressure equalizer 5100. The upper portion may include threads
5212 and a neck 5216 that is positioned between the flange 5104 and a cap stop. As with
other pressure equalizers discussed herein, the pressure equalizer 5100 may also
comprise a number of air tubes 5220 that extend from the top of the opening of the
pressure equalizer 5100 through the top portion 5204 and the bottom portion 5208. The
air tubes 5220 may be constructed by sidewalls 5232 that separate the main outlet 5224
from the air inlet portions 5228. In some embodiments, the tubes 5220 may be
constructed of extruded plastic tubes that are cut to dimension and then attached to the
inner walls of the pressure equalizer 5100. Such a manufacturing process enables a
quicker and more cost-effective option for producing the finished container 51.
Specifically, the body of the container 51 can be manufactured via known methods and the
pressure equalizer 5100 may be attached to the shoulder of the container 51 in a separate
manufacturing step.

[00167]        In some embodiments, the diameter of the flange 5104 can be larger than the
diameter of the shoulder of the container 51 to which the flange 5104 is attached. By
providing a larger flange 5104, the manufacturing process can be completed with more
flexibility. In particular, there can be some room for error in the placement of the pressure
equalizer 5100 relative to the shoulder of the container 51. This makes the manufacturing
process both faster and more cost-effective.
[00168]        With reference now to Figs. 53A-55B, another container 53 will be described in
accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The container 53 may be
constructed similarly to the container 51 in that the portion of the container 53 above its
shoulders (e.g., the pressure equalizer 5304) can be manufactured in a separate
manufacturing process from the portion of the container 53 below its shoulders (e.g., the
body portion 55).
[00169]        The embodiment of the container 53 differs from container 51 in that the
pressure equalizer 5304 comprises a shoulder and neck portion 5308 that is skinnier (e.g.,
of a smaller diameter) than the shoulder and neck portion of a traditional container.
Furthermore, the entirety of the pressure equalizer 5304 is above its flange 5312. As can
be seen in Figs. 54A and 54B, the pressure equalizer 5304 may comprise a cap stopper
5404 below the threading and the shoulder and neck portion 5308. The taper of the
shoulder and neck portion 5308 is greater than the taper of a shoulder and neck portion of
a traditional two liter bottle. Accordingly, the diameter of the container 53 is the same at
the flange 5312, but the diameter of the opening of the pressure equalizer 5304 is
significantly less than a diameter of the opening in a traditional two liter bottle. In some
embodiments, the diameter of the opening of the pressure equalizer 5304 is around about
 10.5 mm (inner diameter of opening). Most traditional two liter bottles have an opening
diameter of about 22.23 mm (inner diameter of opening). Accordingly, the pressure
equalizer 5304 enables a diameter of less than half of traditional bottles, while also
allowing liquids to pour through smoothly and without "glug."
[00170]        In some embodiments, the pressure equalizer 5304 comprises an opening
diameter of about 10.5 mm and can accommodate the smooth (e.g., without "glug")
pouring of many types of liquids having various viscosities. As some non-limiting
examples, the container 53 can hold liquids having a viscosity approximately equal to
water at approximately similar temperatures. Even more specifically, the pressure
equalizer 5304 enables the smooth pouring of liquids having a dynamic viscosity of
approximately 1000 Centipoise at 20 degrees Celsius. Fluids having viscosities greater
than water at room temperature (e.g., similar to molasses or oil at room temperature) may
also be poured out of the container 53 through the pressure equalizer 5304 without
.r-  AO1q0q129r9_-1 12AOArOr12           ?5

glugging. By providing a container 53 with a smaller opening, the accuracy with which
fluid is poured out of the container 53 can be greatly increased. Simultaneously, the
material costs for the container 53 can be reduced because the overall amount of material
required to produce the container 53 is also reduced. Further still, it is possible to achieve
a container 53 with a smaller opening that does not have deformable walls. Rather, a
typical bottle or container having substantially non-deformable body walls (e.g., body
sidewalls that are not designed to be deformed or otherwise squeezed so as to completely
depress the body of the container). In particular, the container 53 may be manufactured
from a semi-crystalline PET and may have a density as described in U.S. Patent
Publication No. 2007/0108156, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated
herein by reference.
[00171]       Referring back to Figs. 54A and 54B, the component parts of the pressure
equalizer 5304 may further include a main outlet port 5408, one or more air inlets 5412,
and one or more dividing walls 5416 that separate the air inlets 5412 from the main outlet
port 5408. Similar to the pressure equalizer 5100 and other pressure equalizers
discussed herein, the number of air inlets 5412 can vary without departing from the scope
of the present disclosure.
[00172]       Figs. 55A and 55B show an intermediate container 55 before the pressure
equalizer 5304 is attached thereto. The intermediate container 55 may be similar to
traditional containers except that it is cut off at its neck/shoulders. A lip or flange 5504
may be established at the top of the intermediate container 55 and may provide a surface
that can be attached to the pressure equalizer 5304 (e.g., via ultrasonic welding, laser
welding, radio frequency welding, gluing/chemical welding, friction welding, spin welding,
shake welding, etc.). The size of the opening 5508 of the intermediate container 55 may
be the same size as the inner diameter of the pressure equalizer 5304 at its flange 5312,
but the outer diameter of the flange 5312 may be larger than the outer diameter of the lip
or flange 5504. The difference in the out diameters of the flanges may facilitate easier
attachment of the pressure equalizer 5304 to the intermediate container 55.
[00173]      With reference now to Figs. 56A and 56B, yet another container 56 will be
described in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The container 56
may comprise similar characteristics to container 53, except that the pressure equalizer
5604 may be integrated into the body of the container rather than being produced in a
separate manufacturing step. Accordingly, the pressure equalizer 5604 may comprise
similar components to the pressure equalizer 5304 (e.g., a main outlet port 5608, one or
more air inlets 5612, and one or more dividing walls 5616 that separate the air inlets 5612
from the main outlet port 5608). However, the pressure equalizer 5604 may not comprise
a flange or any other feature for connecting to the body of the container 56. Rather, the

container 56 may be produced as a single integrated product and the sidewalls 5616 (e.g.,
features that create the air inlets 5612) may be added to the container 56 after the
container has been created. In some embodiments, the air inlets 5612 (and specifically
the materials of the dividing walls 5616) may be cut to the appropriate dimension and
inserted in the opening of the container 56 (either before or after the container has been
filled with a liquid). The cut portions of material may then be ultrasonically welded or
otherwise attached to the inner surface of the bottleneck.
[00174]       Figs. 57A and 57B show yet another pressure equalizer 5704 in accordance
with embodiments of the present disclosure. The pressure equalizer 5704 is similar to the
pressure equalizer 5304 except that the pressure equalizer 5704 doesn't have a flange
5312. The pressure equalizer 5704 is also similar to the pressure equalizer 5604 except
that the pressure equalizer 5704 is attached to the body of a container in a separate
manufacturing step. Accordingly, the component parts of the pressure equalizer 5704
may be similar or identical to the component parts of the pressure equalizer 5604 and may
include a neck and shoulder 5708, a main outlet 5712, one or more air inlets 5716, one or
more dividing walls 5720, and a cap stopper 5724. As with other pressure equalizers
discussed herein, the material with which the pressure equalizer 5704 is manufactured
may include any type of known plastic, glass, synthetic, or the like.
[00175]       Figs. 58A thru 61 B depict other possible configurations of the inlet tubes that
may be used to further enhance the effectiveness of any pressure equalizer described
herein. Referring initially to Figs. 58A and 58B, a pressure equalizer 5804 is shown to
include an air inlet 5808 that extends the path that fluid within the container would have to
travel before arriving at the opening 5812. By extending the flow path within the air inlet
5808, the air inlet 5808 makes it more likely that air will flow from opening 5812 to opening
5816 rather than having fluid within the container flow from opening 5816 to opening 5812.
[00176]       In some embodiments, the air inlet 5808 comprises a first opening 5812
proximate to the opening of the container and a second opening 5816 that is within the
neck or shoulder of the container. A first bend 5820 may be positioned between the first
opening 5812 and second opening 5816. A first portion 5824 of the air inlet 5808 may be
positioned between the first opening 5812 and first bend 5820 while a second portion
5828 of the air inlet 5808 may be positioned between the second opening 5816 and the
first bend 5820. The length of the first portion 5824 may be greater than the length of the
second portion 5828. Furthermore, the diameters and/or profiles of the first opening 5812
and second opening 5816 do not necessarily have to be the same. Rather, the first
opening 5812 may be larger in diameter than the second opening 5816 or vice versa.
Likewise, the shape of the first opening 5812 does not necessarily have to be the same as
the shape of the second opening 5816.

[00177]        The pressure equalizer 5904 in Figs. 59A and 59B comprises an air inlet 5908
that is slightly different from air inlet 5808. Specifically, the air inlet 5908 comprises
multiple bends including a first and second upward bend 5920a, 5920b as well as a
downward bend 5928. A first portion 5924 of the air inlet 5908 may reside between the
first opening 5912 and the first upward bend 5920a. A second portion 5932a of the air
inlet 5908 may reside between the first upward bend 5920a and the downward bend 5928.
A third portion 5932b of the air inlet 5908 may reside between the downward bend 5928
and the second upward bend 5920b. The multiple bends between the first opening 5912
and the second opening 5916 may further increase the path that fluid would have to flow
through the air inlet 5908. Therefore, the fluid pouring out of the container having the
pressure equalizer 5904 will naturally select the main outlet of the container rather than
coming out of the air inlet 5908.
[00178]         It should be appreciated that the number of bends in the air inlet 5908 may be
greater or lesser than the number of bends shown in Figs. 59A and 59B. Specifically, the
air inlet 5908 may comprise one, two, three, four, five, six, or more bends without
departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Further still, the bends do not
necessarily have to be 180 degree bends, but rather can be bends of any amount. In
some embodiments, the bends may be 90 degree bends and the direction in which the
second opening faces is orthogonal to the direction in which the first opening faces. Any
other variations of the air inlets may also be performed in accordance with embodiments
of the present disclosure.
[00179]         Referring now to Figs. 60A and 60B, yet another type of pressure equalizer
6004 comprising yet another type of air inlet 6008 is shown in accordance with
embodiments of the present disclosure. The air inlet 6008 may comprise a helical shape
and contours or follows the inner diameter of the bottleneck. Similar to other air inlets, the
air inlet 6008 may comprise a first opening 6012 and a second opening 6016 with a helical
portion 6020 there between. The helical portion 6020 of the air inlet 6008 may be
integrated into the pressure equalizer 6004 or it may be manufactured separately and
connected to the inside wall of the bottleneck in a separate manufacturing step (e.g., via
ultrasonic welding). In some embodiments, the helical portion 6020 may be attached
continuously to the inside wall of the bottleneck. In other embodiments, the helical portion
6020 may be spot welded at discrete points to the inside wall of the bottleneck.
[00180]         Figs. 61A and 61 B show still another type of pressure equalizer 6104 having
multiple air inlets 6108a, 6108b. Each of the air inlets 6108a, 6108b may comprise helical
portions that wrap around the inner wall of the bottleneck. Each air inlet 6108a, 6108b
may also comprise first opening 6112a, 6112b and a second opening 6116a, 6116b. The
.r-   AOA~19rA1R    u 12AOArOr12          ?R

first openings 6112a, 6112b may be positioned across from one another (e.g. on opposite
sides of the bottle opening) and the helical portions of each air inlet 6108a, 6108b may fit
next to each other as they spiral down the bottleneck. Each air inlet 6108a, 6108b may be
similar or identical to the air inlet 6008. Accordingly, it should be appreciated that a
pressure equalizer may be equipped with one, two, three, four, or more similar types of
helically-shaped air inlets.
[00181]       As described herein, any number of manufacturing methods (e.g., fully
automated, partially-automated, manual) may be employed to produce a container having
a pressure equalizer. In some embodiments, a manufacturing method may: (1) employ
blow molding techniques to blow mold a smaller container top (e.g., having an inner
diameter of approximately 11.5 mm); (2) extrude the air inlet(s); and (3) attach the air
inlets to the inner sidewalls of the bottleneck using one or more of (friction welding,
ultrasonic welding, radio frequency welding, heat welding, gluing, or the like).
[00182]       As noted above, it is also possible to create a pressure equalizer that leaves
the support ledge and throat of the bottle the same size. To do this, the entire top of the
pre-formed container goes away, right down to the support ledge. The pressure equalizer
is then produced that includes the spout, air tubes, an appropriately-sized cap and a
break-band to indicate that the cap has not been removed. The pressure equalizer may
then be attached (e.g., welded and/or glued) to the top of the pre-formed container.
[00183]       As discussed above, it may also be possible to extrude the air tubes and
create a variety of snap-in systems, where each air tube is separately snapped into
features within the spout. Alternatively, or in addition, a complete pressure equalizer may
be provided with snaps or other friction fitting elements to snap the pressure equalizer into
place relative to the body of the container.
[00184]       Another advantage contemplated herein is the ability to employ bottle stacking.
Specifically, since the bottle cap size is reduced (e.g., due to the reduction in the diameter
of the bottle top), the top of one bottle or container may be sized to fit into the bottom of
another bottle.
[00185]       It should be appreciated that any number of materials may be used to
manufacture the pressure equalizers described herein. For example, metal, metal alloys,
non-metal alloys, ceramics, plastics, glass, and other materials used for the construction
of container may be used for the pressure equalizers without departing from the scope of
the present disclosure.
[00186]       In at least one embodiment of the various pressure described herein, the top
rim of the one or more air tubes associated with the pressure equalizer do not extend
.r-   AO1q0q129r9_-1 12AOArOr112         ?

above the bottle rim 136 of the bottle 100. Advantageously, a cap associated with the
bottle can be reused with the pressure equalizer in the bottle 100.
[00187]       Air tubes described herein preferably include solid, non-perforated tubing
walls. That is, there are no holes along the side walls of the air tubes between the upper
inlet rims 408 and the lower end edges 412 of the air tubes. In at least one embodiment of
all of the various pressure equalizers described herein, there are no holes along the side
walls of the air tubes between the upper inlet rims 408 and the lower end edges 412 of the
air tubes. In at least one embodiment of all of the various pressure equalizers described
herein, and as someone of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, if present, any holes
within the sidewalls of the air tubes preferably do not materially impact the flow
characteristics of the subject pressure equalizer.
[00188]       In at least one embodiment of the various pressure equalizers described
herein, the lower end edges of the air tubes do not extend below about 25% of the bottle
length BL
[00189]       In at least one embodiment of the various pressure described herein, at least a
portion of the upper inlet rim 408 of at least one air tube is situated within a rim proximity
distance that is less than or equal to 5% of the bottleneck length           LBottleneck
[00190]       In at least one embodiment of the various pressure equalizers described
herein, even if having a non-circular cross-sectional shape, the air tubes preferably include
a diameter or equivalent diameter (by measuring the cross-sectional area of the air tube
and solving for an equivalent diameter) that resides within a range of about 2% to 50% of
the bottleneck diameter     DBottleneck. In addition, the air tube length    LAirTube   of the air tubes is
greater than or equal to the bottleneck length        LBottleneck and less than or equal to about 25%
of the bottle length BL(that is, LBottleneck   LAirTube ! 2 5%BL).
[00191]       One, some, or all of the various pressure equalizers or containers described
herein may further benefit from having air tubes that are specifically configured with a low
profile design that maximize the equalization of pressure between the interior of the
container and the exterior of the container. Specifically, many different shapes of air tubes
were described. An oval, oblong, tear-shaped, egg-shaped, or eye-shaped air tube may
provide particularly good performance. This particular shape of air tube may maximize the
air inlets cross-sectional area near the outer diameter of the container opening but also
maximize the amount of area through which fluid is allowed to travel out of the container.
A pressure equalizer or insert may be configured with some air inlets of one shape and
some air inlets of another shape. Accordingly, a single container or pressure equalizer
may comprise multiple air inlets, each having a different cross-sectional shape than any
other air inlet.

[00192]       Another feature that may be useful to some or all of the embodiments
described herein is the ability to specifically configure air inlet dimensions to the size of
container and type of fluid which is poured out of the container. As some non-limiting
examples, a 1 liter soda container may have between three and six air inlets each having
a cross-sectional area between approximately __ and         ___  and each having a length
between approximately -__ and       ___.  As another non-limiting example, a 2 liter soda
container may have between three and six air inlets each having a cross-sectional area
between approximately        __ and ___  and each having a length between approximately        __
and ___.     As another non-limiting example, a 1 liter water bottle may have between three
and six air inlets each having a cross-sectional area between approximately       ___ and   __
and each having a length between approximately         __  and  ___.   As another non-limiting
example, a 1 liter juice bottle may have between three and six air inlets each having a
cross-sectional area between approximately       __- and   __  and each having a length
between approximately       -__ and ___.
[00193]       Another feature that may be useful to some or all of the embodiments
described herein is that the length of the air inlets can be kept to a length of no longer than
3 inches per air inlet. Specifically, it may be revealed that air inlets longer than 3 inches in
length are no more useful in equalizing pressure in a container than their shorter
counterparts. Accordingly, in an attempt to control material costs, it may be desirable to
maintain air inlet lengths to less than 3 inches.
[00194]           Yet another feature that may be useful to some or all of the embodiments
described herein is that containers with handles or other containers that have a generally
constant pour direction (e.g., gable top containers) may not require as many air inlets as
containers without such a constant pour direction. In other words, if the direction with
which a container is going to be poured is either controlled or somehow predictable, it may
be possible to reduce the number of air inlets to one or two air inlets rather than three to
six air inlets distributed evenly around the container opening. Moreover, the two or more
air inlets may be grouped at one strategic location of the container opening rather than
being evenly or randomly distributed about the container opening if the container has a
direction of pouring that is somewhat predictable.
[00195]       As discussed above, embodiments of the present disclosure may benefit from
one or more manufacturing methods that were previously unknown in the container and
bottle manufacturing arts. To list but several non-limiting examples, the concept of
building a fluid container that has substantially rigid (e.g., non-collapsable) body walls with
an opening smaller than 15mm is something that has not been possible in the prior art due
to the fact that fluid would simply get stuck in such a container without the advantage of
           arem 01901268_01
                      2AARR12)            I

the disclosed equalization mechanisms. In some embodiments, the way in which such a
container or inlet for a container may be manufactured is to create a container perform
with an opening smaller than 15mm. The container perform may otherwise size the
container in accordance with traditional design dimensions, but the container opening may
be kept smaller than 15mm, thereby decreasing the amount of materials required to
manufacture the container, increasing the pouring accuracy of the container, and the like.
[00196]      Another example of a useful manufacturing technique is the ability to create a
container perform with air inlet tubes. The air inlet tubes may be integral to the perform or
they may be separately manufactured (e.g., via extrusion), cut to the desired length, and
then attached to the container while it is still on the perform.
[00197]      In an alternative or additional manufacturing process, blow molding techniques
can be employed to weld pre-manufactured air inlets into the desired location.
Specifically, the blow molding process requires an increased heat, which may be sufficient
to at least partially plasticize the container and/or air inlet material. This increased heat
may also be sufficient to enable the air inlet to be stuck, adhered, welded, etc. to the inner
wall of the container or insert opening.
[00198]      In an alternative or additional manufacturing process, a welder may be used to
weld individual air inlet tubes into their desired location about the container and/or insert.
Specifically, the pre-manufactured air inlets may be welded to the container and/or insert
using any one of laser welding, ultrasonic welding, radio frequency welding,
gluing/chemical welding, friction welding, spin welding, and shake welding.
[00199]      In an alternative or additional manufacturing process, specifically in connection
with the manufacturing of an insert rather than a container with an integrated pressure
equalization device, a series of parts that include the finish (threaded male portion of the
bottle) along with half of the support ledge (e.g., 4520, 4720, 4924, 5104, 5312, or 5724),
the cap, the safety/tamper seal, the leakage seal, and the air inlets, can be installed at the
capper stage of the line instead of capping a pressure equalization device that is already
incorporated into a container. The separate construction of the finish, support ledge, cap,
tamper seal, leakage seal, and air inlets can be optimized separate from the construction
of the container itself and a final step (before or after filling the container with the desired
liquid) would be to connect to the container to the separately constructed finish and cap
via the support ledge. This final connection may be achieved using any of the welding,
gluing, or other attachment techniques described herein or otherwise known in the
container manufacturing arts.
[00200]      The present disclosure may be embodied in other specific forms without
departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be

considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the
disclosure is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing
description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the
claims are to be embraced within their scope.
[00201]       The one or more present disclosures, in various embodiments, include
components, methods, processes, systems and/or apparatus substantially as depicted
and described herein, including various embodiments, subcombinations, and subsets
thereof. Those of skill in the art will understand how to make and use the present
disclosure after understanding the present disclosure.
[00202]       The present disclosure, in various embodiments, includes providing devices
and processes in the absence of items not depicted and/or described herein or in various
embodiments hereof, including in the absence of such items as may have been used in
previous devices or processes (e.g., for improving performance, achieving ease and/or
reducing cost of implementation).
[00203]       The foregoing discussion of the disclosure has been presented for purposes of
illustration and description. The foregoing is not intended to limit the disclosure to the form
or forms disclosed herein. In the foregoing Detailed Description for example, various
features of the disclosure are grouped together in one or more embodiments for the
purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted
as reflecting an intention that the claimed disclosure requires more features than are
expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive aspects
lie in less than all features of a single foregoing disclosed embodiment. Thus, the following
claims are hereby incorporated into this Detailed Description, with each claim standing on
its own as a separate preferred embodiment of the disclosure.
[00204]       Moreover, though the description of the disclosure has included description of
one or more embodiments and certain variations and modifications, other variations and
modifications are within the scope of the disclosure (e.g., as may be within the skill and
knowledge of those in the art, after understanding the present disclosure). It is intended to
obtain rights which include alternative embodiments to the extent permitted, including
alternate, interchangeable and/or equivalent structures, functions, ranges or steps to those
claimed, whether or not such alternate, interchangeable and/or equivalent structures,
functions, ranges or steps are disclosed herein, and without intending to publicly dedicate
any patentable subject matter.
