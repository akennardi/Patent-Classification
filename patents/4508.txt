A SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FINDING DENTS ON AN AUTOMOBILE
USING A BOOTH
Field
[0001] This disclosure relates to a system and method for finding dents on an automobile using
a booth.
Background
[0002] Hail and other impacts can leave dents and creases on the body of an automobile. Such
minor damages can ruin the aesthetics of the automobile thus, methods for removing dents on
the body of an automobile has evolved over the years. One of the methods for repairing dent is
known as paintless dent repair (PDR). In this method, it is significant to be able to locate the
position of the dents precisely. As such, technicians need to use a PDR reading instruments such
as paintless dent repair light, reflection boards, fluorescent, or light-emitting diode (LED)
lighting to properly assess and locate the dents. This method can be effective in locating and
assessing the dent but can only do it from one specific area to another. Technicians would need
to move the PDR reading instruments in order to locate the dents of an entire car. Thus, using
such method of finding a dent can be time-consuming, inconvenient, and expensive.
[0003] As such it would be useful to have a system and method for finding dents on an
automobile using a booth.

Description of Embodiments
[0018] Described herein is a system and method for system and method for finding dents on an
   automobile using a booth. The following description is presented to enable any person
   skilled in the art to make and use the invention as claimed and is provided in the context of
   the particular examples discussed below, variations of which will be readily apparent to
   those skilled in the art. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation
   are described in this specification. It will be appreciated that in the development of any such
   actual implementation (as in any development project), design decisions must be made to
   achieve the designers' specific goals (e.g., compliance with system- and business-related
   constraints), and that these goals will vary from one implementation to another. It will also
   be appreciated that such development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but
   would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the field of the
   appropriate art having the benefit of this disclosure. Accordingly, the claims appended
   hereto are not intended to be limited by the disclosed embodiments, but are to be accorded
   their widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.
[0019] Figure 1 illustrates a booth 100. In one embodiment, booth 100 can be portable. Further,
   in one embodiment, booth can be non-inflatable, as shown in Figure 1, or inflatable. In a
   non-inflatable embodiment, a support structure 101 can provide the frame for booth 100. A
   plurality of wall sections 102 can connect to support structure 101 forming an interior space
    103 within booth 100. In an inflatable embodiment, booth 100 can be inflated and deflated
   for transportation from one location to another. Booth 100 can be large enough to provide an
   enclosed space for repairing dents on automobiles. Booth 100 can also prevent contaminants
   from the outer surrounding to enter booth 100. Booth 100 can further aid workers in finding
   minor damages on automobiles such as dents, as described below.
Figure 2 illustrates an inflatable embodiment of booth 100. For purposes of this disclosure,
booth 100 can be inflatable or non-inflatable. Booth can comprise any combination of support

                                                  4
structures 101, wall sections 102, a floor 201, and a roof 202, sufficient to create an interior
space 103 large enough for a vehicle to inhabit and one or more technicians to work within.
[0020] [As a non-limiting example wherein booth 100 is inflatable, support structures 101 can
    comprise of inflatable beams 101a. Each support structure 101 can be a plurality of u-shaped
    round columns connected side-by-side that, once inflated form wall sections 102 and roof
    202 of booth 100. Wall sections 102 can comprise inflatable portions, as well as non
    inflatable portions. In some embodiments, wall section 102 can comprise all or portion of
    support structure 101. Floor 201 can be placed at the bottom portion of wall sections 102. In
    one embodiment, floor 201 can comprise a durable plastic sheeting material such as high
    density polyethylene, which can serve as a chemical-resistant barrier to prevent outside
    contaminates from polluting the work area inside booth 100. Further, in one embodiment,
    wall sections 102 and floor 201 can comprise a durable sheet material such as plastic, or
    fabric that can include but are not limited to PVC (polyvinyl chloride) tarpaulins or oxford
    nylon.
[0021] Booth 100 can further comprise a plurality of support ropes 203. Ropes 203 can be in
    tying down booth 100 to the ground. If booth 100 is installed in windy areas, ropes 203 can
    secure booth 100 in place. Booth 100 can further comprise one or more air inlets 204. Air
    inlets 204 can be connectable to an air pump to allow air to enter and fill up inflatable beams
    101a. In one embodiment, air inlet 204 can be placed at the outer surface of booth 100. Air
    inlet 204 can be positioned at the bottom of one of support structure 101.
[0022] Figure 3 illustrates one of wall sections 102 comprising a passage 301. Passage 301 can
    be an opening large enough to accommodate an automobile. In one embodiment, Passage
    301 can comprise a slit 302 at the center of one of wall sections 102. In such structure, wall
    section 102 with passage 301 can spread open from the bottom center of slit 302 once
    automobile is driven into booth 100. In one embodiment, passage 301 can be resealable. In
    such embodiment passage 301 can comprise a resealable fastener 303 that can include but is
    not limited to zipper, snap, and hook and loop fastener. Thus, booth 100 can be sealed
    through resealable fastener 303 on passage 301.

                                                   5
[0023] Figure 4 illustrates an internal view of booth 100. In one embodiment, one or more wall
   sections 102, floor 201, and/or roof 202 can together form an interior surface 401. Interior
   surface 401 can comprise one or more geometric repeating patterns 402. Geometric
   repeating pattern 402 is a pattern of geometric shapes or lines that repeat in a predictable
   manner. One example of a geometric repeating pattern 402 is a pattern of uniformly spaced
   vertical lines 403. An example of interior surface 401 comprising a geometric repeating
   pattern is all or a portion of interior surface 401 comprising uniformly spaced lines, as
   shown in Figure 4.
[0024] Figure 5 illustrates an automobile 500 placed within booth 100. After erecting booth 100
   through inflating, if booth 100 is inflatable or setting up, if booth 100 is non-inflatable,
   automobile can be driven into interior space 103 of booth 100. Once automobile 500 is
   within interior space 103, light can cause geometric repeating pattern 402 to reflect off the
   surface of automobile 500, the reflected image of geometric repeating pattern 402
   hereinafter referred to as reflected pattern 501. Thus, through reflected pattern 501 exterior
   surface of an automobile can be assessed for damages such as dents, and/or scrapes.
[0025] Figure 6 illustrates a surface portion 600 of automobile 500 having a defect 601. When
   reflected pattern 501 appears substantially similar to geometric repeating pattern 402, such is
   an indication the surface of automobile 500 is free of any defects 601 or any other flaws. For
   example, in an embodiment wherein geometric repeating pattern 402 is a pattern of
   uniformly spaced parallel lines, reflected pattern 501 also being parallel and uniformly
   spaced can indicate the surface of automobile 500 is free of defects 601, or other defects.
   However, if a distortion 602 is present in reflected pattern 501, that is to say, the shape of
   reflected pattern 501 deviates in shape from geometric repeating pattern 402, then distortion
   602 is evidence of defect 601. For example, when geometric repeating pattern 402 is
   distorted such that they are not parallel, such occurrence can indicate damage on the surface.
   Using this system and method, workers can easily locate and identify even defects 601 such
   as minor dents and scratches on automobile 500.
[0026] Figure 7 illustrates surface portion 600 of automobile 500 once defect 601 has been
   repaired. Once a technician is done fixing defect 601, reflected pattern 501 can also be used
   to guarantee defect 601 has been fixed. By substantially decreasing or eliminating distortion

                                                   6
   602, defect 601 can be eliminated. For example, when geometric repeating pattern 402 is a
   set of parallel lines, defect 601 has been fixed when reflected pattern 501 can reflect off
   surface portion 600 of automobile 500 parallel or substantially parallel, only curving with
   the contour of the vehicle.
[0027] Figure 8 illustrates a portion of interior surface 401 comprising a first geometric
   repeating pattern 402a in a first region 801a, and a second geometric repeating pattern 402b
   on a second region 802b. One reason for multiple geometric repeating patterns 402 is taking
   into consideration an anticipated distance between each region 801 and surface portion 600.
   For example, if the anticipated distance between the two is great, such as between roof 205
   and the hood of automobile 500, geometric repeating pattern 402 can be large, and if the
   anticipated distance between the two is small, geometric repeating pattern 402 can be
   smaller.
[0028] As an example shown in figure 8, a first geometric repeating pattern 402 on first region
    801a can have a first spacing 803, while second geometric repeating pattern 402b on second
   region 801b can have a second spacing 804. In such example, second spacing 806 can be
   larger than first spacing 804. First spacing 803 and second spacing 804 can be the space in
   between each line in geometric repeating pattern 402.
[0029] Figure 9 illustrates another example of geometric repeating pattern 402. In this example
   first geometric repeating pattern 402a on first region 801 a can have a first set of line weight
   901, while second geometric repeating pattern 402b on second region 801b can have a
   second set of line weight 902. In one embodiment, first spacing 803 in between first
   geometric repeating pattern 402a can be the same with second spacing 804 in between
   second geometric repeating pattern 402b. Furthermore, second line weight 902 can be
   thicker than first line weight 901.
[0030] Figure 10 illustrates a booth 100 comprising a patterned sheet 1001. In such
   embodiment, patterned sheet 1001 can comprise one or more geometric repeating patterns
   402.

                                                  7
[0031] Patterned sheet 1001 can be mountable to support structure 101. As such, patterned sheet
    101 can cover interior surface 401. Further in one embodiment, patterned sheet 1001 can be
   a type of drapery such as curtains, shades, or blinds. In one embodiment, patterned sheet
    1001 can be mounted within booth 100 through method that can include but is not limited to
   fastening. In such embodiment, patterned sheet 1001 can comprise a plurality of hooks 1002
   and one or more rods 1003. As an example embodiment, hooks 1002 can be an S-shape
   hook wherein one portion of each hook 1002 can be attached to the frame of booth 100
   while the other portion of each hook 1002 can secure rods 1003. In another embodiment,
   patterned sheet 1001 can be maneuverable within booth 100. In such embodiment, patterned
   sheet 1001 can be mounted to a freestanding support.
[0032] Figure 11 illustrates another example of geometric repeating pattern 402 on interior
   surface 401. In such example, geometric repeating pattern 402 can comprise a set of
   uniformly spaced horizontal lines 1101.
