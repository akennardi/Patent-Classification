   Detailed Description
15
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller having components that enable the
   implementation of a method of operating a gaming system
   where, in an embodiment, one or more reel strips
20 (advantageously all) are dynamically formed by adding
   stacked symbols to predefined symbols. In the embodiment,
   there are different arrangements of the stacked symbols
   where the stacked symbols are divided into stacks of
   different lengths. In an embodiment, symbols are selected
25 for display in an active display area which has a height
   in symbol display positions which is randomly determined
   from a set of possible heights. In an embodiment,
   different heights are associated with different awards
   that are won when stacks of symbols fill the active
30 display area. In an advantageous embodiment, a combination
   of stacks of different symbols in different columns of the
   symbol display area can fill the active display area.
   In advantageous embodiments the game controller is
35 configured so that both the length of the stacks and the
   height of display area are randomly determined so as to
   vary the probability of an award being made. In an
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 12
   advantageous embodiment, a weighted table defines
   combinations of lengths of the reel strips and the height
   of the symbol display area.
 5 General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
10 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
15 and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
20 such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
25 receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
30 and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
   mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
35 Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 13
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
 5 arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
10
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
15 mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions             (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
20 player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
25 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
30  (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs   (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
35 to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
                                             10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 14
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a stand lone gaming machine
 5 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
10 interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
15 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
20 shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
25 reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either

   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
15 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.  Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
20 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
25 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
30 own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
35 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 16
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
 5 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
10 screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
15 the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
20
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
25 to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                     In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
30 module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
35 an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                 The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
                                             10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
 5 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
10 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
15 alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
20 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
25 or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
30 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
35 In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
 5 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
10 program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
15 provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
20 display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
25 client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
30 administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
35 network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

   for example through a firewall 211.
 5 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
10 separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
15 provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
20
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager which will be evaluated for this play of the game
   and initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that a player's wager can be varied
25 from game to game dependent on player selections. In most
   spinning reel games, it is typical for the player's wager
   to be made up of a selection as to how the game outcome
   will be evaluated by specifying what parts of the game
   outcome will qualify for winning outcomes and a multiplier
30 that will apply to each winning outcome. For example, a
   player's wager may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
   number of lines allowed by the game  (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
35 and an amount per line - e.g. one, two or five credits.
   Winning outcomes on an activated win line may be evaluated
   based on a pay table that specifies the amount awarded for
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 20
   a one credit per line wager multiplied by the amount
   wagered per line.
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
 5 symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
10 outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a players selection of pay lines.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
15 embodiments, the player may selecting a number of reels to
   play. Games of this type are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and
   are also known as "ways" to win games. The selection of
   the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel can
20 be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
   display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
   at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
   reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated,  symbol display positions of the
25 other reels. For example, if there are five reels and
   three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
   symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
30 the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reels, the active display positions being all display
   positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
35 reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.
                                             10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that one or more of the modules could
 5 be implemented in some other way, for example by a
   dedicated circuit.
   The outcome generator 622 is arranged to form reel strips
   dynamically during each play of the game by determining an
10 arrangement of stacks of symbols to be added to the reel
   strips.  That is, each time a player places a fresh wager.
   In this embodiment, the outcome generator 622 is also
   arranged to determine a height for the game play area that
   will be active in a current game.  In the embodiment, the
15 height of the game area and the length of stacks are
   selected from a single, co-dependent weighted table in
   order to allow a game to be provided in which occurrences
   of long stacks and increases in game height both occur
   relatively frequently. To this end, the outcome generator
20 622A includes a symbol arrangement and height selector
   622A which selects one of a combination of game area
   heights and stack length arrangements from weighted table
   642.
25 In this embodiment, the game area defines the number of
   symbol display positions that will be displayed in a
   particular play of the game on display 54.       The game play
   area has a number of columns corresponding to respective
   ones of a plurality of reel strip.   In one example, shown
30 in Figure 8, there are five columns of symbol display
   positons 821, 822, 823, 824 and 825.   The symbol display
   positions are arranged in a rectangular array with five
   rows of symbol display positions being one example of a
   lowest number of rows as shown in Figure 8A.          Accordingly,
35 it will be appreciated that if there are five rows, the
   height of the active game area is five symbol positions
   high.
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 22
   In one example, shown in Figures 8A to 8D there are four
   possible different heights of the active game play area
   shown in Figures 8A to 8D respectively.    In one example,
 5 there are also four possible different arrangements of
   stacks.  In the embodiment, each arrangement of stacks is
   formed by dividing a defined number of stacked symbols
   into different numbers of stacks of the symbol.              In one
   example, there are forty-eight stacked symbols that are
10 added to each of the five reels.
   In this respect, symbol data 641 defines base reel strips
   641A which are comprised of a number of predefined symbols
   to which the arrangement of stacked symbols will be added.
15 The base reel strips 641A also define the positions at
   which the stacks of symbols will be inserted.           It will be
   appreciated that there will be different positions within
   the reel strips for the different arrangements as there
   will be more stacks in some arrangements than others.                       In
20 one example, 48 symbols are inserted into each reel by the
   reel strip former 622D and the four possible arrangements
   are two stacks which are 24 symbols long, three stacks
   which are 16 symbols long, four stacks which are 12
   symbols long, and six stacks which are symbols long. In
25 this example, while each stack of a specific reel will
   have the same stacked symbol, different stackable symbols
   641B may be selected for different reels.           Further, in
   this embodiment of the invention, the same arrangement of
   stacked symbols is applied to each reel.
30
   The outcome generator has as stacked symbol selector 622C
   which obtains a number from random number generator 621 in
   order to select one of a plurality of stackable symbols
   641B to be added to the individual reels 821-825. The
35 stackable symbols 641B are a subset of the game symbols
   used during play of the game.
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 23
   It will be appreciated that in an alternate embodiment, a
   single weighted table could be employed which defines not
   only the arrangement of stacks and the height of the game
   area but also which symbols will be added in stacks to
 5 which reels.
   In the embodiment, once the stacked symbol arrangement and
   height selector 622A has selected the stacked symbol
   arrangement and the active game area height and the
10 stacked symbol selector 622C has selected the stacked
   symbols for the respective reels, the reel strip former
   622D combines these outcomes with the base reel strip 641A
   to generate formed reel strip 641C.
15 It will be appreciated that the particular approach of
   separately selecting stacked symbols for all of the reels
   allows for an advantageous award making technique in
   gaming systems of embodiments of the invention as
   described in further detail below.  However, in other
20 embodiments, less than all of the reels could have stacks
   of symbols added or the same symbol could be added to all
   of the reels.
   Once the reel strips are formed, a symbol selector 622B
25 selects symbols from the formed reel strips 641C using
   random number generator 621. The selected symbols are
   advised to the display controller 624 which causes them to
   be displayed on display 54 at a set of display positions.
30 One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 622B to select symbols from the formed reel
   strips 641C corresponding to respective ones of a
   plurality of spinning reels. The formed reel strips 641C
   specify a sequence of symbols for each reel. In an
35 embodiment, the symbol selector 622B selects the symbols
   for display by selecting a stopping position in the
   sequence. It is known to use a probability table stored in
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 24
   memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular stop position
   being selected. Other techniques can be used to control
   the odds of particular outcomes occurring to thereby
   control the return to player of the game.
 5
   Once symbols are selected, they are evaluated in order to
   determine whether they include any winning outcomes.                      For
   example, in Figure 8A, there is shown a winning
   combination 831 which is highlighted in the selected
10 symbols.   Another winning outcome 832 is highlighted in
   Figure 8D.    These evaluations are made by outcome
   evaluator 623 based on the pay table 643 which defines the
   winning outcomes and associated awards.     In embodiments of
   the outcome evaluator 623 also determines whether the
15 active game area for the current height is completely
   populated by symbols from the stacks of symbols and makes
   an award of a progressive feature game as described in
   further detail below.
20 In this respect, referring to Figures 8A -      8D there are
   shown a plurality of screen shots 800A to 800D of a game
   with the active game area in a number of different states.
   In each of the screen shots, the symbols are displayed in
   five columns of symbol display positions 821, 822, 823,
25 824 and 825.   Figures 8A -  8D show four different heights
   of the active game play area.    In Figure 8A, the active
   game play area 861 is five symbol positions high.                  In
   Figure 8B, the active game play area 862 is six symbol
   positions high.   In Figure 8C, the active game play area
30 863 is seven symbol positions high. In Figure 8D, the
   active game play area 864 is eight symbol positions high.
   In the example, there are four progressive jackpot prizes,
   a Batman jackpot 811, a Batgirl jackpot 812, a Catwoman
35 jackpot 813, and a Robin jackpot 814. In the example, an
   award of a progressive feature from which these jackpots
   can be won is linked to the current height of the active
                                             10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 25
   game play area.  Thus, the height of the active game area
   is advantageously part of an indication to which
   progressive jackpot is currently available.
 5 In Figure 8A, where the height is five symbols high, the
   "Robin" progressive jackpot 814 can be triggered as
   further indicated by the word "Robin" 871 being placed
   alongside the game play area.   In Figure 8B, the
   "Catwoman" progressive jackpot 813 is available as
10 additionally indicated by the word "Catwoman" 872.                   In
   Figure 8C, the "Batgirl" progressive jackpot 812 is
   available as additionally indicated by the message
   "Batgirl" 873.  In Figure 8D, the "Batman" progressive
   jackpot 811 is available as additionally indicated by the
15 word "Batman" 874.
   Thus, advantageously, the height of the active game play
   area 861 - 864 indicates the available progressive
   feature. While in this example, a separate progressive
20 feature is carried out by the progressive feature
   controller 622B in order to determine whether to award a
   current value of the respective progressive jackpot prize
   811 - 814 and hence this is what is awarded, in another
   embodiment, the progressive prize is awarded directly.
25
   In this respect, in embodiments of the invention, the
   award criterion is that a defined number of columns of
   symbol display positions  (advantageously all of the
   columns) are filled with a stack of symbols irrespective
30 of whether different symbols provide the stack in
   different columns. For example, referring to Figure 8B, it
   will be apparent that there is a stack 852 of Robin
   symbols filling the first column 821 and stacks 853, 854
   of Batgirl symbols filling columns 822 and 823. Both
35 stacks count towards an award in embodiments of the
   invention, even though they are different. In other
   Figures, stacks of other stackable symbols such as
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 26
   Catwoman symbols 851 and Batman symbol 855 are shown
   filling an entire column.
   As indicated above, in an advantageous embodiment of the
 5 invention, it is a requirement that all of the portions of
   the active game area that correspond to respective ones in
   a different reels are filled with stacks of symbols for
   there to be an award by outcome evaluator 623, however,
   the individual symbols of different stacks may be
10 different.  In other embodiments, it may be sufficient
   that a smaller number of portions of the game play area
   are filled by stacks, for example, the three filled
   portions of the game play area shown in Figure 8B or 8D.
15 It will be appreciated that the combination of the
   arrangement of stacked symbols in terms of their length
   and the height of the area controls the probability of a
   progressive feature award being made. Referring again to
   Figure 6, Figure 6 shows that the progressive prizes 645
20 are stored in memory 64 of the gaming system.          They are
   then awarded from the progressive feature by progressive
   feature controller 622E as described above. In this
   respect, Figures 8A to 8D show a bet meter 841, a win
   meter 842, and a credit meter 843.   Typically, a win will
25 be awarded to a win meter of meters 644, however, in some
   embodiments, an award of above a certain size may be
   awarded directly to the credit meter to prevent it being
   used in any gamble feature that forms part of the game.
   In other embodiments, the progressive prizes could be part
30 of a link game in which a number of different gaming
   machines compete to win the same prize.    For example, a
   bank of four gaming machines may have a common link
   controller.
35 Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 of the
   embodiment.  At step 705, a wager is received and a player
   initiates a play of the game.   At step 710, the method
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 27
   involves stacked symbol arrangement and height selector
   622A selecting the height and symbol arrangement 710 from
   a weighted table 642 of combinations of game area heights
   and stack length arrangements. At step 715, a symbol is
 5 selected to be stacked for each reel by stacked symbol
   selector 622C.   At step 720, the reels are formed 720.
   The symbol selector 622B then selects 725 symbols for the
   current game area height.    The outcome evaluator 623
   evaluates 730 the selected symbols against the pay table
lo and determines whether the stacks fill all symbol
   positions of the defined number of reels.       If the answer
   is yes, the outcome evaluator 623 awards the progressive
   feature 740 from which the player may win the progressive
   corresponding to the current height 740.      The method then
15 involves conducting the progressive feature game (e.g. a
   pick a box game where the player has a defined number of
   picks to find a jackpot awarding symbol).     Upon the
   progressive being won 750, the progressive prize is
   awarded 755. The method ends at step 760.
20
   In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
   applied by the game controller in order for the player to
   be eligible for stacks of symbols to be added and/or for
   the game area to change height. For example that the game
25 controller determines the player has made a certain sized
   wager, made an ante bet, selected all win lines, played
   sufficient games, or the player is a member of a loyalty
   program.
30 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that rather
   than a progressive feature game from which a progressive
   prize can be one, the filling of columns with stacks of
   symbols can be used to trigger some other form of feature
   game.  A feature game involves some additional element of
35 game play which usually only occurs when a trigger
   condition is met  (in this case based on stacks filling the
   game play area).  Types of feature games include:             those
                                             10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                              - 28
   where a series of free game events are awarded such as
   free games or re-spins (where some reels are held while
   others are re-spun); games where the symbols on the reel
   are changed; and "second screen" games where game play is
 5 totally different to the base game, for example where the
   player makes selections in a "pick a box type" game.
   Further, the progressive feature need not be the only
   feature game.
10 Typically, a winning outcome will result in some form of
   award being made such as an award of credits. Such an
   award may never actually be physically received by a
   player. For example, many gaming systems provide a player
   with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the player
15 can double or forfeit their credits before commencing
   another play of the game or cashing out. Further, as
   credits are fungible, once credits have been added to the
   credit meter it is not possible to distinguish between
   credits which exist because the player has input cash or
20 the like and credits resulting from an award.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
25 electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
30 appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
35 may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.

                              - 29
   Example
   In an example of an embodiment of the invention, the
   method of operating a gaming system involves the game
 5 controller:
        1)   Inserting stacks of varying height from game to
             game;
10      2)   Varying the height of the game play area of
             varying height from game to game;
        3)   Requiring that the game area be filled with
             stacks to trigger the award of progressive
15           jackpot prizes; and
        4)   Using the game height to both indicate and
             determine which Progressive is eligible
20 In the example, the choice of symbols to be inserted onto
   the reels is made by the game controller using weighted
   tables of symbol combinations.   In this way, the stacked
   symbols are placed into the game in a random manner.                     In
   one example, there are 35 fixed symbols on each reel.                       48
25 symbols will be inserted into each of those reels to
   dynamically form the reel.   By a random determination,
   they will be placed as one of the following:        2 stacks 24
   symbols long, 3 stacks of 16 symbols, 4 stacks of 12
   symbols, or 6 stacks of 8 symbols.   Controlling the height
30 of the stacks allows control of the probability of
   stopping the reel with the active game area filled with
   the same symbol.  For example, for a game play area of
   height 8 symbol display positions  (the maximum height of
   the game play area in this example),  it is much less
35 likely fill with stacks of length 8 than it is with stacks
   of length 24. In this example, the weighted table is
   arranged such that different symbols of the symbols that
                                            10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 30
   can be stacked can be selected for each reel.
   The gaming system indicates an "Active Progressive Level"
   by means of the "Active Game Height".   Simply stated, the
 5 Active Game Height dictates the eligible progressive level
   for this spin of the base game.   That is,    there is a
   different progressive prize associated with each of the
   heights, with the highest progressive prize associated
   with the highest height and the lowest prize associated
10 with the lowest height.   Prior to the actual spin, all
   game heights and all levels of the Progressive are
   possible.   In the example, after the start of the spin, if
   the game is only 5 symbol positions tall, only the lowest
   level of the 4 level Progressive is possible.           Similarly,
15 a 6 high game has the possibility of awarding the 2nd
   smallest progressive, and so forth for the next two
   levels.
   The Progressive Feature is triggered (awarded) by the game
20 controller 60 when the active game area of each reel
    (individually) is filled with the same symbol. That is,
   filling the active game area is a winning outcome that
   results in the award of the Feature. While in the example,
   the award is the conduct of a Progressive Feature which
25 may or may not result in the award of the progressive
   prize, in other examples, an award (e.g. in credits) may
   be made directly in response to filling the active game
   area.
30 In the example, the active game area of each reel is
   individually filled -  i.e.different symbols may fill each
   reel. To clarify, if the active game area of reel 1 is
   filled with symbol A, reel 2 filled with symbol B, reel 3
   filled with symbol C, reel 4 filled with symbol D, and
35 reel 5 filled with symbol E, the Progressive Feature tied
   to the current Game Height will be triggered.           The symbols
   on reel 1 do not have to match those on reel 2. This is
                                             10246100_1 (GHMatters) P101047.AU.1 15/05/18

                               - 31
   advantageous because in most stacking games, the player
   loses interest as soon as they see differing stacked
   symbols on reels 1 and 2, whereas in the present method
   the player can still achieve a win in this circumstances.
 5
   In the example, the Game Height and Stack Length are
   selected from a single, co-dependent weighted table. This
   is advantageous because if the stack length and the game
   height were determined independently, it would be
10 necessary to greatly limit both the occurrences of long
   stacks and the increases in game height.     By making it
   more likely that the largest game height and the shortest
   stacks appear together, it is possible to show more games
   of maximum height without over paying.
15
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
20  (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
25 appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
30 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments.
