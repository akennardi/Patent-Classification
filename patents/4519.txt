FIELD OF THE INVENTION
        The present invention relates to compositions and methods for cancer diagnosis,
research and therapy, including but not limited to, cancer markers. In particular, the present
invention relates to ncRNAs as diagnostic markers and clinical targets for prostate, lung,
breast and pancreatic cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        A central aim in cancer research is to identify altered genes that are causally
implicated in oncogenesis. Several types of somatic mutations have been identified including
base substitutions, insertions, deletions, translocations, and chromosomal gains and losses, all
of which result in altered activity of an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene. First
hypothesized in the early 1900's, there is now compelling evidence for a causal role for
chromosomal rearrangements in cancer (Rowley, Nat Rev Cancer 1: 245 (2001)). Recurrent
chromosomal aberrations were thought to be primarily characteristic of leukemias,
lymphomas, and sarcomas. Epithelial tumors (carcinomas), which are much more common
and contribute to a relatively large fraction of the morbidity and mortality associated with
human cancer, comprise less than 1% of the known, disease-specific chromosomal
rearrangements (Mitelman, Mutat Res 462: 247 (2000)). While hematological malignancies
are often characterized by balanced, disease-specific chromosomal rearrangements, most

                                              la
solid tumors have a plethora of non-specific chromosomal aberrations. It is thought that the
karyotypic complexity of solid tumors is due to secondary alterations acquired through cancer
evolution or progression.
        Two primary mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements have been described. In
one mechanism, promoter/enhancer elements of one gene are rearranged adjacent to a proto-

    oncogene, thus causing altered expression of an oncogenic protein. This type of translocation is
    exemplified by the apposition of immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes to MYC
    leading to activation of this oncogene in B- and T-cell malignancies, respectively (Rabbitts,
    Nature 372: 143 (1994)). In the second mechanism, rearrangement results in the fusion of two
 5  genes, which produces a fusion protein that may have a new function or altered activity. The
    prototypic example of this translocation is the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myelogenous
    leukemia (CML) (Rowley, Nature 243: 290 (1973); de Klein et al., Nature 300: 765 (1982)).
    Importantly, this finding led to the rational development of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which
    successfully targets the BCR-ABL kinase (Deininger et al., Blood 105: 2640 (2005)). Thus,
 0  diagnostic methods that specifically identify epithelial tumors are needed.
    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention relates to compositions and methods for cancer diagnosis, research
    and therapy, including but not limited to, cancer markers. In particular, the present invention
 5  relates to ncRNAs as diagnostic markers and clinical targets for prostate, lung, breast and
    pancreatic cancer.
             Embodiments of the present invention provide compositions, kits, and methods useful in
    the detection and screening of prostate cancer. Experiments conducted during the course of
    development of embodiments of the present invention identified upreguation of non-coding
 '0 RNAs in prostate cancer. Some embodiments of the present invention provide compositons and
    methods for detecting expression levels of such ncRNAs. Identification of ncRNAs finds use in
    screening, diagnostic and research uses.
             For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of screening
    for the presence of prostate cancer in a subject, comprising contacting a biological sample from a
25  subject with a reagent for detecting the level of expression of one or more non-coding RNAs
    (ncRNA) (e.g., PCAT1, PCAT14, PCAT43 and PCAT 109); and detecting the level of
    expression of the ncRNA in the sample, for example, using an in vitro assay, wherein an
    increased level of expression of the ncRNA in the sample (e.g., relative to the level in normal
    prostate cells, increase in level relative to a prior time point, increase relative to a pre-established
30  thereshold level, etc.) is indicative of prostate cancer in the subject. In some embodiments, the
    ncRNAs are described by SEQ ID NOs: 1-9. In some embodiments, the sample is tissue, blood,
    plasma, serum, urine, urine supernatant, urine cell pellet, semen, prostatic secretions or prostate
    cells. In some embodiments, the detection is carried out utilizing a sequencing technique, a
    nucleic acid hybridization technique, a nucleic acid amplification technique, or an immunoassay.

    However, the invention is not limited to the technique employed. In some embodiments, the
    nucleic acid amplification technique is polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcription
    polymerase chain reaction, transcription-mediated amplification, ligase chain reaction, strand
    displacement amplification or nucleic acid sequence based amplification. In some embodiments,
 5  the prostate cancer is localized prostate cancer or metastatic prostate cancer. In some
    embodiments, the reagent is a pair of amplification oligonucleotides or an oligonucleotide probe.

    DEFINITIONS

             To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases are
    defined below:
             As used herein, the terms "detect", "detecting" or "detection" may describe either the
    general act of discovering or discerning or the specific observation of a detectably labeled
 5  composition.
             As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any organisms that are screened using the
    diagnostic methods described herein. Such organisms preferably include, but are not limited to,
    mammals (e.g., murines, simians, equines, bovines, porcines, canines, felines, and the like), and
    most preferably includes humans.
 0           The term "diagnosed," as used herein, refers to the recognition of a disease by its signs
    and symptoms, or genetic analysis, pathological analysis, histological analysis, and the like.
             A "subject suspected of having cancer" encompasses an individual who has received an
    initial diagnosis (e.g., a CT scan showing a mass or increased PSA level) but for whom the stage
    of cancer or presence or absence of ncRNAs indicative of cancer is not known. The term further
 5  includes people who once had cancer (e.g., an individual in remission). In some embodiments,
    "subjects" are control subjects that are suspected of having cancer or diagnosed with cancer.
             As used herein, the term "characterizing cancer in a subject" refers to the identification of
    one or more properties of a cancer sample in a subject, including but not limited to, the presence
    of benign, pre-cancerous or cancerous tissue, the stage of the cancer, and the subject's prognosis.
 '0 Cancers may be characterized by the identification of the expression of one or more cancer
    marker genes, including but not limited to, the ncRNAs disclosed herein.
             As used herein, the term "characterizing prostate tissue in a subject" refers to the
    identification of one or more properties of a prostate tissue sample (e.g., including but not limited
    to, the presence of cancerous tissue, the presence or absence of ncRNAs, the presence of pre
25  cancerous tissue that is likely to become cancerous, and the presence of cancerous tissue that is
    likely to metastasize). In some embodiments, tissues are characterized by the identification of
    the expression of one or more cancer marker genes, including but not limited to, the cancer
    markers disclosed herein.
             As used herein, the term "stage of cancer" refers to a qualitative or quantitative
30  assessment of the level of advancement of a cancer. Criteria used to determine the stage of a
    cancer include, but are not limited to, the size of the tumor and the extent of metastases (e.g.,
    localized or distant).
             As used herein, the term "nucleic acid molecule" refers to any nucleic acid containing
    molecule, including but not limited to, DNA or RNA. The term encompasses sequences that
                                                      11

    include any of the known base analogs of DNA and RNA including, but not limited to,
    4-acetylcytosine, 8-hydroxy-N6-methyladenosine, aziridinylcytosine, pseudoisocytosine,
    5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5
    carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil,

    aminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5'-methoxycarbonylmethyluracil,
    5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester,
 0  uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, oxybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl
    2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, N-uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester,
    uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, and 2,6-diaminopurine.
            The term "gene" refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises coding
    sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide, precursor, or RNA (e.g., rRNA, tRNA).
 5  The polypeptide can be encoded by a full length coding sequence or by any portion of the coding
    sequence so long as the desired activity or functional properties (e.g., enzymatic activity, ligand
    binding, signal transduction, immunogenicity, etc.) of the full-length or fragments are retained.
    The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the sequences located
    adjacent to the coding region on both the 5' and 3' ends for a distance of about 1 kb or more on
 '0 either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA. Sequences
    located 5' of the coding region and present on the mRNA are referred to as 5' non-translated
    sequences. Sequences located 3' or downstream of the coding region and present on the mRNA
    are referred to as 3' non-translated sequences. The term "gene" encompasses both cDNA and
    genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains the coding region
25  interrupted with non-coding sequences termed "introns" or "intervening regions" or "intervening
    sequences." Introns are segments of a gene that are transcribed into nuclear RNA (hnRNA);
    introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or "spliced out"
    from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA
    (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of
30  amino acids in a nascent polypeptide.
            As used herein, the term "oligonucleotide," refers to a short length of single-stranded
    polynucleotide chain. Oligonucleotides are typically less than 200 residues long (e.g., between
    15 and 100), however, as used herein, the term is also intended to encompass longer
    polynucleotide chains. Oligonucleotides are often referred to by their length. For example a 24
                                                      19

    residue oligonucleotide is referred to as a "24-mer". Oligonucleotides can form secondary and
    tertiary structures by self-hybridizing or by hybridizing to other polynucleotides. Such structures
    can include, but are not limited to, duplexes, hairpins, cruciforms, bends, and triplexes.
             As used herein, the terms "complementary" or "complementarity" are used in reference to
 5  polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing rules. For example,
    the sequence "5'-A-G-T-3'," is complementary to the sequence "3'-T-C-A-5'." Complementarity
    may be "partial," in which only some of the nucleic acids' bases are matched according to the
    base pairing rules. Or, there may be "complete" or "total" complementarity between the nucleic
    acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the
 0  efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular
    importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding
    between nucleic acids.
             The term "homology" refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial
    homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence is a
 5  nucleic acid molecule that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary nucleic acid
    molecule from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid is "substantially homologous." The inhibition
    of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be
    examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the
    like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will
 '0 compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous nucleic
    acid molecule to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of
    low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require
    that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The
    absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target that is substantially
25  non-complementary (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding
    the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target.
             As used herein, the term "hybridization" is used in reference to the pairing of
    complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the strength
    of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the degree of
30  complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, the Tm of the
    formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids. A single molecule that contains
    pairing of complementary nucleic acids within its structure is said to be "self-hybridized."
             As used herein the term "stringency" is used in reference to the conditions of temperature,
    ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds such as organic solvents, under which
                                                       12

    nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. Under "low stringency conditions" a nucleic acid
    sequence of interest will hybridize to its exact complement, sequences with single base
    mismatches, closely related sequences (e.g., sequences with 90% or greater homology), and
    sequences having only partial homology (e.g., sequences with 50-90% homology). Under
 5  'medium stringency conditions," a nucleic acid sequence of interest will hybridize only to its
    exact complement, sequences with single base mismatches, and closely relation sequences (e.g.,
    90% or greater homology). Under "high stringency conditions," a nucleic acid sequence of
    interest will hybridize only to its exact complement, and (depending on conditions such a
    temperature) sequences with single base mismatches. In other words, under conditions of high
 0  stringency the temperature can be raised so as to exclude hybridization to sequences with single
    base mismatches.
             The term "isolated" when used in relation to a nucleic acid, as in "an isolated
    oligonucleotide" or "isolated polynucleotide" refers to a nucleic acid sequence that is identified
    and separated from at least one component or contaminant with which it is ordinarily associated
 5  in its natural source. Isolated nucleic acid is such present in a form or setting that is different
    from that in which it is found in nature. In contrast, non-isolated nucleic acids as nucleic acids
    such as DNA and RNA found in the state they exist in nature. For example, a given DNA
    sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell chromosome in proximity to neighboring genes;
    RNA sequences, such as a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein, are found in the
 '0 cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of proteins. However,
    isolated nucleic acid encoding a given protein includes, by way of example, such nucleic acid in
    cells ordinarily expressing the given protein where the nucleic acid is in a chromosomal location
    different from that of natural cells, or is otherwise flanked by a different nucleic acid sequence
    than that found in nature. The isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide, or polynucleotide may be
25  present in single-stranded or double-stranded form. When an isolated nucleic acid,
    oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is to be utilized to express a protein, the oligonucleotide or
    polynucleotide will contain at a minimum the sense or coding strand (i.e., the oligonucleotide or
    polynucleotide may be single-stranded), but may contain both the sense and anti-sense strands
    (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be double-stranded).
30           As used herein, the term "purified" or "to purify" refers to the removal of components
    (e.g., contaminants) from a sample. For example, antibodies are purified by removal of
    contaminating non-immunoglobulin proteins; they are also purified by the removal of
    immunoglobulin that does not bind to the target molecule. The removal of non-immunoglobulin
    proteins and/or the removal of immunoglobulins that do not bind to the target molecule results in
                                                       11A

    an increase in the percent of target-reactive immunoglobulins in the sample. In another example,
    recombinant polypeptides are expressed in bacterial host cells and the polypeptides are purified
    by the removal of host cell proteins; the percent of recombinant polypeptides is thereby increased
    in the sample.
 5           As used herein, the term "sample" is used in its broadest sense. In one sense, it is meant
    to include a specimen or culture obtained from any source, as well as biological and
    environmental samples. Biological samples may be obtained from animals (including humans)
    and encompass fluids, solids, tissues, and gases. Biological samples include blood products, such
    as plasma, serum and the like. Such examples are not however to be construed as limiting the
 0  sample types applicable to the present invention.
    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention relates to compositions and methods for cancer diagnosis, research
    and therapy, including but not limited to, cancer markers. In particular, the present invention
 5  relates to ncRNAs as diagnostic markers and clinical targets for prostate, lung, breast and
    pancreatic cancer.
             Experiments conducted during the development of embodiments of the present invention
    utilized RNA-Seq analyses of tissue samples and ab initio transcriptome assembly to predict the
    complete polyA+ transcriptome of prostate cancer. 6,144 novel ncRNAs found in prostate
 '0 cancer were identified, including 121 ncRNAs that associated with disease progression (Figures
    1, 2, 16 and 25). These data demonstrate the global utility of RNA-Seq in defining functionally
    important elements of the genome.
             The present invention is not limited to a particular mechanism. Indeed, an understanding
    of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present invention. Nonetheless, although the
25  biological role of these RNAs, especially the differentially-expressed ones, is not yet known,
    these results indicate a model in which specific intergenic loci are activated in prostate cancer,
    enabling the transcription of numerous disease-specific and tissue-specific ncRNAs (Figure 5g).
    Clinically, these ncRNA signatures are suitable for urine-based assays to detect and diagnose
    prostate cancer in a non-invasive manner (See e.g., Example 1). It is further contemplated that
30  specific ncRNA signatures occur universally in all disease states and applying these
    methodologies to other diseases reveals clinically important biomarkers, particularly for diseases
    that currently lack good protein biomarkers.
             While traditional approaches have focused on the annotated reference genome, data
    generated during the course of development of embodiments of the present invention implicate
                                                       1r

    large swaths of unannotated genomic loci in prostate cancer progression and prostate-specific
    expression. One example of this is the SChLAP1 locus, which represents a >500 kb stretch of
    coordinately regulated expression, and the chr8q24 locus, which contains a prostate specific
    region with the prostate cancer biomarker PCAT- 1. The fact that the SChLAP 1 locus is almost
 5  exclusively expressed in prostate cancers harboring an ETS gene fusion further confirms the
    capacity of ncRNAs to identify patient disease subtypes. In addition, these analyses reveal novel
    cancer-specific drivers of tumorigenesis. For example, the long ncRNA HOTAIR is known to
    direct cancer-promoting roles for EZH2 in breast cancer (Gupta et al., Nature 464 (7291), 1071
    (2010)), while in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line a similar role has been proposed for the
 0  ANRIL ncRNA (Yap et al., Mol Cell 38 (5), 662 (2010)).
    I.       Diagnostic and Screening Methods
             As described above, embodiments of the present invention provide diagnostic and
    screening methods that utilize the detection of ncRNAs (e.g., PCAT-1, PCAT-14, PCAT-43 and
 5  PCAT-109; SEQ ID NOs: 1-9). Exemplary, non-limiting methods are described below.
             Any patient sample suspected of containing the ncRNAs may be tested according to
    methods of embodiments of the present invention. By way of non-limiting examples, the sample
    may be tissue (e.g., a prostate biopsy sample or a tissue sample obtained by prostatectomy),
    blood, urine, semen, prostatic secretions or a fraction thereof (e.g., plasma, serum, urine
 '0 supernatant, urine cell pellet or prostate cells). A urine sample is preferably collected
    immediately following an attentive digital rectal examination (DRE), which causes prostate cells
    from the prostate gland to shed into the urinary tract.
             In some embodiments, the patient sample is subjected to preliminary processing designed
    to isolate or enrich the sample for the ncRNAs or cells that contain the ncRNAs. A variety of
25  techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be used for this purpose, including but
    not limited to: centrifugation; immunocapture; cell lysis; and, nucleic acid target capture (See,
    e.g., EP Pat. No. 1 409 727, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
             The ncRNAs may be detected along with other markers in a multiplex or panel format.
    Markers are selected for their predictive value alone or in combination with the gene fusions.
30  Exemplary prostate cancer markers include, but are not limited to: AMACR/P504S (U.S. Pat.
    No. 6,262,245); PCA3 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,008,765); PCGEM1 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,828,429);

    Biophysica Acta 1756:81-82 (2005)); and, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,854,206 and

   for other cancers, diseases, infections, and metabolic conditions are also contemplated for
   inclusion in a multiplex or panel format.

 5 markers in combination. For example, in some embodiments, the level of expression of two or
   more (e.g., 10 or more, 25 or more, 50 or more, 100 or more or all 121) non-coding RNAs

           i.       DNA and RNA Detection
25         The ncRNAs of the present invention are detected using a variety of nucleic acid
   techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to: nucleic acid
   sequencing; nucleic acid hybridization; and, nucleic acid amplification.
                    1.      Sequencing
30         Illustrative non-limiting examples of nucleic acid sequencing techniques include, but are
   not limited to, chain terminator (Sanger) sequencing and dye terminator sequencing. Those of
   ordinary skill in the art will recognize that because RNA is less stable in the cell and more prone
   to nuclease attack experimentally RNA is usually reverse transcribed to DNA before sequencing.
                                                      17

            Chain terminator sequencing uses sequence-specific termination of a DNA synthesis
    reaction using modified nucleotide substrates. Extension is initiated at a specific site on the
    template DNA by using a short radioactive, or other labeled, oligonucleotide primer
    complementary to the template at that region. The oligonucleotide primer is extended using a
 5  DNA polymerase, standard four deoxynucleotide bases, and a low concentration of one chain
    terminating nucleotide, most commonly a di-deoxynucleotide. This reaction is repeated in four
    separate tubes with each of the bases taking turns as the di-deoxynucleotide. Limited
    incorporation of the chain terminating nucleotide by the DNA polymerase results in a series of
    related DNA fragments that are terminated only at positions where that particular di
 0  deoxynucleotide is used. For each reaction tube, the fragments are size-separated by
    electrophoresis in a slab polyacrylamide gel or a capillary tube filled with a viscous polymer.
    The sequence is determined by reading which lane produces a visualized mark from the labeled
    primer as you scan from the top of the gel to the bottom.
            Dye terminator sequencing alternatively labels the terminators. Complete sequencing can
 5  be performed in a single reaction by labeling each of the di-deoxynucleotide chain-terminators
    with a separate fluorescent dye, which fluoresces at a different wavelength.
            A variety of nucleic acid sequencing methods are contemplated for use in the methods of
    the present disclosure including, for example, chain terminator (Sanger) sequencing, dye
    terminator sequencing, and high-throughput sequencing methods. Many of these sequencing
 '0 methods are well known in the art. See, e.g., Sanger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:5463
    5467 (1997); Maxam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:560-564 (1977); Drmanac, et al., Nat.

    Science 323:133-138 (2009); each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                     2.        Hybridization
30          Illustrative non-limiting examples of nucleic acid hybridization techniques include, but
    are not limited to, in situ hybridization (ISH), microarray, and Southern or Northern blot.
    In situ hybridization (ISH) is a type of hybridization that uses a labeled complementary DNA or
    RNA strand as a probe to localize a specific DNA or RNA sequence in a portion or section of
    tissue (in situ), or, if the tissue is small enough, the entire tissue (whole mount ISH). DNA ISH
                                                         152

    can be used to determine the structure of chromosomes. RNA ISH is used to measure and
    localize mRNAs and other transcripts (e.g., ncRNAs) within tissue sections or whole mounts.
    Sample cells and tissues are usually treated to fix the target transcripts in place and to increase
    access of the probe. The probe hybridizes to the target sequence at elevated temperature, and
 5  then the excess probe is washed away. The probe that was labeled with either radio-, fluorescent
    or antigen-labeled bases is localized and quantitated in the tissue using either autoradiography,
    fluorescence microscopy or immunohistochemistry, respectively. ISH can also use two or more
    probes, labeled with radioactivity or the other non-radioactive labels, to simultaneously detect
    two or more transcripts.
 0          In some embodiments, ncRNAs are detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization
    (FISH). In some embodiments, FISH assays utilize bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs).
    These have been used extensively in the human genome sequencing project (see Nature 409:
    953-958 (2001)) and clones containing specific BACs are available through distributors that can
    be located through many sources, e.g., NCBI. Each BAC clone from the human genome has
 5  been given a reference name that unambiguously identifies it. These names can be used to find a
    corresponding GenBank sequence and to order copies of the clone from a distributor.
            The present invention further provides a method of performing a FISH assay on human
    prostate cells, human prostate tissue or on the fluid surrounding said human prostate cells or
    human prostate tissue. Specific protocols are well known in the art and can be readily adapted
 '0 for the present invention. Guidance regarding methodology may be obtained from many
    references including: In situ Hybridization: Medical Applications (eds. G. R. Coulton and J. de
    Belleroche), Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston (1992); In situ Hybridization: In
    Neurobiology; Advances in Methodology (eds. J. H. Eberwine, K. L. Valentino, and J. D.
    Barchas), Oxford University Press Inc., England (1994); In situ Hybridization: A Practical
25  Approach (ed. D. G. Wilkinson), Oxford University Press Inc., England (1992)); Kuo, et al., Am.

    Ward, et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 52:854-865 (1993)). There are also kits that are commercially
    available and that provide protocols for performing FISH assays (available from e.g., Oncor, Inc.,
    Gaithersburg, MD). Patents providing guidance on methodology include U.S. 5,225,326;
30  5,545,524; 6,121,489 and 6,573,043. All of these references are hereby incorporated by
    reference in their entirety and may be used along with similar references in the art and with the
    information provided in the Examples section herein to establish procedural steps convenient for
    a particular laboratory.
                                                      10

                    3.       Microarrays
             Different kinds of biological assays are called microarrays including, but not limited to:
    DNA microarrays (e.g., cDNA microarrays and oligonucleotide microarrays); protein
    microarrays; tissue microarrays; transfection or cell microarrays; chemical compound
 5  microarrays; and, antibody microarrays. A DNA microarray, commonly known as gene chip,
    DNA chip, or biochip, is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface (e.g.,
    glass, plastic or silicon chip) forming an array for the purpose of expression profiling or
    monitoring expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. The affixed DNA segments
    are known as probes, thousands of which can be used in a single DNA microarray. Microarrays
 0  can be used to identify disease genes or transcripts (e.g., ncRNAs) by comparing gene expression
    in disease and normal cells. Microarrays can be fabricated using a variety of technologies,
    including but not limiting: printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides; photolithography
    using pre-made masks; photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices; ink-jet printing; or,
    electrochemistry on microelectrode arrays.
 5           Southern and Northern blotting is used to detect specific DNA or RNA sequences,
    respectively. DNA or RNA extracted from a sample is fragmented, electrophoretically separated
    on a matrix gel, and transferred to a membrane filter. The filter bound DNA or RNA is subject to
    hybridization with a labeled probe complementary to the sequence of interest. Hybridized probe
    bound to the filter is detected. A variant of the procedure is the reverse Northern blot, in which
 '0 the substrate nucleic acid that is affixed to the membrane is a collection of isolated DNA
    fragments and the probe is RNA extracted from a tissue and labeled.
                    3.       Amplification
             Nucleic acids (e.g., ncRNAs) may be amplified prior to or simultaneous with detection.
25  Illustrative non-limiting examples of nucleic acid amplification techniques include, but are not
    limited to, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
    (RT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), ligase chain reaction (LCR), strand
    displacement amplification (SDA), and nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA).
    Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that certain amplification techniques (e.g., PCR)
30  require that RNA be reversed transcribed to DNA prior to amplification (e.g., RT-PCR), whereas
    other amplification techniques directly amplify RNA (e.g., TMA and NASBA).
             The polymerase chain reaction (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, 4,800,159 and
    4,965,188, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), commonly referred
    to as PCR, uses multiple cycles of denaturation, annealing of primer pairs to opposite strands,
                                                       90n

    and primer extension to exponentially increase copy numbers of a target nucleic acid sequence.
    In a variation called RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase (RT) is used to make a complementary DNA
    (cDNA) from mRNA, and the cDNA is then amplified by PCR to produce multiple copies of
    DNA. For other various permutations of PCR see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202 and
 5  4,800,159; Mullis et al., Meth. Enzymol. 155: 335 (1987); and, Murakawa et al., DNA 7: 287
    (1988), each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
            Transcription mediated amplification (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,480,784 and 5,399,491, each of
    which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), commonly referred to as TMA,
    synthesizes multiple copies of a target nucleic acid sequence autocatalytically under conditions of
 0  substantially constant temperature, ionic strength, and pH in which multiple RNA copies of the
    target sequence autocatalytically generate additional copies. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,491
    and 5,824,518, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In a variation
    described in U.S. Publ. No. 20060046265 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), TMA
    optionally incorporates the use of blocking moieties, terminating moieties, and other modifying
 5  moieties to improve TMA process sensitivity and accuracy.
            The ligase chain reaction (Weiss, R., Science 254: 1292 (1991), herein incorporated by
    reference in its entirety), commonly referred to as LCR, uses two sets of complementary DNA
    oligonucleotides that hybridize to adjacent regions of the target nucleic acid. The DNA
    oligonucleotides are covalently linked by a DNA ligase in repeated cycles of thermal
 '0 denaturation, hybridization and ligation to produce a detectable double-stranded ligated
    oligonucleotide product.
    Strand displacement amplification (Walker, G. et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 392-396
    (1992); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,270,184 and 5,455,166, each of which is herein incorporated by
    reference in its entirety), commonly referred to as SDA, uses cycles of annealing pairs of primer
25  sequences to opposite strands of a target sequence, primer extension in the presence of a dNTPaS
    to produce a duplex hemiphosphorothioated primer extension product, endonuclease-mediated
    nicking of a hemimodified restriction endonuclease recognition site, and polymerase-mediated
    primer extension from the 3' end of the nick to displace an existing strand and produce a strand
    for the next round of primer annealing, nicking and strand displacement, resulting in geometric
30  amplification of product. Thermophilic SDA (tSDA) uses thermophilic endonucleases and
    polymerases at higher temperatures in essentially the same method (EP Pat. No. 0 684 315).
            Other amplification methods include, for example: nucleic acid sequence based
    amplification (U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,238, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety),
    commonly referred to as NASBA; one that uses an RNA replicase to amplify the probe molecule
                                                     21

    itself (Lizardi et al., Bio Technol. 6: 1197 (1988), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety),
    commonly referred to as Q3 replicase; a transcription based amplification method (Kwoh et al.,
    Proc.Natl. A cad. Sci. USA 86:1173 (1989)); and, self-sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et
    al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 1874 (1990), each of which is herein incorporated by
 5  reference in its entirety). For further discussion of known amplification methods see Persing,
    David H., "In Vitro Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques" in DiagnosticMedical
    Microbiology: Principlesand Applications (Persing et al., Eds.), pp. 51-87 (American Society for
    Microbiology, Washington, DC (1993)).
 0                   4.       Detection Methods
             Non-amplified or amplified nucleic acids can be detected by any conventional means.
    For example, the ncRNAs can be detected by hybridization with a detectably labeled probe and
    measurement of the resulting hybrids. Illustrative non-limiting examples of detection methods
    are described below.
 5           One illustrative detection method, the Hybridization Protection Assay (HPA) involves
    hybridizing a chemiluminescent oligonucleotide probe (e.g., an acridinium ester-labeled (AE)
    probe) to the target sequence, selectively hydrolyzing the chemiluminescent label present on
    unhybridized probe, and measuring the chemiluminescence produced from the remaining probe
    in a luminometer. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,174 and Norman C. Nelson et al., Nonisotopic
 '0 Probing, Blotting, and Sequencing, ch. 17 (Larry J. Kricka ed., 2d ed. 1995, each of which is
    herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
             Another illustrative detection method provides for quantitative evaluation of the
    amplification process in real-time. Evaluation of an amplification process in "real-time" involves
    determining the amount of amplicon in the reaction mixture either continuously or periodically
25  during the amplification reaction, and using the determined values to calculate the amount of
    target sequence initially present in the sample. A variety of methods for determining the amount
    of initial target sequence present in a sample based on real-time amplification are well known in
    the art. These include methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,303,305 and 6,541,205, each of
    which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Another method for determining the
30  quantity of target sequence initially present in a sample, but which is not based on a real-time
    amplification, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,710,029, herein incorporated by reference in its
    entirety.
             Amplification products may be detected in real-time through the use of various self
    hybridizing probes, most of which have a stem-loop structure. Such self-hybridizing probes are
                                                       T,

    labeled so that they emit differently detectable signals, depending on whether the probes are in a
    self-hybridized state or an altered state through hybridization to a target sequence. By way of
    non-limiting example, "molecular torches" are a type of self-hybridizing probe that includes
    distinct regions of self-complementarity (referred to as "the target binding domain" and "the
 5  target closing domain") which are connected by a joining region (e.g., non-nucleotide linker) and
    which hybridize to each other under predetermined hybridization assay conditions. In a preferred
    embodiment, molecular torches contain single-stranded base regions in the target binding domain
    that are from 1 to about 20 bases in length and are accessible for hybridization to a target
    sequence present in an amplification reaction under strand displacement conditions. Under
 0  strand displacement conditions, hybridization of the two complementary regions, which may be
    fully or partially complementary, of the molecular torch is favored, except in the presence of the
    target sequence, which will bind to the single-stranded region present in the target binding
    domain and displace all or a portion of the target closing domain. The target binding domain and
    the target closing domain of a molecular torch include a detectable label or a pair of interacting
 5  labels (e.g., luminescent/quencher) positioned so that a different signal is produced when the
    molecular torch is self-hybridized than when the molecular torch is hybridized to the target
    sequence, thereby permitting detection of probe:target duplexes in a test sample in the presence
    of unhybridized molecular torches. Molecular torches and a variety of types of interacting label
    pairs are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,274, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 10         Another example of a detection probe having self-complementarity is a "molecular
    beacon." Molecular beacons include nucleic acid molecules having a target complementary
    sequence, an affinity pair (or nucleic acid arms) holding the probe in a closed conformation in the
    absence of a target sequence present in an amplification reaction, and a label pair that interacts
    when the probe is in a closed conformation. Hybridization of the target sequence and the target
25  complementary sequence separates the members of the affinity pair, thereby shifting the probe to
    an open conformation. The shift to the open conformation is detectable due to reduced
    interaction of the label pair, which may be, for example, a fluorophore and a quencher (e.g.,
    DABCYL and EDANS). Molecular beacons are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,925,517 and
    6,150,097, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
30          Other self-hybridizing probes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. By way
    of non-limiting example, probe binding pairs having interacting labels, such as those disclosed in
    U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,862 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) might be adapted for
    use in the present invention. Probe systems used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms
    (SNPs) might also be utilized in the present invention. Additional detection systems include

    "molecular switches," as disclosed in U.S. Publ. No. 20050042638, herein incorporated by
    reference in its entirety. Other probes, such as those comprising intercalating dyes and/or
    fluorochromes, are also useful for detection of amplification products in the present invention.
    See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,447 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

            ii.      Data Analysis
            In some embodiments, a computer-based analysis program is used to translate the raw
    data generated by the detection assay (e.g., the presence, absence, or amount of a given marker or
    markers) into data of predictive value for a clinician. The clinician can access the predictive data
 0  using any suitable means. Thus, in some preferred embodiments, the present invention provides
    the further benefit that the clinician, who is not likely to be trained in genetics or molecular
    biology, need not understand the raw data. The data is presented directly to the clinician in its
    most useful form. The clinician is then able to immediately utilize the information in order to
    optimize the care of the subject.
 5          The present invention contemplates any method capable of receiving, processing, and
    transmitting the information to and from laboratories conducting the assays, information
    provides, medical personal, and subjects. For example, in some embodiments of the present
    invention, a sample (e.g., a biopsy or a serum or urine sample) is obtained from a subject and
    submitted to a profiling service (e.g., clinical lab at a medical facility, genomic profiling
 '0 business, etc.), located in any part of the world (e.g., in a country different than the country
    where the subject resides or where the information is ultimately used) to generate raw data.
    Where the sample comprises a tissue or other biological sample, the subject may visit a medical
    center to have the sample obtained and sent to the profiling center, or subjects may collect the
    sample themselves (e.g., a urine sample) and directly send it to a profiling center. Where the
25  sample comprises previously determined biological information, the information may be directly
    sent to the profiling service by the subject (e.g., an information card containing the information
    may be scanned by a computer and the data transmitted to a computer of the profiling center
    using an electronic communication systems). Once received by the profiling service, the sample
    is processed and a profile is produced (i.e., expression data), specific for the diagnostic or
30  prognostic information desired for the subject.
            The profile data is then prepared in a format suitable for interpretation by a treating
    clinician. For example, rather than providing raw expression data, the prepared format may
    represent a diagnosis or risk assessment (e.g., presence or absence of a ncRNA) for the subject,
    along with recommendations for particular treatment options. The data may be displayed to the
                                                        9zM

    clinician by any suitable method. For example, in some embodiments, the profiling service
    generates a report that can be printed for the clinician (e.g., at the point of care) or displayed to
    the clinician on a computer monitor.
             In some embodiments, the information is first analyzed at the point of care or at a
 5  regional facility. The raw data is then sent to a central processing facility for further analysis
    and/or to convert the raw data to information useful for a clinician or patient. The central
    processing facility provides the advantage of privacy (all data is stored in a central facility with
    uniform security protocols), speed, and uniformity of data analysis. The central processing
    facility can then control the fate of the data following treatment of the subject. For example,
 0  using an electronic communication system, the central facility can provide data to the clinician,
    the subject, or researchers.
             In some embodiments, the subject is able to directly access the data using the electronic
    communication system. The subject may chose further intervention or counseling based on the
    results. In some embodiments, the data is used for research use. For example, the data may be
 5  used to further optimize the inclusion or elimination of markers as useful indicators of a
    particular condition or stage of disease or as a companion diagnostic to determine a treatment
    course of action.
             iiii.  In vivo Imaging
 10          ncRNAs may also be detected using in vivo imaging techniques, including but not limited
    to: radionuclide imaging; positron emission tomography (PET); computerized axial tomography,
    X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging method, fluorescence detection, and chemiluminescent
    detection. In some embodiments, in vivo imaging techniques are used to visualize the presence
    of or expression of cancer markers in an animal (e.g., a human or non-human mammal). For
25  example, in some embodiments, cancer marker mRNA or protein is labeled using a labeled
    antibody specific for the cancer marker. A specifically bound and labeled antibody can be
    detected in an individual using an in vivo imaging method, including, but not limited to,
    radionuclide imaging, positron emission tomography, computerized axial tomography, X-ray or
    magnetic resonance imaging method, fluorescence detection, and chemiluminescent detection.
30  Methods for generating antibodies to the cancer markers of the present invention are described
    below.
             The in vivo imaging methods of embodiments of the present invention are useful in the
    identification of cancers that express ncRNAs (e.g., prostate cancer). In vivo imaging is used to
    visualize the presence or level of expression of a ncRNA. Such techniques allow for diagnosis

    without the use of an unpleasant biopsy. The in vivo imaging methods of embodiments of the
    present invention can further be used to detect metastatic cancers in other parts of the body.
             In some embodiments, reagents (e.g., antibodies) specific for the cancer markers of the
    present invention are fluorescently labeled. The labeled antibodies are introduced into a subject
 5  (e.g., orally or parenterally). Fluorescently labeled antibodies are detected using any suitable
    method (e.g., using the apparatus described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,107, herein incorporated by
    reference).
             In other embodiments, antibodies are radioactively labeled. The use of antibodies for in
    vivo diagnosis is well known in the art. Sumerdon et al., (Nucl. Med. Biol 17:247-254 [1990]
 0  have described an optimized antibody-chelator for the radioimmunoscintographic imaging of
    tumors using Indium-1I1      as the label. Griffin et al., (J Clin One 9:631-640 [1991]) have
    described the use of this agent in detecting tumors in patients suspected of having recurrent
    colorectal cancer. The use of similar agents with paramagnetic ions as labels for magnetic
    resonance imaging is known in the art (Lauffer, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 22:339-342
 5  [1991]). The label used will depend on the imaging modality chosen. Radioactive labels such as
    Indium-111, Technetium-99m, or Iodine- 131 can be used for planar scans or single photon
    emission computed tomography (SPECT). Positron emitting labels such as Fluorine-19 can also
    be used for positron emission tomography (PET). For MRI, paramagnetic ions such as
    Gadolinium (III) or Manganese (II) can be used.
 10          Radioactive metals with half-lives ranging from 1 hour to 3.5 days are available for
    conjugation to antibodies, such as scandium-47 (3.5 days) gallium-67 (2.8 days), gallium-68 (68
    minutes), technetiium-99m (6 hours), and indium- 11 (3.2 days), of which gallium-67,
    technetium-99m, and indium-Il are preferable for gamma camera imaging, gallium-68 is
    preferable for positron emission tomography.
25           A useful method of labeling antibodies with such radiometals is by means of a
    bifunctional chelating agent, such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), as described,
    for example, by Khaw et al. (Science 209:295 [1980]) for In-Ill and Tc-99m, and by Scheinberg
    et al. (Science 215:1511 [1982]). Other chelating agents may also be used, but the 1-(p
    carboxymethoxybenzyl)EDTA and the carboxycarbonic anhydride of DTPA are advantageous
30  because their use permits conjugation without affecting the antibody's immunoreactivity
    substantially.
             Another method for coupling DPTA to proteins is by use of the cyclic anhydride of
    DTPA, as described by Hnatowich et al. (Int. J. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 33:327 [1982]) for labeling of
    albumin with In-111, but which can be adapted for labeling of antibodies. A suitable method of

    labeling antibodies with Tc-99m which does not use chelation with DPTA is the pretinning
    method of Crockford et al., (U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,546, herein incorporated by reference).
             A method of labeling immunoglobulins with Tc-99m is that described by Wong et al.
    (Int. J. Appl. Radiat. Isot., 29:251 [1978]) for plasma protein, and recently applied successfully
 5  by Wong et al. (J. Nucl. Med., 23:229 [1981]) for labeling antibodies.
             In the case of the radiometals conjugated to the specific antibody, it is likewise desirable
    to introduce as high a proportion of the radiolabel as possible into the antibody molecule without
    destroying its immunospecificity. A further improvement may be achieved by effecting
    radiolabeling in the presence of the ncRNA, to insure that the antigen binding site on the
 0  antibody will be protected. The antigen is separated after labeling.
             In still further embodiments, in vivo biophotonic imaging (Xenogen, Almeda, CA) is
    utilized for in vivo imaging. This real-time in vivo imaging utilizes luciferase. The luciferase
    gene is incorporated into cells, microorganisms, and animals (e.g., as a fusion protein with a
    cancer marker of the present invention). When active, it leads to a reaction that emits light. A
 5  CCD camera and software is used to capture the image and analyze it.
             iv.      Compositions & Kits
             Compositions for use in the diagnostic methods described herein include, but are not
    limited to, probes, amplification oligonucleotides, and the like.
 10          The probe and antibody compositions of the present invention may also be provided in
    the form of an array.
    II.      Drug Screening Applications
             In some embodiments, the present invention provides drug screening assays (e.g., to
25  screen for anticancer drugs). The screening methods of the present invention utilize ncRNAs.
    For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of screening for
    compounds that alter (e.g., decrease) the expression or activity of ncRNAs. The compounds or
    agents may interfere with transcription, by interacting, for example, with the promoter region.
    The compounds or agents may interfere with mRNA (e.g., by RNA interference, antisense
30  technologies, etc.). The compounds or agents may interfere with pathways that are upstream or
    downstream of the biological activity of ncRNAs. In some embodiments, candidate compounds
    are antisense or interfering RNA agents (e.g., oligonucleotides) directed against ncRNAs. In
    other embodiments, candidate compounds are antibodies or small molecules that specifically
    bind to a ncRNAs regulator or expression products inhibit its biological function.
                                                       9)7

             In one screening method, candidate compounds are evaluated for their ability to alter
    ncRNAs expression by contacting a compound with a cell expressing a ncRNA and then assaying
    for the effect of the candidate compounds on expression. In some embodiments, the effect of
    candidate compounds on expression of ncRNAs is assayed for by detecting the level ncRNA
 5  expressed by the cell. mRNA expression can be detected by any suitable method.

    A.       Methods
 5           Methods Summary
             All prostate tissue samples were obtained from the University of Michigan Specialized
    Program Of Research Excellence (S.P.O.R.E.) using an IRB-approved informed consent
    protocol. Next generation sequencing and library preparation was performed as previously
    described (Maher et al., Proc NatlAcad Sci USA 106 (30), 12353 (2009)). Uniquely mapping
 '0 sequencing reads were aligned with TopHat and sequencing data for all samples was merged. Ab
    initio transcriptome assembly was performed by aligning sequences with TopHat and using
    uniquely mapped read positions to build transcripts with Cufflinks. Informatics approaches were
    used to refine the assembly and predict expressed transcriptional units. Unannotated transcripts
    were nominated based upon their absence in the UCSC, RefSeq, ENSEMBL, ENCODE, and
25  Vega databases. Differential expression was determined using the Significance Analysis of
    Microarrays (SAM) algorithm (Tusher et al., ProcNat Acad Sci USA 98 (9), 5116 (2001)) on
    log2 mean expression in benign, cancer, and metastatic samples. Cancer outlier profile analysis
    (COPA) was performed as previously described (Tomlins et al., Science 310 (5748), 644 (2005))
    with slight modifications. PCR experiments were performed according to standard protocols, and
30  RACE was performed with the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's
    instructions. ChIP-seq data was obtained from previously published data (Yu et al., Cancer Cell
    17 (5), 443). siRNA knockdown was performed with custom siRNA oligos (Dharmacon) with
    Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Transmembrane invasion assays were performed with Matrigel (BD
    Biosciences) and cell proliferation assays were performed by cell count with a Coulter counter.

    Urine analyses were performed as previously described (Laxman et al., Cancer Res 68 (3), 645
    (2008)) with minor modifications.
            Cell lines and tissues

    5 pg/ml transferrin, 0.25 gg/ml biotin, and 25 gg/ml adenine. PrEC cells were grown in PrEGM
                                                      ,0

    supplemented with 2 ml BPE, 0.5 ml hydrocortisone, 0.5 ml EGF, 0.5 ml epinephrine, 0.5 ml
    transferring, 0.5 ml insulin, 0.5 ml retinoic acid, and 0.5 ml triiodothyronine, as part of the
    PrEGM BulletKit (Lonza). PrSMC cells were grown in SmGM-2 media supplemented with 2ml
    BPE, 0.5 ml hydrocortisone, 0.5 ml EGF, 0.5 ml epinephrine, 0.5 ml transferring, 0.5 ml insulin,
 5  0.5 ml retinoic acid, and 0.5 ml triiodothyronine, as part of the SmGM-2 BulletKit (Lonza).
            RNA-Seq Library Preparation.
            Next generation sequencing of RNA was performed on 21 prostate cell lines, 20 benign
    adjacent prostates, 47 localized tumors, and 14 metastatic tumors according to Illumina's
 0  protocol using 2 gg of RNA. RNA integrity was measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer,
    and only samples with a RIN score >7.0 were advanced for library generation. RNA was poly
    A+ selected using the OligodT beads provided by Ilumina and fragmented with the Ambion
    Fragmentation Reagents kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA synthesis, end-repair, A-base addition,
    and ligation of the Illumina PCR adaptors (single read or paired-end where appropriate) were
 5  performed according to Illumina's protocol. Libraries were then size-selected for 250-300 bp
    cDNA fragments on a 3.5% agarose gel and PCR-amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase
    (Finnzymes) for 15 -18 PCR cycles. PCR products were then purified on a 2% agarose gel and
    gel-extracted. Library quality was credentialed by assaying each library on an Agilent 2100
    Bioanalyzer of product size and concentration. Libraries were sequenced as 36-45mers on an
 '0 Illumina Genome Analyzer I or Genome Analyzer II flowcell according to Illumina's protocol.
    All single read samples were sequenced on a Genome Analyzer I, and all paired-end samples
    were sequenced on a Genome Analyzer II.
            RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
25          Total RNA was isolated using Trizol and an RNeasy Kit (Invitrogen) with DNase I
    digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was verified on an Agilent
    Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA was synthesized from total
    RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and random primers (Invitrogen).
30          Quantitative Real-time PCR
            Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed using Power SYBR Green
    Mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time
    PCR System. All oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies
    (Coralville, IA) and are listed in Table 13. The housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was used as a

    loading control. Fold changes were calculated relative to GAPDH and normalized to the median
    value of the benign samples.
            Reverse-transcription PCR
 5          Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed for primer pairs using Platinum Taq
    High Fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. PCR
    products were either sequenced directly (if only a single product was observed) or appropriate gel
    products were extracted using a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pcr4-TOPO vectors
    (Invitrogen). PCR products were bidirectionally sequenced at the University of Michigan
 0  Sequencing Core using either gene-specific primers or M13 forward and reverse primers for
    cloned PCR products. All oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA
    Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are listed in Table 13.
            RNA-ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)
 5          5' and 3' RACE was performed using the GeneRacer RLM-RACE kit (Invitrogen)
    according to the manufacturer's instructions. RACE PCR products were obtained using Platinum
    Taq High Fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen), the supplied GeneRacer primers, and appropriate
    gene-specific primers indicated in Table 13. RACEPCR products were separated on a 2%
    agarose gels. Gel products were extracted with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into pcr4
 '0 TOPO vectors (Invitrogen), and sequenced bidirectionally using M13 forward and reverse
    primers at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core. At least three colonies were sequenced
    for every gel product that was purified.
            Paired-end next-generation sequencing of RNA
25          2 pg total RNA was selected for polyA+ RNA using Sera-Mag oligo(dT) beads (Thermo
    Scientific), and paired-end next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared as previously
    described (Maher et al., supra) using Illumina-supplied universal adaptor oligos and PCR primers
    (Illumina). Samples were sequenced in a single lane on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II flowcell
    using previously described protocols (Maher et al., supra). 36-45 mer paired-end reads were
30  according to the protocol provided by Illumina.
            siRNA knockdown studies
            Cells were plated in 100 mM plates at a desired concentration and transfected with 20 gM
    experimental siRNA oligos or non-targeting controls twice, at 12 hours and 36 hours post
                                                     21

    plating. Knockdowns were performed with Oligofectamine and Optimem. Knockdown efficiency
    was determined by qPCR. 72 hours post-transfection, cells were trypsinized, counted with a
    Coulter counter, and diluted to 1 million cells/mL. For proliferation assays, 200,000 cells were
    plated in 24-well plates and grown in regular media. 48 and 96 hours post-plating, cells were
 5  harvested and counted using a Coulter counter. For invasion assays, Matrigel was diluted 1:4 in
    serum-free media and 100 gL of the diluted Matrigel was applied to a Boyden chamber
    transmembrane insert and allowed to settle overnight at 37 0 C. 200,000 cells suspended in serum
    free media were applied per insert and 500 gL of serum-containing media was placed in the
    bottom of the Boyden (fetal bovine serum functioning as a chemoattractant). Cells were allowed
 0  to invade for 48 hours, at which time inserts were removed and noninvading cells and Matrigel
    were gently removed with a cotton swab. Invading cells were stained with crystal violet for 15
    minutes and air-dried. For colorimetric assays, the inserts were treated with 200 gl of 10% acetic
    acid and the absorbance at 560 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer. For WST-1 assays,
    20,000 cells were plated into 96-well plates and grown in 100 gL of serum-containing media. 48
 5  and 96 hours post-plating, cells were measured for viability by adding 10 gL of WST-1 reagent
    to the cell media, incubating for 2 hours at 37 0C and measuring the absorbance at 450 nM using
    a spectrophotomer.
            Urine qPCR
 10         Urine samples were collected from 120 patients with informed consent following a digital
    rectal exam before either needle biopsy or radical prostatectomy at the University of Michigan
    with Institutional Review Board approval as described previously (Laxman et al., Cancer Res 68
    (3), 645 (2008)). Isolation of RNA from urine and TransPlex whole transcriptome amplification
    were performed as described previously (Laxman et al., Neoplasia 8 (10), 885 (2006)). qPCR on
25  urine samples was performed for KLK3 (PSA), TMPRSS2-ERG, GAPDH, PCA3, PCAT-1 and
    PCAT-14 using Power SYBR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) as described above. Raw Ct
    values were extracted and normalized in the following manner. First, samples with GAPDH Ct
    values >25 or KLK3 Ct values >30 were removed from analysis to ensure sufficient prostate cell
    collection, leaving 108 samples for analysis. The GAPDH and KLK3 raw Ct values were average
30  for each sample. ACt analysis was performed by measuring each value against the average of
    CtGAPDH and CtKLK3, and ACt values were normalized to the median ACt of the benign
    samples. Fold change was then calculated at 2- ACt. Samples were considered to be prostate
    cancer if histopathological analysis observed cancer or if the TMPRSS2-ERG transcript achieved

    a Ct value <37. Benign samples were defined as samples with normal histology and TMPRSS2
    ERG transcript Ct values >37.
             Statistical analyses for experimental studies
 5           All data are presented as means  s.e.m. All experimental assays were performed in
    duplicate or triplicate.
             Bioinformatics analyses
             To achieve an ab initio prediction of the prostate cancer transcriptome existing publicly
 0  tools for mapping, assembly, and quantification of transcripts were supplemented with additional
    informatics filtering steps to enrich the results for the most robust transcript predictions (Fig. 6a).
    Transcripts were then identified and classified by comparing them against gene annotation
    databases (Fig. 6b). Details of the bioinformatics analyses are provided below.
 5           Mapping reads with TopHat
             Reads were aligned using TopHat v 1.0.13 (Feb 5, 2010) (Trapnell et al., Bioinformatics
    25, 1105-11 (2009)), a gapped aligner capable of discovering splice junctions ab initio. Briefly,
    TopHat aligns reads to the human genome using Bowtie (Langmead et al., Genome Biol 10, R25
    (2009)) to determine a set of "coverage islands" that may represent putative exons. TopHat uses
 '0 these exons as well as the presence of GT-AG genomic splicing motifs to build a second set of
    reference sequences spanning exon-exon junctions. The unmapped reads from the initial genome
    alignment step are then remapped against this splice junction reference to discover all the
    junction-spanning reads in the sample. TopHat outputs the reads that successfully map to either
    the genome or the splice junction reference in SAM format for further analysis. For this study a
25  maximum intron size of 500kb, corresponding to over 99.98% of RefSeq (Wheeler et al. Nucleic
    Acids Res 28, 10-4 (2000)) introns was used. For sequencing libraries the insert size was
    determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer prior to data analysis, and it was found that this
    insert size agreed closely with software predictions. An insert size standard deviation of 20 bases
    was chosen in order to match the most common band size cut from gels during library
30  preparation. In total, 1.723 billion fragments were generated from 201 lanes of sequencing on the
    Illumina Genome Analyzer and Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Reads were mapped to the human
    genome (hg18) downloaded from the UCSC genome browser website (Karolchik et al., Nucleic
    Acids Res 31, 51-4 (2003); Kent et al., Genome Res 12, 996-1006 (2002)). 1.418 billion unique

    alignments were obtained, including 114.4 million splice junctions for use in transcriptome
    assembly. Reads with multiple alignments with less than two mismatches were discarded.
            Ab initio assembly and quantification with Cufflinks
 5           Aligned reads from TopHat were assembled into sample-specific transcriptomes with
    Cufflinks version 0.8.2 (March 26, 2010) (Trapnell et al., Nat Biotechnol 28, 511-5). Cufflinks
    assembles exonic and splice-junction reads into transcripts using their alignment coordinates. To
    limit false positive assemblies a maximum intronic length of 300kb, corresponding to the 99.93%
    percentile of known introns was used. After assembling transcripts, Cufflinks computes isoform
 0  level abundances by finding a parsimonious allocation of reads to the transcripts within a locus.
    Transcripts with abundance less than 15% of the major transcript in the locus, and minor
    isoforms with abundance less than 5% of the major isoform were filtered. Default settings were
    used for the remaining parameters.
             The Cufflinks assembly stage yielded a set of transcript annotations for each of the
 5  sequenced libraries. The transcripts were partitioned by chromosome and the Cuffcompare utility
    provided by Cufflinks was used to merge the transcripts into a combined set of annotations. The
    Cuffcompare program performs a union of all transcripts by merging transcripts that share all
    introns and exons. The 5' and 3' exons of transcripts were allowed to vary by up to 1OOnt during
    the comparison process.
 10
             Distinguishing transcripts from background signal
             Cuffcompare reported a total of 8.25 million distinct transcripts. Manual inspection of
    these transcripts in known protein coding gene regions indicated that most of the transcripts were
    likely to be poor quality reconstructions of overlapping larger transcripts. Also, many of the
25  transcripts were unspliced and had a total length smaller than the size selected fragment length of
    approximately ~250nt. Furthermore, many of these transcripts were only present in a single
    sample. A statistical classifier to predict transcripts over background signal was designed to
    identify highly recurrent transcripts that may be altered in prostate cancer. AceView (Thierry
    Mieg et al. Genome Biol 7 Suppl 1, S12 1-14 (2006)) were used. For each transcript predicted by
30  Cufflinks the following statistics were collected: length (bp), number of exons, recurrence
    (number of samples in which the transcript was predicted), 95th percentile of abundance
    (measured in Fragments per Kilobase per Million reads (FPKM)) across all samples, and
    uniqueness of genomic DNA harboring the transcript transcript (measured using the Rosetta
    uniqueness track from UCSC (Rhead et al. 2010. Nucleic Acids Res 38, D613-9). Using this
                                                        114

    information, recursive partitioning and regression trees in R (package part) were used to predict,
    for each transcript, whether its expression patterns and structural properties resembled those of
    annotated genes. Classification was performed independently for each chromosome in order to
    incorporate the effect of gene density variability on expression thresholds. Transcripts that were
 5  not classified as annotated genes were discarded, and the remainder were subjected to additional
    analysis and filtering steps. By examining the decision tree results it was observed that the 95th
    percentile of expression across all samples as well as the recurrence of each transcript were most
    frequently the best predictors of expressed versus background transcripts (Fig. 7).

            The statistical classifier predicted a total 2.88 million (34.9%) transcript fragments as
    "expressed" transcripts. A program was developed to extend and merge intron-redundant
    transcripts to produce a minimum set of transcripts that describes the assemblies produced by
    Cufflinks. The merging step produced a total of 123,554 independent transcripts. Tanscript
 5  abundance levels were re-computed for these revised transcripts in Reads per Kilobase per
    Million (RPKM) units. These expression levels were used for the remainder of the study. Several
    additional filtering steps were used to isolate the most robust transcripts. First, transcripts with a
    total length less than 200 nt were discarded. Single exon transcripts with greater than 75%
    overlap to another longer transcript were also discarded. Transcripts that lacked a completely
 '0 unambiguous genomic DNA stretch of at least 40 nt were also removed. Genomic uniqueness
    was measured using the Rosetta uniqueness track downloaded from the UCSC genome browser
    website. Transcripts that were not present in at least 5% of the cohort (>5 samples) at more than
    5.0 RPKM were retained.
            In certain instances transcripts were observed that were interrupted by poorly mappable
25  genomic regions. Additionally, for low abundance genes fragmentation due to the lack of splice
    junction or paired-end read evidence needed to connect nearby fragments were observed. The
    difference in the Pearson correlation between expression of randomly chosen exons on the same
    transcript versus expression of spatially proximal exons on different transcripts was measured
    and it was found that in the cohort, a Pearson correlation >0.8 had a positive predictive value
30  (PPV) of >95% for distinct exons to be part of the same transcript. Using this criteria,
    hierarchical agglomerative clustering to extend transcript fragments into larger transcriptional
    units was performed. Pairs of transcripts further than 100 kb apart, transcripts on opposite
    strands, and overlapping transcripts were not considered for clustering. Groups of correlated
    transcripts were merged, and introns <40 nt in length were removed.

             Comparison with gene annotation databases
             The 44,534 transcripts produced by the bioinformatics pipeline were classified by
    comparison with a comprehensive list of "annotated" transcripts from UCSC, RefSeq, ENCODE,
 5  Vega, and Ensembl. First, transcripts corresponding to processed pseudogenes were separated.
    This was done to circumvent a known source of bias in the TopHat read aligner. TopHat maps
    reads to genomic DNA in its first step, predisposing exon-exon junction reads to align to their
    spliced retroposed pseudogene homologues. Next, transcripts with >1bp of overlap with at least
    one annotated gene on the correct strand were designated "annotated", and the remainder were
 0  deemed "unannotated". Transcripts with no overlap with protein coding genes were subdivided
    into intronic, intergenic, or partially intronic antisense categories based on their relative genomic
    locations.
             Informatics filtering of unspliced pre-mRNA isoforms
 5           An increase in the percentage of intronic transcripts in the assembly relative to known
    intronic ncRNAs was observed. This led to the observation that in many cases unspliced pre
    mRNAs appear at sufficient levels to escape the filtering steps employed by Cufflinks during the
    assembly stage. Intronic and antisense transcripts that were correlated (Pearson correlation >0.5)
    to their overlapping protein coding genes were removed. This effectively removed transcripts
 '0 within genes such as PCA3 and HPN that were obvious premRNA artifacts, while leaving truly
    novel intronic transcripts - such as those within FBXL 7 and CDH13 - intact. These steps
    produced a consensus set of 35,415 transcripts supporting long polyadenylated RNA molecules
    in human prostate tissues and cell lines. Per chromosome transcript counts closely mirrored
    known transcript databases (Table 2), indicating that the informatics procedures employed
25  compensate well for gene density variability across chromosomes. Overall a similar number of
    transcripts as present in the either the RefSeq or UCSC databases (Wheeler et al. Nucleic Acids
    Res 28, 10-4 (2000)) were detected.
             Coding potential analysis
30           To analyze coding potential, DNA sequences for each transcript were extracted and
    searched for open reading frames (ORFs) using the txCdsPredict program from the UCSC source
    tool set (Kent et al. Genome Res 12, 996-1006 (2002)). This program produces a score
    corresponding to the protein coding capacity of a given sequence, and scores >800 are ~90%
    predictive of protein coding genes. This threshold was used to count transcripts with coding

    potential, and found only 5 of 6,641 unannotated genes with scores >800, compared with 1,669
    of 25,414 protein coding transcripts. Additionally, it was observed that protein coding genes
    possess consistently longer ORFs than either unannotated or annotated ncRNA transcripts,
    indicating that the vast majority of the unannotated transcripts represent ncRNAs (Fig. 10).
 5
             Separation of transcripts into repetitive and non-repetitive categories
            To separate transcripts into "repeat" and "non-repeat" transcripts, the genomic DNA
    corresponding to the transcript exons was extracted and the fraction of repeat-masked nucleotides
    in each sequence were calculated. For the designation of repeat classes, RepMask 3.2.7 UCSC
 0  Genome Browser track (Kent, supra) was used. It was observed that transcripts enriched with
    repetitive DNA tended to be poorly conserved and lacked ChIP-seq marks of active chromatin
    (Fig. 12). Transcripts containing >250% repetitive DNA (Fig. 11) were separated for the purposes
    of the ChIP-seq and conservation analyses discussed below.
 5          Conservation Analysis
            The SiPhy package (Garber et al. Bioinformatics 25, i54-62 (2009)) was used to estimate
    the locate rate of variation (o) of all non-repetitive transcript exons across 29 placental
    mammals. The program was run as described on the SiPhy website.
 10         ChIP-Seq datasets
            Published ChIP-Seq datasets for H3K4mel, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, Acetylated H3, Pan
    H3, and H3K36me3 were used (Yu et al. Cancer Cell 17, 443-54). These data are publically
    available through the NCBI Geo Omnibus (GEO GSM353632). The raw ChIP-Seq data was
    analyzed using MACS34 (H3K4mel, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, Acetylated H3, and Pan-H3) or
25  SICER35 (H3K36me3) peak finder programs using default settings. These peak finders were
    used based upon their preferential suitability to detect different types of histone modifications
    (Pepke et al., Nat Methods 6, S22-32 (2009)). The H3K4me3-H3K36me3 chromatin signature
    used to identify lincRNAs was determined from the peak coordinates by associating each
    H3K4me3 peak with the closest H3K36me3-enriched region up to a maximum of 10kb away.
30  The enhancer signature (H3K4mel but not H3K4me3) was determined by subtracting the set of
    overlapping H3K4me3 peaks from the entire set of H3K4mel peaks. These analyses were
    performed with the bx-python libraries distributed as part of the Galaxy bioinformatics
    infrastructure.

            Differential Expression Analysis
            To predict differentially expressed transcripts a matrix of log-transformed, normalized
    RPKM expression values was prepared by using the base 2 logarithm after adding 0.1 to all
    RPKM values. The data were first centered by subtracting the median expression of the benign
 5  samples for each transcript. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method (Tusher et
    al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 98, 5116-21 (2001)) with 250 permutations of the Tusher et al. SO
    selection method was used to predict differentially expressed genes. A delta value corresponding
    to the 90th percentile FDR desired for individual analyses was used. The MultiExperiment
    Viewer application (Chu et al., Genome Biol 9, RI 18 (2008)) was used to run SAM and generate
 0  heatmaps. It was confirmed that the results matched expected results through comparison with
    microarrays and known prostate cancer biomarkers.
            Outlier Analysis
            A modified COPA analysis was performed on the 81 tissue samples in the cohort. RPKM
 5  expression values were used and shifted by 1.0 in order to avoid division by zero. The COPA
    analysis had the following steps (MacDonald & Ghosh, Bioinformatics22, 2950-1 (2006);
    Tomlins et al. Science 310, 644-8 (2005)): 1) gene expression values were median centered,
    using the median expression value for the gene across the all samples in the cohort. This sets the
    gene's median to zero. 2) The median absolute deviation (MAD) was calculated for each gene,
 '0 and then each gene expression value was scaled by its MAD. 3) The 80, 85, 90, 98 percentiles of
    the transformed expression values were calculated for each gene and the average of those four
    values was taken. Then, genes were rank ordered according to this "average percentile", which
    generated a list of outliers genes arranged by importance. 4) Finally, genes showing an outlier
    profile in the benign samples were discarded. Six novel transcripts ranked as both outliers and
25  differentially-expressed genes in the analyses. These six were manually classified either as
    differentially-expressed or outlier status based on what each individual's distribution across
    samples indicated.
            Repeat Enrichment Analysis
30          To assess the enrichment of repetitive elements in the assembly, 100 random
    permutations of the transcript positions on the same chromosome and strand were generated. To
    mirror the original constraints used to nominate transcripts it was ensured that permuted
    transcript positions contained a uniquely mappable stretch of genomic DNA at least 50 nt long.
    To account for the effects of mappability difficulties, each exon was padded by  0 bp, 50 bp,

    100 bp, or 500 bp of additional genomic sequence before intersecting the exons with repeat
    elements in the RepeatMasker 3.2.7 database. It was observed that padding by more than 50bp
    did not improve enrichment results and padded exons by  50 bp in subsequent analyses and tests
    (Table 9). Finally, the Shapiro- Wilk test for normality was performed and it was verified that
 5  the number of matches to highly abundant repetitive element types was approximately normally
    distributed.
    B.       Results
 0           Prostate cancer transcriptome sequencing
             Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on 21 prostate cell lines, 20 benign
    adjacent prostates (benign), 47 localized tumors (PCA), and 14 metastatic tumors (MET). A total
    of 201 RNA-Seq libraries from this cohort were sequenced yielding a total of 1.41 billion
    mapped reads, with a median 4.70 million mapped reads per sample (Table 1 for sample
 5  information).
             To analyze these data a method for ab initio transcriptome assembly to reconstruct
    transcripts and transcript abundance levels was used (Figure 6 and Table 2) (Trapnell et al.,
    NatBiotechnol 28 (5), 511; Trapnell et al., Bioinformatics 25 (9), 1105 (2009)).    Sample-specific
    transcriptomes were predicted and individual predication were merged into a consensus
 '0 transcriptome and the most robust transcripts were retained (Figure 7). The ab initio
    transcriptome assembly and subsequent refinement steps yielded 35,415 distinct transcriptional
    loci (see Figure 8 for examples).
             The assembled transcriptome was compared to the UCSC, Ensembl, Refseq, Vega, and
    ENCODE gene databases to identify and categorize transcripts. While the majority of the
25  transcripts (77.30%) corresponded to annotated protein coding genes (72.10%) and noncoding
    RNAs (5.2%), a significant percentage (19.8%) lacked any overlap and were designated
    "unannotated" (Figure la). These included partially intronic antisense (2.44%), totally intronic
    (12.10%), and intergenic transcripts (5.250%). These results agree with previous data indicating
    that large fractions of the transcriptome represent unannotated transcription (Bimey et al., Nature
30  447 (7146), 799 (2007); Carninci et al., Science 309 (5740), 1559 (2005) and that significant
    percentages of genes may harbor related antisense transcripts (He et al., Science 322 (5909),
    1855 (2008); Yelin et al., Nat Biotechnol 21 (4), 379 (2003)). Due to the added complexity of
    characterizing antisense or partially intronic transcripts without strand-specific RNA-Seq
    libraries, studies focused on totally intronic and intergenic transcripts.
                                                      IQ

            Characterization of novel transcripts
            Global characterization of novel transcripts corroborated previous reports that they are
    relatively poorly conserved and more lowly expressed than protein coding genes (Guttman et al.,
 5  Nat Biotechnol 28 (5), 503; Guttman et al., Nature 458 (7235), 223 (2009)). Expression levels of
    unannotated prostate cancer transcripts were consistently higher than randomly permuted
    controls, but lower than annotated ncRNAs or protein coding genes (Figure 1b). Unannotated
    transcripts also showed less overlap with known expressed sequence tags (ESTs) than protein
    coding genes but more than randomly permuted controls (Figure 5). Unannotated transcripts
 0  showed a clear but subtle increase in conservation over control genomic intervals (novel
    intergenic transcripts p  = 2.7 x 10-4  0.0002 for 0.4 < o < 0.8; novel intronic transcripts p = 2.6
    x 10-5  0.0017 for 0 < o < 0.4, Figure 1c). Only a small subset of novel intronic transcripts
    showed increased conservation (Figure lc insert), but this conservation was quite profound. By
    contrast, a larger number of novel intergenic transcripts showed more mild increases in
 5  conservation. Finally, analysis of coding potential revealed that only 5 of 6,144 transcripts
    harbored a high quality open reading frame (ORF), indicating that the overwhelming majority of
    these transcripts represent ncRNAs (Figure 10).
            Next, published prostate cancer ChIP-Seq data for two prostate cell lines (Yu et al.,
    Cancer Cell 17 (5), 443; VCaP and LNCaP was used in order to interrogate the overlap of
 '0 unannotated transcripts with histone modifications supporting active transcription (H3K4me l,
    H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, Acetyl-H3 and RNA polymerase II, see Table 3). Because
    unannotated ncRNAs showed two clear subtypes, repeat-associated and non-repeats (Figure 11
    and discussed below), it was contemplated that these two subtypes may display distinct histone
    modifications as noted in previous research (Day et al., Genome Biol 11 (6), R69). Whereas non
25  repeat transcripts showed strong enrichment for histone marks of active transcription at their
    putative transcriptional start sites (TSSs), repeat-associated transcripts showed virtually no
    enrichment (Figure 12), and for the remaining ChIP-Seq analyses non-repeat transcripts only
    were considered. In this set of unannotated transcripts, strong enrichment for histone
    modifications characterizing TSSs and active transcription, including H3K4me2, H3K4me3,
30  Acetyl-H3 and RNA Polymerase II (Figure ld-g) but not H3K4mel was observed, which
    characterizes enhancer regions (Figures 13 and 14). Intergenic ncRNAs performed much better
    in these analyses than intronic ncRNAs (Figure ld-g). To elucidate global changes in transcript
    abundance between prostate cancer and benign tissues, differential expression was performed
    analysis for all transcripts. 836 genes differentially-expressed between benign and PCA samples
                                                       an

    (FDR < 0.01) were found, with protein-coding genes constituting 82.8% of all differentially
    expressed genes (Figure lh and Table 4). This category contained the most significant
    transcripts, including numerous known prostate cancer genes such as AMACR32 and Hepsin
    (Dhanasekaran et al., Nature 412 (6849), 822 (2001)). Annotated ncRNAs represented 7.4% of
 5  differentially-expressed genes, including the ncRNA PCA334, which resides within an intron of
    the PRUNE2 gene and ranked #4 overall (12.2 fold change; adj. p < 2 x 10-4, Wilcoxon rank
    sum test, Benjamini-Hochberg correction) (Figure 8). Finally, 9.8% of differentially-expressed
    genes corresponded to unannotated ncRNAs, including 3.2% within gene introns and 6.6% in
    intergenic regions, indicating that these species contribute significantly to the complexity of the
 0  prostate cancer transcriptome.
            Dysregulation of unannotated non-coding RNAs
            Recent reports of functional long intervening non-coding RNAs (Dhanasekaran et al.,
    Nature 412 (6849), 822 (2001); Gupta et al., Nature 464 (7291), 1071; Rinn et al., Cell 129 (7),
 5  1311 (2007); Guttman et al., Nature 458 (7235), 223 (2009)) (lincRNAs) in intergenic regions
    led to an exploration of intergenic ncRNAs further. A total of 1859 unannotated intergenic RNAs
    were found throughout the human genome. The present invention is not limited to a particular
    mechanism. Indeed, an understanding of the mechanism is not necessary to practice the present
    invention. Nonetheless it is contemplated that this is an underestimate due to the inability to
 '0 detect small RNAs eliminated by the ~250bp size selection performed during RNA-Seq library
    generation (Methods). Overall, novel intergenic RNAs resided closer to protein-coding genes
    than protein-coding genes do to each other (the median distance to the nearest protein-coding
    gene is 4292 kb for novel genes and 8559 kb for protein-coding genes, Figure 2a). For instance,
    if two protein-coding genes, Gene A and Gene B, are separated by the distance AB, then the
25  furthest an unannotated ncRNA can be from both of them is 0.5 *AB, which is exactly what was
    observed (4292/8559    = 0.501). Supporting this observation, 34.1% of unannotated transcripts are
    located >10 kb from the nearest protein-coding gene. As an example, the Chr15q arm was
    visualized using the Circos program. Eighty-nine novel intergenic transcripts were nominated
    across this chromosomal region, including several differentially-expressed loci centromeric to
30  TLE3 (Figure 2b) which were validated by PCR in prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 15). A
    focused analysis of the 1859 novel intergenic RNAs yielded 106 that were differentially
    expressed in localized tumors (FDR < 0.05; Figure 2c). These Prostate Cancer Associated
    Transcripts (PCATs) were ranked according to their fold change in localized tumor versus benign
    tissue (Tables 5 and 6).
                                                      A1

            Similarly, performing a modified cancer outlier profile analysis (COPA) on the RNA-Seq
    dataset re-discovered numerous known prostate cancer outliers, such as ERG7, ETV 17,
    SPINK135, and CRISP336,37, and nominated numerous unannotated ncRNAs as outliers
    (Figure 2d and Tables 6 and 7). Merging the results from the differential expression and COPA
 5  analyses resulted in a set of 121 unannotated transcripts that accurately discriminated benign,
    localized tumor, and metastatic prostate samples by unsupervised clustering (Figure 2c). These
    data provide evidence that PCATs serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer and novel prostate
    cancer subtypes. Clustering analyses using novel ncRNA outliers also provide disease subtypes
    (Figure 16).
 0
            Confirmation and tissue-specificity of ncRNAs
            Validation studies were performed on 14 unannotated expressed regions, including ones
    both included and not present in the list of differentially expressed transcripts. Reverse
    transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments demonstrated a
 5   -78% (11/14) validation rate in predicted cell line models for both transcript identity and
    expression level (Figure 17). Next, three transcripts (PCAT-109, PCAT-14, and PCAT-43)
    selectively upregulated in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate were examined. From the
    sequencing data, each genomic loci shows significantly increased expression in prostate cancer
    and metastases, except for PCAT-14, which appears absent in metastases (Figure 3a-c). PCAT
 '0 109 also ranks as the #5 best outlier in prostate cancer, just ahead of ERG (Figure 2d and Table
    6). qPCR on a cohort of 14 benign prostates, 47 tumors, and 10 metastases confirmed expression
    of these transcripts (Figure 3a-c). All three appear to be prostate-specific, with no expression
    seen in breast or lung cancer cell lines or in 19 normal tissue types (Table 8). This tissue
    specificity was not necessarily due to regulation by androgen signaling, as only PCAT-14
25  expression was induced by treatment of androgen responsive VCaP and LNCaP cells with the
    synthetic androgen RI 881, consistent with previous data from this genomic locus (Figure 18)
    (Tomlins et al., Nature 448 (7153), 595 (2007); Stavenhagen et al., Cell 55 (2), 247 (1988)).
    PCAT-14, but not PCAT-109 or PCAT-43, also showed differential expression when tested on a
    panel of matched tumor-normal samples, indicating that this transcript, which is comprised of an
30  endogenous retrovirus in the HERV-K family (Bannert and Kurth, Proc Natl Acad Sci US A 101
    Suppl 2, 14572 (2004)), can be used as a somatic marker for prostate cancer (Figure 19). 5' and
    3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) at this locus revealed the presence of individual
    viral protein open reading frames (ORFs) and a transcript splicing together individual ORF 5'
    untranslated region (UTR) sequences (Figure 20). It was observed that the top-ranked intergenic

    ncRNA resided in the chromosome 8q24 gene desert nearby to the c-Myc oncogene. This
    ncRNA, termed PCAT-1, is located on the edge of the prostate cancer susceptibility region 240
    43 (Figure 4a) and is about 0.5 Mb away from c-Myc. This transcript is supported by clear peaks
    in H3K4me3, Acetyl-H3, and RNA polymerase II ChIP-Seq data (Figure 4b). The exon-exon
 5  junction in cell lines was validated by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing of the junction (Figure
    4c), and 5' and 3' RACE was performed to elucidate transcript structure (Figure 4d). By this
    analysis, PCAT-1 is a mariner family transposase (Oosumi et al., Nature 378 (6558), 672 (1995);
    Robertson et al., Nat Genet 12 (4), 360 (1996)) interrupted by an Alu retrotransposon and
    regulated by a viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter region (Figure 4d and Figure 21). By
 0  qPCR, PCAT- 1 expression is specific to prostate tissue, with striking upregulation in prostate
    cancers and metastases compared to benign prostate tissue (Figure 4e). PCAT-1 ranks as the
    second best overall prostate cancer biomarker, just behind AMACR (Table 3), indicating that
    this transcript is a powerful discriminator of this disease. Matched tumor normal pairs similarly
    showed marked upregulation in the matched tumor samples (Figure 4f). RNA interference
 5  (RNAi) was performed in VCaP cells using custom siRNAs targeting PCAT-1 sequences and no
    change in the cell proliferation or invasion upon PCAT- 1 knockdown was observed (Figure 22)
             Selective re-expression of repetitive elements in cancer
             The presence of repetitive elements in PCAT- 1 led to an exploration of repetitive
 '0 elements. Repetitive elements, such as Alu and LINE-I retrotransposons, are broadly known to
    be degenerate in humans (Oosumi et al, supra; Robertson et al., supra; Cordaux et al., Nat Rev
     Genet 10 (10), 691 (2009), with only ~100 LINE-I elements (out of 12 ~500,000) showing
    possible retrotransposon activity (Brouha et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100 (9), 5280 (2003)).
    While transcription of these elements is frequently repressed through DNA methylation and
25  repressive chromatin modifications (Slotkin and Martienssen, Nat Rev Genet 8 (4), 272 (2007)),
    in cancer widespread hypomethylation has been reported (Cho et al., JPathol211 (3), 269
    (2007); Chalitchagorn et al., Oncogene 23 (54), 8841 (2004); Yegnasubramanian et al., Cancer
    Res 68 (21), 8954 (2008)). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that these elements have
    functional roles in both normal biology (Kunarso et al., Nat Genet.) and cancer (Lin et al., Cell
30   139 (6), 1069 (2009)), even if their sequences have mutated away from their evolutionary
    ancestral sequence (Chow et al., Cell 141 (6), 956). To date, only RNA-Seq platforms enable
    discovery and quantification of specific transposable elements expressed in cancer. As described
    above, it was observed that >50% of unannotated exons in the assembly overlap with at least one
    repetitive element (Figure 11). Since these elements pose mappability challenges when

    performing transcriptome assembly with unique reads, these loci typically appear as "mountain
    ranges" of expression, with uniquely mappable regions forming peaks of expression separated by
    unmappable "ravines" (Figures 23 and 24). PCR and Sanger sequencing experiments were
    performed to confirm that these transposable elements of low mappability are expressed as part
 5  of these loci (Figures 23 and 24). To probe this observation further, the exons from unannotated
    transcripts in the assembly, with the addition of the flanking 50, 100, or 500 bp of additional
    genomic sequence to the 5' and 3' end of the exons were generated, the overlap of these intervals
    with repetitive elements to randomly permuted genomic intervals of similar sizes was performed.
    A highly significant enrichment for repetitive elements in the dataset was observed (OR 2.82
 0  (95% CI 2.68- 2.97), p < 10-100, Table 9). Examination of the individual repetitive element
    classes revealed a specific enrichment for SINE elements, particularly Alus (p < 2 x 10-16,
    Tables 10 and 11). A subset of LINE-I and Alu transposable elements demonstrate marked
    differential expression in a subset of prostate cancer tumors (Figure 25). One locus on
    chromosome 2 (also highlighted in Figure 3b) is a 500+ kb region with numerous expressed
 5  transposable elements (Figure 26). This locus, termed Second Chromosome Locus Associated
    with Prostate-I (SChLAP 1), harbors transcripts that perform extremely well in outlier analyses
    for prostate cancer (Tables 6 and 7). PCAT-109, discussed above, is one outlier transcript in this
    region. Moreover, the SChLAP1 locus is highly associated with patients positive for ETS gene
    fusions (p < 0.000 1, Fisher's exact test, Figure 27), whereas this association was not observed
 '0 with other expressed repeats. A direct regulatory role for ERG on this region was not identified
    using siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERG in the VCaP cell line. These data indicate that the
    dysregulation of repeats in cancer is highly specific, and that this phenomenon associates with
    only a subset of tumors and metastases. Thus, the broad hypomethylation of repeat elements
    observed in cancer (Cho et al., JPathol211 (3), 269 (2007); Chalitchagorn et al., Oncogene 23
25  (54), 8841 (2004); Yegnasubramanian et al., CancerRes 68 (21), 8954 (2008)) does not account
    for the high specificity of repeat expression.
             Non-invasive detection of ncRNAs in urine
             Taken together, these data show an abundance of novel ncRNA biomarkers for prostate
30  cancer, many of which appear to have tissue specificity. 77 urine sediments obtained from
    patients with prostate cancer and 31 control patients without known disease (Table 12 for sample
    details) were analyzed (Laxman et al., CancerRes 68 (3), 645 (2008)). The control patients are
    defined as those lacking cancer histology upon prostate biopsy and lacking the TMPRSS2-ERG
    fusion transcript in urine sediment RNA (Laxman et al., supra). PCAT-1 and PCAT-14, as well
                                                      A AI

   as the known ncRNA biomarker PCA3, were selected for evaluation on this urine panel due to
   their biomarker status in patient tissue samples. qPCR analysis led to an observation of
   specificity in their ability to detect prostate cancer patients and not patients with normal prostates
   (Figure 5a-c). In several cases, patients with ETS-negative prostate cancer that were
 5 misclassified as "benign" are clearly evident (Figures 5a and 5c). Moreover, PCAT-14 appears
   to perform almost as well as PCA3 as a urine biomarker, nearly achieving statistical significance
   (p =  0.055, Fisher's exact test) despite the small number of patients used for this panel. It was
   next evaluated whether these unannotated ncRNAs identified a redundant set of patients that
   would also be identified by other urine tests, such as PCA3 or TMPRSS2-ERG transcripts.
 0 Comparing PCAT-1 and PCAT-14 expression in urine samples to PCA3 or to each other
   revealed that these ncRNAs identified distinct patient sets, indicating that a patient's urine
   typically harbors PCAT-1 or PCAT-14 transcripts but not both (Figure 5d). Using the cut-offs
   displayed in Figure 5a-c, a binary heatmap comparing these three ncRNAs with patients'
   TMPRSS2-ERG status was generated (Figure 5e). The ncRNAs were able to detect additional
 5 ETS-negative patients with prostate cancer through this urine test, indicating that they have
   clinical utility as highly specific markers for prostate cancer using a multiplexed urine test.
   Combining PCAT-1, PCAT-14 and PCA3 into a single "non-coding RNA signature" generated a
   highly specific urine signature (p   =  0.0062, Fisher's exact test, Figure 5f) that identifies a number
   of prostate cancer patients that is broadly comparable to the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (33% vs.
 0 45%).
            Figure 34 shows detection of prostate cancer RNAs in patient urine samples using qPCR.
   All RNA species were detectable in urine. Figure 35 shows that multiplexing urine SChLAP-1
   measurements with serum PSA improves prostate cancer risk stratification. Individually,
   SChLAP-1 is a predictor for prostate cancers with intermediate or high clinical risk of
25 aggressiveness. Multiplexing this measurement with serum PSA improves upon serum PSA's
   ability to predict for more aggressive disease.
   Additional Characterization
            Additional experiments were conducted related to PCAT-1 and SChLAP-1 region in
30 prostate cancer. Figure 29 demonstrates that PCAT-1 expression sensitizes prostate cancer cells
   to treatment with PARP- 1 inhbitors. Figure 30 demonstrates that PCAT- 1 expression sensitizes
   prostate cells to radiation treatment.
            Figure 31 demonstrates that unannotated intergeic transcripts in SChLAP- 1 differentiate
   prostate cancer and benign samples. Figure 32 demonstrates that SChLAP-1 is required for
                                                       14 1

  prostate cancer cell invasion and proliferation. Prostate cell lines, but not non-prostate cells,
  showed a reduction in invasion by Boyden chamber assays. EZH2 and non-targeting siRNAs
  served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Deletion analysis of SChLAP- 1 was
  performed. Figure 33 shows that a regionessential for its function was identified.
5
  ncRNAs in lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers
          Analysis of the lung cancer transcriptome (Figure 36) was performed. 38 lung cell lines
  were analyzed by RNA-Seq and then lncRNA transcripts were reconstructed. Unannotated
  transcripts accounted for 27% of all transcripts. Novel transcripts well more highly expressed
0 than annotated ncRNAs but not protein-coding transcripts. An outlier analyses of 13 unannotated
  transcripts shows novel IncRNAs in subtypes of lung cancer cell lines. Figure 37 shows
  discovery of M41 and ENST-75 ncRNAs in lung cancer. Figure 38 shows that lncRNAs are
  drivers and biomarkers in lung cancer. Figure 39 shows identification of cancer-associated
  lncRNAs in breast and pancreatic cancer. Three novel breast cancer IncRNAs were nominated
5 from RNA-Seq data (TUO 11194, TUO019356, and TU0024146. All show outlier expression
  patterns in breast cancer samples but not benign samples. Three novel pancreatic cancer
  IncRNAs were nominated from RNA-Seq data (TU0009141, TU0062051, and TU0021861). All
  show outlier expression patterns in pancreatic cancer samples but not benign samples.
