                                           ABSTRACT
[003611         The present invention relates to triterpene glycoside saponin-derived
adjuvants, syntheses thereof, intermediates thereto, and uses thereof. QS-7 is a potent
immune-adjuvant that is significantly less toxic than QS-21, a related saponin that is currently
the favoured adjuvant in anticancer and antiviral vaccines. Tedious isolation and purification
protocols have hindered the clinical development of QS-7. A novel semi-synthetic method is
provided wherein a hydrolyzed prosapogenin mixture is used to synthesize QS-7, QS-21, and
related analogs, greatly facilitating access to QS-7 and QS-21 analogs for preclinical and
clinical evaluation.

                    CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. provisional
application U.S.S.N. 61/043,197, filed April 8, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated
herein by reference.
                                  FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0003] The present invention relates to triterpene glycoside saponin-derived adjuvants, syntheses
thereof, and intermediates thereto. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions
comprising compounds of the present invention and methods of using said compounds or
compositions in the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004] Saponins are glycosidic compounds that are produced as secondary metabolites of
steroids and triterpenes. They are widely distributed among plant species and in some marine
invertebrates. The chemical structure of saponins imparts a wide range of pharmacological and
biological activities, including some potent and efficacious immunological activity. Semi
purified saponin extracts from the bark of the South American Quillaja saponariaMolina tree
(Quillajasaponins) exhibit remarkable immunoadjuvant activity. Because the Quillajasaponins
are found as a mixture of at least one hundred structurally related saponin glycosides, their
separation and isolation is often difficult if not prohibitive.
[0005] The most active fraction of these extracts, designated QS-21, has been found to include a
mixture of two principal isomeric triterpene glycoside saponins, each incorporating a quillaic
acid triterpene core, flanked on either side by complex oligosaccharides and a stereochemically

rich glycosylated fatty acyl chain. The potency of QS-21 and its favorable toxicity profile in
dozens of recent and ongoing vaccine clinical trials (melanoma, breast cancer, small cell lung
cancer, prostate cancer, HIV- 1, malaria) have established it as a promising new adjuvant for
immune response potentiation and dose-sparing. However, the tolerated dose of QS-21 does not
exceed 100 pg, above which significant local and systemic side effects arise.
[0006] Access to other potent Quillajasaponins has been hindered by difficulties in obtaining
pure species from Quillajasaponin extracts. Futhermore, the structural identity of many
Quillajasaponins remains only postulated. The discovery of new Quillajasaponins and related
analogs with potent adjuvant activity and low toxicity presents a challenge to the fields of
chemical synthesis and medicine.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007] The present invention encompasses the recognition that the clinical use of QS-21 as an
adjuvant is limited due to toxicity at higher doses, and that QS-7, a related Quillajasaponin, is
difficult to isolate in pure form. Moreover, synthetic access to QS-21, QS-7 and other triterpene
glycoside saponins is hindered by their structural complexity. The present invention provides
compounds that are analogs of QS-21 and QS-7.

interchangeably with the terms "heteroaryl ring," "heteroaryl group," or "heteroaromatic," any of
which terms include rings that are optionally substituted. The terms "heteroaralkyl" and
"heteroarylalkyl" refer to an alkyl group substituted by a heteroaryl moiety, wherein the alkyl
and heteroaryl portions independently are optionally substituted.
[0034] The term "heteroaliphatic," as used herein, means aliphatic groups wherein one or two
carbon atoms are independently replaced by one or more of oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, or
phosphorus. Heteroaliphatic groups may be substituted or unsubstituted, branched or
unbranched, cyclic or acyclic, and include "heterocycle," "hetercyclyl," "heterocycloaliphatic,"
or "heterocyclic" groups.
[0035] As used herein, the terms "heterocycle," "heterocyclyl," "heterocyclic radical," and
"heterocyclic ring" are used interchangeably and refer to a stable 5- to 7-membered monocyclic
or 7-1 0-membered bicyclic heterocyclic moiety that is either saturated or partially unsaturated,
and having, in addition to carbon atoms, one or more, preferably one to four, heteroatoms, as
defined above. When used in reference to a ring atom of a heterocycle, the term "nitrogen"
includes a substituted nitrogen. As an example, in a saturated or partially unsaturated ring having
0-3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, the nitrogen may be N (as in 3,4

terms "heterocycle," "heterocyclyl," "heterocyclyl ring," "heterocyclic group," "heterocyclic
moiety," and "heterocyclic radical," are used interchangeably herein, and also include groups in
which a heterocyclyl ring is fused to one or more aryl, heteroaryl, or cycloaliphatic rings, such as
indolinyl, 3H-indolyl, chromanyl, phenanthridinyl, or tetrahydroquinolinyl, where the radical or
point of attachment is on the heterocyclyl ring. A heterocyclyl group may be mono- or bicyclic.
The term "heterocyclylalkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclyl, wherein the
alkyl and heterocyclyl portions independently are optionally substituted.
[0037] As used herein, the term "partially unsaturated" refers to a ring moiety that includes at
least one double or triple bond. The term "partially unsaturated" is intended to encompass rings
having multiple sites of unsaturation, but is not intended to include aryl or heteroaryl moieties, as
herein defined.
[0038] In another aspect, the present invention provides "pharmaceutically acceptable"
compositions, which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the
compounds described herein, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
carriers (additives) and/or diluents. As described in detail, the pharmaceutical compositions of
the present invention may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form,
including those adapted for the following: oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous
or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and
systemic absorption, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue; parenteral
administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural injection
as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation; topical
application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-release patch or spray applied to
the skin, lungs, or oral cavity; intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or
foam; sublingually; ocularly; transdermally; or nasally, pulmonary and to other mucosal
surfaces.

without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication,
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
[0040] The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein means a
pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler,
diluent, excipient, or solvent encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the
subject compound from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the
body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other
ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials
which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: sugars, such as lactose, glucose
and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth;
malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut
oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as
propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters,
such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and
aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl
alcohol; pH buffered solutions; polyesters, polycarbonates and/or polyanhydrides; and other non
toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.
[0041] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts which
are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of
humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and
are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well
known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in
detail in J. PharmaceuticalSciences, 1977, 66, 1-19, incorporated herein by reference.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from
suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable,
nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with
organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid
or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other

and the like.
[0042] In other cases, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more acidic
functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically-acceptable salts with
pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" in these
instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of
compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ in the
administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process, or by separately reacting the
purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or
bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a
pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary amine. Salts
derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and
N(Cp 4alkyl) 4 salts. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium,
potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include,
when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using
counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl
sulfonate and aryl sulfonate. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base
addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
piperazine and the like. (See, for example, Berge et al., supra).

(e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms of the structure;
for example, the R and S configurations for each stereocenter, Z and E double bond isomers, and
Z and E conformational isomers. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as

enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational) mixtures of the present
compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms
of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention.
[0044] Provided compounds may comprise one or more saccharide moieties. Unless otherwise
specified, both D- and L-configurations, and mixtures thereof, are within the scope of the
invention. Unless otherwise specified, both a- and $-linked embodiments, and mixtures thereof,
are contemplated by the present invention.
[0045] If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired,
it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, chiral chromatography, or by derivation with a
chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group
cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a
basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl,
diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by
resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic
means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers.
[0046] Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include
compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For
example, compounds having the present structures including the replacement of hydrogen by
deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a 3C- or "C-enriched carbon are within
the scope of this invention. Such compounds are useful, for example, as analytical tools, as
probes in biological assays, or as therapeutic agents in accordance with the present invention.
[0047] One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the synthetic methods, as described
herein, utilize a variety of protecting groups. By the term "protecting group," as used herein, it is
meant that a particular functional moiety, e.g., 0, S, or N, is masked or blocked, permitting, if
desired, a reaction to be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a multifunctional
compound. In preferred embodiments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to give
a protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions; the protecting group is preferably
selectively removable by readily available, preferably non-toxic reagents that do not attack the
other functional groups; the protecting group forms a separable derivative (more preferably

limited to these protecting groups; rather, a variety of additional equivalent protecting groups can
be readily identified using the above criteria and utilized in the method of the present invention.
Additionally, a variety of protecting groups are described by Greene and Wuts (supra).
[0048] As described herein, compounds of the invention may contain "optionally substituted"
moieties. In general, the term "substituted," whether preceded by the term "optionally" or not,
means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a suitable
substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, an "optionally substituted" group may have a suitable
substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any
given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified
group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. Combinations of
substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those that result in the formation of
stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term "stable," as used herein, refers to compounds
that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their production,
detection, and, in certain embodiments, their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of
the purposes disclosed herein.
[0049] Suitable monovalent substituents on a substitutable carbon atom of an "optionally

polysaccharide. The most basic carbohydrate is a monosaccharide, such as glucose, sucrose,
galactose, mannose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, and fructose. Disaccharides are two joined
monosaccharides. Exemplary disaccharides include sucrose, maltose, cellobiose, and lactose.
Typically, an oligosaccharide includes between three and six monosaccharide units (e.g.,
raffinose, stachyose), and polysaccharides include six or more monosaccharide units. Exemplary
polysaccharides include starch, glycogen, and cellulose. Carbohydrates may contain modified
saccharide units such as 2'-deoxyribose wherein a hydroxyl group is removed, 2'-fluororibose
wherein a hydroxyl group is replace with a fluorine, or N-acetylglucosamine, a nitrogen
containing form of glucose. (e.g., 2'-fluororibose, deoxyribose, and hexose). Carbohydrates may
exist in many different forms, for example, conformers, cyclic forms, acyclic forms,
stereoisomers, tautomers, anomers, and isomers.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS
[0067] The clinical success of anticancer and antimicrobial vaccines critically depends on the
identification of, and access to, novel potent adjuvants with attenuated toxicity. In this context,
specific fractions from extracts of the bark of Quillajasaponaria(QS) have proven to be
exceedingly powerful adjuvants in immunotherapy. The QS-21 fraction (Kensil, C. R.; Patel, U.;
Lennick, M.; Marciani, D. J. Immunol. 1991, 146, 431-437), comprising isomeric forms of a
complex triterpene glycoside saponin (Soltysik, S.; Wu, J. Y.; Recchia, J.; Wheeler, D. A.;

potentiator (Kim, S. K.; Ragupathi, G.; Musselli, C.; Choi, S. J.; Park, Y. S.; Livingston, P. 0.

disease (HIV, malaria) vaccine therapies (Sasaki, S.; Sumino, K.; Hamajima, K.; Fukushima, J.;

symptoms arise. On the other hand, QS-7, another QS extract fraction, was found not only to
possess significant stand-alone adjuvant activity (Kensil, 1991; Kensil, 1998, supra), but also to
induce remarkable synergistic immune response augmentation (Kensil, C. A., U.S. Pat. No.
6,231,859) when co-administered with QS-21, allowing for the administration of less QS-21.
Importantly, QS-7, unlike QS-21, exhibited negligible toxicity in mice. The present invention
provides an efficient semi-synthetic method of synthesizing analogs of QS-7 and QS-21, thereby
signficantly reducing the number of synthetic steps required to access this potent class of
adjuvants.

[00157]         However, further use of this semi-pure hydrolyzed mixture of prosapongenins is
hindered by the fact that prosapongenins A and B, which differ only by an a-L-Rha vs. $-D-Xyl
residue, are inseperable by silica gel chromatography.
[001581          Other work has described isolation of highly pure or semi-pure prosapogenins and
saponins (WOOO/09075, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,231,859, 5,977,081, 6,080,725, 6,262,029; Higuchi,

several rounds of silica gel and/or HPLC purification in order to isolate the desired products.
Furthermore, there is batch variability between commercially available QS samples such that

some batches contain no saponins with rhamnose-containing branched trisaccharides. None of
the previously described isolation or degradation studies provides efficient access to pure
prosapogenins or sapogenins. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,231,859 describes the isolation of
98% pure QS-21 following one silica gel chromatography and three or four additional rounds of
HPLC run in sequence. The final yield of QS-21 was 59 mg from 20 g of Quillajasaponaria
extract (see Examples 1 and 2). A similar procedure for the isolation of QS-7 yielded 7 mg of
purified QS-7 (final purity not reported) from a 20 g Quillajasaponariaextract (see Examples 1
and 4). Such yields and purity are not sufficient for large scale production of pharmaceutical
grade adjuvants.
[00159]         In one aspect of the present invention, Applicant has unexpectedly found a
strategy that allows for the facile separation of derivatized prosapogenins A and B via silica gel
chromatography. In one aspect, the hydroxyl groups on prosapogenins A and B are derivatized
with a suitable protecting group, as described herein, to afford derivatives that are separable by
silica gel chromatography. In some embodiments, all hydroxyl groups are derivatized with the
same protecting group. In other embodiments, different hydroxyl groups bear different
protecting groups. In certain embodiments, the hydroxyl-protected prosapogenin A and B
derivatives also have a protecting group on one or both of their carboxylic acid groups.
[001601         In certain embodiments, poly(silylation) of prosapogenins A and B, wherein all
hydroxyl groups are converted to silyl ethers, gives a mixture of poly(silylated) diacid
prosapogenins A and B that are easily separable via silica gel chromatography. In some
embodiments, poly(silylation) is used to afford nonakis(trialkylsilyl) ethers of prosapogenins A
and B. In some embodiments, poly(silylation) is used to afford nonakis(triethylsilyl) ethers of
prosapogenins A and B. In some embodiments, poly(silylation) is used to afford
nonakis(trimethylsilyl) ethers of prosapogenins A and B.
[001611         In other embodiments, the hydroxyl groups on prosapogenins A and B are
derivatized as poly(benzyl) ethers to give a mixture of poly(benzyl) diacids of prosapogenins A
and B that are easily seperable via silica gel chromatography. In some embodiments,
poly(benzyl) etherification is used to afford nonakis(benzyl) ethers of prosapogenins A and B.
[00162]         One of ordinary skill will appreciate that a number of suitable protecting groups
may be used, and that one or both carboxylic acid groups may optionally be protected as well. In

certain embodiments, the glucoronic acid group is selectively protected prior to derivitizing the
hydroxyl groups of prosapogenins A and B. In some embodiments, the glucoronic acid group is
selectively protected subsequent to derivitizing the hydroxyl groups of prosapogenins A and B.
[001631          Batch variability of commerically available Quillajasaponariaextracts may
result in hydrolyzed saponin mixtures containing prosapogenins other than A, B, and C. In
certain embodiments, the hydrolyzed saponin mixture subjected to the described protecting
group strategy will be an enriched mixture of prosapogenins A and B. In some embodiments, the
saponin mixture will contain one or more other prosapogenins such as prosapogenin C. In
certain embodiments, a preliminary round of chromatography is used to render the saponin
mixture enriched in prosapogenins A and B.
[00164]          Other prosapongenins may be subjected to base hydrolysis and the protecting
group strategies described above and herein. Examples of saponins that may be derivatized with
protecting groups according to the present invention include Glycyrrhizic acid, Hederasaponin C,
  -Aescin, Helianthoside 2, Ginsenoside Rd, and Saponinum album, to name but a few.
[00165]          In some embodiments, the mixture of prosapogenins will contain rhamnose
residues. In some embodiments, the mixture of prosapogenins will not contain rhamnose
residues. In some embodiments, the mixture of prosapogenins will be derived from Gypsoside
A.
[001661          In certain embodiments, the mixture of prosapogenins will contain disaccharides.
In some embodiments, the disaccharide is galactose-glucuronic acid.
[00167]          As described herein, prosapogenins bearing protecting groups in accordance with
the present invention may be separated and isolated from one another by suitable physical
means. The term "separated by suitable physical means" refers to methods of separating
mixtures of prosapogenins or saponins. Such methods are well known in the art and include
preferential crystallization, chromatography, and trituration, among others. One of ordinary skill
in the art will recognize that such methods may allow for the separation and isolation of both
major and minor constituents.
[001681          In some embodiments, suitable protecting groups will render provided compounds
crystalline. In certain embodiments, preferential crystallization is used to separate provided
compounds.

[001691        It will be appreciated that chromatography steps aimed at separating derivatives
of prosapogenins A and B may be carried out according to methods known in the art. In certain
embodiments, chromatography is carried out on derivatives of prosapogenins A and B wherein
all hydroxyl groups bear a suitable protecting group. In some embodiments, chromatography is
carried out on poly(benzyl) diacids of prosapogenins A and B. In some embodiments,
chromatography is carried out on poly(silyl) ether diacids of prosapogenins A and B. In some
embodiments, chromatography is carried out on poly(benzyl) ethers of prosapogenins A and B
wherein one or both carboxylic acid groups bears a protecting group. In some embodiments,
chromatography is carried out on poly(silyl) ethers of prosapogenins A and B wherein one or
both carboxylic acid groups bears a protecting group.
[00170]        In certain embodiments, the chromatography is gravity silica gel chromatography.
In certain embodiments, the chromatography is flash silica gel chromatography. In certain
embodiments, the chromatography is gravity alumina gel chromatography. In certain

[002131          In each of the synthetic steps depicted in Schemes 3-6, one of ordinary skill will
recognize that a variety of suitable protecting groups may be used. Orthogonal protecting group
strategies are well known in the art and may be used to selectively protect and deprotect
saccharide hydroxyl groups. It will be appreciated that a variety of suitable leaving groups LGI
may also be employed, as described above, to carry out glycosylation step S-9.
[00214]          In certain embodiments, step S-1 involves the addition of a nucleophile to a
compound of formula IV. In some embodiments, the reaction between a compound of formula
IV and a nucleophile is carried out using suitable esterification conditions. The term "suitable
esterification conditions," as used herein, refers to the catalyzed or uncatalyzed esterification or
transesterification between an oxygen nucleophile and an ester or carboxylic acid. In some

[00215]         In some embodiments, the reaction between a compound of formula IV and a
nucleophile is carried out using suitable peptide bond forming conditions. Suitable peptide
coupling conditions are well known in the art and include those described in detail in Han et al.,
Tetrahedron, 60, 2447-67 (2004), the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In
certain embodiments, the peptide coupling conditions include the addition of HOBt, DMAP,
BOP, HBTU, HATU, BOMI, DCC, EDC, IBCF, or a combination thereof.
[002161         In some embodiments, the nucleophile is carbon-based, such as an alkyl metal
species. In some embodiments, the nucleophile is a Grignard reagent. In some embodiments,
the nucleophile is an organolithium. In some embodiments, the nucleophile is an organoborane.
In some embodiments, the nucleophile is an organotin. In some embodiments, the nucleophile is
an enol.
Uses
[00217]         Compounds of formulae I, II, III, or IV may be used as adjuvants or to enhance
the cellular uptake of toxins. The inventive compounds may be particularly useful in the
treatment or prevention of neoplasms or other proliferative diseases in vivo. However, inventive
compounds described above may also be used in vitro for research or clinical purposes.
Adjuvants
[002181         Most protein and glycoprotein antigens are poorly immunogenic or non
immunogenic when administered alone. Strong adaptive immune responses to such antigens
often requires the use of adjuvants. Immune adjuvants are substances that, when administered to
a subject, increase the immune response to an antigen or enhance certain activities of cells from
the immune system. An adjuvant may also allow the use of a lower dose of antigen to achieve a
useful immune response in a subject.
[00219]         Common adjuvants include alum, Freund's adjuvant (an oil-in-water emulsion
with dead mycobacteria), Freund's adjuvant with MDP (an oil-in-water emulsion with
                                              88 of 205

                                                                                       SK 1335-PCT

muramyldipeptide, MDP, a constituent of mycobacteria), alum plus Bordetellapertussis
(aluminum hydroxide gel with killed B. pertussis). Such adjuvants are thought to act by delaying
the release of antigens and enhancing uptake by macrophages. Immune stimulatory complexes
(ISCOMs) such as Quil-A (a Quillaja saponin extract) are open cage-like complexes typically
with a diameter of about 40 nm that are built up by cholesterol, lipid, immunogen, and saponin.
ISCOMs deliver antigen to the cytosol, and have been demonstrated to promote antibody
response and induction of T helper cell as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in a variety
of experimental animal models.
[00220]         Various studies have raised the concern of potential toxicity associated with
saponin-based adjuvants. Fractionation experiments testing the major components of Quil-A
showed that QS-21 had low toxicity and QS-7 showed no lethality at the doses tested in CD-I
mice intradermally. QS-7 showed no hemolytic activity at levels up to 200 pg/mL of saponin
(Kensil et al., 1991, supra).
[00221]         In humans, QS-21 has displayed both local and systemic toxicity. Maximum
doses for healthy patients are typically     50 pg, and < 100 pg for cancer patients. As mentioned
above, QS-7 has been found not only to possess significant stand-alone adjuvant activity, but
also to induce remarkable synergistic immune response augmentation. Unfortunately, QS-7 has
proven difficult to isolate in clinically useful quantities.
[00222]         The present invention encompasses the recognition that synthetic access to and
structural modification of QS-7 and related Quillajasaponins may afford compounds with high
adjuvant potency and low toxicity.
Enhanced uptake of toxins
[002231          Saponins have been shown to exhibit cell membrane-permeabilizing properties,
and have been investigated for their therapeutic potential. In some cases, saponins have virtually
no effect alone, but when used in combination with another drug will significantly amplify the
effects of the other drug. One example of such a combination effect is with ginsenoside and cis
diaminedichloroplatinum(II) (Nakata, H., et al., Jpn J CancerRes. 1998, 89, 733-40). Therefore,
saponins have potential utility in combination therapies with antitumor drugs for cancer

of other cytotoxic agents.
 Vaccines
[00225]          Compositions of the invention are useful as vaccines to induce active immunity
towards antigens in subjects. Any animal that may experience the beneficial effects of the
compositions of the present invention within the scope of subjects that may be treated. In some
embodiments, the subjects are mammals. In some embodiments, the subjects are humans.
[002261          The vaccines of the present invention may be used to confer resistance to
infection or cancer by either passive or active immunization. When the vaccines of the present
invention are used to confer resistance through active immunization, a vaccine of the present
invention is administered to an animal to elicit a protective immune response which either
prevents or attenuates a proliferative or infectious disease. When the vaccines of the present
invention are used to confer resistance to infection through passive immunization, the vaccine is
provided to a host animal (e.g., human, dog, or mouse), and the antisera elicited by this vaccine
is recovered and directly provided to a recipient suspected of having an infection or disease or
exposed to a causative organism.
[00227]          The present invention thus concerns and provides a means for preventing or
attenuating a proliferative disease resulting from organisms or tumor cells which have antigens
that are recognized and bound by antisera produced in response to the immunogenic
polypeptides included in vaccines of the present invention. As used herein, a vaccine is said to
prevent or attenuate a disease if its administration to an animal results either in the total or partial
attenuation (i.e., suppression) of a symptom or condition of the disease, or in the total or partial
immunity of the animal to the disease.
[002281          The administration of the vaccine (or the antisera which it elicits) may be for
either a "prophylactic" or "therapeutic" purpose. When provided prophylactically, the vaccine(s)
are provided in advance of any symptoms of proliferative disease. The prophylactic
administration of the vaccine(s) serves to prevent or attenuate any subsequent presentation of the

disease. When provided therapeutically, the vaccine(s) is provided upon or after the detection of
symptoms which indicate that an animal may be infected with a pathogen or have a certain
cancer. The therapeutic administration of the vaccine(s) serves to attenuate any actual disease
presentation. Thus, the vaccines may be provided either prior to the onset of disease
proliferation (so as to prevent or attenuate an anticipated infection or cancer) or after the
initiation of an actual proliferation.
[00229]          Thus, in one aspect the present invention provides vaccines comprising one or
more bacterial, viral, protozoal, or tumor-related antigens in combination with one or more
inventive compounds. In some embodiments, the vaccine comprises a single bacterial, viral,
protozoal, or tumor-related antigen in combination with one inventive compound. In some
embodiments, the vaccine comprises two or more bacterial, viral, protozoal, or tumor-related
antigens in combination with a single inventive compound. In some embodiments, the vaccine
comprises a two or more bacterial, viral, protozoal, or tumor-related antigens in combination
with two or more inventive compounds. In some embodiments, the vaccine comprises a single

[00250]         The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of
the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or
prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the
pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or
controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices,
liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be formulated for rapid release, e.g., freeze-dried.
They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by
incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions that can be dissolved in
sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These
compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that
they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the
gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions
that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in
micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.
[00251]         Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention
include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups

diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing
agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate,
benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular,
cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl
alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.
[00252]         Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as
wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming
and preservative agents.
[002531         Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents
as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters,
microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and
mixtures thereof.
[00254]         Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or
vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one
or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers
comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate,
and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt
in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
[00255]         Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal
administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations
containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.
[002561         Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this
invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches
and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a
pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which
may be required.
[00257]         The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active
compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins,

[002581         Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention,
excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and
polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary
propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as
butane and propane.
[00259]         Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of
a compound of the present invention to the body. Dissolving or dispersing the compound in the
proper medium can make such dosage forms. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase
the flux of the compound across the skin. Either providing a rate controlling membrane or
dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel can control the rate of such flux.
[002601         Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also
contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.
[002611         Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral
administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or
more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions,
suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable
solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants,
buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the
intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.
[00262]         Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, which may be employed
in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as
glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof,
vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper
fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the
maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
[002631         These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting
agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms
upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and

antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may
also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the
compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be
brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate
and gelatin.
[00264]         In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the
absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished
by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water
solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which in
turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a
parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an
oil vehicle.
[00265]         Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the
subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on
the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug
release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters)
and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in
liposomes or microemulsions, which are compatible with body tissue.
[002661         In certain embodiments, a compound or pharmaceutical preparation is
administered orally. In other embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical preparation is
administered intravenously. Alternative routs of administration include sublingual,
intramuscular, and transdermal administrations.
[00267]         When the compounds of the present invention are administered as
pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical
composition containing, for example, 0.1% to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5% to 90%) of active
ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
[002681         The preparations of the present invention may be given orally, parenterally,
topically, or rectally. They are of course given in forms suitable for each administration route.
For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye

[002691          These compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy
by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray,
rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or
drops, including buccally and sublingually.
[00270]          Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present
invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical
compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage
forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.
[00271]          Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions
of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient that is effective
to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of
administration, without being toxic to the patient.
[00272]          The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the
activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide
thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or
metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other
drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed,
the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being
treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
[002731          A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine
and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example,
the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in
the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required to achieve the desired
therapeutic effect and then gradually increasing the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.
[00274]          In some embodiments, a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the
invention is provided to a subject chronically. Chronic treatments include any form of repeated
administration for an extended period of time, such as repeated administrations for one or more
months, between a month and a year, one or more years, or longer. In many embodiments, a

chronic treatment involves administering a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the
invention repeatedly over the life of the subject. Preferred chronic treatments involve regular
administrations, for example one or more times a day, one or more times a week, or one or more
times a month. In general, a suitable dose such as a daily dose of a compound of the invention
will be that amount of the compound that is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic
effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above.
Generally doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient, when used for the indicated
effects, will range from about 0.000 1 to about 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Preferably
the daily dosage will range from 0.001 to 50 mg of compound per kg of body weight, and even
more preferably from 0.01 to 10 mg of compound per kg of body weight. However, lower or
higher doses can be used. In some embodiments, the dose administered to a subject may be
modified as the physiology of the subject changes due to age, disease progression, weight, or
other factors.

[00282]         The synthesis of the hexasaccharide fragment within QS-7-Api (Figure 1)
required initial preparation of the selectively protected monosaccharides 2-4, 6, and 8 (Scheme
7). While the xylo-, gluco- and apio-derived monosaccharides 2-4 (Scheme 7A) were obtained in
multi-step sequences by previously reported procedures and modifications thereof (Kim, Y. J.;
Wang, P.; Navarro-Villalobos, M.; Rohde, B. D.; Derryberry, J.; Gin, D. Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc.

Soc. 2001, 123, 8766-8772) the novel sugars 6 and 8 were prepared from rhamnopyranose 5 and
fucopyranoside 7, respectively. Silylation of the selectively-protected rhamnopyranose 5
(Scheme 7B) with TIPSOTf provided the a-TIPS glycoside (96%), which subsequently
underwent C4-0-debenzylation to furnish the rhamnopyranoside 6 (98%). Synthesis of the
fucosyl residue within QS-7 commenced with selective C3-0-alkylation of the allyl
fucopyranoside 7 (Scheme 7C) with PMBCl (56%) via its transient stannylene acetal. This
allowed for sequential selective silylation of the equatorial C2-OH (97%) and acetylation of the
axial C4-OH (>99%). Finally, oxidative removal of the PMB ether with DDQ provided the
selectively-protected fucopyranoside 8 (86%).

[002831         Convergent assembly of the branched hexasaccharide (Scheme 8) involved
dehydrative glycosylation (Ph 2 SO-Tf 2O) (Garcia, B. A.; Gin, D. Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 122,
4269-4279) of fucopyranoside 8 with rhamnopyranose 5 (84%). The resulting a-disaccharide 9
then underwent a series of protective group exchanges, including TBS removal (95%), a novel
Et 2Zn/Pd(PPh 3) 4-mediated anomeric de-allylation (68%), (Chandrasekhar, S.; Reddy, C. R.; Rao,
R. J. Tetrahedron 2001, 57, 3435-3438) and selective anomeric silylation (75%) to afford the
disaccharide 10 as a suitable glycosyl acceptor. Its glycosyl donor coupling partner was prepared
by chemo- and stereoselective dehydrative glycosylation of rhamnopyranoside 6 with
xylopyranose 2 to afford the $-disaccharide 11 (75%), which directly underwent modified
Helferich glycosylation (Roush, W. R.; Bennett, C. E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 3541-3542)
with the apiose-derived donor 4 to afford trisaccharide 12 (86%). The acetate esters in 12 were
then exchanged for a benzylidene acetal protective group (94%), followed by selective acid
hydrolysis of the rhamno-derived isopropylidene ketal to afford the corresponding vicinal diol
(710%). Selective alkylation of the resulting axial rhamno-C2-OH with BnBr could then be
accomplished (84%), allowing for Schmidt glycosylation (Schmidt, R. R.; Kinzy, W. Adv.
Carbohydr.Chem. Biochem. 1994, 50, 21-123) of the C3-OH with the glucosyl imidate 3 to
afford the tetrasaccharide 13 ( 8 6 %). Exchange of the benzoate ester for a TES ether ( 9 1%, 2
steps) and conversion of the anomeric TIPS group to its a-trichloroacetimidate counterpart 14
(92%, 2 steps) secured a suitable donor for glycosylation of disaccharide 10. This was
accomplished by treating the two components with TMSOTf to afford hexasaccharide 15 (62%),
whose fucosyl-TIPS-acetal was then transformed to the a-trichloroacetimidate 16 ( 8 4 %, 2 steps).

glucuronolactone 17 during the course of the synthesis of QS-21 (Kim, et al., supra). This C28
carboxylic acid glycosyl acceptor 18 responded well to glycosylation with trichloroacetimidate
glycosyl donor 16 (BF 3-OEt 2) to afford fully protected QS-7-Api (71%), which underwent global
deprotection under carefully managed conditions (TFA; H2 , Pd-C). The resulting product (71 %)
was found to be identical to naturally derived QS-7-Api (1) (trace quantities of natural QS-7-Api
(~70 %  purity, NMR) were obtained from exhaustive RP-HPLC purification of commercial Quil
A ($90/g).
[00285]         This synthesis of 1 (Scheme 9A) from de novo construction of all oligosaccharide
fragments confirms the structure of QS-7-Api and provides significantly more dependable access
to homogeneous samples of 1 than isolation from natural sources. This notwithstanding, the
synthesis of 1 can be further augmented. Quil-A (19, Scheme 9B) is a commercially available
semi-purified extract from Quillajasaponariaand contains variable quantities of >50 distinct
saponins (Vansetten, supra), many of which incorporate the triterpene-trisaccharide substructure
within QS-7 (and QS-2 1). This monodesmoside saponin 20 (Scheme 9B) can be isolated in semi
pure form via direct base hydrolysis of the Quil-A mixture (Higuchi et al., supra). Subsequent
poly(silylation) of 20 with excess TESOTf afforded the corresponding nonakis(triethylsilyl
ether) (257 mg from 1.15 g of 19), whose glucuronic acid functionality could be selectively
derivatized to the benzyl ester 21 (CbzCl, 68%). This triterpene-trisaccharide conjugate, obtained
in only a 3-step protocol from Quil-A (19), was an effective donor in a C28-carboxylate
glycosylation (80%) with hexasaccharide 16 to provide, after global deprotection, QS-7-Api (1)
(77%). The evolution of the first synthesis of 1 to this semi-synthetic variant furnishes complex
QS-saponin adjuvants (and likely non-natural analogues) with markedly enhanced facility,
enabling heretofore untapped opportunities for novel adjuvant discovery in antitumor and
antiviral vaccine development.

Experimental Procedures
General Procedures.
[00286]         Reactions were performed in flame-dried sealed-tubes or modified Schlenk
(Kjeldahl shape) flasks fitted with a glass stopper under a positive pressure of argon, unless
otherwise noted. Air- and moisture-sensitive liquids and solutions were transferred via syringe.
The appropriate carbohydrate and sulfoxide reagents were dried via azeotropic removal of water
with toluene. Molecular sieves were activated at 350 'C and were crushed immediately prior to
use, then flame-dried under vacuum. Organic solutions were concentrated by rotary evaporation
below 30 'C. Flash column chromatography was performed employing 230-400 mesh silica gel.
Thin-layer chromatography was performed using glass plates pre-coated to a depth of 0.25 mm
with 230-400 mesh silica gel impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm).

Materials.
[00287]         Lyophilized QS saponin Quil-A (batch L77-244) was obtained from Brenntag
Biosector (Frederikssund, Denmark) via distribution by Accurate Chemical and Scientific
Corporation (Westbury, NY). Dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, hexane, toluene,
and benzene were purified by passage through two packed columns of neutral alumina under an
argon atmosphere. Methanol was distilled from magnesium at 760 Torr.
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride was distilled from phosphorus pentoxide at 760 Torr.
Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate and pyridine were distilled from calcium hydride at 760 Torr.
Dimethylformamide was dried over 4A molecular sieves. All other chemicals were obtained
from commercial vendors and were used without further purification unless noted otherwise.
Instrumentation.
[002881         Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum BX
spectrophotometer or a Bruker Tensor 27. Data are presented as the frequency of absorption
(cm-1). Proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance ('H NMR and "C NMR) spectra were
recorded on a Varian 400, a Varian 500, a Varian Inova 500, or a Bruker Avance III instrument;
chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (6 scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and
are referenced to the residual protium in the NMR solvent (CHCl 3 : 6 7.26 for IH NMR, 6 77.16
for 1C  NMR). Data are presented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, bs = broad
singlet, d = doublet, bd = broad doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet and/or multiple
resonances), coupling constant in Hertz (Hz), integration, assignment. RP-HPLC purification
and analyses were carried out on a Waters 2545 binary gradient HPLC system equipped with a
Waters 2996 photodiode array detector, and absorbances were monitored at a wavelength of 214
nm.

0.00034 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dichloromethane (0.20 mL) were each transferred to a 10-mL round
bottom flask and cooled to 0 'C. A pre-cooled (0 C) solution of trifluoroacetic acid (1.0 mL,
TFA/water 4:1) was added to each flask. After vigorous stirring for 60 min, the reaction mixtures
were concentrated in vacuo for 140 min at 0 'C to give a white solid residue.
To both flasks were added tetrahydrofuran (1.0 mL), ethanol (2.0 mL), and 10% (dry basis)
palladium on carbon, wet, Degussa type El0l NE/W (2.0 mg, 0.00094 mmol, 2.8 equiv). The
two runs were stirred under hydrogen pressure (50 psi) for 44 h, and then the suspensions were
combined and filtered through a 0.45 ptm polyvinylidene fluoride filter disk, which was then
washed with methanol (5 mL). The filtrate and rinsing were concentrated and purified by RP
HPLC on an XBridge Prep BEH300 C18 column (5 ptm, 10 x 250 mm) using a linear gradient of
32+37% acetonitrile (0.05% TFA) in water (0.05% TFA) over 30 min at a flow rate of 5
mL/min. The fraction containing the major peak                    (tR =   14.85 min) was collected and lyophilized

141 (3 x 2.0 mg, 0.0014 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran (3 x 1.0 mL) and ethanol (3 x 1.0
mL) in three 10-mL round-bottom flasks were charged with 10% (dry basis) palladium on
carbon, wet, Degussa type E101 NE/W (3 x 3.8 mg, 0.0054 mmol, 3.7 equiv). The reaction
suspensions were stirred under hydrogen pressure (50 psi) for 23 h and then filtered through
three 0.45 ptm polyvinylidene fluoride filter disks. The filters were washed with methanol, and
the filtrate and rinsing were concentrated in three 25-mL round bottom flasks to give the partially
protected product as a clear residue.
[00327]          The reaction flasks were cooled to 0 'C and charged with a pre-cooled (0 C)
solution of trifluoroacetic acid (3 x 1.0 mL, TFA/water 3:1). After stirring for 75 min, the
reaction mixtures were concentrated in vacuo at 0 'C. The resulting white solid residue was
purified by RP-HPLC on an XBridge Prep BEH300 C18 column (5 ptm, 10 x 250 mm) using a
linear gradient of 35-45% acetonitrile (0.05% TFA) in water (0.05% TFA) over 30 min at a
flow rate of 5 m/min. The fractions containing the major peak (tR = 27.7 min) were collected
and lyophilized to afford synthetic QS-21-Xyl (5) (1.4 mg, 0.00070 mmol, 50% yield) as a white
solid. LRMS (ESI) m/z: Calcd for C 92 H14 7 0 4 6 (M-H) 1987.92, found 1987.94. The IH NMR
spectrum of QS-21 -Xyl (5) was found to be in agreement with the previously reported
characterization.

[00342]          Compound 1-9. Three solutions of fully protected 1-9 248 (3 x 2.0 mg, 0.0014
mmol, 1.0 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran (3 x 1.0 mL) and ethanol (3 x 1.0 mL) in three 10-mL round
bottom flasks were charged with 10% (dry basis) palladium on carbon, wet, Degussa type E101
NE/W (3 x 3.8 mg, 0.0054 mmol, 3.8 equiv). The three parallel reactions were stirred under
hydrogen pressure (50 psi) for 24 h, and then the suspensions were each filtered through a 0.45
ptm polyvinylidene fluoride filter disk, washed with methanol (5 mL), and concentrated in a 25
mL round bottom flask.
[003431          A pre-cooled (0 C) solution of trifluoroacetic acid (1.0 mL, TFA/water 3:1) was
added to each flask. After vigorous stirring for 75 min, the three parallel reactions were
concentrated in vacuo for 1 h at 0 'C to give white solid residue. This crude product was purified
by RP-HPLC on an XBridge Prep BEH300 C18 column (5 ptm, 10 x 250 mm) using a linear
gradient of 30+50% acetonitrile (0.05% TFA) in water (0.05% TFA) over 30 min at a flow rate
of 5 mL/min. The fraction containing the major peak           (tR =   12.15 min) was collected and
lyophilized to dryness to afford compound 1-9 (2.4 mg, 85% yield) as a white solid.

was equally divided into three 10-mL round bottom flasks and dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (3 x
1.0 mL) and ethanol (3 x 1.0 mL). The three parallel reactions were charged with 10% (dry
basis) palladium on carbon, wet, Degussa type E101 NE/W (3 x 3.2 mg, 0.0045 mmol, 3.3
equiv) and stirred under hydrogen pressure (50 psi) for 24.5 h. The three suspensions were
combined and filtered through two 0.45 ptm polyvinylidene fluoride filter disks, washed with
methanol (5 mL), and concentrated in two 25-mL round bottom flasks.
[00346]         A pre-cooled (0 0 C) solution of trifluoroacetic acid (1.0 mL, TFA/water 3:1) was
added to both flasks. After vigorous stirring for 60 min, the two parallel reactions were
concentrated in vacuo for 2 h at 0 0 C to afford white solid residue. This crude product was

Preclinical Evaluation of Synthetic QS-21 with GD3-KLH Conjugate Vaccine.
[00350]         This example demonstrates the in vivo immunogenicity of certain compounds of
the present invention. Using similar protocols, the immuno-potentiating properties of the
synthetic adjuvants SQS-21-Api and SQS-21-Xyl were evaluated in mice (C57BL/6J, female, six
weeks of age). Although our previous synthetic chemistry efforts had unambiguously verified the
chemical structure of SQS-21-Api (Kim, Y.-J.; Wang, P.; Navarro-Villalobos, M.; Rohde, B. D.;
Derryberry, J.; Gin, D. Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 11906-11915) and SQS-21-Xyl (Deng,

Xyl; SQS-7   = synthetic QS-7). NQS-21 is isolated as a 65:35 mixture of its Apiose and Xylose
isomeric forms, yet it is extremely difficult to separate these constituents from trace natural
saponin impurities from the tree bark. As a result, it was necessary to explore whether there were
any naturally derived trace saponin impurities that may function as the immuno-active
constituent.
[003511         Groups of five mice were immunized with the melanoma antigen GD3
ganglioside conjugated to KLH (GD3-KLH) at a 10 ptg antigen dose per vaccination. As the
negative control, mice were vaccinated with the GD3-KLH antigen only. As a positive control,
vaccinations were performed with naturally derived NQS-21 (derived by fractionating a mixture
of saponins from Quillaja saponaria) at a dose of 20 ptg, an amount known to induce measurable
antibody responses with acceptable toxic effects in mice. Evaluation of the adjuvant activity of
synthetic SQS-21 adjuvants at the same dose (20 ptg) included a reconstituted mixture of SQS
21-Api and SQS-21-Xyl in a 65:35 mixture (SQS-21-Mix) to mimic typical isomeric ratios
found within NQS-2 1. Similar evaluations were performed on each of the separate saponin
isomers, SQS-21-Api and SQS-21-Xyl at 20 pag doses. Mice were immunized weekly for three
weeks with the stated doses of specified adjuvants, and were bled 10 days after the third
vaccination. Immunopotentiation was assessed by testing for the presence of antibody against
GD3 and KLH by ELISA, and against a tumor cell-line SK-MEL-28, expressing GD3 antigen,
by FACS.
Antibody Response (ELISA).
[00352]         The antibody response after vaccination with GD3-KLH conjugate with or
without adjuvant was determined with an ELISA assay using either GD3 ganglioside or KLH
protein as target. Comparison of the different adjuvants at the same doses (10 and 20 pag) of
SQS-21, SQS-21-Api and SQS-21-Xyl were all equally effective at inducing and IgM antibody
response against GD3 after 3 weekly vaccinations with antibody titers in each case significantly
higher than the group with GD3-KLH alone. After the third vaccination, no IgG antibodies
against GD3 were detected; however, after the fourth immunization IgM and IgG antibody titers

were induced in most mice. Again, there were no significant differences between the various
groups. The IgG antibody response against KLH was also strikingly elevated in all groups with
no group demonstrating significantly higher or lower titers than the others. All were at least 20
fold higher than the GD3-KLH alone group. A graphical representation (Figure 2) of the
antibody titers at 20 ptg QS-adjuvant dose clearly illustrates that the SQS-21 adjuvants possess
comparable adjuvant activity to that of NQS-21.
Cell Surface Reactivity by Flow Cytometry (FACS).
[003531          Immunopotentiation was also assessed by testing for the presence of antibody
against a tumor cell-line SK-MEL-28) expressing GD3 antigen by FACS. Sera drawn 7 days
after the 4th vaccination was tested for cell surface reactivity by flow cytometry using the SK
Mel-28 (GD3 positive) cell line. The median FACS results are represented graphically at 20 kg
QS-adjuvant dose    for direct comparison (Figure 3). Presera obtained from mice before
immunization showed less than 10% positive cells and sera from mice vaccinated with all three
synthetic adjuvants showed significant positive reactivity with SK-Mel-28. These data reinforce
the comparable adjuvant activity of synthetic SQS-21 relative to that of NQS-21.
Toxicity.
[00354]          As a measure of toxicity, loss of weight was monitored at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h
after each injection. The median weight loss for groups of five mice receiving SQS-21-Mix,
SQS-21-Api or SQS-21-Xyl at the three different doses is demonstrated in Figure 4. As the
negative control, vaccinations employing GD3-KLH only (no adjuvant) led to no appreciable
weight loss after each injection. As the positive control, the presence of NQS-21 (20 kg) elicited
notable and expected weight loss after each injection. This pattern of weight loss over the 4-week
duration is very similar to that of the other groups of mice vaccinated with SQS-21 synthetic
adjuvants (mix, and separate isomers), again signaling a comparable biological profile of SQS-21
compared to that of NQS-21.

Preclinical Evaluation of Selected Compounds of Formula II with GD3-KLH Conjugate
Vaccine.
[00355]          Synthetic efforts have resulted in the preparation of compounds of formula II,
including compounds 1-8, 1-9, and 1-10. In these compounds, structural variations within the
hydrolytically labile acyl chain of natural QS compounds take the form of significantly more
stable amide-linked constructs, along with dramatically simplified linear alkyl chain variants.
[00356]          Groups of five mice were vaccinated (3x @ 1-wk intervals, booster @ wk 7) with
GD3-KLH antigen (10 tg) along with the adjuvant of interest (10 tg). As a negative control, one
group was vaccinated with the antigen only, devoid of adjuvant. As positive controls, two groups
were vaccinated with either natural NQS-21 or synthetic SQS-21-Mix, both of which were
established to be potent immunoadjuvants in this assay (see Figure 2). Three compounds of
formula II, as well as our recently synthesized QS-7-Api adjuvant, were evaluated in parallel for
comparison (Figure 5).
[00357]          Antibodies to GD3 in the blood samples were measured by ELISA (Figure 5A).
These preliminary data reveal that these synthetic compounds are at least as active as NQS-21 in
terms of immunopotentiating ability. These activities are reinforced by the strikingly high Ab
titers (0.8-1.6 x 106, Figure 5B) against the protein antigen KLH. Detailed toxicity assessment of
these novel adjuvants is currently underway.
[00358]          This important collection of preliminary data (Figure 5) establishes the concepts
that: (1) hydrolytically stable compounds of formula II are active immunopotentiators; and (2)
that the present invention provides novel and potent adjuvant compounds with potencies that
rival and exceed that of natural NQS-21.
