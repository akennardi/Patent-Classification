                                            Abstract:
A communication portal coupled with a processing system and a host having a first resource.
The processing system has a second resource addressable by a terminal using a predetermined
communication protocol. The communication portal receives a first communication from a
terminal identifying the first resource. In response, the communication portal identifies the
second resource, stores a data record associating the first resource and the second resource, and
provides a response to the first communication to identify the second resource. The terminal
then uses the communication protocol adapted for the second resource as a way to request an
operation on the first resource. The portal communicates with the processing system to identify
a request for an operation on the second resource and in response, communicates with the host
to perform a second operation on the first resource based on the stored data record associating
the first resource and the second resource.

                               FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY
[0003]      At least some embodiments disclosed in the present application relate to
coordination of a plurality of separate computer systems having separate resources to
process a task in general and more particularly but not limited to the use of a
communication system to set up the processing of a computing task using a computing
system that lacks a required resource hosted on a separate computer system.
                                      BACKGROUND
[0004]      In a system having multiple computer systems connected via one or more
computer networks, different portions of computing resources for processing a task may
reside in different computer systems.     The use of a predetermined communication
protocol allows the computer systems to communicate with each other in a

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                               2
predetermined way to utilize the resources that are distributed among the computer
systems for the processing of the task.      Improvements to the communication protocol
can improve the performance of the system as a whole and/or improve the functionalities
of the system as a whole.      In some instances, improvements to the communication
protocol can improve the performance of some of the individual computer systems
and/or improve the functionalities of the individual computer systems.
[0005]      For example, a typical electronic payment processing network has a
transaction handler interconnecting a plurality of acquirer processors and a plurality of
issuer processors according to an electronic communication standard.        The electronic
payment processing network has the capability to process certain transactions, such as
credit card or debit card transactions, but may not have the capability to process other
transactions, such as reward point transactions.     The reward points may be hosted in
computer systems separate from the electronic payment processing system.
[0006]      U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0087530 discloses a data structure for a
communication protocol in an electronic payment processing system, in which the data
field for the message type identifier in a transaction message is extended to
accommodate an identifier for crediting reward and an identifier for redeeming reward.
As a result, the communication protocol is extended to process not only payment
transactions in financial currencies, but also the crediting and redeeming of reward
benefits.
[0007]      In general, a typical electronic payment processing system includes separate
computing systems such as a transaction handler, one or more issuer processors, one or
more acquirer processors, and transaction terminals.       The individual computing
systems in the electronic payment processing system are generally connected via one or
more computer networks.        Resources for processing a payment from a consumer to a
merchant are typically distributed among the computing systems connected via
computer networks.
[0008]      A typical transaction terminal of a merchant is configured with the resources to
obtain consumer account identification information of a consumer to initiate a transaction
message and communicate the transaction message to an acquirer processor for
processing; a typical merchant account is controlled by an acquirer processor; a typical

     WO 2016/014561                                                  PCT/US2015/041373
                                              3
consumer account is controlled by an issuer processor; the transaction handler of the
electronic payment processing system interconnects the acquirer processors and the
issuer processors and has the resources to route messages from acquirer processors to
responsible issuers processors based on consumer account identification information
and route messages from issuer processors to responsible acquirer processors based
on identification information of merchant accounts.
[0009]      However, extending the communication protocol of an electronic payment
processing network may involve undesirable impacts to certain computing apparatuses
within the electronic payment processing network and thus may have difficulties in its
implementations.

incorporated herein by reference.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0023]      Figure 1 shows a system configured to use a communication network to
coordinate processing among a plurality of separate computing systems according to
one embodiment.
[0024]      In Figure 1, a terminal (301) is configured to process a predetermined type of
operations with the processing system (303) using a resource B (305) configured with
the processing system (303).       The terminal (301) is configured to communicate with the
processing system (303) according to a predetermined communication protocol to
process the operations in connection with the resource B (305).
[0025]      In Figure 1, the processing system (303) is expanded to allow the processing
of operations upon a separate resource A (307) that is hosted on a resource host (309)
that is not directly addressable via the predetermined communication protocol between
the terminal (301) and the processing system (303).
[0026]      In Figure 1, the processing system (303) is expanded via the use of a
communication portal (311) which has communication links with the terminal (301), the
processing system (303), and the resource host (309).
[0027]      In Figure 1, the communication portal (311) is configured with a data store
(313) to store resource correlation records (e.g., 315) to facilitate the operations on the
resource A (307), when the terminal (301) communicates with the processing system
(303) using the predetermined communication protocol that may not directly support the
operations on the resource A (307).
[0028]      In one embodiment, to enable the terminal (301) communicating with the
processing system (303) using the predetermined communication protocol designed for
operations on resource B (305) to operate upon resource A (307), while using certain

     WO 2016/014561                                                      PCT/US2015/041373
                                               5
functions of the processing system (303) in processing the operations, the terminal (301)
uses the communication link between the terminal (301) and the communication portal
(311) to establish a correlation between the resource A (307) and the resource B (305).
[0029]      For example, the terminal (301) uses the communication link between the
terminal (301) and the communication portal (311) to indicate to the communication
portal (311) the intent to operate on the resource A (307).      In response, the
communication portal (311) stores a resource correlation record (315) associating the
resource A (307) identified by the terminal (301) and the resource B (305) that is
allocated for the subsequent processing of the resource A (307) via the processing
system (303).     Operations on the resource B (305) by the processing system (303)
allows the terminal (301) to utilize the existing functions of the processing system (303)
needed in operating on the resource A (307); and the communication portal (311) further
communicates with the resource host (309) to complete other tasks required to operate
on the resource A (307).
[0030]      For example, as a response to the communication from the terminal (301)
indicating the intent to operate on resource A (307), the communication portal (311)
identifies the resource B (305) to the terminal (301).    Subsequently, the terminal (301)
may use the predetermined communication protocol with the processing system (303) to
operate on the resource B (305).
[0031]      In Figure 1, the communication portal (311) uses the communication link
between the processing system (303) and the communication portal (311) to monitor
operations on resource B (305).      Upon detection of an operation on the resource B
(305), the communication portal (311) communicates with the resource host (309) and
the processing system (303) to perform additional operations to supplemental the
operations upon the resource B (305) with additional operations on the resource A (307)
hosted on the resource host (309), in accordance with the resource correlation record
(315).
[0032]      Thus, through the use of the communication portal (311) and the resource
correlation record (315), the system as illustrated in Figure 1 allows the terminal (301) to
perform operations on resource A (307) using a predetermined communication protocol
between the terminal (301) and the processing system (303) designed for resource B

      WO 2016/014561                                                   PCT/US2015/041373
                                               6
(305).
[0033]      The technology illustrated in Figure 1 can be used, for example, to process
reward point/benefit transactions using an electronic payment processing network
configured to process financial currency transactions.     For example, a system and
method can be configured using the technique to process reward redemption using an
electronic payment processing network without changing the communication protocol
used for payment processing within the electronic payment processing network.
[0034]      Figure 2 shows a communication system to process reward redemption
according to one embodiment.        In Figure 2, the communication system includes a
plurality of separate computing systems connected via one or more computer networks.
[0035]      For example, the computing systems in Figure 2 include a transaction
terminal (105) disposed in a store of a merchant, an acquirer processor (147) in control
of a merchant account (148), other acquirer processors (553) controlling other merchant
accounts, an issuer processor (145) controlling account numbers (557), other issuer
processors (555), such as issuer processor (145) controlling a consumer account
illustrated in Figure 8.   The issuer processor (145) controlling the account numbers
(557) for reward redemption in Figure 2 may or may not be the same as the issuer
processor (145) controlling the consumer account (146).      The account information (142)
of the consumer account (146) of the user of the reward account (525) is used as the
user ID (551) in one embodiment; and in other embodiments, other types of user IDs,
such as a member ID, a phone number, an email address, etc., can be used to identify
the reward account (525) via a registration process.
[0036]      The computing system in Figure 2 further includes a portal (143) in control of
the reward account (525) of the user and a reward host (513) configured to facilitate the
reward balance inquiry (503), account setup communications (515), and redemption
communications (519), as further discussed below.
[0037]      In Figure 2, the different computing systems have different resources for the
processing of reward redemptions.        For example, the reward host (513) is in control of
the reward account (525) of the user.      The issuer processor (145) is in control of
accounts represented by the account numbers (557).         The transaction handler (103) is
configured with routing information to route messages among the issuer processors

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              7
(145, 555) and the acquirer processors (147, 553).       The acquirer processors (147, 553)
are in control of the merchant accounts (e.g., 148) to receive payments initiated on the
transaction terminals (e.g., 105).
[0038]      Figure 2 illustrates an example using one transaction terminal (105).       In a
typical implementation, multiple transaction terminals (105) can be similarly connected to
the portal (143) and respective acquirer processors (147, 553).
[0039]      Figure 2 illustrates an example using one reward host (513).      In a typical
implementation, the portal (143) can support multiple reward hosts (513) in a similar way.
[0040]      In Figure 2, a communication protocol is configured to allow the use of the
electronic payment processing network, including the acquirer processor (147), the
transaction handler (145), and the issuer processor (145) to process the redemption of
rewards using existing communication messages standards for the electronic payment
processing network.
[0041]      To facilitate the reward redemption, the portal (143) is provided to
communicate with the transaction terminal (105), the reward host (513) and the issuer
processor (145) to set up accounts for payment processing during balance inquiry and to
process reward redemption during authorization of payments made using the account
numbers (557), as further discussed below.
[0042]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) of Figure 2 is configured to present a
user interface that allows a user to provide data to associate user ID (551) with the
identification of the reward account (525) in a registration process.
[0043]      After the registration data associating the user ID (551) with the identification
of the reward account (525) is stored in the data warehouse (149) of the portal (143), the
portal (143) may process the reward redemption operations in response to the user ID
(551).
[0044]      For example, when the transaction terminal (105) receives the user ID (551)
from a user to process a purchase, the transaction terminal (105) transmits to the portal
(143) a reward balance inquiry (503) that identifies the user ID (551).
[0045]      Based on the registration data associating the user ID (551) with the
identification of the reward account (525), the portal (143) of Figure 2 performs a reward
balance communication (511) with the reward host (513) to obtain the current balance of

     WO 2016/014561                                                   PCT/US2015/041373
                                              8
the reward account (525).
[0046]      Further, the portal (143) performs an account setup communication (515) with
a predetermined issuer processor (145) to obtain an account number (509), selected
from a plurality of account numbers (557) controlled by the issuer processor (145), for
the reward transaction that is predicted to follow the reward balance inquiry (503).
[0047]     As a response to the reward balance inquiry (503), the portal (143) stores data
associating the account number (509) with the reward account (525) identified by the
user ID (551) and transmits the balance response (505) to the transaction terminal (105).
The balance response (505) illustrated in Figure 2 identifies not only the reward balance
(507) for the reward account (525) identified via the user ID (551) but also the account
number (509) that is obtained via the account setup communication (515) and that can
be used to initiate a payment transaction that corresponds to the redemption of rewards
from the reward balance (507).
[0048]      For example, after obtaining the balance response (505), the transaction
terminal (105) may present the reward balance (507) to the user of the user ID (551) and
present a user interface that allows the user to request the redemption of a portion of the
reward balance (507), or the reward balance (507) in its entirety.
[0049]      Upon receiving the user instructions to redeem rewards consistent with the
reward balance (507), the transaction terminal (105) performs an authorization
communication (517) with the acquirer processor (147) using the account number (509).
The authorization communication (517) includes an authorization request transmitted to
the acquirer processor (147) for propagation, via the transaction handler (103), to the
issuer processor (145) identified by the account number (509), and an authorization
response propagated back from the issuer processor (145), via the transaction handler
(103) and acquirer processor (147), to the transaction terminal (105).
[0050]      In one embodiment, the authorization communication (517) is in compliance
with existing communication standard for payment transactions in the electronic payment
processing network, such as a payment transaction made in consumer account (146)
[0051]      In Figure 2, in response to the authorization request identifying the account
number (509), the issuer processor (145) performs a reward redemption communication
(519) with the portal (143), which in turn performs a redemption communication (521)

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                             9
with the reward host (513).
[0052]      In Figure 2, the reward redemption communication (519) includes a
communication from the issuer processor (145) to the portal (143) to request reward
redemption for the account number (509).       In response, the portal (143) identifies the
reward account (525) based on the data associating the account number (509) with the
reward account (525), previously established via the account setup communication
(515).    The portal (143) uses the redemption communication (521) to request
redemption of rewards from the reward account (525) in accordance with the transaction
amount specified in the authorization request received in the issuer processor (145).
The redemption communication (521) includes a message transmitted from the reward
host (513) to the portal (143), indicating whether the redemption is successful or not.
[0053]      For example, the reward redemption operations may include the rewards host
(513) reserving the portion of the redeemed rewards for subsequent settlement.         For
example, the reward redemption operations may include the rewards host (513)
removing the redeemed rewards from the reward account (525) to hold the redeemed
rewards for pending settlement.
[0054]      The result of the redemption operations is propagated from the reward host
(513) to the issuer processor (145) via the portal (143) using the redemption
communication (521) and the reward redemption communication (519).            Based on the
result, the issuer processor (145) generates the authorization response for the payment
transaction requested using the account number (509), approving or rejecting the
payment transaction.
[0055]      During settlement of the payment transaction, the issue processor (145)
provides the funds according to the payment transaction to the merchant account (148)
controlled by the acquirer processor (147); and the reward host (513) provides funds
corresponding to aggregated redeemed rewards to the issuer processor (145).
[0056]      Thus, the system of Figure 2 includes a just-in-time account setup established
via the account setup communication (515) responsive to the reward balance inquiry
(503).    The just-in-time account setup assigns a virtual account, a debit account, or a
prepaid account for a subsequent reward redemption implemented using a payment
transaction in the assigned account.     The assigned account may be limited to one-time

      WO 2016/014561                                                   PCT/US2015/041373

use and/or limited to be used within a predetermined period of time after the setup.     A
payment transaction made in the assigned account can be processed within an
electronic payment processing network in a standardized way like a payment transaction
made in a typical consumer account (146).        However, the processing of the payment
transaction in the assigned account at the issuer processor is enhanced and/or
facilitated via the redemption communications (519 and 521) established via the portal
(143).    Using the redemption communications (519 and 521) the reward redemption
from the reward account (525) can be processed just-in-time to support the payment
transaction processed in the issuer processor (145) for the payment made using the
assigned account.
[0057]      For example, a reward redemption platform of one embodiment (e.g.,
implemented via the portal (143)) is configured to associate a virtual account under
control of an issuer processor with a reward account (525) during the balance inquiry
(551) of the reward account (525).    The account number (509) of the virtual account is
provided with the balance (507) of the reward account (525) to the transaction terminal
(105), which allows a user to specify a redemption amount that does not exceed the
reward balance (505).     The transaction terminal (105) than uses the account number
(509) provided within the balance result (505) responsive to the balance inquiry (503) to
initiate a payment transaction in the virtual account.   The issuer processor (145) is
configured to communicate with the reward redemption platform (e.g., implemented via
the portal (143)) to convert the redeemed rewards to funds for a payment provided by the
issuer processor (145) to the acquirer processor (147) of the merchant account (148) via
an electronic payment processing network.        Thus, the reward transactions can be
performed using the electronic payment processing network with minimum impact on the
electronic payment processing network.
[0058]      Thus, the reward redemption platform (e.g., implemented via the portal (143))
allows the redemption of reward benefits (e.g., loyalty rewards, such as loyalty points,
miles, virtual currency) to be performed using the payment processing network
configured to processing payments in consumer accounts (e.g., 146), without requiring a
transaction be made in the consumer payment account using a currency issued by a
government.

[0059]     In one embodiment, virtual accounts or one-time use prepaid accounts are
used to manage benefits in the reward accounts such that the reward redemption can be
performed as payment transactions in the virtual accounts or one-time use prepaid
accounts using the payment processing network.
[0060]     For example, a reward redemption platform is configured to communicate with
an issuer processor to assign a one-time use account for the redemption of reward
benefits of a user.    The assignment of the virtual account can be performed in response
to a balance inquiry in the preparation for reward redemption.    For example, in
response to a balance inquiry from a merchant's computing system, the one-time use
account is assigned and the account number is communicated to the transaction
terminal to initiate a payment that is actually funded by the reward benefits.  The
transaction messages from the transaction terminal, to the issuer processor via the
respective acquirer processor and the transaction handler are processed in a way as the
processing of messages for a payment transaction in a consumer account (e.g., a credit
account, a debit account, a prepaid account, etc.). At the backend, the issuer processor
requests helps from the portal in redeeming rewards to support the payment transaction,
[0061]     The account assigned for benefit redemption may be a one-time account, a
virtual account, a prepaid account, a debit account and/or a private label account.    For
example, the virtual account can be assigned for the redemption of the reward benefits
of the user within a predetermined period of time; and after the period of time, the virtual
account is no longer valid.    In the embodiment, the account is established and/or
assigned solely for the redemption of reward benefits; and the account is funded solely
by the reward benefits in one or more of the reward accounts of the user.
[0062]     In one embodiment, the account information of the virtual account is
transmitted to a merchant (or the user) in a response to a reward balance inquiry.     The
balance information allows the user to request the redemption of a valid amount of
rewards from the reward account of the user and thus reduces the chance of rejection
due to the request of a redemption amount exceeding the balance of the reward account.
The account information allows the transaction terminal of the merchant to initiate a
payment transaction in the virtual account in the payment processing network without
modifications to the transaction terminal of the merchant, and without modifications to

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                               12
the acquirer processor of the merchant.      In one embodiment, the payment transaction in
the virtual account is performed substantially in the same way as a payment transaction
in the consumer account of the user; and arrangements to enable the benefit redemption
are discussed below.
[0063]      In one embodiment, when the transaction request in the virtual account is
received in the issuer processor of the virtual account, the issuer processor is configured
to communicate with the reward redemption platform for benefit processing in
accordance with the information stored to set up the virtual account and/or to assign the
virtual account for the redemption of the reward benefits of the user.     In response, the
reward redemption platform is configured communicate with the host of the reward
benefits to reserve, convert, and/or deduct the reward benefits of the user for payment to
the merchant.
[0064]      For example, during the authorization phase of the transaction in the virtual
account, the transaction amount for the redemption is specified via an authorization
request and in accordance with the reward balance reported by the host of the reward
benefits.    During the authorization of the transaction in the issuer processor, the issuer
processor requests the reward redemption platform to authorize the transaction; and the
reward redemption platform communicates with the host of reward benefits to reserve
the amount of benefits to be redeemed and provide authorization.        During the
settlement of the transaction, the issuer processor communicates with the host of reward
benefits via the reward redemption platform to deduct the redeemed benefits from the
reward account of the user and transmit a payment corresponding to the redeemed
benefits to the acquirer processor of the merchant.
[0065]      In one embodiment, during the balance inquiry, the reward redemption
platform and/or the reward host converts the balance to an equivalent account balance
of the virtual account in a payment currency issued by a government (e.g., U.S. dollar).
Thus, the transaction terminal of the merchant may initiate the payment transaction in
the payment currency.
[0066]      Alternatively, the virtual account may be configured to use a virtual currency
corresponding to the reward currency provided by the reward host; and the reward
currency is converted to a payment currency issued by a government (e.g., U.S. dollar)

     WO 2016/014561                                                      PCT/US2015/041373
                                              13
during the settlement of the reward redemption transaction; and the transaction initiated
on the transaction terminal is specified in the virtual currency.
[0067]     In one embodiment, when the authorization request is made in the reward
currency (e.g., points, miles, virtual currency), the authorization response is configured to
specify the transaction amount in a payment currency issued by a government (e.g., U.S.
dollar).  The monetary value of the redeemed reward benefits is communicated to the
transaction terminal of the merchant via the authorization response.       The settlement of
transaction is based on the monetary value of the redeemed reward benefits specified in
the authorization response.     Since the conversion from the redeemed reward amount to
a monetary value is postponed until the authorization is approved, the last conversion
rate between the reward currency and the payment currency can be applied to the
conversion during the authorization of the reward redemption.        During the authorization,
the redeemed rewards are converted to an amount of payment currency and reserved
for settlement.
[0068]     In one embodiment, the authorization request for the reward redemption
transaction and the settlement request for the reward redemption transaction are
communicated via two passes of request/response communications.             In another
embodiment, the authorization and settlement requests of the reward redemption
transaction are combined in the same messages for one pass of request/response
communications, communicated between the transaction terminal of the merchant and
the issuer processor of the virtual account.
[0069]     As a result of the system, the reward redemption transaction can be performed
as a transaction in the virtual payment account in a way similar to a transaction in a
typical consumer payment account.        The virtual payment account can be set up prior to
the transaction (e.g., during the reward balance inquiry, or in response to a user
request); and the issuer processor is configured to communicate with the reward host,
preferably via a centralized reward redemption platform, to authorize and/or settlement
the requested redemption of rewards.
[0070]     In one embodiment, after a merchant submits a request to get the balance of a
reward account of a user to a reward redemption platform, the platform forwards the
balance request to a rewards bank, which obtains the balance information and provides

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              14
the balance information to the reward redemption platform.      If the balance is greater
than zero, the reward redemption platform submits a request for a private label payment
account number to an issuer processor, which in response allocates a private label
payment account for the request and communicates the account information of the
allocated private label payment account to the reward redemption platform.       The reward
redemption platform associates the reward account of the user with the allocated private
label payment account.     After providing the account information and the balance
information to the merchant as a response to the balance request, the merchant may use
the account information to initiate a payment transaction in the payment processing
network in which the issuer processor is connected.       When the issuer processor
receives the transaction request in the allocated private label payment account, the
issuer processor communicates with the rewards bank, via the reward redemption
platform, to order the conversion of rewards to a payment to the merchant.       The
payment is provided to the merchant from the issuer processor to the acquirer processor
of the merchant in a way same as a payment is provided from a consumer payment
account.
[0071]     In one embodiment, a user may visit the portal of the reward redemption
platform to look up the reward balance in the reward account of the user and/or request
the private label payment account for the redemption of rewards from the reward
accounts.    In one embodiment, the private label payment account may be linked to
multiple reward accounts; and the user may specify rules for the redemption of rewards
from the multiple reward accounts.      In one embodiment, an account identification
device is provided to the user to present the account information of the private label
payment account.      The user may use the private label payment account in a way similar
to the use of a consumer payment account issued to the user.
[0072]     Figure 3 shows a system to process reward redemption according to one
embodiment.      In Figure 3, a portal (143) is configured to communicate with the
merchant computer (501), the issuer processor (145) of virtual accounts (or private label
accounts) configured for reward redemptions, and one or more reward hosts (e.g., 513).
[0073]     In one embodiment, the issuer processor (145) of the virtual accounts (or
private label accounts) is implemented as a part of the transaction handler (103) which

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              15
interconnects acquirer processors (e.g., 147) and issuer processors on the payment
processing network (e.g., illustrated in Figure 8).
[0074]      In Figure 3, the issuer processor (145) is configured to allocate/generate a
virtual account (523) (or private label account) in response to a request from the portal
(143).
[0075]      For example, when the merchant computer (501) sends a reward balance
inquiry (503) to the portal (143), the portal (143) requests, via the account setup
communication (515), a virtual account (523) for the reward account (525) identified in
the reward balance inquiry (503), if it does not already have an associated virtual
account (523).     In one embodiment, the portal (143) is coupled with the data warehouse
(149) to store data associating the reward account (525) and the virtual account (523).
[0076]      In Figure 3, the portal (143) and the reward host (513) are configured to
exchange reward balance communication (511) for reward accounts administered on the
reward host (513).     In one embodiment, the virtual account (523) is requested if the
balance of the respective reward account (525) is above zero; and when the reward
balance is zero, the virtual account (523) is not requested.
[0077]      In Figure 3, in response to the reward balance inquiry (503), the portal (143)
provides the balance response (505) that includes the reward balance (507) of the
reward account (525) identified in the reward balance inquiry (503), and the account
number (509) of the virtual account assigned, via the account setup communication
(515), to the reward account (525) identified in the reward balance inquiry (503).     The
reward balance (507) may be specified in terms of a payment currency issued by a
government (e.g., U.S. dollar), or the reward currency identified by the reward host (513).
[0078]     The merchant computer (501) may present the reward balance (507) and be
configured to allow the user to request the redemption of a reward amount that does not
exceed the reward balance (507).       In one embodiment, the merchant computer (501)
includes a transaction terminal (105) connected to the acquirer processor (147) of the
merchant.
[0079]      Using the account number (509), the transaction terminal (105) of the
merchant can initiate an authorization communication (517) in the virtual account (523)
associated with the reward account (525).

      WO 2016/014561                                                   PCT/US2015/041373
                                             16
[0080]      In Figure 3, the authorization communication (517) includes an authorization
request transmitted from the merchant computer (501) to the issuer processor (145) via
the acquirer processor (147) and the transaction handler (103), and an authorization
response transmitted from the issuer processor (145) to the merchant computer (501)
via the transaction handler (103) and the acquirer processor (147).
[0081]      In Figure 3, in response to the authorization request in the virtual account
(523), the issuer processor (145) and portal (143) exchange reward redemption
communication (519); and the portal (143) and the reward host (513) exchange the
redemption communication (521).
[0082]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to route the redemption
request corresponding to the authorization request to the reward host (513) based on the
association between the reward account (525) and virtual account (523) established via
the account setup communication (515).       In response to the redemption request, the
reward host (513) is configured to reserve, deduct, and/or convert the redeemed rewards
from the reward account (525).      The portal (143) is configured to propagate the
rejection or acceptation of the redemption request, from the reward host (513) to the
issuer processor (145) via the reward redemption communication (519) and the
redemption communication (521).
[0083]      Thus, with the pre-redemption arrangement to set up the virtual account (523)
for association with the reward account (525) prior to the reward redemption, and the
redemption processing arrangement among the issuer processor (145), the portal (143)
and the reward host (513), the redemption transaction can be performed via the payment
processing network, without modifications to the acquirer processor (147), and the
transaction handler (103).
[0084]      Figure 4 shows a method to process reward redemption according to one
embodiment.       For example, the method of Figure 4 can be implemented in a system
illustrated in Figure 2 or 3.
[0085]      In Figure 4, a computer apparatus is configured to: receive (531) a request for
a reward balance of a reward account; associate (533) a virtual payment account with
the reward account; provide (535) account information of the virtual account and balance
information of the reward account in a response to the request; and in response to an

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373

authorization request from an acquirer processor for a payment transaction in the virtual
account, communicate (537) with the issuer processor of the virtual account and a host
of the reward account to provide a payment funded by the redeemed rewards to an
acquirer processor via a payment processing network.
[0086]     In one embodiment, issuer designated accounts are used to manage the
processing of reward redemption.
[0087]     In one embodiment, an issuer designated account is issued to represent a
reward account, or a reward host, as a funding source for payment transactions.
[0088]     For example, the designated account may be issued as a payment account
specifically for a reward account of a particular user, such that the redemption of the
rewards from the reward account of the particular user can be accessed via a payment
transaction in the designated account.     In such an example, a transaction in the
payment account is only for the redemption of rewards from the reward account of the
particular user, not from different reward accounts of other users.
[0089]     For example, the designated account may be issued as a payment account for
a set of reward accounts having the same reward currency hosted on the same reward
host, such that the redemption of the rewards from any reward account in the set of
reward accounts can be accessed via a payment transaction in the designated account.
In such an example, a transaction in the payment account may be for the redemption of
rewards from any of the set of reward accounts.      The issuer may settle multiple
payment transactions made in the payment account together with the reward host, by
receiving from the reward host the total amount of funds used to pay merchants in the
multiple payment transactions.     Thus, the settlement with the reward host for the
multiple payment transactions in the payment account can be combined, even when the
reward currencies are redeemed from different reward accounts.
[0090]     In one embodiment, a reward redemption platform is configured to
pre-associate one or more reward accounts with an issuer designated account.         During
balance inquiry, the reward redemption platform provides the merchant with the reward
account balance, together with the associated issuer designated account.       The
response to the balance inquiry may also include the exchange rate between the
currency for transactions in the issuer designated payment account and the rewards

      WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373

(e.g., loyalty points, virtual currency, miles provided in a loyalty program).  Thus, the
user may specify an amount of rewards to be redeemed, and the merchant system can
convert the redeemed amount into a transaction amount of a payment transaction in the
issuer designated payment account.
[0091]      To redeem an amount of rewards as payment to the merchant, the merchant
initiates a transaction in the issuer designated account and initiates a separate
redemption request with the reward redemption platform.         The merchant system is
configured to approve the redemption of the rewards as payment after both the merchant
and the reward redemption platform authorize the respective requests.
[0092]      The issuer processor may approve the payment transaction in the issuer
designated account without considering the current reward balance of the reward
account of the user; and the reward redemption platform is to communicate with the
reward host to ensure that the redeemed amount is within the balance limit and to
remove the redeemed rewards from the reward balance of the respective reward
account.
[0093]      During the process of the redemption request from the merchant system, the
deduction of the redeemed rewards is performed in real time with the authorization of the
payment transaction in the issuer designated account such that the same set of rewards
cannot be redeemed more than once.
[0094]      In the payment transactions made in the issuer designated account, the issuer
processor pays the respective acquirers (and thus the respective merchants) the
transaction amounts the payment transactions; and the issuer, the rewards redemption
platform, and the reward host exchange reconciliation files to settle the funds for the
rewards redeemed via the set of payment transactions.
[0095]      For example, the settlement of the funds paid out as redeemed rewards can
be performed periodically, daily, weekly, or monthly, or when a predetermined criterion is
met, such as when the total amount of the funds that have been paid out reaches a
threshold.     In some embodiments, the reward host may prepaid the issuer at least a
portion of the funds for the redemption of the rewards; and the issuer may or may not
provide a credit line for making payments corresponding to the redeemed wards.
[0096]      Thus, the reward redemption platform and the issuer processor does not have

      WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373

to communicate in real time during the processing of a payment transaction in the issuer
designated payment account for the redemption of rewards from rewards hosted on a
reward host that is different from the issuer processor.
[0097]      In one embodiment, after a merchant submits a request to get the balance of a
reward account of a user to a reward redemption platform, the platform forwards the
balance request to a rewards bank, which obtains the balance information and provides
the balance information to the reward redemption platform.      If the balance is greater
than zero, the reward redemption platform identifies the issuer designated payment
account that can be used to charge for a payment corresponding to rewards redeemed
from a reward account and/or from a reward host.     After the account information of the
issuer designated account and the balance information are provided to the merchant as
a response to the balance request, the merchant may use the account information to
initiate a payment transaction in the payment processing network in which the issuer
processor is connected.     When the issuer processor receives the transaction request in
the issuer designated payment account, the issuer processor makes the payment using
a funding source reserved for the redemption of the rewards from the reward account
and/or from the reward host.     When the reward redemption platform receives the
corresponding reward redemption request, the reward redemption platform
communicates with the rewards bank to order the deduction of the rewards from the
respective reward account.      The payment is provided to the merchant from the issuer
processor to the acquirer processor of the merchant in a way same as a payment is
provided from a consumer payment account; and the issuer processor settles with the
rewards bank for the funds paid out in the re
[0098]      In one embodiment, a user may visit the portal of the reward redemption
platform to look up the reward balance in the reward account of the user and/or request

accounts.
[0099]      In an embodiment where the issuer designated payment account is specific to
a reward account of a user, the user may provide the issuer designated payment
account to the merchant system for a payment transaction funded by redeemed rewards.

redemption platform and the authorization request for the payment in the issuer
designated account using the account number of the issuer designated payment
account.    The reward redemption platform is configured to determine the reward
account of the user based on the account number of the issuer designated payment
account and data associating the reward account of the user and the account number of
the issuer designated payment account.
[0100]     In an embodiment where the issuer designated payment account is for a
reward host or a set of different reward accounts hosted on the reward host, the user is
required to identify both the issuer designated payment account and the reward account
of the user to the merchant system for a payment transaction funded by redeemed
rewards.    The merchant system is configured to initiate the redemption request to the
reward redemption platform using an identifier of the reward account of the user and the
authorization request for the payment using the account number of the issuer designated
account.
[0101]     Figure 5 shows a system to process reward redemption using a designated
payment account according to one embodiment.        In Figure 5, a portal (143) is
configured to communicate with the merchant computer (501), the issuer processor
(145) of an issuer designated account (541) configured to have a funding source backed
up the rewards in an reward account (525) and/or backed up the rewards provided by the
reward host (513).    The account (541) is designated for payments funded by the
rewards.
[0102]     In one embodiment, the issuer processor (145) of the account (541)
designated by the issuer for payments funded by the rewards is implemented as a part of
the transaction handler (103) which interconnects acquirer processors (e.g., 147) and
issuer processors on the payment processing network (e.g., illustrated in Figure 8).
[0103]     In one embodiment, the designated account (525) is pre-allocated and
associated with the reward account (525) of the user (101) (or a set of reward accounts
hosted on the reward host (513), including the reward account (525) of the user (101)),
via the account setup communication (515).     Alternatively, the issuer processor (145)
may allocate the issuer designated account (525) in response to a balance inquiry
received in the portal (143).

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                              21
[0104]      In Figure 5, when the merchant computer (501) sends a reward balance
inquiry (503) to the portal (143) for the reward account (525), the portal (143) identifies
the designated account (541) that is associated with the reward account (525) in the data
warehouse (149).       The designated account (541) may also be associated with other
reward accounts hosted on the same reward host (513), if the designated account (541)
is not specifically for the reward account (525).   In one embodiment, the data
warehouse (149) stores data associating the designated account (541) with the reward
host (513) such that the same designated account (541) can be identified for a reward
redemption from any of the reward accounts (e.g., 525) hosted on the reward host (513).
[0105]      In Figure 5, the portal (143) and the reward host (513) are configured to
exchange reward balance communication (511) for reward accounts administered on the
reward host (513).      In response to the reward balance inquiry (503), the portal (143)
obtains the current balance of the reward account (525) from the reward host (513) via
the reward balance communication (511), and provides the balance response (505) that
includes the reward balance (507) of the reward account (525) identified in the reward
balance inquiry (503), and the account number (542) of the designated account (541)
that is associated in the data warehouse (149) with the reward account (525).
[0106]      In one embodiment, the designated account (541) is identified in the balance
response (505) if the balance of the respective reward account (525) is above zero; and
when the reward balance is zero, the account number (542) of the designated account
(541) is not provided in the balance response (505).
[0107]      The reward balance (507) may be specified in terms of a payment currency
used in the issuer designated account (541) (e.g., issued by a government, such as U.S.
dollar), or the reward currency identified by the reward host (513).
[0108]      In one embodiment, the balance response (505) further includes an exchange
rate between the reward currency used in the reward account (525) and/or for the
rewards provided by the reward hosts (513) and the payment currency used in the
designated account (541).       Thus, the merchant computer (501) can be configured to
prompt the user to redeem an amount in the reward currency, and request an amount of
payment transaction in the designated account (541) in the payment currency.
[0109]      The merchant computer (501) may present the reward balance (507) and be

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                             22
configured to allow the user to request the redemption of a reward amount that does not
exceed the reward balance (507).
[0110]      In one embodiment, the data warehouse (149) is further configured to store
one or more preferences and/or rules for the redemption of rewards, which are used to
calculate a suggested amount of rewards for redemption.        The balance response (505)
may include the suggested redemption amount.         Thus, the merchant computer (501) is
configured to present the suggested redemption amount for user confirmation (or initiate
redemption without user manual confirmation).
[0111]      In one embodiment, the merchant computer (501) includes a transaction
terminal (105) connected to the acquirer processor (147) of the merchant.      Using the
account number (542), the transaction terminal (105) of the merchant can initiate an
authorization communication (517) for a payment transaction in the designated account
(541) associated with the reward account (525) and/or the reward host (513).       The
requested transaction amount corresponds to the value of the rewards to be redeemed.
[0112]      In Figure 5, the authorization communication (517) includes an authorization
request transmitted from the merchant computer (501) to the issuer processor (145) via
the acquirer processor (147) and the transaction handler (103), and an authorization
response transmitted from the issuer processor (145) to the merchant computer (501)
via the transaction handler (103) and the acquirer processor (147).
[0113]      In Figure 5, in response to the authorization request for the payment
transaction in the designated account (541), the issuer processor (145) performs fraud
risk assessment, budget check, etc. to determine whether nor not to reject the request
for the payment transaction in the designated account (541).
[0114]      In one embodiment, the issuer processor (145) does not have real time
balance information for the reward account (525).      Thus, the issuer processor (145) is
configured to process of the authorization request for the payment transaction in the
designated account (541) without the balance information of the reward account (525);
and the issuer processor (145) does not cause the adjustment in the reward account
(525) in view of the payment transaction in the designated account (541).
[0115]      In Figure 5, the merchant computer (501) is configured to perform a
redemption communication (521), via the portal (143), with the reward host (513) to

     WO 2016/014561                                                       PCT/US2015/041373
                                             23
authorize the redemption based on the current reward balance of the reward account
(525) and effect adjustment to the reward account (525) to take into the account of the
redemption of rewards that are redeemed to fund the payment in the designated account
(541).
[0116]     For example, the merchant computer (501) identifies the redeemed amount
from the reward account (525) to the portal (143), which forwards the redemption request
to the corresponding reward host (513) of the reward account (525).          If the reward host
(513) authorizes the redemption request, the reward host (513) deducts the redeemed
amount from the reward account (525) and transmits a redemption response to the
merchant computer (501) via the portal (143).
[0117]     When the issuer processor (145) approves the authorization request for the
payment transaction in the designated account (541) and the reward host (513)
approves the redemption request, the merchant computer (501) accepts the reward
redemption payment made in the designated account (541).            However, if the issuer
processor (145) and/or the reward host (513) rejects a respective request for certain
reasons, the merchant computer (501) rejects the reward redemption payment made in
the designated account (541).
[0118]     In one embodiment, the issuer processor (145) and the reward host (513)
separately records the payment transactions in the designated account (541) and the
redemption requests in the reward accounts (e.g., 525) hosted in the reward host (513).
After a period of operation, the portal (143) facilities the reconciliation communication
(519) to settle the funds used to pay for the transactions in the designated account (541)
and/or to reverse the deduction of redeemed amounts that correspond to respective
payment transactions rejected by the issuer processor (145).
[0119]     In one embodiment, the redemption communication (521) is performed in
response to that the corresponding payment transaction in the designated account (541)
is approved by the issuer processor (145); and the redemption communication (521) is
configured to provide information identifying the payment transaction (e.g., an
authorization code for the payment transaction).       Alternatively, the merchant computer
(501) may perform the authorization communication (517) and the redemption
communication (521) concurrently.

[0120]      Figure 6 shows a method to process reward redemption according to one
embodiment.       For example, the method of Figure 6 can be implemented in a system
illustrated in Figure 5.
[0121]      In Figure 6, a computer apparatus is configured to: receive (561) a request for
a reward balance of a reward account; identify (563) an issuer designated payment
account associated with the reward account; provide (565) account information of the
payment account and balance information of the reward account in a response to the
request; receive (567) from a merchant a redemption request for the redemption of an
amount of rewards that is to be paid to the merchant via a payment transaction in the
issuer designated account; and communicate (569) with a reward host of the reward
account to adjust the reward account for the amount of rewards redeemed via the
payment transaction.
[0122]      In one embodiment, the computing apparatus includes one or more of: the
portal (143), the issuer processor (145), the transaction handler (145), the reward host
(513), the data warehouse (149), the transaction terminal (105) and the merchant
computer (501), each of which can be implemented via one or more data processing
systems illustrated Figure 11.     The computing apparatus can be further implemented,
optionally, to perform other operations discussed below, such as the operations
discussed in the section entitled "SYSTEM." Some of the hardware arrangements are
discussed in the sections entitled "CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE" and
"HARDWARE."
[0123]      In one embodiment, a communication portal (311) is provided to have a
communication link with a processing system (303), and a communication link with a
host (309) having a first resource (307).
[0124]      The communication portal (311) receives a first communication from a
terminal (301) coupled with the processing system (303), where the first communication
identifies the first resource (307), and the first communication is received from the
terminal (301) in the communication portal (311) without going through the processing
system (303).
[0125]      In response to the first communication, the communication portal (311)
identifies a second resource (305) addressable by the processing system (303), stores a

      WO 2016/014561                                                   PCT/US2015/041373
                                              25
data record (315) associating the first resource (307) and the second resource (305),
and provides to the terminal (301) a response to the first communication to identify the
second resource (305).       Using the second resource (305) identified in the response, the
terminal (301) can communicate with the processing system (303) using a
communication protocol configured for operations on the second resource (305).          The
terminal (301) transmits a second communication to the processing system (303) using
the communication protocol adapted for the second resource (305) as a way to indirectly
request an operation on the first resource (307).
[0126]      As illustrated in Figure 1, the communication portal (311) communicates with
the processing system (303) to identify a request for a first operation on the second
resource (305), which request was communicated to the processing system (303) by the
terminal (301) using the communication protocol adapted for the second resource (305).
In response to the request and in accordance with the data record (315) associating the
first resource (307) and the second resource (305), the communication portal (311)
communicates with the host (309) of the first resource (307) to perform a second
operation on the first resource (307).
[0127]      For example, the processing system (303) of one embodiment includes an
electronic payment processing network (e.g., as illustrated in Figure 8) having a
transaction handler (103) interconnecting a plurality of acquirer processors (e.g., 147)
and a plurality of issuer processors (145); and the communication portal (e.g., 143) is
coupled with the transaction handler (103) to receive a notification of the request for the
first operation on the second resource (305).
[0128]      For example, the first resource includes a reward account (525); the second
resource (305) of one embodiment includes an issuer designated financial account (541)
illustrated in Figure 5.    The account (541) is designated by the issuer processor (145)
for making payments using funds corresponding to the redemption of rewards from the
reward accounts (e.g., 525) hosted on the reward hosts (513).
[0129]      Figure 1 and Figure 5 illustrate an example of portals (311 or 143) coupled
with a host (309 or 513).     The system can be readily expanded to include multiple hosts
controlling multiple resources (e.g., 307), such as rewards accounts (525).      Different
rewards accounts (e.g., 525) and/or hosted on different hosts (e.g., 513) may use

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              26
different reward currencies, such as points, miles, virtual cash, etc.
[0130]      In Figure 5, the resource (307) controlled by the host (513) is identified using
an account number (542) issued by the issuer processor (145) to represent the issuer
designated financial account (541).
[0131]      In one embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 5, the request for the first
operation on the second resource (305) includes an authorization request (e.g., 517)
transmitted via the electronic payment processing network, including the acquirer
processor (147), the transaction handler (103), and the issuer processor (145) for a
payment made using the issuer designated financial account (541).
[0132]      In response to the detection of the authorization request (e.g., 517), the
second operation on the first resource (307) includes the redemption of reward benefits
from the reward account (525) to fund the issuer designated financial account (541) for
the payment requested by the authorization request (e.g., 517).
[0133]      As illustrated in Figure 5, an example of the first communication from the
terminal (301) to the communication portal (311) includes a request (503) for a balance
(507) of the reward account (525).      In Figure 5, the balance inquiry (503) is transmitted
from the merchant computer (501), such as a transaction terminal (105), to the portal
(143) without going through the processing system (303).        Thus, the communication
protocol between the terminal (301) and the processing system (303) for operations on
the resource B (305) does not have to be updated or extended to accommodate the
operations or transactions on the reward accounts (525).
[0134]      In one embodiment, the response to the first communication provided by the
communication portal (311) to the terminal (301), such as the balance response (505)
includes the balance (507), in addition to an identification of the issuer designated
financial account (541), such as the account number (542) of the designated account
(541).   In some embodiments, the response further includes an exchange rate between
a financial currency of the issuer designated account (541) and the reward benefits in the
reward account (525), such that the merchant computer (501) may validate a redemption
request in view of the reward balance (507) and compute the transaction amount in the
designated account (541) based on the user requested amount of redeemed benefits.
[0135]      For example the exchange rate can be specified as a ratio of the financial

     WO 2016/014561                                                       PCT/US2015/041373
                                                27
currency of the issuer designated account (541) of the reward benefits in the reward
account (525).      Multiplying the ratio by a redeemed amount of reward benefits provides
the amount of financial currency to be paid using the designated account (541).
[0136]     In one embodiment, the issuer processor (145) and the reward hosts (513)
store data tracking the transactions made using the designated accounts (541) to facility
the use of the redeemed benefits as a payment currency processed via the electronic
payment processing network.         Periodically, the portal (143) communicates with the
issuer processor (145) of the issuer designated account (541) and the host (513) to
settle funds for payments made in the issuer designated account (541) to redeem
rewards controlled by the host (513).       Combining multiple transactions/redemptions for
a combined settlement increases the processing efficiency.
SYSTEM
[0137]     Figure 7 illustrates a system to provide services based on transaction data
according to one embodiment.         In Figure 7, the system includes a transaction terminal
(105) to initiate financial transactions for a user (101), a transaction handler (103) to
generate transaction data (109) from processing the financial transactions of the user
(101) (and the financial transactions of other users), a profile generator (121) to generate
transaction profiles (127) based on the transaction data (109) to provide
information/intelligence about user preferences and spending patterns, a point of
interaction (107) to provide information and/or offers to the user (101), a user tracker
(113) to generate user data (125) to identify the user (101) using the point of interaction
(107), a profile selector (129) to select a profile (131) specific to the user (101) identified
by the user data (125), and an advertisement selector (133) to select, identify, generate,
adjust, prioritize and/or personalize advertisements for presentation to the user (101) on
the point of interaction (107) via a media controller (115).
[0138]     In one embodiment, the system further includes a correlator (117) to correlate
user specific advertisement data (119) with transactions resulting from the user specific
advertisement data (119).       The correlation results (123) can be used by the profile
generator (121) to improve the transaction profiles (127).
[0139]     The transaction profiles (127) of one embodiment are generated from the

     WO 2016/014561                                                       PCT/US2015/041373

transaction data (109) in a way as illustrated in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0306029,
entitled "Cardholder Clusters," and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0306032, entitled
"Systems and Methods to Summarize Transaction Data," the disclosures of which
applications are hereby in corporated herein by reference.
[0140]      In one embodiment, a data warehouse (149) as illustrated in Figure 8 is
coupled with the transaction handler (103) to store the transaction data (109) and other
data, such as account data (111), transaction profiles (127) and correlation results (123).
In Figure 8, a portal (143) is coupled with the data warehouse (149) to provide data or
information derived from the transaction data (109), in response to a query request from
a third party or as an alert or notification message.
[0141]      In Figure 8, the transaction handler (103) is coupled between an issuer
processor (145) in control of a consumer account (146) and an acquirer processor (147)
in control of a merchant account (148).       An account identification device (141) is
configured to carry the account information (142) that identifies the consumer account
(146) with the issuer processor (145) and provide the account information (142) to the
transaction terminal (105) of a merchant to initiate a transaction between the user (101)
and the merchant.
[0142]      Figures 9 and 10 illustrate examples of transaction terminals (105) and
account identification devices (141).      Figure 11 illustrates the structure of a data
processing system that can be used to implement, with more or fewer elements, at least
some of the components in the system, such as the point of interaction (107), the
transaction handler (103), the portal (143), the data warehouse (149), the account
identification device (141), the transaction terminal (105), the user tracker (113), the
profile generator (121), the profile selector (129), the advertisement selector (133), the
media controller (115), etc.    Some embodiments use more or fewer components than
those illustrated in Figures 7 - 11.
[0143]      In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) relates to financial transactions
processed by the transaction handler (103); and the account data (111) relates to
information about the account holders involved in the transactions.        Further data, such
as merchant data that relates to the location, business, products and/or services of the
merchants that receive payments from account holders for their purchases, can be used

in the generation of the transaction profiles (127).
[0144]      In one embodiment, the financial transactions are made via an account
identification device (141), such as financial transaction cards (e.g., credit cards, debit
cards, banking cards, etc.); the financial transaction cards may be embodied in various
devices, such as plastic cards, chips, radio frequency identification (RFID) devices,
mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc.; and the financial transaction
cards may be represented by account identifiers (e.g., account numbers or aliases).         In
one embodiment, the financial transactions are made via directly using the account
information (142), without physically presenting the account identification device (141).
[0145]      Further features, modifications and details are provided in various sections of
this description.
CENTRALIZED DATA WAREHOUSE
[0146]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) maintains a centralized data
warehouse (149) organized around the transaction data (109).        For example, the
centralized data warehouse (149) may include, and/or support the determination of,
spending band distribution, transaction count and amount, merchant categories,
merchant by state, cardholder segmentation by velocity scores, and spending within
merchant target, competitive set and cross-section.
[0147]      In one embodiment, the centralized data warehouse (149) provides
centralized management but allows decentralized execution.        For example, a third party
strategic marketing analyst, statistician, marketer, promoter, business leader, etc., may
access the centralized data warehouse (149) to analyze customer and shopper data, to
provide follow-up analyses of customer contributions, to develop propensity models for
increased conversion of marketing campaigns, to develop segmentation models for
marketing, etc.    The centralized data warehouse (149) can be used to manage
advertisement campaigns and analyze response profitability.
[0148]      In one embodiment, the centralized data warehouse (149) includes merchant
data (e.g., data about sellers), customer/business data (e.g., data about buyers), and
transaction records between sellers and buyers over time.      The centralized data
warehouse (149) can be used to support corporate sales forecasting, fraud analysis

      WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                               30
reporting, sales/customer relationship management (CRM) business intelligence, credit
risk prediction and analysis, advanced authorization reporting, merchant benchmarking,
business intelligence for small business, rewards, etc.
[0149]      In one embodiment, the transaction data (109) is combined with external data,
such as surveys, benchmarks, search engine statistics, demographics, competition
information, emails, etc., to flag key events and data values, to set customer, merchant,
data or event triggers, and to drive new transactions and new customer contacts.
TRANSACTION PROFILE
[0150]      In Figure 7, the profile generator (121) generates transaction profiles (127)
based on the transaction data (109), the account data (111), and/or other data, such as
non-transactional data, wish lists, merchant provided information, address information,
information from social network websites, information from credit bureaus, information
from search engines, and other examples discussed in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No.
2011/0054981, entitled "Analyzing Local Non-Transactional Data with Transactional
Data in Predictive Models," the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by
reference.
[0151]      In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) provide intelligence
information on the behavior, pattern, preference, propensity, tendency, frequency, trend,
and budget of the user (101) in making purchases.         In one embodiment, the transaction
profiles (127) include information about what the user (101) owns, such as points, miles,
or other rewards currency, available credit, and received offers, such as coupons loaded
into the accounts of the user (101).     In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127)
include information based on past offer/coupon redemption patterns.         In one
embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) include information on shopping patterns in
retail stores as well as online, including frequency of shopping, amount spent in each
shopping trip, distance of merchant location (retail) from the address of the account
holder(s), etc.
[0152]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) provides at least part of the
intelligence for the prioritization, generation, selection, customization and/or adjustment
of an advertisement for delivery within a transaction process involving the transaction

     WO 2016/014561                                                       PCT/US2015/041373
                                               31
handler (103).     For example, the advertisement may be presented to a customer in
response to the customer making a payment via the transaction handler (103).
[0153]      Some of the transaction profiles (127) are specific to the user (101), or to an
account of the user (101), or to a group of users of which the user (101) is a member,
such as a household, family, company, neighborhood, city, or group identified by certain
characteristics related to online activities, offline purchase activities, merchant
propensity, etc.
[0154]      In one embodiment, the profile generator (121) generates and updates the
transaction profiles (127) in batch mode periodically.        In other embodiments, the profile
generator (121) generates the transaction profiles (127) in real-time, or just in time, in
response to a request received in the portal (143) for such profiles.
[0155]      In one embodiment, the transaction profiles (127) include the values for a set
of parameters.      Computing the values of the parameters may involve counting
transactions that meet one or more criteria, and/or building a statistically-based model in
which one or more calculated values or transformed values are put into a statistical
algorithm that weights each value to optimize its collective predictiveness for various
predetermined purposes.
[0156]      Further details and examples about the transaction profiles (127) in one
embodiment are provided in the section entitled "AGGREGATED SPENDING
PROFILE."
[0157]      In Figure 7, an advertisement selector (133) prioritizes, generates, selects,
adjusts, and/or customizes the available advertisement data (135) to provide user
specific advertisement data (119) based at least in part on the user specific profile (131).
The advertisement selector (133) uses the user specific profile (131) as a filter and/or a
set of criteria to generate, identify, select and/or prioritize advertisement data for the user
(101).    A media controller (115) delivers the user specific advertisement data (119) to
the point of interaction (107) for presentation to the user (101) as the targeted and/or
personalized advertisement.
[0158]      In one embodiment, the user data (125) includes the characterization of the
context at the point of interaction (107).    Thus, the use of the user specific profile (131),
selected using the user data (125), includes the consideration of the context at the point

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                              32
of interaction (107) in selecting the user specific advertisement data (119).
[0159]      In one embodiment, in selecting the user specific advertisement data (119),
the advertisement selector (133) uses not only the user specific profile (131), but also
information regarding the context at the point of interaction (107).   For example, in one
embodiment, the user data (125) includes information regarding the context at the point
of interaction (107); and the advertisement selector (133) explicitly uses the context
information in the generation or selection of the user specific advertisement data (119).
[0160]      In one embodiment, the advertisement selector (133) may query for specific
information regarding the user (101) before providing the user specific advertisement
data (119).    The queries may be communicated to the operator of the transaction
handler (103) and, in particular, to the transaction handler (103) or the profile generator
(121).    For example, the queries from the advertisement selector (133) may be
transmitted and received in accordance with an application programming interface or
other query interface of the transaction handler (103), the profile generator (121) or the
portal (143) of the transaction handler (103).
[0161]      In one embodiment, the queries communicated from the advertisement
selector (133) may request intelligence information regarding the user (101) at any level
of specificity (e.g., segment level, individual level). For example, the queries may
include a request for a certain field or type of information in a cardholder's aggregated
spending profile.     As another example, the queries may include a request for the
spending level of the user (101) in a certain merchant category over a prior time period
(e.g., six months).
[0162]      In one embodiment, the advertisement selector (133) is operated by an entity
that is separate from the entity that operates the transaction handler (103).     For
example, the advertisement selector (133) may be operated by a search engine, a
publisher, an advertiser, an ad network, or an online merchant.      The user specific profile
(131) is provided to the advertisement selector (133) to assist in the customization of the
user specific advertisement data (119).
[0163]      In one embodiment, advertising is targeted based on shopping patterns in a
merchant category (e.g., as represented by a Merchant Category Code (MCC)) that has
high correlation of spending propensity with other merchant categories (e.g., other

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              33
MCCs). For example, in the context of a first MCC for a targeted audience, a profile
identifying second MCCs that have high correlation of spending propensity with the first
MCC can be used to select advertisements for the targeted audience.
[0164]      In one embodiment, the aggregated spending profile is used to provide
intelligence information about the spending patterns, preferences, and/or trends of the
user (101).     For example, a predictive model can be established based on the
aggregated spending profile to estimate the needs of the user (101).        For example, the
factor values and/or the cluster ID in the aggregated spending profile can be used to
determine the spending preferences of the user (101).        For example, the channel
distribution in the aggregated spending profile can be used to provide a customized offer
targeted for a particular channel, based on the spending patterns of the user (101).
[0165]      In one embodiment, mobile advertisements, such as offers and coupons, are
generated and disseminated based on aspects of prior purchases, such as timing,
location, and nature of the purchases, etc.      In one embodiment, the size of the benefit of
the offer or coupon is based on purchase volume or spending amount of the prior
purchase and/or the subsequent purchase that may qualify for the redemption of the
offer.   Further details and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. Pat. App.
Pub. No. 2008/0201226, entitled "Mobile Coupon Method and Portable Consumer
Device for Utilizing Same," the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by
reference.
[0166]      In one embodiment, conditional rewards are provided to the user (101); and
the transaction handler (103) monitors the transactions of the user (101) to identify
redeemable rewards that have satisfied the respective conditions.        In one embodiment,
the conditional rewards are selected based on transaction data (109).        Further details
and examples of one embodiment are provided in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No.
2008/0082418, entitled "Consumer Specific Conditional Rewards," the disclosure of
which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.        The techniques to detect the
satisfied conditions of conditional rewards can also be used to detect the transactions
that satisfy the conditions specified to locate the transactions that result from online
activities, such as online advertisements, searches, etc., to correlate the transactions
with the respective online activities.

AGGREGATED SPENDING PROFILE
[0168]      In one embodiment, the characteristics of transaction patterns of customers
are profiled via clusters, factors, and/or categories of purchases.    The transaction data
(109) may include transaction records; and in one embodiment, an aggregated spending
profile is generated from the transaction records to summarize the spending behavior
reflected in the transaction records, in a way illustrated in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No.
2010/0306029, entitled "Cardholder Clusters," and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No.
2010/0306032, entitled "Systems and Methods to Summarize Transaction Data," the
disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
[0169]      In one embodiment, each of the transaction records is for a particular
transaction processed by the transaction handler (103).       Each of the transaction
records provides information about the particular transaction, such as the account
number of the consumer account (146) used to pay for the purchase, the date (and/or
time) of the transaction, the amount of the transaction, the ID of the merchant who
receives the payment, the category of the merchant, the channel through which the
purchase was made, etc.       Examples of channels include online, offline in-store, via
phone, etc.     In one embodiment, the transaction records may further include a field to
identify a type of transaction, such as card-present, card-not-present, etc.
[0170]      In one embodiment, a "card-present" transaction involves physically
presenting the account identification device (141), such as a financial transaction card, to
the merchant (e.g., via swiping a credit card at a POS terminal of a merchant); and a
"card-not-present" transaction involves presenting the account information (142) of the
consumer account (146) to the merchant to identify the consumer account (146) without
physically presenting the account identification device (141) to the merchant or the

     WO 2016/014561                                                      PCT/US2015/041373
                                             35
transaction terminal (105).
[0171]      In one embodiment, certain information about the transaction can be looked
up in a separate database based on other information recorded for the transaction.          For
example, a database may be used to store information about merchants, such as the
geographical locations of the merchants, categories of the merchants, etc.         Thus, the
corresponding merchant information related to a transaction can be determined using
the merchant ID recorded for the transaction.
[0172]      In one embodiment, the transaction records may further include details about
the products and/or services involved in the purchase.       For example, a list of items
purchased in the transaction may be recorded together with the respective purchase
prices of the items and/or the respective quantities of the purchased items.       The
products and/or services can be identified via stock-keeping unit (SKU) numbers, or
product category IDs. The purchase details may be stored in a separate database and
be looked up based on an identifier of the transaction.
[0173]     When there is voluminous data representing the transaction records, the
spending patterns reflected in the transaction records can be difficult to recognize by an
ordinary person.
[0174]      In one embodiment, the voluminous transaction records are summarized into
aggregated spending profiles to concisely present the statistical spending characteristics
reflected in the transaction records.   The aggregated spending profile uses values
derived from statistical analysis to present the statistical characteristics of transaction
records of an entity in a way easy to understand by an ordinary person.
[0175]      Details about aggregated spending profiles of some embodiments are
provided in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0306029, entitled "Cardholder Clusters," and
U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2010/0306032, entitled "Systems and Methods to Summarize
Transaction Data," the disclosures of which applications are hereby incorporated herein

TRANSACTION DATA BASED PORTAL
[0176]      In Figure 7, the transaction terminal (105) initiates the transaction for a user
(101) (e.g., a customer) for processing by a transaction handler (103).      The transaction

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              36
handler (103) processes the transaction and stores transaction data (109) about the
transaction, in connection with account data (111), such as the account profile of an
account of the user (101).     The account data (111) may further include data about the
user (101), collected from issuers or merchants, and/or other sources, such as social
networks, credit bureaus, merchant provided information, address information, etc.        In
one embodiment, a transaction may be initiated by a server (e.g., based on a stored
schedule for recurrent payments).
[0177]      Over a period of time, the transaction handler (103) accumulates the
transaction data (109) from transactions initiated at different transaction terminals (e.g.,
105) for different users (e.g., 101).  The transaction data (109) thus includes information
on purchases made by various users (e.g., 101) at various times via different purchases
options (e.g., online purchase, offline purchase from a retail store, mail order, order via
phone, etc.)
[0178]      In one embodiment, the accumulated transaction data (109) and the
corresponding account data (111) are used to generate intelligence information about
the purchase behavior, pattern, preference, tendency, frequency, trend, amount and/or
propensity of the users (e.g., 101), as individuals or as a member of a group.      The
intelligence information can then be used to generate, identify and/or select targeted
advertisements for presentation to the user (101) on the point of interaction (107), during
a transaction, after a transaction, or when other opportunities arise.
[0179]      Figure 8 shows a system to provide information based on transaction data
(109) according to one embodiment.        In Figure 8, the transaction handler (103) is
coupled between an issuer processor (145) and an acquirer processor (147) to facilitate
authorization and settlement of transactions between a consumer account (146) and a
merchant account (148).      The transaction handler (103) records the transactions in the
data warehouse (149).      The portal (143) is coupled to the data warehouse (149) to
provide information based on the transaction records, such as the transaction profiles
(127) or aggregated spending profile . The portal (143) may be implemented as a web
portal, a telephone gateway, a file/data server, etc.
[0180]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to receive queries identifying
search criteria from the profile selector (129), the advertisement selector (133) and/or

     WO 2016/014561                                                      PCT/US2015/041373
                                               37
third parties and in response, to provide transaction-based intelligence requested by the
queries.
[0181]      For example, in one embodiment, a query is to specify a plurality of account
holders to request the portal (143) to deliver the transaction profiles (127) of account
holders in a batch mode.
[0182]      For example, in one embodiment, a query is to identify the user (101) to
request the user specific profile (131), or the aggregated spending profile, of the user
(101).   The user (101) may be identified using the account data (111), such as the
account number, or the user data (125) such as browser cookie ID, IP address, etc.
[0183]      For example, in one embodiment, a query is to identify a retail location; and
the portal (143) is to provide a profile (e.g., 341) that summarizes the aggregated
spending patterns of users who have shopped at the retail location within a period of
time.
[0184]      For example, in one embodiment, a query is to identify a geographical
location; and the portal (143) is to provide a profile (e.g., 341) that summarizes the
aggregated spending patterns of users who have been to, or who are expected to visit,
the geographical location within a period of time (e.g., as determined or predicted based
on the locations of the point of interactions (e.g., 107) of the users).
[0185]      For example, in one embodiment, a query is to identify a geographical area;
and the portal (143) is to provide a profile (e.g., 341) that summarizes the aggregated
spending patterns of users who reside in the geographical area (e.g., as determined by
the account data (111), or who have made transactions within the geographical area with
a period of time (e.g., as determined by the locations of the transaction terminals (e.g.,
105) used to process the transactions).
[0186]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to register certain users
(101) for various programs, such as a loyalty program to provide rewards and/or offers to
the users (101).
[0187]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) is to register the interest of users (101), or
to obtain permissions from the users (101) to gather further information about the users
(101), such as data capturing purchase details, online activities, etc.
[0188]      In one embodiment, the user (101) may register via the issuer; and the

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                            38
registration data in the consumer account (146) may propagate to the data warehouse
(149) upon approval from the user (101).
[0189]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) is to register merchants and provide
services and/or information to merchants.
[0190]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) is to receive information from third parties,
such as search engines, merchants, websites, etc.       The third party data can be
correlated with the transaction data (109) to identify the relationships between purchases
and other events, such as searches, news announcements, conferences, meetings, etc.,
and improve the prediction capability and accuracy.
[0191]      In Figure 8, the consumer account (146) is under the control of the issuer
processor (145).    The consumer account (146) may be owned by an individual, or an
organization such as a business, a school, etc.     The consumer account (146) may be a
credit account, a debit account, or a stored value account.      The issuer may provide the
consumer (e.g., user (101)) an account identification device (141) to identify the
consumer account (146) using the account information (142).        The respective consumer
of the account (146) can be called an account holder or a cardholder, even when the
consumer is not physically issued a card, or the account identification device (141), in
one embodiment.       The issuer processor (145) is to charge the consumer account (146)
to pay for purchases.
[0192]      In one embodiment, the account identification device (141) is a plastic card
having a magnetic strip storing account information (142) identifying the consumer
account (146) and/or the issuer processor (145).      Alternatively, the account
identification device (141) is a smartcard having an integrated circuit chip storing at least
the account information (142).    In one embodiment, the account identification device
(141) includes a mobile phone having an integrated smartcard.
[0193]      In one embodiment, the account information (142) is printed or embossed on
the account identification device (141).   The account information (142) may be printed
as a bar code to allow the transaction terminal (105) to read the information via an optical
scanner.     The account information (142) may be stored in a memory of the account
identification device (141) and configured to be read via wireless, contactless
communications, such as near field communications via magnetic field coupling, infrared

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                            39
communications, or radio frequency communications.        Alternatively, the transaction
terminal (105) may require contact with the account identification device (141) to read
the account information (142) (e.g., by reading the magnetic strip of a card with a
magnetic strip reader).
[0194]      In one embodiment, the transaction terminal (105) is configured to transmit an
authorization request message to the acquirer processor (147).      The authorization
request includes the account information (142), an amount of payment, and information
about the merchant (e.g., an indication of the merchant account (148)).      The acquirer
processor (147) requests the transaction handler (103) to process the authorization
request, based on the account information (142) received in the transaction terminal
(105).   The transaction handler (103) routes the authorization request to the issuer
processor (145) and may process and respond to the authorization request when the
issuer processor (145) is not available.   The issuer processor (145) determines whether
to authorize the transaction based at least in part on a balance of the consumer account
(146).
[0195]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103), the issuer processor (145),
and the acquirer processor (147) may each include a subsystem to identify the risk in the
transaction and may reject the transaction based on the risk assessment.
[0196]      In one embodiment, the account identification device (141) includes security
features to prevent unauthorized uses of the consumer account (146), such as a logo to
show the authenticity of the account identification device (141), encryption to protect the
account information (142), etc.
[0197]      In one embodiment, the transaction terminal (105) is configured to interact with
the account identification device (141) to obtain the account information (142) that
identifies the consumer account (146) and/or the issuer processor (145).       The
transaction terminal (105) communicates with the acquirer processor (147) that controls
the merchant account (148) of a merchant.      The transaction terminal (105) may
communicate with the acquirer processor (147) via a data communication connection,
such as a telephone connection, an Internet connection, etc.     The acquirer processor
(147) is to collect payments into the merchant account (148) on behalf of the merchant.
[0198]      In one embodiment, the transaction terminal (105) is a POS terminal at a

      WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373

traditional, offline, "brick and mortar" retail store. In another embodiment, the
transaction terminal (105) is an online server that receives account information (142) of
the consumer account (146) from the user (101) through a web connection.           In one
embodiment, the user (101) may provide account information (142) through a telephone
call, via verbal communications with a representative of the merchant; and the
representative enters the account information (142) into the transaction terminal (105) to
initiate the transaction.
[0199]      In one embodiment, the account information (142) can be entered directly into
the transaction terminal (105) to make payment from the consumer account (146),
without having to physically present the account identification device (141).     When a
transaction is initiated without physically presenting an account identification device
(141), the transaction is classified as a "card-not-present" (CNP) transaction.
[0200]      In one embodiment, the issuer processor (145) may control more than one
consumer account (146); the acquirer processor (147) may control more than one
merchant account (148); and the transaction handler (103) is connected between a
plurality of issuer processors (e.g., 145) and a plurality of acquirer processors (e.g., 147).
An entity (e.g., bank) may operate both an issuer processor (145) and an acquirer
processor (147).
[0201]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103), the issuer processor (145),
the acquirer processor (147), the transaction terminal (105), the portal (143), and other
devices and/or services accessing the portal (143) are connected via communications
networks, such as local area networks, cellular telecommunications networks, wireless
wide area networks, wireless local area networks, an intranet, and Internet. In one
embodiment, dedicated communication channels are used between the transaction
handler (103) and the issuer processor (145), between the transaction handler (103) and
the acquirer processor (147), and/or between the portal (143) and the transaction
handler (103).
[0202]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) uses the data warehouse
(149) to store the records about the transactions, such as the transaction records or
transaction data (109).      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) includes a
powerful computer, or cluster of computers functioning as a unit, controlled by

     WO 2016/014561                                                       PCT/US2015/041373
                                               41
instructions stored on a computer readable medium.
[0203]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) is configured to support and
deliver authorization services, exception file services, and clearing and settlement
services.    In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) has a subsystem to
process authorization requests and another subsystem to perform clearing and
settlement services.
[0204]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) is configured to process
different types of transactions, such credit card transactions, debit card transactions,
prepaid card transactions, and other types of commercial transactions.
[0205]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) facilitates the
communications between the issuer processor (145) and the acquirer processor (147).
[0206]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) is coupled to the portal
(143) (and/or the profile selector (129), the advertisement selector (133), the media
controller (115)) to charge the fees for the services of providing the transaction-based
intelligence information and/or advertisement.
[0207]      For example, in one embodiment, the system illustrated in Figure 7 is
configured to deliver advertisements to the point of interaction (107) of the user (101),
based on the transaction-based intelligence information; and the transaction handler
(103) is configured to charge the advertisement fees to the account of the advertiser in
communication with the issuer processor in control of the account of the advertiser.
The advertisement fees may be charged in response to the presentation of the
advertisement, or in response to the completion of a pre-determined number of
presentations, or in response to a transaction resulted from the presentation of the
advertisement.     In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) is configured to a
periodic fee (e.g., monthly fee, annual fee) to the account of the advertiser in
communication with the respective issuer processor that is similar to the issuer
processor (145) of the consumer account (146).
[0208]      For example, in one embodiment, the portal (143) is configured to provide
transaction-based intelligence information in response to the queries received in the
portal (143).   The portal (143) is to identify the requesters (e.g., via an authentication, or
the address of the requesters) and instruct the transaction handler (103) to charge the

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                             42
consumer accounts (e.g., 146) of the respective requesters for the transaction-based
intelligence information.    In one embodiment, the accounts of the requesters are
charged in response to the delivery of the intelligence information via the portal (143).
In one embodiment, the accounts of the requesters are charged a periodic subscription
fee for the access to the query capability of the portal (143).
[0209]      In one embodiment, the information service provided by the system illustrated
in Figure 7 includes multiple parties, such as one entity operating the transaction
handler (103), one entity operating the advertisement data (135), one entity operating
the user tracker (113), one entity operating the media controller (115), etc.     The
transaction handler (103) is used to generate transactions to settle the fees, charges
and/or divide revenues using the accounts of the respective parties.       In one
embodiment, the account information of the parties is stored in the data warehouse (149)
coupled to the transaction handler (103).     In some embodiments, a separate billing
engine is used to generate the transactions to settle the fees, charges and/or divide
revenues.
[0210]      In one embodiment, the transaction terminal (105) is configured to submit the
authorized transactions to the acquirer processor (147) for settlement.      The amount for
the settlement may be different from the amount specified in the authorization request.
The transaction handler (103) is coupled between the issuer processor (145) and the
acquirer processor (147) to facilitate the clearing and settling of the transaction.
Clearing includes the exchange of financial information between the issuer processor
(145) and the acquirer processor (147); and settlement includes the exchange of funds.
[0211]      In one embodiment, the issuer processor (145) is to provide funds to make
payments on behalf of the consumer account (146).        The acquirer processor (147) is to
receive the funds on behalf of the merchant account (148).       The issuer processor (145)
and the acquirer processor (147) communicate with the transaction handler (103) to
coordinate the transfer of funds for the transaction.   In one embodiment, the funds are
transferred electronically.
[0212]      In one embodiment, the transaction terminal (105) may submit a transaction
directly for settlement, without having to separately submit an authorization request.
[0213]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides a user interface to allow the user

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                              43
(101) to organize the transactions in one or more consumer accounts (146) of the user
with one or more issuers.      The user (101) may organize the transactions using
information and/or categories identified in the transaction records, such as merchant
category, transaction date, amount, etc.      Examples and techniques in one embodiment
are provided in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2007/0055597, entitled "Method and System for
Manipulating Purchase Information," the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated
herein by reference.
[0214]      In one embodiment, the portal (143) provides transaction based statistics,
such as indicators for retail spending monitoring, indicators for merchant benchmarking,
industry/market segmentation, indicators of spending patterns, etc.     Further examples
can be found in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2009/0048884, entitled "Merchant
Benchmarking Tool," the disclosure of which application is hereby incorporated herein by

The memory (167) may store instructions for the processor (151) and/or data, such as
the account information (142) associated with the consumer account (146).
[0226]      In one embodiment, the account information (142) includes an identifier
identifying the issuer (and thus the issuer processor (145)) among a plurality of issuers,
and an identifier identifying the consumer account among a plurality of consumer
accounts controlled by the issuer processor (145).     The account information (142) may
include an expiration date of the account identification device (141), the name of the
consumer holding the consumer account (146), and/or an identifier identifying the
account identification device (141) among a plurality of account identification devices
associated with the consumer account (146).
[0227]      In one embodiment, the account information (142) may further include a
loyalty program account number, accumulated rewards of the consumer in the loyalty
program, an address of the consumer, a balance of the consumer account (146), transit
information (e.g., a subway or train pass), access information (e.g., access badges),
and/or consumer information (e.g., name, date of birth), etc.
[0228]      In one embodiment, the memory includes a nonvolatile memory, such as
magnetic strip, a memory chip, a flash memory, a Read Only Memory (ROM), etc. to
store the account information (142).
[0229]      In one embodiment, the information stored in the memory (167) of the account
identification device (141) may also be in the form of data tracks that are traditionally
associated with credits cards.     Such tracks include Track 1 and Track 2.     Track 1
("International Air Transport Association") stores more information than Track 2, and
contains the cardholder's name as well as the account number and other discretionary
data.    Track 1 is sometimes used by airlines when securing reservations with a credit
card.    Track 2 ("American Banking Association") is currently most commonly used and
is read by ATMs and credit card checkers.       The ABA (American Banking Association)
designed the specifications of Track 1 and banks abide by it.     It contains the

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                             46

device (141) does not have the input device (153), the audio device (157) and the display
device (155) in one embodiment; and in another embodiment, an account identification
device (141) does not have components (151-159).
[0235]      For example, in one embodiment, an account identification device (141) is in
the form of a debit card, a credit card, a smartcard, or a consumer device that has
optional features such as magnetic strips, or smartcards.
[0236]      An example of an account identification device (141) is a magnetic strip
attached to a plastic substrate in the form of a card.   The magnetic strip is used as the
memory (167) of the account identification device (141) to provide the account
information (142).    Consumer information, such as account number, expiration date,
and consumer name may be printed or embossed on the card.           A semiconductor chip
implementing the memory (167) and the communication device (159) may also be

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                             47
embedded in the plastic card to provide account information (142) in one embodiment.
In one embodiment, the account identification device (141) has the semiconductor chip
but not the magnetic strip.
[0237]      In one embodiment, the account identification device (141) is integrated with a
security device, such as an access card, a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, a
security card, a transponder, etc.
[0238]      In one embodiment, the account identification device (141) is a handheld and
compact device.     In one embodiment, the account identification device (141) has a size

POINT OF INTERACTION
[0240]      In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) is to provide an
advertisement to the user (101), or to provide information derived from the transaction
data (109) to the user (101).
[0241]      In one embodiment, an advertisement is a marketing interaction which may
include an announcement and/or an offer of a benefit, such as a discount, incentive,
reward, coupon, gift, cash back, or opportunity (e.g., special ticket/admission).   An
advertisement may include an offer of a product or service, an announcement of a
product or service, or a presentation of a brand of products or services, or a notice of
events, facts, opinions, etc.    The advertisements can be presented in text, graphics,
audio, video, or animation, and as printed matter, web content, interactive media, etc.
An advertisement may be presented in response to the presence of a financial
transaction card, or in response to a financial transaction card being used to make a
financial transaction, or in response to other user activities, such as browsing a web
page, submitting a search request, communicating online, entering a wireless
communication zone, etc.       In one embodiment, the presentation of advertisements may

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              48
be not a result of a user action.
[0242]      In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) can be one of various
endpoints of the transaction network, such as point of sale (POS) terminals, automated
teller machines (ATMs), electronic kiosks (or computer kiosks or interactive kiosks),
self-assist checkout terminals, vending machines, gas pumps, websites of banks (e.g.,
issuer banks or acquirer banks of credit cards), bank statements (e.g., credit card
statements), websites of the transaction handler (103), websites of merchants, checkout
websites or web pages for online purchases, etc.
[0243]      In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be the same as the
transaction terminal (105), such as a point of sale (POS) terminal, an automated teller
machine (ATM), a mobile phone, a computer of the user for an online transaction, etc.
In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be co-located with, or near, the
transaction terminal (105) (e.g., a video monitor or display, a digital sign), or produced by
the transaction terminal (e.g., a receipt produced by the transaction terminal (105)).     In
one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be separate from and not co-located
with the transaction terminal (105), such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant,
a personal computer of the user, a voice mail box of the user, an email inbox of the user,
a digital sign, etc.
[0244]      For example, the advertisements can be presented on a portion of media for a
transaction with the customer, which portion might otherwise be unused and thus
referred to as a "white space" herein.    A white space can be on a printed matter (e.g., a
receipt printed for the transaction, or a printed credit card statement), on a video display
(e.g., a display monitor of a POS terminal for a retail transaction, an ATM for cash
withdrawal or money transfer, a personal computer of the customer for online
purchases), or on an audio channel (e.g., an interactive voice response (IVR) system for
a transaction over a telephonic device).
[0245]      In one embodiment, the white space is part of a media channel available to
present a message from the transaction handler (103) in connection with the processing
of a transaction of the user (101).   In one embodiment, the white space is in a media
channel that is used to report information about a transaction of the user (101), such as
an authorization status, a confirmation message, a verification message, a user interface

     WO 2016/014561                                                      PCT/US2015/041373
                                               49
to verify a password for the online use of the account information (142), a monthly
statement, an alert or a report, or a web page provided by the portal (143) to access a
loyalty program associated with the consumer account (146) or a registration program.
[0246]      In other embodiments, the advertisements can also be presented via other
media channels which may not involve a transaction processed by the transaction
handler (103).     For example, the advertisements can be presented on publications or
announcements (e.g., newspapers, magazines, books, directories, radio broadcasts,
television, digital signage, etc., which may be in an electronic form, or in a printed or
painted form).     The advertisements may be presented on paper, on websites, on
billboards, on digital signs, or on audio portals.
[0247]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) purchases the rights to use
the media channels from the owner or operators of the media channels and uses the
media channels as advertisement spaces.           For example, white spaces at a point of
interaction (e.g., 107) with customers for transactions processed by the transaction
handler (103) can be used to deliver advertisements relevant to the customers
conducting the transactions; and the advertisement can be selected based at least in
part on the intelligence information derived from the accumulated transaction data (109)
and/or the context at the point of interaction (107) and/or the transaction terminal (105).
[0248]      In general, a point of interaction (e.g., 107) may or may not be capable of
receiving inputs from the customers, and may or may not co-located with a transaction
terminal (e.g., 105) that initiates the transactions.   The white spaces for presenting the
advertisement on the point of interaction (107) may be on a portion of a geographical
display space (e.g., on a screen), or on a temporal space (e.g., in an audio stream).
[0249]      In one embodiment, the point of interaction (107) may be used to primarily to
access services not provided by the transaction handler (103), such as services provided
by a search engine, a social networking website, an online marketplace, a blog, a news
site, a television program provider, a radio station, a satellite, a publisher, etc.
[0250]      In one embodiment, a consumer device is used as the point of interaction
(107), which may be a non-portable consumer device or a portable computing device.

and the account identification device (141), can be implemented as a computer system,
such as a data processing system illustrated in Figure 11, with more or fewer
components.      Some of the modules may share hardware or be combined on a
computer system.       In one embodiment, a network of computers can be used to
implement one or more of the modules.
[0256]      Further, the data illustrated in Figure 7, such as transaction data (109),

      WO 2016/014561                                                   PCT/US2015/041373
                                             51
account data (111), transaction profiles (127), and advertisement data (135), can be
stored in storage devices of one or more computers accessible to the corresponding
modules illustrated in Figure 7.     For example, the transaction data (109) can be stored
in the data warehouse (149) that can be implemented as a data processing system
illustrated in Figure 11, with more or fewer components.
[0257]      In one embodiment, the transaction handler (103) is a payment processing
system, or a payment card processor, such as a card processor for credit cards, debit
cards, etc.
[0258]      Figure 11 illustrates a data processing system according to one embodiment.
While Figure 11 illustrates various components of a computer system, it is not intended
to represent any particular architecture or manner of interconnecting the components.
One embodiment may use other systems that have fewer or more components than
those shown in Figure 11.
[0259]      In Figure 11, the data processing system (170) includes an inter-connect
(171) (e.g., bus and system core logic), which interconnects a microprocessor(s) (173)
and memory (167).      The microprocessor (173) is coupled to cache memory (179) in the
example of Figure 11.
[0260]      In one embodiment, the inter-connect (171) interconnects the
microprocessor(s) (173) and the memory (167) together and also interconnects them to
input/output (1/O) device(s) (175) via 1/O controller(s) (177).  1/O devices (175) may
include a display device and/or peripheral devices, such as mice, keyboards, modems,
network interfaces, printers, scanners, video cameras and other devices known in the
art.   In one embodiment, when the data processing system is a server system, some of
the I/O devices (175), such as printers, scanners, mice, and/or keyboards, are optional.
[0261]      In one embodiment, the inter-connect (171) includes one or more buses
connected to one another through various bridges, controllers and/or adapters.       In one
embodiment the 1/O controllers (177) include a USB (Universal Serial Bus) adapter for
controlling USB peripherals, and/or an IEEE-1394 bus adapter for controlling IEEE-1 394
peripherals.
[0262]      In one embodiment, the memory (167) includes one or more of: ROM (Read
Only Memory), volatile RAM (Random Access Memory), and non-volatile memory, such

     WO 2016/014561                                                    PCT/US2015/041373
                                              52
as hard drive, flash memory, etc.
[0263]      Volatile RAM is typically implemented as dynamic RAM (DRAM) which
requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory.
Non-volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive, a magnetic optical drive, an
optical drive (e.g., a DVD RAM), or other type of memory system which maintains data
even after power is removed from the system.        The non-volatile memory may also be a
random access memory.
[0264]      The non-volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of
the components in the data processing system.        A non-volatile memory that is remote
from the system, such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing
system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface, can also be
used.
[0265]      In this description, some functions and operations are described as being
performed by or caused by software code to simplify description.       However, such
expressions are also used to specify that the functions result from execution of the
code/instructions by a processor, such as a microprocessor.
[0266]      Alternatively, or in combination, the functions and operations as described
here can be implemented using special purpose circuitry, with or without software
instructions, such as using Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or
Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Embodiments can be implemented using
hardwired circuitry without software instructions, or in combination with software
instructions.    Thus, the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of
hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular source for the instructions
executed by the data processing system.
[0267]      While one embodiment can be implemented in fully functioning computers and
computer systems, various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a
computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of
the particular type of machine or computer-readable media used to actually effect the
distribution.
[0268]      At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied, at least in part, in software.
That is, the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data

     WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                                53
processing system in response to its processor, such as a microprocessor, executing
sequences of instructions contained in a memory, such as ROM, volatile RAM,
non-volatile memory, cache or a remote storage device.
[0269]      Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as
part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, object,
module or sequence of instructions referred to as "computer programs." The computer
programs typically include one or more instructions set at various times in various
memory and storage devices in a computer, and that, when read and executed by one or
more processors in a computer, cause the computer to perform operations necessary to
execute elements involving the various aspects.
[0270]      A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which
when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various
methods.     The executable software and data may be stored in various places including
for example ROM, volatile RAM, non-volatile memory and/or cache.           Portions of this
software and/or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices.         Further, the
data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks.
Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized
servers and/or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication
sessions or in a same communication session.          The data and instructions can be
obtained in entirety prior to the execution of the applications.   Alternatively, portions of
the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically, just in time, when needed for
execution.    Thus, it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine
readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.
[0271]      Examples of computer-readable media include but are not limited to
recordable and non-recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory
devices, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory
devices, floppy and other removable disks, magnetic disk storage media, optical storage
media (e.g., Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD ROMS), Digital Versatile Disks
(DVDs), etc.), among others.       The computer-readable media may store the instructions.
[0272]      The instructions may also be embodied in digital and analog communication
links for electrical, optical, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals, such as

      WO 2016/014561                                                     PCT/US2015/041373
                                              54
carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.    However, propagated signals, such
as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc. are not tangible machine readable
medium and are not configured to store instructions.
[0273]      In general, a machine readable medium includes any mechanism that
provides (i.e., stores and/or transmits) information in a form accessible by a machine
(e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any
device with a set of one or more processors, etc.).
[0274]      In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with
software instructions to implement the techniques.        Thus, the techniques are neither
limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any
particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.
