Frame innovation description:
It's a formwork system that will be used new frame and it will be able to be
open from two sides by the size of 410 as attached in the drawing.
The height of the frame is 2134mm and the width centre to centre will be
1219.
For example if the frame in position A the opening size will be 410.
While if we turn the frame upside down the opening side will be the
same 410.
Otherwise the form worker cannot make mistake by using the frame
in wrong position because both side has the same opening size 410.
