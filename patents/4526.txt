ABSTRACT
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) generate light more efficiently than high-intensity discharge
lamps or high-intensity fluorescent lamps. Driving a series of LEDs with a constant-voltage
primary supply and a low-voltage LED driver keeps efficiency high. Unfortunately, LED
forward voltage varies as a function of temperature: at low temperature, the forward voltage
rises.  Placing the LEDs in series magnifies the forward voltage increases.     This makes it
difficult to drive a series of LEDs at low temperature with a constant-voltage supply because
the forward voltage can exceed the power supply voltage. To account for this behavior, an
exemplary LED lighting fixture includes a "bypass" circuit that, when engaged, effectively
removes at least one LED from each series string of LEDs to bring the total forward voltage
below the power supply voltage. The low-voltage driver circuit monitors temperature, and
engages the "bypass" circuit when necessary to ensure that DC voltage is not exceeded. See
Fig. 3A.

[00021        Compared to traditional lighting systems such as high intensity discharge (HID), high
intensity fluorescent (HIF), and high pressure sodium (HPS) lightings that are used in a variety
of settings, including large scale facilities such as warehouses, light emitting diodes (LEDs)
provide superior performance. Some of the advantages include low energy consumption (with
excellent lighting levels), fast switching, long lifetime, etc.
                                               SUMMARY
[00031      Embodiments of the present invention include a lighting fixture that includes a plurality
of light emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged in series, a constant-voltage power supply operably
coupled to the LEDs, a sensor in electrical communication with the LEDs, and a bypass circuit
operably coupled to the sensor. In operation, the power supply provides a constant voltage across
the LEDs. The sensor measures a decrease in the LEDs' temperature; this decrease in
temperature causes an increase in series voltage across the LEDs. And the bypass circuit short
circuits at least one LED in response to the increase in the series voltage so as to reduce the
series voltage below the constant voltage provided by the constant-voltage power supply.
[00041       In some examples, the bypass circuit enables the short-circuited LED for a
predetermined period. While the LED is re-enabled, the sensor measures a change in the LEDs'
temperature, e.g., for a period of 20 ms or less. If the temperature change indicates that the series
voltage remains high, the bypass circuit short-circuits the LED again. Otherwise, the bypass

circuit leaves the LED enabled until the temperature drops again. The bypass circuit can also
short-circuit at least one LED if the series voltage exceeds a threshold voltage.
100051     Another embodiment comprises an apparatus for illuminating an environment at cold
temperature. An exemplary apparatus includes at least one LED, a linear driver circuit operably
coupled to the LED, a sensor in electrical and/or thermal communication with the at least one
light emitting diode, a processor operably coupled to the to the sensor, and a switch (e.g., one or
more transistors) operably coupled to the processor and to the linear driver circuit. In operation,
the linear driver circuit provides a drive current to the LED. The sensor detects a variation in the
drive current from a predetermined drive current caused by a decrease in temperature of the
LED, e.g., based on the LED's temperature. The processor generates a drive current control
signal, such a pulse-width modulated digital signal, based on at least in part on the variation
measured by the sensor. And the switch controls the drive current provided to the LED by the
linear drive circuit in response to the drive current control signal fnom the processor, The
processor may also dim the LED by varying the drive current control signal.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
100221     For the cold storage industry, facility lighting has been a significant challenge owing to
the subpar performance in refrigerated environments of the main industrial lighting choices, high
intensity discharge (HID) and high intensity fluorescent (HIF) lighting fixtures. In general, these
lighting systems consume too much energy, generate too much heat, and are expensive to
maintain. And low-temperature environments, such as those in cold-storage facilities, exacerbate
the disadvantages of HID and HIF lighting.
[0023]     In contrast, an exemplary smart light-emitting diode (LED) lighting fixture offers
consistent performance and durability in all temperature environments. For example, an LED
lighting system can frequently cycle on/off without impacting the longevity of the lamp source or
fixture, instantly return to full intensity when activated, even in -40oF chillers, and generate
minimal heat during operations, significantly reducing refrigeration loads.
100241     However, an LED's forward voltage has a significant variation with temperature. For
example, as shown in FIG. IA for the specific example of a GaInN LEDs the forward LED
voltage to maintain constant current increases with falling ambient temperatures. Over a
temperature range of about 273 K to about 300 K, the forward voltage for a single LED increases
by about 0.1 V. For strings of LEDs arranged in series, the total fluctuation in forward voltage
can reach several volts, depending on the number of LEDs in series, their temperature
performance, and the total temperature drop. Unfortunately, for LED drivers supplied by
constant voltage sources, which tend to be more efficient and less expensive than other power
supplies, it may not be possible to increase the voltage to compensate for increases in LED
forward voltage at low temperature. In other words, a linear LED driver supplied by an efficient
constant-voltage power supply might not provide enough voltage to drive LEDs arranged in
series at extremely cold temperatures , such as typical cold-storage facility temperatures that run
from -40T (-40"T) to --4"F (--20").

100251       LED drive current also varies with forward voltage as shown in FIG. 1B, which is a plot
of forward current versus forward voltage (an I-V curve) for an LED at temperature of 25"C. For
an LED to emit an appreciable amount of light, the forward voltage should exceed a
characteristic on-voltage value, which typically is in the range of about 2-3 volts at room
temperature as shown in FIG. IB. Changing the LED temperature causes the current-voltage
relationship to vary, in effect increasing or decreasing the LED voltage according to the
relationship depicted in FIGS. IA and 1B. But because an LED's voltage, current, and
temperature are interrelated, knowledge of any two of these quantities makes it possible to solve
for the third quantity. For example, if the current is fixed (can be assumed to be fixed), a
temperature measurement can be used to find the voltage, or vice versa.
[0026]       FIG. 2A shows LED-based lighting fixtures 210a and 210b (collectively, lighting
fixtures 210) that uses the relationship among LED current, voltage, and temperature to operate
in cold environments (e.g., environments at temperatures of 0 C -5           C, -10   C, -5'   C, -20" C
 -25 C, -30       C, -35  C, -40' C, etc.). For instance, the fixture such as a refrigerated storage
warehouse 200, with constant-voltage power supplies (not shown). Smaller fixtures 260 can be
used in smaller cold environments, such as the refrigerators 250 shown in FIG, 2B.
[00271       As explained in greater detail below, each fixture 210 includes a sensor that measures
(decreases in) temperature. Each fixture 210 also includes a processor or other circuitry that
predicts the corresponding (increase in) LED forward voltage using the LEDs' temperature
voltage relationship at a given current. To compensate for changes in LED forward voltage, the
lighting fixtures 210 and 260 include bypass circuits that short circuit one or more of the LEDs
in the lighting fixture 210 to reduce the overall forward voltage of the plurality of LEDs. Further,
since LEDs are more efficient at producing light at low temperatures (e.g., below 0 C), so short
circuiting one or more LEDs may not significantly reduce the fixture's light output. In some
cases, the bypass circuit may short-circuit the LED(s) to reduce power consumption for a given
light output level at a given temperature.
[0028]       In other cases, the LED fixtures may regulate the current supplied by the driver
circuit(s) to the LEDs. For instance, an exemplary LED fixture may include a microcontroller or
other processor that determines fluctuations in the LED drive current, possibly by measuring
temperature or the current itself. The microcontroller may modulate the drive current by applying

a drive current control signal (e.g., a pulse-width modulated signal) to the gate of a bipolar
transistor that conducts current from the power supply to the driver or from the driver to the
LEDs.
[0029]       In addition, the LED-based lighting fixtures 210 can deliver light where and when
needed, unlike HID and HIF fixtures, in part because of LEDs' fast response times. For instance,
the LED fixture 210 may include a processor that increases light output when there is activity
220 in the area 200 and dims the lights when the area 200 is unoccupied as indicated by a signal
from an ambient light sensor (not shown). The processor 200 may also brighten or dim the lights
in response to a signal from an ambient light sensor to save energy in a process known as
"daylight harvesting." For more information on occupancy- and daylight-based LED control, see,

[0030]       Bypass Circuits to Reduce LED Forward Voltage
[0031]       FIG. 3A shows a lighting fixture 300 that includes a plurality of LEDs 310a-310n
(collectively, LEDs 310) that are in series with each other. For instance, the fixture 300 may
include 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or more LEDs 310 in series depending on the available voltage,
which is supplied by a constan-voltage power supply 330 via a non-switching linear driver 340.
If the power supply 330 provides 60 V or less (e.g., 42 V with a tolerance of + 0.5 V), it may be
considered by Underwriters' Labs to be a Class 2 Power Unit and thus subject to slightly less
rigorous design constraints than certain other power supplies.
[00321       The linear driver 340 may be optimized for a given temperature (e.g., room
temperature), but fluctuations in ambient temperature may reduce the efficiency of the driver 340
and the LEDs 310. The lighting fixture 300 also includes one or more sensors 360 capable of
measuring temperature, voltage overhead, and/or LED current drive may sense the voltage
provided for driving the LEDs 310. And the fixture 300 includes a microcontroller 350 or other
processor, that determines, based on the sensor measurements, whether there is sufficient voltage

to drive the LEDs 310. A bypass circuit 370, shown in FIG. 3A as a switch, that short-circuits the
first LED 310a if the voltage is too low to drive all of the LEDs 310.
100331       For example, the sensor 360 may be implemented as a fully-integrated digital
temperature sensor like the one shown in FIG. 11 and described below. The sensor 360 can also
be implemented using other components, including but not limited to thermistors,
thermocouples, and so forth. In operation, the sensor 360 measures a decrease in temperature and
predict an associated voltage increase by using a relationship, such as a look-up table stored in
memory (not shown), that relates voltage with temperature. As an alternative embodiment, the
sensor 360 may measure a decrease in temperature and transmit a signal representing the
measurement to a microcontroller 350 that uses the relationship relating LED forward voltage
with temperature to determine the change in LED forward voltage at the lower temperature. For
Cree LEDs. the conversion is about -2.5mV/"C; for other LEDs, the conversion may be higher or
lower. In this case, the mi crocontroller 350 looks up the voltage-temperature conversion in a
memory 352, which stores these characteristics in a look-up table or other representation of the
LEDs' temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, (In other embodiments, a
voltmeter may be used to measure the voltage across the series, as discussed in more detail with
respect to FIGS. 5 and 6.)
[00341       If the sensor 360 and/or processor 350 determine that there is not sufficient voltage
and/or there is a requirement that the forward voltage should not exceed a prescribed amount
(e.g., to protect the integrity of the LEDs), the first LED 31 Ga (or, equivalently, the last LED
310n) may be "bypassed" (e.g., short-circuited) to reduce the overall forward voltage of the
LEDs 310. Bypassing one or more of the LEDs reduces the total forward voltage and makes it
possible to drive at least some of the LEDs 310 at full current.
[00351       In some implementations, the microcontroller 350 may apply a "bypass-circuit" control
signal (e.g., a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) digital signal) 380 to a bypass circuit 370 to effect
the bypassing of the first LED 3 1Ga (or the last LED 3 1On) in the series 3 10. This bypass circuit
370 may include a field-effect transistor or switching component in addition to various support
components, e.g., as described below with respect to FIG. 10. It can be implemented separately
from the linear driver circuit 340 or located on the same circuit board as the linear driver circuit
340. Upon receiving the control signal 380, the bypass-circuit 370 short-circuits the first LED

310a and consequently reduce the overall forward voltage needed for the plurality of LEDs. (In
alternative implementations, the bypass circuit 370 may be included in the linear driver 340, and
the processor 350 may transmit the control signal directly to the linear driver 340. )
[00361       Once the first LED 310a has been electrically removed (short-circuited) from the series
of LEDs 310, it may be checked periodically to determine if there is sufficient voltage available
to drive all the LEDs 310. For example, if the temperature has increased, the power supply DC
voltage may be adequate to provide a lower forward voltage to drive the LEDs 310. In such
embodiments, the microcontroller 350 and bypass-circuit 370 may periodically enable the first
LED 31 0a to check whether normal, un-bypassed operation has become possible. This periodic
disabling of the bypass circuit nay be performed at a rate too fast to observe with the naked eye,
e.g.. at a speed of 100 Hz or faster (i.e., a period less than about 20 milliseconds). The fast
switching speed leads to an imperceptible flicker of the first LED 310a and possibly of the other
LEDs 310 as well. If the measurement shows that the forward voltage has dropped below the
supply voltage (e.g., because the temperature has risen), then the bypass circuit may re-enable
the first LED 3 10, Otherwise, the bypass circuit nay disable the first LED 310a after the
measurement and check the voltage again later (e.g., every 30 seconds, 60 seconds, five minutes,
ten minutes, etc.).
[00371       FIG, 3B shows how multiple "bypass circuits" 370a--3 70c (collectively, bypass circuits
370) may be coupled to the LEDs 310 to allow for individual "bypassing" of some or all of the
LEDs, For example, the bypass circuits 370 may comprise respective transistors, e.g., as shown
in FIG. 10. Upon receiving a signal 380b from the microcontroller 350, some or all of these
transistors may short out a respective LED 310. For example, in FIG. 3B, bypass circuit 370b is
associated with LED 31Gb, bypass circuit 370c is associated with LED 310c, etc., and each
bypass circuit 370 is connected to the microcontroller 350. As such, the microcontroller 350 can
switch on or disable the bypass circuits 370 individually and consequently can control the overall
total voltage across the LEDs 310 more finely. This may allow the LEDs 310 to illuminate the
environment over a wider range of voltage swings (and a wider range of temperatures).
100381       With reference to FIG. 4, a lighting fixture 400 may include light bars 490a-490c
(collectively, light bars 490) that each comprise several LEDs 410a--410n (collectively, LEDs
410) in series. Each light bar 490 may be connected to a constant-voltage power supply 430

through a respective low-voltage driver 440a-440c (collectively, drivers 440). In some
embodiments, the constant-voltage power supply 430 and low-voltage drivers 440 may be
conmnonly available modular power supplies and drivers, respectively.
[00391     As explained above, the combined forvard voltages of the LEDs 410 in each light bar
490 may exceed the available DC voltage as the ambient temperature drops. In some
implementations, the low voltage drivers 440 of some or all of the light bars 410 may serve as
sensors that measure the temperature and/or voltage to determine if the forward voltage exceeds
the DC voltage available for each light bar 490. For example, if the same amount of forward
voltage should be available to each light bar 490 in the lighting fixture 400, the voltage drivers
440 may check to determine if the total forward voltage at each light bar 490 exceeds the total
available DC voltage divided by the number of light bars 490 in the lighting fixture 400.
[00401     In some embodiments, the lighting fixture 400 includes a digital light agent (DLA)
module 450, which may be implemented as a processor, that may determine, upon receiving the
sensing measurements from the voltage drivers 440. if the total forward voltages for the light
bars 490 have exceeded the apportioned DC voltages. In other embodiments, the voltage drivers
490 may have made such determinations and may transmit the result to the DLA module 450.
Once it has been determined that the forward voltages at one or more of the light bars exceed the
available DC voltage, and/or the total combined forward voltage of all the LEDs 410 exceeds the
power supply DC voltage, the DLA module 450 may signal the voltage drivers to engage bypass
circuits 420a---420c (collectively, bypass circuits 420) included in each light bar 490. In some
embodiments, when engaged, the bypass circuits 420 may short-circuit at least one LED 410 in
each light bar 490 (FIG. 4 as shown depicts the short-circuiting of the first LED of the light bar).
For example, the number of LEDs short-circuited by different bypass circuits may be the same
and/or different.

[00421     FIG. 5 shows a plurality of LEDs 51 Oa- 51 On (collectively, LEDs 510) in series with
each other and connected to a DC voltage power supply 530 via a non-switching linear driver

the LEDs less efficient than the optimal case. In embodiments similar to those discussed with
reference to FIG 3A, a sensor 560b measures the ambient temperature 560a and determines
whether there is sufficient voltage to drive the plurality of LEDs. In alternative embodiments, the
sensor may relay the measurements to the microcontroller 550 which may then look up, in a
memory 552, a relationship that relates LED forward voltages with temperature to determine
whether there is sufficient voltage to drive the plurality of LEDs.
[0043]       In other embodiments, a voltmeter 590 measures the voltage overhead across the
plurality of the LEDs and may determine if the forward voltage of the plurality of LEDs exceeds
the available DC voltage, and provide the microcontroller with the result. In some embodiments,
the sensor 590 may measure the forward voltage of the plurality of LEDs and relay the measured
data to the microcontroller 550 for the microcontroller to determine if the DC power supply
provides sufficient voltage to drive the LEDs 510. Upon determining that the forward voltage
has exceeded the power supply DC voltage and/or another prescribed voltage threshold, the
microcontroller 550 applies a "bypass-circuit" control signal 580 (e.g., a pulse-width-modulated
(PWM) digital signal) to the bypass circuit 570. This causes the bypass circuit 570 to short
circuit the first LED 510a (or last LED, as an alternative example) in the series as shown in
FIG. 5. As explained above, short-circuiting the first LED 51 Ga reduces the overall forward
voltage needed for the series of LEDs.
[0044]       After the first LED 51 Ga has been short-circuited and the total forward voltage of the
remaining plurality of LEDs reduced to or below the DC voltage from the power supply 530, the
microcontroller 550 may disable the bypass switch 570 and bring the shorted LED 51 0a back
online periodically to check if there is enough forward voltage to drive all the LEDs 510. For
example, the ambient temperature may have increased and the required total forward voltage for
the plurality of LEDs including the shorted-out LED may have been reduced to below the DC
voltage. In such embodiments, the microcontroller 550 may periodically disable the "bypass
circuit" (e.g., switch off the bypass circuit 570) to check whether un-bypassed operation has
become possible by, for example, measuring the total forward voltage again with the voltmeter
590. This periodic disabling of the bypass circuit may be performed at a rate too fast to observe
with the naked eye, e.g., at a speed of 100 Hz or faster (i.e., a period less than about 20

milliseconds, 10 milliseconds, 5 milliseconds, etc.
100451     FIG. 6 shows a fixture 600 that includes multiple bypass circuits 620a and 620b
(collectively, bypass circuits 620), each of which is coupled to a different LED 610 in the series
of LEDs 610a-610n (collectively, LEDs 610). The LEDs 610 are driven by a linear driver circuit
640 that receives power from a constant-voltage power supply 630. As in FIG. 5, a processor 650
determines the temperature by measuring the forward LED voltage with a voltage sense circuit
690 (e.g_. a voltmeter) and looking up the temperature 660a corresponding to the measured
voltage and drive current in a look-up table or other representation stored in a memory 652. (The
processor 600 nay also measure the temperature 660a using a temperature sensor 660b and
determine the LED forward voltage based on the temperature 660a.) If the processor 650
determines that the forward LED voltage has risen above the power supply voltage or another
threshold, the processor generates one or more control signals 680a and 680b for actuating the
bypass circuits 670a through 670(n - 1) (collectively, bypass circuits 670). only some of which
are shown for clarity.
[00461     Upon receiving the control signals 680a and 680b from the microcontroller 650, the
bypass circuits 670a and 670b may short-circuit the associated LED(s), For example, in FIG. 6,
bypass circuit/switch 670a is associated with LED 610a, bypass circuit/switch 670b is associated
with LED 610b, etc. As such, the microcontroller 650 can switch on or disable the bypass
circuits 670 individually and consequently can control the overall total voltage across the LEDs
610 more finely. This may allow the LEDs 610 to illuminate the environment over a wider range
of voltage swings (and a wider range of temperatures). This, for example, may also allow for the
wear that ensues from the switching on/off of LEDs to be distributed evenly amongst some or all
the LEDs in the series.
[0047]     If desired, the processor 650 may actuate the bypass circuits 620a and 620b
independently. That is, in FIG. 6, the processor 650 can switch on or disable the bypass circuits
620a and 620b individually, and consequently would be able to control the voltage across each
LED 610a, 610c separately. This, for example, may allow for the wear that ensues from the
switching on/off of LEDs to be distributed evenly amongst some or all the LEDs in the series.

100481     Current Monitoring for Low-Temperature Operation
[00491     FIG. 7 illustrates an LED lighting fixture 700 with a processor 750 that controls the
current supplied to LEDs 710 in response to changes in temperature. The LEDs 710 are
connected to a power supply (not shown) via a linear driver 740 and a bypass circuit 770, which
may also be part of the linear driver 740. In this case, the linear driver 740 can be an inexpensive
device, e.g., a driver that does not provide or use a precision current reference for controlling the
current supplied to the LEDs 710. And the bypass circuit 770 can be a transistor-based device
like the bypass circuits shown in FIGS. 3A, 3B, 5, 6, 7, and 10. It can also comprise one or more
bipolar transistors whose base-emitter voltage drop may be used to set a desired drive current for
the LEDs 710. In operation, the processor 750 and the transistors manage the level of the drive
current supplied to the LEDs 7 10.
[00501     As shown in FIG. 7, a current sensor 790 coupled in series with the LEDs 710 may
measure the LED drive current. The current sensor 790 provides this measurement to the
processor 750, which determines whether the drive current has deviated from a desired set-point
based on values stored in a memory 752. The processor 750 may also determine the voltage or
temperature based on the current measurement.
100511     In other embodiments, a temperature sensor 760b may provide a measurement of the
temperature 760a to the processor 750, which determines if the drive current has deviated from
the desired drive current set-point based on the temperature measurement based on values stored
in the memory 752. For example, the sensor and/or the microcontroller imay use a relationship
that relates current with temperature, and based on a temperature measurement from the sensor
760b may be able to determine the drive current at the plurality of LEDs 710.
100521     Upon determining the deviation of the drive current from the drive current set-point, in
some embodiments, the processor 750 may apply a drive current control signal (e.g., a pulse
width-modulated (PWM) digital signal) 780 to the bypass circuit 770 to adjust the drive current
to the desired value. For example, if the ambient temperature drops and the output current
exceeds the desired value, the processor 750 may apply a PWM signal to the transistor 770 in
order to reduce the driver current to the set-point level. In some embodiments, the same PWM

100531       Compensation for Temperature-Induced LED Drive Voltage Fluctuation
[00541       FIG. 8 shows an exemplary process for managing the voltage across LEDs operating in
a low temperature environment. In some embodiments, at step 801, a plurality of LEDs are
connected to a constant voltage source. For example, the voltage source may be a DC voltage
source power supply connected to a linear driver. At step 802, one may measure physical
quantities such as ambient temperature of the plurality of the LEDs, and determine, at step 803,
the forward voltage of the LEDs by using a relationship that relates temperature to forward
voltages. In other embodiments, one may measure the voltage overhead and/or LED current
drive and determine the forward voltage.
[00551       At step 804. the measured drive voltage is compared to a threshold amount (e.g., the
DC voltage provided by the voltage source). If the measured drive voltage is under the threshold,
the temperature may be periodically monitored to check if the forward voltage remains under the
threshold. If the measured forward voltage exceeds the threshold, at step 805, a processor (e.g.. a
microcontroller) may effectuate the bypassing of at least one of the LEDs in the plurality of
LEDs using a bypass circuit. In some embodiments, the bypassing/short-circuiting may
electrical ly isolate the LED and bring the overall forward voltage across the plurality of LEDs
under the threshold.
[00561       At step 806, the microcontroller may disable the bypass circuit to determine if the LED
forward voltage has dropped, For example, the temperature may have increased and the forward
voltage required to drive the LEDs at the desired drive current may have decreased below the
threshold, In some embodiments, the switching on/off of the bypass circuit may be undertaken at
an imperceptible rate to humans. If a measurement of the forward voltage at step 807 shows that
the forward voltage still exceeds the threshold, the bypass circuit is re-engaged and at least one
LED is short-circuited at step 808. If, on the other hand, the forward voltage has fallen under the
threshold, the bypass circuit is left disabled and the ambient temperature is monitored to check
the forward voltage remains below the threshold.

100571       FIG. 9 shows an exemplary process for managing the drive current supplied to a
plurality of LEDs operating in a low temperature environment. At step 901, a constant voltage
supply is connected to a plurality of LEDs via a linear driver to maintain a given drive current
through the plurality of LEDs. At step 902, physical quantities such as ambient temperature of
the plurality of the LEDs are measured, and based on the measurements, at step 903, the drive
current at the LEDs, and the variations due to fluctuations in temperature may be determined.
For example, a drop in temperature may result in an increase in the drive current, and such a
change in the drive current may be determined at step 903. In some embodiments, the
fluctuations in drive current may also be determined by measuring the current itself and/or
voltage overhead using a sensor.
[00581       At step 904, if the drive current is determined to be acceptable (e.g., the drive current
variations are within some acceptable bounds of the desired drive current set-point), the
temperature may be periodically monitored to check if the drive current variations remains
within the bounds. If, on the other hand, the current variations are not acceptable, a
microcontroller may apply, at step 905, a drive current control signal to a transistor and/or a
linear driver circuit to keep the current at the desired level of drive current. For example, if a
drop in temperature has resulted in an increase of the drive current, the microprocessor may
signal the transistor and/or the linear driver to reduce the drive current to the desired level, At
step 906, one may determine if the drive current has attained the desired level, and if so, at step
907, the temperature may be periodically monitored to check the drive current maintains at the
desired level. If, on the other hand, the drive current has not reached the desired level, the
microcontroller may apply additional signal to the transistor and/or linear driver to adjust the
drive current at the plurality of LEDs to the desired level.

circuit 1000 includes a inetal---oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) 1020 that
is connected to a DC voltage power supply 1030. For example, the voltage supply 1030 may be a
constant-voltage source (e.g., 42V). The MOSFET 1020 is also connected to a bipolar junction
transistor 1070 whose base is connected to a microcontroller or other processor (not shown). In
some embodiments, the bypass circuit 1000 also contains several resistors, which may be

connected to the transistors in series and/or parallel for use in, amongst other things, monitoring
and/or testing the bypass circuit 1000. For example, the MOSFET 1020 may be connected to a
resistor RI in parallel, and the transistor1070 may be connected to a smaller resistor R37 in
series. In some embodiments, a much higher resistor R33 may be placed between the gate of the
MOSFET 1020 and the collector of the transistor 1070. In some embodiments, the monitoring
and/or testing may be conduct at several points throughout the circuit. For example, in the
embodiments depicted in FIG. 10, several test points (TPs), such as TP23, TP24, TP21, TP28
and/or TP27 are used to determine voltage and/or current in the bypass circuit.
100611     Temperature Sensors
[00621     FIG. II shows a circuit diagram of an exemplary temperature sensor. In some
embodiments, the temperature sensor 1 100 comprises a thermal sensor 1120 capable of
measuring its own internal temperature and the temperature of a remote/external component such
as a transistor, diode, LED, etc. In this case, the thermal sensor 1120 comprises a digital
temperature supervisor; in other examples, the thermal sensor 1120 may comprise a
thermocouple, thermistor, or other suitable temperature-sensitive device or component. In some
embodiments, the thermal sensor 1120 mnav measure the temperature using a transistor I 170.
Such a thermal sensor may have an effective capacitance C14. The measurements of the
temperature sensor I 100 may be communicated to a microcontroller 1150 via a suitable
electrical connection as depicted in FIG, 11.

100721       Computer-executable instructions may be in many forms, such as program modules,
executed by one or more computers or other devices. Generally, program modules include
routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or
implement particular abstract data types. Typically the functionality of the program modules may
be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments.
[00731       Also, data structures may be stored in computer-readable media in any suitable form.
For simplicity of illustration, data structures may be shown to have fields that are related through
location in the data structure. Such relationships may likewise be achieved by assigning storage
for the fields with locations in a computer-readable medium that convey relationship between the
fields. However, any suitable mechanism may be used to establish a relationship between
information in fields of a data structure, including through the use of pointers, tags or other
mechanisms that establish relationship between data elements.
[00741       Also, various inventive concepts may be embodied as one or more methods, of which
an example has been provided. The acts performed as part of the method may be ordered in any
suitable way, Accordingly, embodiments may be constructed in which acts are performed in an
order different than illustrated, which may include performing some acts simultaneously, even
though shown as sequential acts in illustrative embodiments.
[00751       All definitions, as defined and used herein, should be un derstood to control over
dictionary definitions, definitions in documents incorporated by reference, and/or ordinary
meanings of the defined terms.
100761       The indefinite articles "a" and "an," as used herein in the specification and in the
claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean "at least one."
100771       The phrase "and/or," as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be
understood to mean "either or both" of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are
conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements
listed with "and/or" should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., "one or more" of the elements
so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically
identified by the "and/or" clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically
identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to "A and/or B". when used in

conjunction with open-ended language such as "comprising" can refer, in one embodiment, to A
only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally
including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally
including other elements); etc.
100781      As used herein in the specification and in the claims, "or" should be understood to have
the same meaning as "and/or" as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list,
"or" or "and/or" shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also
including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted
items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as "only one of' or "exactly one of," or,
when used in the claims, "consisting of," will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a
number or list of elements. In general, the term "or" as used herein shall only be interpreted as
indicating exchisive alternatives (i.e. "one or the other but not both") when preceded by terms of
exclusivity, such as "either," "one of," "only one of," or "exactly one of." "Consisting
essentially of," when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of
patent law.
[00791      As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase "at least one," in
reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element
selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily
including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and
not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows
that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the
list of elements to which the phrase "at least one" refers, whether related or unrelated to those
elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, "at least one of A and B" (or,
equivalently, "at least one of A or B," or, equivalently "at least one of A and/or B") can refer, in
one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and
optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally
including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A);
in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least
one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.

"comprising," "including," "carrying," "having," "containing," "involving," "holding,"
"composed of," and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but
not limited to. Only the transitional phrases "consisting of' and "consisting essentially of" shall
be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent
Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.
