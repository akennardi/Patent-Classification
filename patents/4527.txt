   MICROORGANISMS FOR PRODUCING DIAMINE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING
                                      DIAMINE USING THEM
  [Technical Field]
         The     present     disclosure         relates     to      a     microorganism               for
producing         diamine    and     a   method     of  producing         diamine         using       the
same.
  [Background Art]
        Biogenic       amines      (BAs)    are    nitrogenous        compounds           which       are
mainly         produced     by      decarboxylation         of      amino          acids        or     by
amination         and   transamination         of    aldehydes       and      ketones.             These
biogenic          amines     are        low    molecular       weight             compounds           and
synthesized          in   the    metabolism         of   microorganisms,                plants        and
animals,         and    thus    biogenic        amines     are      known         as      components
frequently found           in these cells.            In particular,           biogenic amines
are    polyamines        such  as      spermidine,      spermine,        putrescine           or    1,4
butanediamine, and cadaverine.
         In    general,     putrescine        is    an   important         raw       material         for
production         of polyamine         nylon-4,6     which   is     produced          by    reacting
putrescine         with   adipic      acid.     Putrescine       is    usually         produced        by
chemical          synthesis        involving         conversion           of       propylene           to
acrylonitrile and to succinonitrile.
        As a production method of putrescine using a microorganism,
a   method       of   producing         putrescine      at  a     high      concentration              by
transformation          of  E.    coli     and Corynebacterium has                  been     reported

have      been      actively         conducted          on     putrescine           transporters              in     E.

Biochem. 48:             506-512, 2010).
         Meanwhile,            cadaverine          is    a    foul-smelling              diamine         compound
produced           by    protein       hydrolysis             during         putrefaction            of     animal
tissues.            Cadaverine          has      the     chemical            formula       of     NH 2 (CH  2  ) 5NH 2 ,
which is          similar to that of putrescine.
         Cadaverine              serves       as     a    component            of     polymers           such        as
polyamide          or    polyurethane,            chelating          agents,        or   other       additives.
In    particular,             polyamide        having       an     annual        global       market        of     3.5
million         tons        is    known     to     be     prepared            by   polycondensation                  of
cadaverine           or      succinic       acid,       and     thus         cadaverine         has      received
much attention as an industrially useful compound.
         Cadaverine             is   a    diamine          found        in      a    few     microorganisms
 (Tabor       and     Tabor,        MicrobiolRev.,             49:81-99,          1985).          In    the       gram
negative          bacterium E.          coli,       cadaverine           is    biosynthesized             from L
lysine by L-lysine                  decarboxylase.              The     level       of cadaverine              in E.
coli       is      regulated          by      biosynthesis,               degradation,             uptake          and
export         of     cadaverine          (Soksawatmaekhin                   et    al.,      MolMicrobiol.,

  [Disclosure]
         The       present          inventors          have        made        intensive           efforts           to
investigate            a    protein      having        an    ability          to   export        diamine          such
as      putrescine               or    cadaverine              so       as       to      improve           diamine
productivity             in    a   microorganism           having the            diamine       productivity.

                                                         4
       The        present          invention             provides              a       microorganism               for
producing         diamine,         in    which        activity            of      a     protein        having       an
amino    acid        sequence       of    SEQ      ID    NO:      6    or     an     amino       acid     sequence
having      55%       or   higher        sequence           homology            with        SEQ      ID   NO:6      is
introduced or enhanced.
       As used herein, the                  term "diamine"                 collectively refers to a
compound        having      two    amine       groups,         and       specific           examples       thereof
may     include           putrescine              and        cadaverine.                      Putrescine            is
tetramethylenediamine                 which       may     be    produced             from ornithine             as    a
precursor.                Cadaverine              is       called             1,5-pentanediamine                    or
pentamethylenediamine,                   which       may      be     produced            from       lysine      as    a
precursor.            Such    diamines         are      industrially                applicable           compounds
that   serve         as   valuable        raw      materials            for      synthesis           of   polymers
such as polyamine nylon, polyamide or polyurethane.
       As     used       herein,        the     term        "protein            having         an     amino      acid
sequence        of    SEQ   ID NO:       6"    is    a    protein          found        in    Corynebacterium
efficiens, and also called CE2495.                              It was investigated that this
protein         retains        high       homology            with         a     membrane            protein        of
Corynebacterium,              NCgl2522.              In      an     embodiment               of     the    present
invention,         CE2495       protein         is     identified              as     a    putative        protein
which    is     involved        in    diamine         export         in     a    strain        having      diamine
productivity,            thereby remarkably                 increasing diamine productivity.
       Here,       CE2495      protein having                the      amino acid             sequence       of     SEQ
ID   NO:      6   may      be    a   protein          that       is       encoded           by    a    nucleotide
sequence        of     SEQ    ID    NO:     5.     In     the      polynucleotide                  encoding        the
CE2495      protein,         however,         various          modifications                 may     be    made     in
the   coding         region      provided          that       they        do     not       change       the    amino

                                                        5
acid        sequence        of     the    polypeptide            expressed         from        the      coding
region,          due     to     codon    degeneracy           or     in    consideration               of      the
codons        preferred         by   an   organism         in    which     the    protein          is      to   be
expressed.             Thus,      the   CE2495     protein         may    be    encoded         by     various
nucleotide            sequences       as    well    as     by     the   nucleotide            sequence          of
SEQ ID NO:           5.
         Further, the            CE2495 protein of              the present invention may be
any protein             having     the   amino     acid       sequence       of   SEQ      ID NO:          6,   or
having        55% or       higher,      preferably         75% or       higher,       more      preferably
90% or         higher,        much    more    preferably            95% or       higher,          even        much
more     preferably           98% or higher,         and most preferably                  99% or higher

substantial             diamine      export     activity.             It    is    apparent            that      an
amino        acid      sequence       having     such       homology,         of   which         a    part      is
deleted,          modified,         substituted,           or    added,       is    also       within          the

export        activity.            For    example,         the     protein       may     be      a     protein
having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:                                  22   or SEQ ID NO:                24,

      For example,        the protein       having the amino acid sequence                    of
SEQ ID NO:     22   is   a protein found in             Corynebacterium ammoniagenes,
and also called HMPREF0281_01446.                   It was investigated that this

Corynebacterium,          NCg12522      and    61%        homology       with    CE2495       of
Corynebacterium         efficiens.        In    an      embodiment        of   the     present

exhibits     diamine      export     activity         in    a   strain     having      diamine

      The HMPREF0281_01446           protein having the amino acid sequence
of   SEQ   ID     NO.    22   may    be   a   protein          that    is    encoded      by   a
nucleotide      sequence      of   SEQ   ID   NO:       21.      In   the   polynucleotide
encoding    this      protein,      however,      various         modifications        may    be
made  in   the    coding    region     provided        that    they do not       change      the
amino acid sequence of the polypeptide expressed from the coding
region,    due     to   codon     degeneracy         or     in    consideration        of   the
codons   preferred       by an     organism     in      which     the   protein     is   to be
expressed.         Thus,     this     protein       may       be    encoded     by     various
nucleotide     sequences       as   well   as    by      the   nucleotide      sequence       of
SEQ ID NO:    21.
      Further,      the protein having the                amino acid sequence           of   SEQ
ID NO:   24 is     a protein found in          Corynebacterium lipophiloflavum,

nucleotide            sequence          of     SEQ      ID    NO:      23.          In    the     polynucleotide
encoding           this       protein,          however,           various           modifications             may      be

          The       term       "homology",             as     used       herein          with       regard          to    a
sequence, refers                to identity with a given amino acid sequence or
nucleotide             sequence,          and       the     homology            may      be    expressed            as    a

determined by a method known to those skilled in the art.
          As      used      herein,           the       term        "microorganism                for      producing

or   a  microorganism          having      endogenous         diamine      productivity.
Specifically,      the microorganism            having   diamine       productivity      may
be a microorganism having putrescine or cadaverine productivity.
      The    "microorganism       having putrescine            productivity"        may be,
but is   not limited to,         a microorganism         in    which the activity of

converts     acetyl    glutamate      semialdehyde        to    N-acetylornithine         is
enhanced      compared     to    its    endogenous        activity,         in    order   to
enhance     the   biosynthetic      pathway        from   glutamate        to   ornithine,
and the     productivity      of   ornithine       which    is    used as     a precursor
for  putrescine       biosynthesis        is     enhanced,       but    is    not   limited
thereto.
      Further,      the   microorganism          having    putrescine        productivity
may  be   a   microorganism       which      is    modified      to   have    activity    of
ornithine     carbamoyl     transferase         (ArgF)  involved        in   synthesis    of
arginine      from    ornithine,       a     protein      (NCgll221)         involved     in
glutamate       export,     and/or      a     protein       (NCgl469)        involved     in
putrescine       acetylation      weaker        than   its      endogenous       activity,

enzyme    proteins       are    not   particularly           limited      thereto,        and   the

      Further,       as non-limiting            examples,       the   ornithine        carbamoyl
transferase       (ArgF) may have an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:
18,  the protein        involved       in     glutamate       export    may have         an amino

may have an amino acid sequence                    of SEQ ID NO:         20.     However, the
amino    acid      sequences       of     respective         enzyme     proteins          are   not
limited     thereto,      and    the    enzymes       may    be   proteins       having       amino

production.               A    method       of     enhancing          lysine       productivity               may     be
performed            by      a    known       method         which      is     predictable               to      those
skilled in the art.
          The      lysine       decarboxylase            is    an   enzyme       catalyzing            conversion
of     lysine          to     cadaverine,            and      its     activity          is    introduced              or
enhanced, thereby effectively producing cadaverine.
          The lysine decarboxylase may have an amino acid                                           sequence of
SEQ      ID    NO:       26,     but    is     not     particularly            limited        thereto.               The

          As       used       herein,          the      term        "production"             is       a      concept
including           extracellular            release         of diamine,           for example,              release
of     diamine          into       a   culture         medium,         as   well        as    production              of
diamine within a microorganism.
          Meanwhile,            the   term       "introduction            of    protein         activity",            as

          The    increase           in     the     gene     copy       number      may      be,      but     is     not
particularly             limited          to,     performed        by     operably        linking         the     gene

Specifically,              the     copy number           of      the    polynucleotide              in    the     host
cell      genome       may      be     increased        by     introducing           into      the      host      cell
the      vector         which          is     operably           linked        to   the       polynucleotide
encoding the protein of the present                                  invention and replicates and
functions          independently of the host                         cell, or by           introducing into
the      host       cell        the      vector        which        is      operably         linked         to      the
polynucleotide               and     is     able     to   integrate           the   polynucleotide                into
the host cell genome.
         As     used      herein,         "modification             of    the     expression           regulatory

but       is     not        particularly              limited          to,       done      by        inducing           a

with        a    nucleotide              sequence        having           stronger         activity.                The

for   a  ribosome-binding            site,       and       a   sequence           regulating            the
termination of transcription and translation.
      As   used     herein,       the      replacement             or    modification                of     a
promoter,     although      not      particularly             limited          thereto,           may     be
performed      by    replacement          or       modification             with         a      stronger
promoter     than    the   original          promoter.             A   strong          heterologous
promoter    instead of     the original promoter may be linked upstream
of   the   polynucleotide          expression             unit,      and       examples           of    the
strong   promoter     may   include        a    CJ7 promoter,             a    lysCP1        promoter,
an  EF-Tu   promoter,     a    groEL     promoter,           an    aceA     or     aceB      promoter,
and   specifically,       a     Corynebacterium-derived                      promoter,              lysCPl

polynucleotide       encoding       the    enzyme         so  that     its       expression           rate
may   be  increased.          Here,      the       lysCPl       promoter           is     a    promoter
improved      through     nucleotide             sequence           substitution                of      the

Further,     CJ7     promoter        is     a      strong        promoter            derived          from
Corynebacterium ammoniagenes                 (Korean         Patent     No.        0620092         and    WO
2006/065095).
      Furthermore,       modification           of      a   polynucleotide               sequence         on
chromosome,      although      not    particularly             limited          thereto,          may     be
performed     by   inducing      a   mutation           on   the     expression            regulatory
sequence      through      deletion,            insertion,            non-conservative                    or
conservative       substitution          of      polynucleotide                sequence,             or     a
combination     thereof    in    order      to     further       enhance         the     activity         of
the polynucleotide sequence, or                  by replacing the                 sequence with a

                                            13
polynucleotide        sequence      which    is   modified       to   have      stronger
activity.
      As used herein,         the term "vector"        refers to a DNA construct
including     a   nucleotide      sequence     encoding     the    desired     protein,
which is operably linked to an appropriate expression regulatory
sequence to express the desired protein in a suitable host cell.
The regulatory sequence may include a promoter that can initiate
transcription,       an optional       operator   sequence      for  regulating       the
transcription,        a   sequence      encoding     a   suitable     mRNA      ribosome
binding     site,     and    a   sequence     regulating      the   termination        of
transcription       and   translation.        After    the   vector    is    introduced
into    the   suitable       host    cell,    it  may     replicate       or    function
independently of the host genome, and may be integrated into the
genome itself.
      The     vector       used     in    the    present       invention        is    not
particularly      limited,     as long as it      is    able  to replicate        in  the
host cell, and any vector known in the art may be used.                        Examples
of   conventional       vectors     may   include     a  natural     or    recombinant
plasmid,    cosmid,     virus    and bacteriophage.          For   instance,      pWE15,
M13,   XMBL3,    XMBL4,     \IXII,    XASHII,    XAPII,    XtlO,    Atll,     Charon4A,
and Charon2lA       may be     used    as  a phage     vector    or  cosmid vector.
pBR type,    pUC type,      pBluescriptII      type,    pGEM type,     pTZ type,      pCL
type   and   pET   type    may   be   used   as  a plasmid       vector.       A vector
usable in the present invention is not particularly limited, and
any   known     expression      vector     may   be    used.      Preferably,        pDZ,
pACYC177,     pACYC184,       pCL,   pECCG117,     pUC19,     pBR322,      pMW118,     or
pCClBAC vector may be used.

                                                                14
          Further,           the polynucleotide                    encoding       the     desired          endogenous
protein           in        the        chromosome              can      be     replaced           by      a     mutated
polynucleotide                     using          a     vector           for     bacterial               chromosomal
insertion.                   The        insertion             of     the     polynucleotide                 into         the
chromosome            may be performed                    by any        method      known       in    the    art,        for
example,           homologous                recombination.                 Since       the       vector         of      the
present           invention              may        be      inserted          into      the        chromosome              by
homologous             recombination,                  it      may      further       include          a    selection
marker to confirm chromosomal insertion.                                         The selection marker is
to     select       cells          that       are     transformed           with     the     vector,         that        is,
to      confirm           insertion             of     the      desired        polynucleotide,                 and       the
selection             marker            may        include          markers         providing              selectable
phenotypes,               such        as    drug      resistance,            auxotrophy,            resistance             to
cytotoxic           agents,             or     surface          protein        expression.               Only        cells
expressing            the        selection           marker        are     able    to    survive          or    to    show
different            phenotypes                under        the      environment           treated          with         the
selective agent, and thus the transformed cells may be selected.
          As      used           herein,           the       term        "transformation"                 means          the
introduction                of     a    vector        including          a   polynucleotide               encoding           a
target        protein            into      a   host      cell      in    such    a   way      that      the     protein
encoded by the polynucleotide                                 is   expressed         in the host cell.                     As
long       as    the       transformed              polynucleotide             can     be    expressed            in     the
host       cell,       it      can      be     either        integrated         into      and      placed         in     the
chromosome              of        the       host        cell,         or    exist       extrachromosomally.
Further,          the        polynucleotide                 includes         DNA    and     RNA       encoding           the
target protein.                    The polynucleotide may be introduced in any form,
as long as            it can be introduced into                            the host cell and expressed
therein.           For example,                 the polynucleotide                may be         introduced           into
the host          cell        in     the     form of         an expression            cassette,           which       is     a

                                                         15
gene        construct           including            all       elements          required            for        its
autonomous            expression.                Typically,           the      expression              cassette
includes           a   promoter          operably           linked      to      the      polynucleotide,
transcriptional             termination            signals,        ribosome         binding         sites,       or
translation termination                     signals.          The   expression cassette may be
in    the     form     of   a    self-replicable               expression         vector.           Also,       the
polynucleotide as               it is may be introduced into the host cell and
operably linked to                 sequences required for expression                            in the host
cell.
         Further, as used herein, the term "operably linked" means                                                 a
functional           linkage        between         a   polynucleotide              sequence           encoding
the      desired       protein          of    the     present        invention           and     a    promoter
sequence          which       initiates           and       mediates       transcription                 of     the
polynucleotide sequence.
         Further,        the     microorganism              having     diamine         productivity             may
be     a     microorganism,              in      which       the     diamine         acetyltransferase
activity          is   weakened          compared          to   the    endogenous            activity,           in
order to increase diamine production.
         As     used    herein,        the     term     "diamine       acetyltransferase"                   is   an
enzyme catalyzing transfer of                         an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to
diamine,         and it     may be         exemplified          by   Corynebacterium glutamicum
NCg11469         or   E.   coli       SpeG,      but     its    name    may     differ        depending          on
the      species        of     a    microorganism              having       diamine         productivity.
NCgl1469 may have an amino acid                            sequence of SEQ ID NO:                   11 or       12,
and SpeG         may    have      an    amino      acid      sequence      of    SEQ      ID NO:        13,     but
the       sequence        may       differ         depending          on     the       species          of      the
microorganism.                The      protein        may      have     an     amino       acid        sequence
having          80%    or     higher,           preferably          90%      or      higher,          or       more

                                             16
preferably      95%    or     higher,     or   particularly        preferably        97%   or
higher    homology        therewith,       as    long      as   it   has    the     diamine
acetyltransferase activity.
      Since     the    diamine       acetyltransferase          converts      diamine      to
acetyl-diamine          (e.g.,       N-Ac-putrescine           or    N-Ac-cadaverine),
diamine productivity may be increased by weakening its activity,
compared to the endogenous activity.
      As   used    herein,       the   term    "endogenous        activity"     refers     to
activity      of     the      protein      that     the      original     microorganism
possesses    in   its     native     or  undenatured        state,    and   "modified      to
have   weakened       activity,       compared      to   the    endogenous       activity"
means   that activity of           the protein       is   further weakened         compared
to  the   activity      of    the   corresponding       protein     that    the    original
microorganism possesses in the native or undenatured state.
      The    weakening         of   the    protein      activity      means      that     the
protein   activity       is    reduced,    compared      to a    non-modified       strain,
or the activity is eliminated.                It is possible to apply a method
well known in the art to the weakening of the protein activity.
      Examples      of    the    method    may   include      a   method    of   replacing
the gene    encoding        the protein      on   the   chromosome      by a gene        that
is  mutated     to    reduce      the   enzyme    activity      or   to   eliminate       the
protein    activity,        a   method   of   introducing        a  mutation      into    the
expression     regulatory        sequence    of    the gene     encoding     the protein
on   the    chromosome,          a    method     of     replacing       the    expression
regulatory      sequence        of   the    gene     encoding      the   protein       by    a
sequence    having weaker          activity,    a method       of deleting a part          or
an entire of the gene encoding                the protein on the chromosome,                 a
method      of        introducing          antisense          oligonucleotide            that

complementarily                binds         to      a     transcript              of      the     gene       on      the
chromosome             to    inhibit         translation               of    mRNA       to    the      protein,          a
method        of     artificially              adding         a    sequence           complementary             to     SD
sequence         at      upstream         of     SD     sequence            of    the      gene    encoding           the
protein to           form a       secondary structure, thereby preventing access
of       the      ribosomal             subunits,               and        a      reverse          transcription
engineering              (RTE)      method           of       adding         a     promoter         for       reverse
transcription             at    3'-terminus             of     open       reading        frame      (ORF)      of     the
corresponding               sequence,          and      combinations               thereof,         but      are      not
particularly limited thereto.
         In    detail,        a   partial          or    full       deletion         of     the   gene     encoding
the protein             may be      done       by    introducing              a   vector       for    chromosomal
insertion             into       a      microorganism,                    thereby           substituting              the
polynucleotide                 encoding             an        endogenous             target          protein           on
chromosome           with     a   polynucleotide                 having         a  partial        deletion         or    a
marker        gene.         The    "partial"            may      vary       depending          on    the     type      of
polynucleotide,               but     specifically               refers         to   1   to    300,     preferably
1 to 100,         and more preferably 1 to 50 nucleotides.

Alcaligenes             sp.   or    the      like,        but      are      not    limited        thereto.            The

microorganism         of    the   present       invention        is    specifically     a

       In another       aspect,   the present        invention      provides   a method
of     producing         diamine,        comprising:           (i)    culturing       the
microorganism       having     putrescine      diamine,       in   which   activity    of
the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:                         6 or 55%
or higher sequence homology therewith is introduced or enhanced,
so as to obtain a cell culture;              and    (ii)    recovering diamine       from
the cultured microorganism or the cell culture.
       The protein having the amino acid sequence                     of SEQ ID NO:     6
or   the   protein      having    the   amino     acid     sequence     having   55%   or
higher     sequence      homology      therewith,        the    introduction     of   the
protein    activity,       the  enhancement       of    the   protein    activity,    the

the same as described above.

                                                19
       In   the method,        the     step of     culturing the microorganism may
be,   although       not    particularly        limited     to,     preferably       performed
by   batch      culture,       continuous        culture,       and     fed-batch        culture
known in the art.            In this regard, the culture conditions are not
particularly         limited,       but     an   optimal      pH     (e.g.,      pH   5    to   9,
preferably       pH     6   to     8,    and   most    preferably         pH    6.8)      may  be
maintained       by    using     a   basic     chemical      (e.g.,     sodium      hydroxide,
potassium       hydroxide          or     ammonia)     or    acidic       chemical         (e.g.,
phosphoric       acid     or   sulfuric      acid).     Also,       an  aerobic       condition
may   be    maintained         by    adding     oxygen     or      oxygen-containing          gas
mixture      to    a   cell     culture.         The   culture       temperature          may  be
maintained      at    20   to   450C,     and preferably        at   25   to   400C,     and the
cultivation may be performed for about 10 to 160 hours.
       Furthermore,         a   medium      to  be   used     for    culture      may    include
sugar      and      carbohydrate           (e.g.,     glucose,         sucrose,         lactose,
fructose,      maltose,       molasse,       starch    and    cellulose),         oil    and  fat
(e.g.,     soybean      oil,    sunflower       seed   oil,    peanut      oil    and coconut
oil),    fatty acid        (e.g.,      palmitic acid,       stearic acid and linoleic
acid),     alcohol       (e.g.,     glycerol      and   ethanol),        and    organic      acid
(e.g.,     acetic     acid)     individually        or  in    combination         as   a   carbon
source;      nitrogen-containing              organic      compound        (e.g.,      peptone,
yeast    extract,       meat juice,        malt   extract,       corn    solution,       soybean
meal    powder      and    urea),       or   inorganic      compound        (e.g.,     ammonium
sulfate,        ammonium         chloride,         ammonium         phosphate,          ammonium
carbonate,       and ammonium nitrate)              individually        or   in    combination
as     a     nitrogen         source;         potassium        dihydrogen           phosphate,
dipotassium        phosphate,         or   sodium-containing           salt     corresponding
thereto     individually         or    in   combination       as    a phosphorus         source;
other     essential        growth-stimulating           substances         including        metal

                                                      20
salts    (e.g.,       magnesium          sulfate        or     iron      sulfate),           amino        acids,
and vitamins.             In    the present         invention,           the     medium may be used
as a synonym for the culture liquid.
      As     used       herein,         the     term      "cell        culture"         is      a    material
obtained      by    culturing         a   microorganism,              and     includes         the     medium,
the   microorganism              cultured,         and      substances             released         from       the
microorganism           cultured.          For     example,          a   nutrient          supply         source
required        for      cell       culture,         such       as      minerals,          amino          acids,
vitamins,         nucleic          acids        and/or        other         components             generally
contained       in    culture        medium       (or    culture         liquid)       in      addition         to
the   carbon        source,         and    the     nitrogen           source        may     be      included.
Further,      a    desired         substance        or    an    enzyme        produced/secreted                 by
the cells may be included.
      Since       diamine        produced        by   culture         may be        secreted         into      the
medium    or      remain        in    the     cells,       the      cell      culture         may      include
diamine that is produced by culturing the microorganism.
      The      method         of    recovering          diamine          such       as    putrescine            or
cadaverine         produced          in     the      culturing             step      of       the      present
invention        may      be     carried       out,      for     example,           using       a     suitable
method    known        in     the    art     according          to     a   culturing           method,         for
example,     batch        culture,       continuous          culture,         or    fed-batch          culture,
thereby      collecting            the    desired         amino        acids        from      the      culture
liquid.
 [Advantageous Effects]
      In      the        present          invention,            it       is       demonstrated               that
Corynebacterium efficiens-derived                           CE2495         protein         is     a    protein

                                                      21
having       diamine         export    activity,          and   putrescine          export        activity
can       be   enhanced          by   introducing            this    protein           activity            into
Corynebacterium                sp.    microorganism             which        has         a      putrescine
synthetic         pathway,        but    low      putrescine       export        activity.             It    is
also        demonstrated            that       putrescine         and       cadaverine             can       be
increased         at    the    same   time       by  introducing        this      protein         activity
into       E.coli        which     has     synthetic         pathways        of      putrescine             and
cadaverine.            Accordingly,          diamine       can be    effectively             produced        by
applying Corynebacterium efficiens-derived                                CE2495          protein         to   a

                                                            22
         It      was       also       confirmed        that       putrescine            was    produced       in    a
high       yield         in      Corynebacterium glutamicum                          strains        prepared      by
additional             introduction            of    NCg12522          gene     into       the   transposon       in
KCCM11240P             or     DAB12-b,         or    by    substitution             of     NCg12522      promoter
on the        chromosome with cj7 promoter                            to enhance NCg12522                activity.
Further,           the      intracellular            amount        of putrescine              was    measured     in
the     strain          in    which       NCg12522        expression           was      enhanced,       and    as   a
result, a smaller amount of putrescine was observed, compared to
that      of     a    control          group.     It    is     indicating           that      NCg12522     has    an
ability to export putrescine.
         In      detail,           based      on    the     nucleotide            sequence         of   the    gene
encoding            NCg12522            of    Corynebacterium                glutamicum          ATCC13032,         a

         PCR was           performed          using      the     genomic         DNA     of    Corynebacterium
glutamicum ATCC13032                       as   a   template          and     two     pairs     of    primers     so
as    to      amplify           PCR      fragments         of     the      N-terminal          and    C-terminal
regions,           respectively.               These      PCR fragments were                  electrophoresed
to obtain the                 desired fragments.                 At     this time,           PCR reaction was

carried out             for 30     cycles of denaturation                      for 30       seconds at         950C,
annealing            for   30   seconds         at      550C,    and      extension          for    30   seconds
at 720C.            The fragment of the N-terminal region thus obtained was
treated           with      restriction             enzymes,          BamHI        and      SalI,       and      the
fragment of             the C-terminal region thus                       obtained was treated with
restriction             enzymes,       SalI      and XbaI.             The     fragments         thus    treated
were cloned into the pDZ vector treated with restriction enzymes,
BamHI and XbaI,               so as      to construct a plasmid pDZ-1'NCgl2522(K/0).
          The         plasmid        pDZ-1'NCgl2522(K/O)                      was        introduced            into
Corynebacterium glutamicum KCCM11240P                                   by    electroporation,              so    as
to obtain a             transformant.              Then, the          transformant was plated and
cultured           on BHIS     plate        (37     g/l     of   Braine        heart     infusion,         91    g/l

urea,        pH      6.8)    at    300C       for       8   hours.          Subsequently,            each      cell
culture          was      serially        diluted            from      10-4     to    10-1.          Then,       the
diluted          samples      were     plated         and     cultured         on    an   X-gal-containing
solid       medium for colony formation.                          From the colonies                thus    formed,
the      white        colonies       which        appeared         at     relatively           low    frequency
were        selected        to    finally           obtain       a     Corynebacterium glutamicum
strain          in     which     the      gene        encoding          NCg12522         was      deleted        and
putrescine              productivity            was        weakened.               The      Corynebacterium

weakened was designated as KCCM11240P                            ANCgl2522.
         In the      same manner, PCR was performed using the genomic DNA
of     Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13869                            as    a   template    and    two
pairs      of primers        given     in    Table       1  so    as    to   construct     a  plasmid
pDZ-2'NCgl2522(K/O)                 by      the        above        described         method.          A
Corynebacterium glutamicum                    strain,         in    which      the    gene   encoding
NCg12522         of     DAB12-b        strain         was      deleted         using     the    vector
according        to     the    above      described          method       to    weaken    putrescine
productivity,           was    constructed.             This      Corynebacterium glutamicum
strain having weakened putrescine export                               activity was designated
as DAB12-b ANCgl2522.

W3110.     Further,      putrescine       and    cadaverine      productions    were
remarkably    increased      in   W3110   pDZTn-P(cj7)-HMPREF0281         01446  and
W3110  pDZTn-P(cj7)-HMPREF0298_0262             strains which were       introduced
with HMPREF028101446 and HMPREF0298_0262, respectively.
      That is,    it   was   confirmed that diamine         in    cell  culture was
remarkably     increased      by    enhancing     activity     of   CE2495   or  the
protein   having       55%    or    higher     sequence    homology      therewith,
suggesting that the ability to export diamine such as putrescine
and cadaverine       can be     improved by enhancing         activity    of  CE2495
or the protein having 55%           or higher sequence homology therewith.
      As    such,       the      present     inventors       demonstrated       that
Corynebacterium        glutamicum       having     enhanced       CE2495    activity
prepared      by       introducing         CE2495      into        transposon     of
Corynebacterium sp. microorganism KCCM11240P ANCgl2522 which has
a  putrescine     synthetic       pathway,    but   reduced     putrescine    export
activity    has      enhanced      putrescine      export     activity,      thereby
producing putrescine in a high yield.
      Accordingly,       this     strain   KCCM11240P     ANCgl2522      Tn:P(cj7)
