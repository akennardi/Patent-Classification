CROSS REFERENCE
         The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
2014245378, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
         [0001]
         The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition and, in particular, to a
lubricating oil composition for a hydraulic oil for construction machines, a hydraulic oil for
industrial machines, a hydraulic oil for windmills, a hydraulic oil for machine tools, a turbine
oil, a compressor oil, an oil agent for shock absorbers, and the like.
BACKGROUND ART
         [0002]
         In order to meet the requirements of reducing emissions of exhaust gas and carbon
dioxide according to the environmental regulations or the like, hardware modifications have
been made on industrial machines and construction machines to employ motorization, an
electricity storage system using a regenerative energy, or the like.
         Further, in order to meet a demand for an essential technique for improving the
properties of a hydraulic oil used in a hydraulic system to achieve a high efficiency, fuel
saving and power-saving hydraulic oils are disclosed (see, for instance, Patent Literature 1).
         [0003]
         Since a pressure in hydraulic equipment has become increasingly high from year to
year, troubles such as scoring of a hydraulic pump are frequently caused. Accordingly, the
ISO standard has employed an FZG scoring test. A typical method for improving an FZG
scoring resistance is adding an acid phosphate or an amine salt thereof or an active sulfur
compound (see, for instance, Patent Literature 2).

       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION
                  [0005]
                 For hydraulic equipment, an increase in a pressure is accompanied by an increase
   5   in an oil temperature, so that sludge formed from additives has become a problem. The
       sludge causes the clogging of a filter, the spool lock of a switching valve, and the wear of
       a pump. The compositions disclosed in Patent Literatures 1 and 2, however, are unlikely to
       meet all the demands for wear resistance, low-sludge properties and excellent fuel
       economy performance.
 10              [0006]
                An object of the invention is to provide a lubricating oil composition that
      restrains formation of sludge and is excellent in wear resistance such as scoring resistance
      and in fuel-economy performance.

     DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)
              [0025]
     First Exemplary Embodiment
 10           According to a first exemplary embodiment, a lubricating oil composition
     contains or is provided by blending a base oil with (A) a specific polyacrylate compound
     and (B) a specific phosphorus compound and, preferably, also with a component (C), a
     component (D) or a component (E). A detailed description is as follows.
              [0026]
15   Base Oil
              A base oil in the lubricating oil composition of the first exemplary embodiment
     (hereinafter, occasionally simply referred to as "the present composition") has a kinematic
    viscosity at 40 degrees C in a range from 1 mm 2/s to 200 mm 2/s. When the kinematic
    viscosity at 40 degrees C is not less than 1 mm2/s, evaporation loss is small. When the
20  kinematic viscosity at 40 degrees C is not more than 200 nm 2 /s, an excessive power loss
    due to viscosity resistance can be avoided. More preferably, the kinematic viscosity at 40
    degrees C is in a range from 10 mm 2 /s to 100 mm 2 /s.
              [0027]
              The viscosity index of the base oil is 80 or more. When the viscosity index is 80
25  or more, a change in viscosity with temperature is small, so that the base oil can maintain
    a necessary viscosity at a high temperature. The viscosity index is more preferably 100 or
    more and further more preferably 120 or more. The base oil preferably has a saturated
    content of 90 mass% or more. When the saturated content is 90 mass% or more, the
    present composition exhibits an improved oxidation stability. The saturated content is

                                                     7
      more preferably 95 mass% or more and further more preferably 97 mass% or more. The
      base oil has a sulfur content of less than 0.03 mass%. When the sulfur content in the base
      oil is less than 0.03, the present composition exhibits an improved oxidation stability.
      Incidentally, the sulfur content is a value measured according to JIS K 2541 and the
  5   saturated content is a value measured according to ASTM D 2007.
                [0028]
               As the base oil used in the present composition, one of base oils categorized into
     Group II, III or IV of the base oil categories according to American Petroleum Institute
     (API) or a mixture of two or more thereof is suitably usable. Base oils of Group II have a
 10  viscosity index in a range from 80 to 120, a sulfur content of 0.03 mass% or less and a
     saturated content of 90 mass% or more. Base oils of Group III have a viscosity index of
     120 or more, a sulfur content of 0.03 mass% or less and a saturated content of 90 mass%
     or more. Base oils of Group IV are poly-alpha-olefin (PAO).
               [0029]
 15            The base oil may be a mineral oil or a synthetic oil as long as the base oil has the
     above properties. The mineral oil or the synthetic oil is subject to no particular limitation
     in type or others. Examples of the mineral oils include paraffin-based mineral oils,
    intermediate-based mineral oils and naphthene-based mineral oils that are prepared by
    purifying processes such as solvent purification, hydrogenation purification and
20  hydrocracking.
               Examples of the synthetic oil include poly-alpha-olefin (PAO), alpha-olefin
    copolymer, polybutene, alkylbenzene, polyol ester, dibasic acid ester, polyoxy alkylene
    glycol, polyoxy alkylene glycol ester, polyoxy alkylene glycol ether, hindered ester and
    silicone oil. Further, isomerized products of slack wax and GTL WAX are also usable.
25             Among the above examples, mineral oils prepared by hydrogenation purification,
    mineral oils prepared by hydrocracking, isomerized products of slack wax and GTL WAX
    (i.e., wax-isomerized mineral oils) and poly-alpha-olefin are favorably usable.
               According to the first exemplary embodiment, one of the above mineral oils may
    be used alone or a combination of two or more thereof may be used as the base oil.

                                                     8
       Alternatively, one of the above synthetic oils may be used alone or a combination of two
       or more thereof may be used. Further alternatively, a combination of at least one of the
       above mineral oils and at least one of the above synthetic oils may be used.
                 [0030]
   5   Component (A)
                The component (A) in the present composition is an acrylate compound having a
      mass average molecular weight in a range from 10,000 to 100,000. When the mass
      average molecular weight falls below the above lower limit, the fuel-economy
      performance is deteriorated. When the mass average molecular weight exceeds the above
 10   upper limit, the shear stability of the lubricating oil composition is lowered. The mass
      average molecular weight of the component (A) is preferably in a range from 15,000 to
      80,000, and particularly preferably in a range from 20,000 to 75,000.
                [0031]
               Preferable examples of the polyacrylate compound include poly(meth)acrylate
 15   compounds, among which polymethacrylate (PMA) is preferable. The polymethacrylate
      may be dispersed or non-dispersed.
               In the present composition, one of the above polyacrylate compounds may be
     used alone as the component (A) or a combination of two or more thereof may be used.
               The content of the component (A) is preferably in a range from 0.1 mass% to 20
20   mass%, more preferably in a range from 0.2 mass% to 15 mass%, of the total amount of
     the composition. When the content is equal to or more than the above lower limit, the
     component (A) has a sufficient effect in improving the viscosity index. When the content
     is equal to or less than the above upper limit, the shear stability and piston-cleaning
     performance of the lubricating oil composition are improved.
25             [0032]
     Component (B)
              The phosphorus compound usable as the component (B) of the present
     composition is triaryl phosphate or triaryl thiophosphate represented by a formula (1)
     below.

   5            [0034]
                In the formula (1), R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 4 or less carbon
       atoms and X is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom. In the formula (1), three R may be
       mutually the same or different. Examples of the alkyl group having 4 or less carbon atoms
       include a methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, n-butyl group,
 10   isobutyl group and tertiary butyl group.
                The phosphorus compound represented by the formula (1) preferably has an acid
      number of 10 mg KOH/g or less. When the acid number is 10 mg KOH/g or less, the
      resulting lubricating oil composition exhibits excellent heat resistance and formation of
      sludge can be restrained. The acid number is more preferably 5 mg KOH/g or less and
 15   further more preferably 1 mg KOH/g or less. Incidentally, the acid number is a value
      measured according to JIS K 2501.
               Examples of the phosphorus compound represented by the formula (1) include
     triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, triphenyl thiophosphate, tricresyl thiophosphate,
     mono(di)-t-butyltriphenyl phosphate, and triphenyl phosphorothioate.
20             [0035]
               In the present composition, one of the above phosphorus compounds may be used
     alone as the component (B) or a combination of two or more thereof may be used. The
     content of the component (B) is in a range from 0.05 mass% to 2.0 mass% of the total
     amount of the composition. When the content exceeds 2.0 mass%, the component (B) is
25   unlikely to have a large effect in providing the wear resistance. Similarly, when the
     content is equal to or less than 0.05 mass%, the component (B) is unlikely to have an
     effect in providing the wear resistance. The content is more preferably in a range from 0.1
     mass% to 1.0 mass%.

                 The sulfur compound used as the component (C) in the present composition is
       preferably a dithiophosphate compound represented by a formula (2) below.

 10            In the formula (2), R1 represents a linear or branched alkylene group having 1 to 8
      carbon atoms, and R2 and R3 each represent a hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon
      atoms.
               In the formula (2), when the carbon number of R' is more than 8, the component
      (C) often fails to dissolve in the base oil. In view of the above, R1 is preferably a linear or
15    branched alkylene group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably a linear or branched
      alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and further preferably a branched alkylene

20             When the carbon number of each of R2 and R3 is less than 3 (i.e., a low molecular
     weight), the sulfur compound often fails to adsorb to a metal surface. When the carbon
     number of each of R2 and R3 is more than 8, the sulfur compound often fails to dissolve in
     the base oil. In view of the above, R2 to R3 each preferably represent a linear or branched
     alkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, and more preferably a linear or branched alkyl

   Other Additives
            Further, in order to improve the performance of the present composition, known
   additives such as oiliness agent, dispersant, rust inhibitor, metal deactivator, anticorrosive,
20 antioxidant, demulsifier and antifoaming agent may be blended as needed as long as an
   object of the invention is achieved.
            [0047]
            Examples of the oiliness agent include: saturated or unsaturated aliphatic
   monocarboxylic acids such as stearic acid and oleic acid; dimerized fatty acids such as
25 dimer acid and hydrogenated dimer acid; hydroxy fatty acids such as ricinoleic acid and
   12-hydroxystearic acid; saturated or unsaturated aliphatic monoalcohols such as lauryl
   alcohol and oleyl alcohol; saturated or unsaturated aliphatic monoamines such as
   stearylamine and oleylamine; saturated or unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acid
   amides such as a mixture of an aliphatic secondary amine with a hydrocarbon chain

                                                  15
    having 8 to 18 carbon atoms, lauric acid amide and oleic acid amide; and multivalent fatty
    acid esters such as an oleic acid monoglyceride. The content of the oiliness agent is
    preferably in a range from 0.01 mass% to 10 mass%, more preferably in a range from 0.1

             Examples of the dispersant include succinimide derivatives. One of the above
    dispersants may be used alone or a combination of two or more thereof may be used. This
    component contributes to preventing rust and dispersing sludge. As the succinimide
    derivative, a succinimide having an alkyl group or an alkenyl group in a side chain, which
10  is known as an ashless dispersant, is favorably usable. In particular, a succinimide with a
    side chain that has an alkyl group or an alkenyl group and has a number average molecular
    weight approximately in a range from 500 to 3000 is preferable. When the number
    average molecular weight of the side chain is less than 500, the succinimide is likely to be
    less dispersible in the base oil. On the other hand, when the number average molecular
15 weight of the side chain is more than 3000, the succinimide is difficult to handle in
   preparation of the lubricating oil composition. Further, the viscosity of the composition is
   excessively increased, so that, for instance, the composition may deteriorate the operating
   characteristics of hydraulic equipment or the like where the composition is used.
             [0049]
20           There are a variety of examples of the succinimide, which include a succinimide
   having a polybutenyl group or a polyisobutenyl group. The polybutenyl group is provided
   by polymerizing a mixture of 1-butene and isobutene or a highly pure isobutene or by
   hydrogenating a polyisobutenyl group. Incidentally, the succinimide may be either a so
   called mono-alkenyl/alkyl succinimide or a so-called bis-alkenyl/alkyl succinimide.
25           [0050]
             The succinimide derivative may be further modified with boron in use. For
   instance, a boron-modified polybutenyl succinimide may be provided by adding an
   organic solvent such as alcohols, hexane and xylene with the above polyamine, a
   polybutenyl succinic acid (anhydride) and a boron compound such as a boric acid and

                                                  16
    heating the mixture under appropriate conditions. Incidentally, examples of the boron
    compound include boric anhydride, halogenated boron, borate, amide borate and boron
    oxide in addition to a boric acid. Among the above, a boric acid is particularly preferable.
             [0051]
 5           When the boron-modified succinimide is blended, a boron content is preferably in
    a range from 1 mass ppm to 50 mass ppm, more preferably in a range from 5 mass ppm to
    30 mass ppm, of the total amount of the composition.
             [0052]
             In the first exemplary embodiment, the content of the dispersant is preferably in a
10 range from 0.01 mass% to 1 mass%, more preferably in a range from 0.05 mass% to 0.5
   mass%, of the total amount of the composition.
             Examples of the metal deactivator and the anticorrosive include benzotriazole and
   thiadiazole. The content of these metal deactivators and anticorrosives is preferably
   approximately in a range from 0.005 mass% to 1 mass%, more preferably in a range from
15 0.007 mass% to 0.5 mass%, of the total amount of the composition.
             [0053]
             Examples of the antioxidant include a phenolic antioxidant and an amine
   antioxidant. One of these antioxidants may be used alone or a combination of two or more
   thereof may be used. Examples of the phenolic antioxidant include monophenolic
20 compounds such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl phenol, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-ethyl phenol and
   octadecyl 3-(3.5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate       and diphenolic compounds
   such as 4,4'-methylenebis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol) and 2,2'-methylenebis(4-ethyl-6-tert
   butylphenol).
             Examples of the amine antioxidant include: monoalkyldiphenylamine compounds
25 such as monooctyldiphenylamine and monononyldiphenylamine; dialkyl diphenylamine

   dinonyldiphenylamine;           polyalkyldiphenylamine        compounds          such       as
   tetrabutyldiphenylamine,       tetrahexyldiphenylamine,     tetraoctyldiphenylamine       and

                                               17
   tetranonyldiphenylamine; and naphthylamine compounds such as alpha-naphthylamine,
   phenyl-alpha-naphthylamine,      butylphenyl-alpha-naphthylamine,     pentylphenyl-alpha
   naphthylamine,     hexylphenyl-alpha-naphthylamine,    heptylphenyl-alpha-naphthylamine,
   octylphenyl-alpha-naphthylamine and nonylphenyl-alpha-naphthylamine.

             According to the first exemplary embodiment, one of the above phenolic
   antioxidants may be used alone or a combination of two or more thereof may be used.
   Similarly, one of the above amine antioxidants may be used alone or a combination of two
   or more thereof may be used. Further, one or more of the above phenolic antioxidants and

20           Examples of the antifoaming agent include polymeric-silicone antifoaming agents
   and polyacrylate antifoaming agents. The content of the antifoaming agent is preferably in

25 Lubricating Oil Composition
             The present composition prepared as described above has a viscosity index of 160
   or more. When the viscosity index is less than the above lower limit, the temperature
   dependency of viscosity increases, which is not preferable. Incidentally, the viscosity
   index may be measured according to JIS K 2283. The viscosity index is preferably 165 or

                                                    18
     more.
                 [0057]
                The present composition exhibits good heat resistance to restrain formation of
     sludge, and is excellent in wear resistance such as scoring resistance and in fuel-economy
  5  performance. The present composition is thus suitably usable as a hydraulic oil for
     construction machines, a hydraulic oil for industrial machines, a hydraulic oil for
     windmills, a hydraulic oil for machine tools, a turbine oil, a compressor oil, and an oil
     agent for shock absorbers, contributing to enhancing device efficiency. Especially, the
     present composition improves a flow rate per unit time, and thus is greatly effective for a
 10  device whose performance depends on a flow rate. Since exhibiting an excellent shear
     stability and reducing formation of sludge in use, the present composition is durable for a
     long-term use. Further, the present composition exhibits high extreme pressure properties,
     and thus is highly effective in preventing pump seizure.

      the composition.
                The present composition of the second exemplary embodiment is the same as that
      of the first exemplary embodiment except the component (C), and thus further description
      of the second exemplary embodiment is omitted.
  5             It should be noted that when a combination of the component (C) and the
     component (B) is employed, the content of the component (B) is preferably in a range
     from 0.05 mass% to 0.5 mass% of the total amount of the composition.

   Evaluation Results
            As is evident from Tables 1 and 2, the sample oils of Examples 1 to 6, each of
   which contains all the compositional elements according to the invention, are excellent in
   wear resistance (FZG scoring resistance, static friction coefficient), heat resistance (the
10 amount of sludge) and a fuel-economy performance (overall pump efficiency).
            In contrast, Comparatives 1 and 2, which lack some of the compositional
   elements according to the invention, are inferior in performance to Examples.
