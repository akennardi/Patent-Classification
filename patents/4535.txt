                               ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
         A surgical kit includes at least one instrument and at least one implant device. The
instrument has a needle body used to form a surgical passage through ocular tissue. The device
includes a flexible tube that defines a duct for diverting aqueous humor with an outer surface
having a maximal cross-sectional dimension that is less than the maximal cross-sectional
dimension of the needle body. The device incorporates sealing means including at least one
element that define a maximal cross-sectional dimension that is greater that the maximal cross
sectional dimension of the needle body and that are operably disposed within the surgical
passage and form a seal between the surrounding ocular tissue and the element(s) as well as
fixate the device in the surgical passage. The kit (and devices thereof) can be used as part of a
surgical method to divert aqueous humor to a space formed in ocular tissue.

          METHOD, SURGICAL KIT AND DEVICE FOR TREATING GLAUCOMA
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
[0001]       The present invention relates to surgical treatment of glaucoma. More particularly,
this invention relates to medical devices and materials for diverting aqueous humor out of the
anterior chamber through a surgically implanted duct passageway.
2. State of the Art
[0002]       Glaucoma is a progressive ocular disease that manifests itself through elevated
intraocular pressure ("IOP"). High pressure develops in an eye because of impaired outflow of
aqueous humor. In open-angle glaucoma, the impaired outflow is caused by abnormalities of
the drainage system of the anterior chamber. In closed-angle glaucoma, the impaired outflow is
caused by impaired access of aqueous to the drainage system. If the pressure within the eye
remains sufficiently high for a long enough period of time, total vision loss occurs. Thus,
glaucoma is a leading cause of preventable blindness.
[0003]       As shown in Fig. 1, the eye 10 is a hollow structure wherein the anterior chamber 20
contains a clear fluid called aqueous humor. Aqueous humor is formed by the ciliary body 12
adjacent the posterior chamber 9 of the eye. The fluid, which is made at a fairly constant rate,
then passes around the lens 14, through the pupillary opening in the iris 18 and into the anterior
chamber 20. Once in the anterior chamber 20, the fluid drains out of the eye 10 through two
different routes. In the uveoscleral route, the fluid percolates between muscle fibers of the
ciliary body 12. This route accounts for approximately ten percent of the aqueous outflow in
humans. The primary pathway for aqueous outflow in humans is through the canalicular route,
which involves the trabecular meshwork (not shown) and Schlemm's canal 24.
[0004]       The trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal 24 are located at the junction
between the iris 18 and the sclera 26. This junction, which is typically referred to as the angle,
is labeled 28. The trabecular meshwork is a wedge-shaped structure that runs around the
circumference of the eye. It is composed of collagen beams arranged in a three-dimensional
sieve-like structure. The beams are lined with a monolayer of cells called trabecular cells. The
spaces between the collagen beams are filled with an extracellular substance that is produced by

                                                  2
the trabecular cells. These cells also produce enzymes that degrade the extracellular material.
Schlemm's canal 24 is disposed adjacent to the trabecular meshwork. The outer wall of the
trabecular meshwork coincides with the inner wall of Schlemm's canal 24. Schlemm's canal 24
is a tube-like structure that runs around the circumference of the cornea. In human adults,
Schlemm's canal is believed to be divided by septa into a series of autonomous, dead-end
canals. The aqueous fluid travels through the spaces between the trabecular beams of the
trabecular meshwork, across the inner wall of Schlemm's canal 24 into the canal, through a
series of collecting channels that drain from Schlemm's canal 24 and into the episcleral venous
system (not shown).
[0005]       The tough outer membrane known as the sclera 26 covers all of the eye 10 except
that portion covered by the cornea 34, which is the thin, transparent membrane which covers
the pupillary opening and the iris 18. The cornea 34 merges into the sclera 26 at a juncture
referred to as the limbus 32. A portion of the sclera 26 is covered by a thin tissue called
Tenon's membrane 36 (also called Tenon's capsule), which envelopes the bulb of the eye from
the optic nerve (not shown) to the ciliary region. Near its front, Tenon's membrane 36 blends
into the conjunctiva 30 where it is attached to the ciliary region of the eye as shown.
[0006]       In a normal patient, aqueous humor production is equal to aqueous humor outflow
and intraocular pressure remains fairly constant (typically in the 8 to 18 mmHg range). In
glaucoma, there is abnormal resistance to aqueous humor outflow, which manifests itself as
increased IOP. Tonometry is the measurement of IOP. In primary open angle glaucoma, which
is the most common form of glaucoma, the abnormal resistance is believed to be along the outer
aspect of trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm's canal 24. Primary open angle
glaucoma accounts for approximately eighty-five percent of all glaucoma. Other forms of
glaucoma (such as angle closure glaucoma and secondary glaucomas) also involve decreased
aqueous humor outflow through the canalicular pathway but the increased resistance is from
other causes such as mechanical blockage, inflammatory debris, cellular blockage, etc.
[0007]       With the increased resistance, the aqueous humor builds up because it cannot exit
fast enough. As the aqueous humor builds up, the IOP within the eye increases. The increased
IOP compresses the axons in the optic nerve and also may compromise the vascular supply to
the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries vision from the eye to the brain. Some eyes seem more
susceptible to damage from excessive IOP than other eyes. While research is investigating ways

                                                    3
to protect the nerve from an elevated pressure, the therapeutic approach currently available in
glaucoma is to reduce the intraocular pressure.
[0008]        The clinical treatment of glaucoma is typically carried out in a step-wise manner.
Medication often is the first treatment option. Administered either topically or orally, these
medications work to either reduce aqueous production or they act to increase outflow. If one
medication fails, the patient is oftentimes given a second medication and then a third and
fourth. It is not unusual to have glaucoma patients on four separate medications. Currently
available medications have many serious side effects including: congestive heart failure,
respiratory distress, hypertension, depression, renal stones, aplastic anemia, sexual dysfunction
and death. In addition, the preservatives in various medications are known to cause damage to
the endothelial cells underlying the cornea which can manifest as opacification of the cornea.
Further, the preservatives can also change the characteristics of the conjunctiva which can lead
to additional filtration problems. Compliance with medication is a also a major problem, with
estimates that over half of glaucoma patients do not follow their correct dosing schedules which
can lead to progressive vision loss.
[0009]        When medication fails to adequately reduce the IOP, laser trabeculoplasty is often
performed. In laser trabeculoplasty, thermal energy from a laser is applied to a number of
noncontiguous spots in the trabecular meshwork. It is believed that the laser energy stimulates
the metabolism of the trabecular cells in some way, and changes the cellular material in the
trabecular meshwork. In a large percent of patients, aqueous humor outflow is enhanced and
IOP decreases. However, the effect often does not last long and a significant percentage of
patients develop an elevated IOP within the years that follow the treatment. The laser
trabeculoplasty treatment is typically not repeatable. In addition, laser trabeculoplasty is not an
effective treatment for primary open angle glaucoma in patients less than fifty years of age, nor
is it effective for angle closure glaucoma and many secondary glaucomas.
[0010]        If laser trabeculoplasty does not reduce the IOP sufficiently, then incisional surgery
(typically referred to as filtering surgery) is performed. The most commonly performed
incisional procedure is trabeculectomy. The trabeculectomy procedure involves cutting a
"trapdoor" in the sclera and then from within the wall of the trapdoor, punching a hole into the
anterior chamber which allows fluid to drain from the anterior chamber into the trapdoor, out
the "door" of the trapdoor and then into a bleb (a blister-like formation) under the conjunctiva,

                                                   4
thereby decreasing IOP. Sutures are placed under controlled tension to keep the door of the
trapdoor sufficiently closed in order to control IOP and avoid hypotony (i.e., low IOP). This
procedure is relatively difficult to perform correctly and has a high level of long-term
complications. Additional interventions often need to be performed to adjust the tension in the
sutures to further control IOP.
[0011]      When trabeculectomy doesn't successfully lower the eye pressure, the next step, and
usually the last, is a surgical procedure that implants a glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) that
shunts aqueous humor from the anterior chamber to control the IOP. One such GDI, as shown
in U.S. Patent 6,050,970 to Baerveldt, is a drainage tube that is attached at one end to a plastic
plate. The drainage tube is comprised of a silicone rubber shunt with an outer diameter of
between 1.0 and 3.0 French; preferably with an inner diameter of 0.3mm and an outer diameter
of 0.6mm (1.8 French). The Baerveldt tube is implanted by first making an incision in the
conjunctiva 30, exposing the sclera 26 and the natural plane between the sclera and
conjunctiva/Tenon's membrane is dissected down to slightly beyond the equator. The plastic
plate is sewn to the surface of the sclera posteriorly, usually over the equator. A full thickness
hole is made into the eye under the limbus 32, usually with a needle. The tube is inserted into
the eye through this needle tract. The external portion of the tube is covered with either cadaver
sclera or other equivalent tissue to prevent it from eroding through the conjunctiva. The
conjunctiva 30 is replaced and the incision is closed tightly. With this shunt device, aqueous
drains out of the anterior chamber through the tube and along the surface of the plate and into
the bleb, where the bleb is defined as a thin layer of connective tissue that encapsulates the
plate and tube. The plate typically has a large surface area, which can be as large as 20mm in
diameter, in order to wick and disperse fluid. Once fluid accumulates in the bleb, it can absorb
through the tissues of the bleb and into the venous system of the sclera or to the surface of the
eye where it can evaporate or collect in the tear ducts. These plates are generally made of
silicone rubber, which eventually becomes encapsulated by the connective tissue of the bleb.
These large encapsulated plates are irritating to some patients.
[0012]       Some of the current approved GDIs include valving of the tube that enters the
anterior chamber of the eye in order to control IOP and avoid hypotony. In addition, many
GDI's including the aforementioned Baerveldt valve have their tubes tied off to prevent
hypotony in the acute phase before capsules form around the device. The ligating sutures are
then cleaved with a laser or dissolve within a month.

                                                 5
[0013]       Current GDIs have an effective half life of two to five years from implantation
before a second, third or fourth GDI is required. Due to the bulky size of current GDIs, there is
room for only three devices in the eye; rarely is a fourth device implanted. The problems
associated with current generation GDIs are:
         - Impairment of eye motion and resulting double vision (diplopia).
         - Hypotony (low IOP which could result in a detached retina).
         - Erosion of conjunctiva and infection and associated high costs of using a cadaver
sclera to prevent erosion. Furthermore, cadaver sclera is difficult to obtain outside the U.S.
and several religions do not permit the use of cadaver tissue in the body.
         - Severe encapsulation of the plate which prevents proper filtering of fluid and leads to
poor IOP control.
[0014]       The difficulty of performing trabeculectomies and GDI's as well as their associated
morbidities led to development of a novel glaucoma drainage implant described in U.S. Patents
7,431,709; 7,594,899; and 7,837,644; commonly assigned to assignee of the present invention
and herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0015]       In one embodiment, a kit is provided for treating glaucoma which includes at least
one hand-held instrument and at least one aqueous humor drainage device. The hand-held
instrument has a needle body that is inserted through ocular tissue into the anterior chamber of
the eye to define a passage through the ocular tissue leading to the anterior chamber. It is also
contemplated that the entrance through the ocular tissue can be selectively widened by means
of a stab wound or by manipulation of the tip of the needle body to better accommodate the
aqueous humor drainage device. The needle body has a maximal cross-sectional dimension
(e.g., diameter D1 of FIG. 5) along its length.
[0016]       The aqueous humor drainage device includes a flexible tube that defines a duct for
diverting aqueous humor from the anterior chamber. The tube has a proximal end and distal
end opposite one another. The distal end can have a tapered profile that facilitates insertion into
the passage leading to the anterior chamber formed by the needle body. The tube's outer

                                                  6
surface has a maximal cross-sectional dimension (e.g., the outer diameter D2 of FIG. 7) that is
less than the maximal cross-sectional dimension of the needle body (e.g., diameter D1 of FIG.
5). The device also incorporates sealing means that includes at least one element that is spaced
apart from the proximal and distal ends of the tube and that extends radially outward beyond
the outer surface of the tube. The element(s) define a maximal cross-sectional dimension that is
greater that the maximal cross-sectional dimension of the needle body (e.g., outer diameter D1
of FIG. 5). The element(s) are operably disposed within the passage defined by the needle
body, and their relative dimensions cause the surrounding ocular tissue to directly contact the
element(s) in order to form a seal between the surrounding tissue and the element(s). The seal
surrounds the entire circumferential perimeter of the device defined by the element(s) and seal
prevents leakage of aqueous humor through the space between the tube and the surrounding
ocular tissue. The element(s) of the sealing means also act to fix the device in place in the
passage and minimize migration of the device in both the proximal and distal directions. The
maximum cross-sectional diameter of the element(s) of the sealing means is defined by at least
one blunt surface to facilitate sealing.
[0017]       In one embodiment, the element(s) of the sealing means is realized by two tabs that
are disposed opposite one another on opposite sides of the tube. The two tabs can be generally
planar in form and lie in a common plane that extends transverse to the central axis of the tube.
The generally co-planar configuration of the tabs minimizes the profile of the device in order to
reduce erosion and migration of the device. The two tabs can be mirror images of one another
reflected about the central axis of the tube. The outer edges of the tabs can have a tapered
profile facing the distal end of the tube. This tapered profile facilitates introduction of the tabs
into the passage formed by the needle body. The tabs can have a profile that tapers in the radial
direction (i.e., the direction of the common plane of the two tabs) transverse to the central axis
of the tube.
[0018]       In one embodiment, the instruments of the kit (including at least one hand-held
instrument and at least one aqueous humor drainage device) are housed in one or more
enclosures that provide the surgeon easy access to the instruments as needed. The enclosure(s)
can be realized from suitable material (such as a thermoplastic) that is inexpensive and readily
disposable for one-time use. Other materials (such as stainless steel and the like) suitable for
non-disposable applications can also be used.

                                                   7
[0019]      An inserter can be used to deploy the device into the passage leading to the anterior
chamber formed by the needle body. The inserter can be realized by an apparatus similar to
that described in U.S. Patents 7,431,7091; 7,594,899; and 7,837,644 with one or two slots that
accommodate the tabs of the device. Alternatively, the inserter can be realized by a stylet
and/or a trocar device as described below. In such embodiments, the inserter can be part of the
instrument kit housed in the enclosure.
[0020]      In another embodiment, one or more elements of the kit can be used as part of a
surgical method to divert aqueous humor to a pocket region formed in the ocular tissue (such as
a pocket formed between the conjuctiva-sclera and Tenon's membrane).

             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0044]      As used herein, the term "distal" is generally defined as in the direction of the eye of
the patient, or away from a user of the system/apparatus/device. Conversely, "proximal"
generally means in the direction away from the eye of the patient, or toward the user of the
system/apparatus/device.
[0045]      Turning now to FIGS. 2 and 3, there is shown an embodiment of a kit for treating
glaucoma, which includes at least one hand-held instrument 101 (FIG. 2) and at least one
aqueous humor drainage device 201 (FIG. 3). The instrument 101 has a needle body 103 that is
inserted through ocular tissue into the anterior chamber 20 of the eye (FIG. 1) to define a
passage through the tissue leading into the anterior chamber 20. The needle body 103 has a
maximal cross-sectional dimension (e.g., diameter D1 of FIG. 5) along its length. The proximal
end of the needle body 103 is rigidly coupled to a hub 105. A handle 107 is rigidly coupled to
the hub 105. The handle 107 is gripped by the fingers of the surgeon for manipulation of the
needle body 103 as desired. A needle cover 109 can extend over the needle body 103 for
safety. The needle body 103 can have a hollow-bore (or possibly a solid bore). The hub 105

                                                   10
and the handle 107 can be realized by a syringe body that includes a plunger that fits inside a
tube as is well known. A solution can be loaded into the tube and pumped through the hollow
bore needle body 103 by hand manipulation of the plunger. In addition, the needle body may
be bent into a more desirable shape to precisely place the needle tract, especially when the
patient's nose is in the way of the needle handle.
[0046]      The aqueous humor drainage device 201 includes a flexible tube 203 that defines a
duct 205 for diverting aqueous humor from the anterior chamber 20. The tube 203 has a
proximal end 207 and distal end 209 opposite one another. The distal end 209 can have a
tapered profile that facilitates insertion into the passage leading to the anterior chamber 20
formed by the needle body 103. The tube's outer surface 211 has a maximal cross-sectional
dimension (e.g., outer diameter D2 of FIG. 7) that is less than the maximal cross-sectional
dimension of the needle body 103 (e.g., diameter D1 of FIG. 5). The device 201 also includes
first and second tabs or fins 213A, 213B that are spaced apart from the proximal and distal ends
207, 209 of the tube 203. The tabs 213A, 213B extend radially outward beyond the outer
surface 211 of the tube 203 opposite one another on opposing sides of the tube 203. The first
and second tabs 213A, 213B can be generally planar in form and lie in a common plane that
extends transverse to the central axis of the tube 203 as best shown in FIG. 3. The generally co
planar configuration of the tabs 213A, 213B, when placed flat against the sclera of the eye,
minimizes the profile of the device in order to reduce erosion and migration. The first and
second tabs 213A, 213B can be mirror images of one another reflected about the central axis of
the tube 203 as shown. Tab 213A defines an outer edge 215A, and tab 213B defines an outer
edge 215B. The maximal distance between the outer edge 215A and the outer edge 215B define
a maximal cross-sectional dimension that is greater that the maximal cross-sectional dimension
of the needle body 103 (e.g., outer diameter D1 of FIG. 5). The tabs 213A, 213B are operably
disposed within the passage defined by the needle body 103 and their dimensions cause the
surrounding tissue to directly contact the tabs 213A, 213B in order to form a seal between the
surrounding tissue and the tabs 213A, 213B. The seal surrounds the entire circumferential
perimeter of the device defined by the tabs 213A, 213B and prevents leakage of aqueous humor
through the space between the tube 203 and the surrounding tissue. The needle-defined passage
can also be widened in the scleral area with the use of a sharp knife and associated stab wound.
The widened part can be formed either before or after formation of the needle-defined passage.
The tabs 213A, 213B can deform in the passage as they are inserted into the passage in

                                                  11
response to forces applied by the surrounding tissue, and/or the surrounding tissue can deform
(by compressing/stretching/thinning) as the tabs 213A, 213B are inserted into the passage.
Such deformation is controlled by the maximal cross-sectional dimension of the tabs 213A,
213B relative to the cross-sectional dimension of the passage (as formed by the needle body
103 or stab wound) as well as the hardness of the material of the tabs 213A, 213B. The tabs
213A, 213B also act to fix the device 201 in place in the passage and minimize migration of the
device 201 in both the proximal and distal directions.
[0047]        The outer edges 215A, 215B of the tabs 213A, 213B can have a tapered profile
facing the distal end 209 as best shown on FIG. 3. This tapered profile facilitates introduction
of the tabs 213A, 213B into the passage formed by the needle body 103.
[0048]        The tabs 213A, 213B can have respective profiles that taper in the radial direction
(i.e., the direction of the common plane of the tabs) transverse to and away from the central axis
of the tube 203 as best shown in FIG. 3.
[0049]        The outer surface 211 of the tube 203 has a maximal cross-sectional dimension (e.g.,
outer diameter D2) that is less than the maximal cross-sectional dimension of the needle body
103. For example, the outer surface 211 can have an outer diameter D2 less than 0.4mm (such
as on the order of 0.35mm) for a needle body 103 with a maximal cross-sectional dimension of
0.4mm. In one embodiment, the duct 205 of the tube 203 is a simple constant-diameter lumen
with a diameter in the range between 0.05mm and 0.15mm. This small duct diameter limits
aqueous humor flow through the tube 203 and provides for control over IOP without the need
for unidirectional valves or other structures (such as filters) that limit aqueous humor flow
through the tube. More specifically, the diameter of the duct 205 alone controls the flow rate of
aqueous humor through the duct 205 and thus controls the IOP of the patient. The appropriate
duct diameter can vary among patients depending on the production rate of aqueous humor and
the extent of clogging of the natural drainage paths of the patient and thus can be selected by
the physician as desired.

[0050]      In one embodiment, the instruments of a kit, including at least one hand-held
instrument 101 (FIG. 2) and at least one aqueous humor drainage device 201 (FIG. 3) as
described herein, are housed in one or more enclosures, such as an instrument tray 401 as
shown in FIG. 4, that provides the surgeon easy access to the instruments as needed. The
instrument tray 401 can be realized from suitable material (such as a thermoplastic) that is
inexpensive and readily disposable for one-time use. Other materials (such as stainless steel
and the like) suitable for non-disposable applications can also be used. The kit can include a
plurality of hand-held instruments 101 (FIG. 2) with needle bodies of different diameters and/or
a plurality of aqueous humor drainage devices 201 (FIG. 3) with tube ducts and/or tabs of
different sizes (for example, a plurality of devices 201 with different tab sizes that correspond
to varying needle body diameters of the instruments 101 of the kit). In addition, to effected the
stab incision, knives of different diameters (discussed hereinafter with respect to FIGS. 18A
and 18B) can be included in the kit as well as measuring devices, medications, sponges to apply
medication, measuring devices, markers, syringes, rinsing fluid, trocars, inserters and the like.
[0051]      An inserter can be used to deploy the device 201 into the passage leading to the
anterior chamber 20 formed by the needle body 103. The inserter can be realized by an
apparatus similar to that described in U.S. Patents 7,431,709, 7,594,899, and 7,837,644 with
one or two slots that accommodate the tabs 213A, 213B of the device 201. Alternatively, the
inserter can be realized by a stylet and/or a trocar device as described below. In such
embodiments, the inserter can be part of the instrument kit housed in the tray 401.
[0052]      FIG. 5 shows the dimensions of an exemplary embodiment of the needle body 103.
In this exemplary embodiment, the needle body 103 has an outer diameter D1 of 0.4 mm (i.e.,
27 gauge). Other suitable outer diameters D1 can be in the range from 0.4mm (i.e., 27 gauge)
to 0.635mm (i.e., 23 gauge). The needle body 103 can also be provided bent into a desirable
shape to allow the needle to be inserted into the eye at an angle that, if not bent, would interfere
with the patient's nose.
[0053]      FIGS. 6 and 7 shows the dimensions of an exemplary embodiment of an aqueous
humor drainage device 201 for use with the needle body 103 of FIG. 5. The tube 203 has a
length of 8.5mm. The duct 205 has a diameter of 0.07mm. The outer surface 211 has a
maximal cross sectional diameter (diameter D2) of 0.35mm, which is less than the outer

                                                  13
diameter D1 of the needle body 103. The tabs 213A, 213B are spaced by 4.5mm from the
distal end 209 of the tube 203 and spaced by 3mm from the proximal end 207 of the tube 203.
The tabs 213A, 213B are generally planar in form and lie in a common plane that extends
transverse to the central axis of the tube 203. The tabs 213A, 213B are mirror images of one
another reflected about the central axis of the tube 203 as shown. The planar form of the first
and second tabs 213A, 213B has a maximal thickness on the order of 0.35mm (i.e., the outer
diameter D2 of the tube 203), a lengthwise dimension of 1mm parallel to the central axis of the
tube 203, and a maximal cross-sectional dimension between the edges 215A, 215B of 1.1mm.
In other designs, the maximal cross-sectional dimension between the edges 215A, 215B can be
in the range between 0.9mm and 1.5mm. Such maximal cross-sectional dimension is
significantly larger than the outer diameter D1 of 0.4mm for the needle body 103 of FIG. 5.
[0054]      FIGS. 8 to 14B illustrate alternate designs for the tabs of the implantable aqueous
humor drainage device. In the design of FIG. 8, the tabs 213A1, 213B1 have a profile that
tapers in the radial direction transverse to the central axis of the tube 203 where the tapered
radial surfaces of the tabs extend from a flat feature 217. In the design of FIG. 9, the tabs
213A2, 213B2 are parts of a triangular wedged-shaped body 219 disposed along the lengthwise
extent of the tube 203. The proximal walls 221A, 221B of the wedge-shaped body 219 are
oriented transverse to the central axis of the tube 203, which is intended to aid in reducing
migration of the tube 203 in the proximal direction out of the passage formed by the instrument
101. In the design of FIG. 10, the tabs 213A3, 213B3 have proximal walls 223A, 223B that are
oriented transverse to the central axis of the tube 203, which is intended to aid in reducing
migration of the tube 203 in the proximal direction out of the passage formed by the instrument
101. In the design of FIG. 11, the tabs 213A4, 213B4 each have a curved wedge-shaped form.
In the design of FIG. 12A, the tabs 213A5, 213B5 and tube 203 define a cross-sectional profile
of rhombus with radiused comers (in particular, the rhombus profile tapers in the radial
direction transverse to and away from the central axis of the tube 203). The tapered surfaces of
the tabs 213A5, 213B5 extend from the annular surface of the tube 203 as shown. In the design
of FIG. 12B, the tabs 213A6, 213B6 define a cross-sectional profile of an oblong with
semicircular ends as shown. Alternatively, the tabs 213A6, 213B6 can define a cross-sectional
profile of an oblong with semielliptical ends. In the design of FIG. 12C, the tabs 213A7,
213B7 define a cross-sectional profile of an ellipse whose boundary is offset radially from and
surrounds the annular surface of the tube 203. In the design of FIG. 12D, the tabs 213A8,

                                                   14
213B8 define a cross-sectional profile of a larger radius ellipse (as compared to the elliptical
profile of FIG. 12C) whose boundary is offset radially from and surrounds the annular surface
of the tube 203.
[0055]       In the design of FIGS. 13A and 13B, a cork-like tab 213' is provided that extends
circumferentially beyond the annular surface of the tube 203. The cork-like tab 213' has a
cross-sectional profile of a circle as is evident from the view of FIG. 13B.
[0056]       In the design of FIGS. 14A and 14B, a generally planar tab 213" is provided that
extends circumferentially beyond the annular surface of the tube 203. The generally planar tab
213" has a cross-sectional oblong profile as is evident from the view of FIG. 14B.
[0057]       The outer surface(s) of the tab(s) of the device 201 can be blunt with rounded
features as shown, and thus avoid any sharp corners and edges. The blunt outer surface(s) of
the tab(s) is particularly suited to forming a seal to the surrounding tissue as described herein.
[0058]       In the design of FIG. 11, a slit 225 is formed in the tabs 213A, 213B in a manner
such that the slit 225 transects the lumen 205 of the aqueous humor drainage device 205. The
slit 225 is positioned proximal to that part of the tabs 213A, 213B that forms the seal to the
surrounding tissue (i.e., the blunt exterior edges of the tabs 213A, 213B at their maximal radial
distance with respect to the central axis of the tube 203). The purpose of the slit 225 is two
fold. First, the slit 225 can act as a pressure relief valve in the event the lumen 205 of the
aqueous humor drainage device 205 becomes clogged downstream due to overgrowth of tissue
in the bleb. The elastomeric nature of the aqueous humor drainage device 205 is such that as
pressure builds up within the lumen 205, the slit 225 can deform into an open state where
aqueous humor is released into the bleb thereby reducing pressure in the anterior chamber. The
second advantage of the slit 225 is to deliberately accomplish the same purpose; that is to
relieve pressure in the anterior chamber. In order to effectuate this release, the lumen 205
downstream from the slit 225 is sealed closed thereby forcing fluid to escape through the slit
225. The length and width of the slit 225 controls the pressure at which aqueous humor escapes
and can be tailored to prevent hypotony. The aqueous humor escapes through the slit 225 and
flows proximally in the space between the surrounding tissue and the outer surface of the
proximal part of the tube 203. Fluid that escapes through the slit 225 will have its pressure
dropped by both the narrow lumen 205 of the distal part of tube 203 as well as the slit 225.

                                                   15
Periannular leakage of aqueous humor in the space between the surrounding tissue and the
outer surface of the distal part of the tube 203 is blocked by the seal formed by the tabs 213A,
213B. More specifically, the blunt exterior edges of the tabs 213A, 213B at their maximal
radial offset with respect to the central axis of the tube 203 forms a seal with the surrounding
tissue that blocks such periannular leakage of aqueous humors.
[0059]       The aqueous humor drainage device 201 can be formed of a homogenous polymeric
material. In one embodiment, the homogenous polymeric material is a polyolefinic copolymer
material having a triblock polymer backbone comprising polystyrene-polyisobutylene
polystyrene, which is herein referred to as "SIBS". SIBS can also be referred to as
poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene) where b stands for "block". High molecular weight
polyisobutylene (PIB) is a soft elastomeric material with a Shore hardness of approximately
1OA to 30A. When copolymerized with polystyrene, it can be made at hardnesses ranging up to
the hardness of polystyrene, which has a Shore hardness of 1OOD. Thus, depending on the
relative amounts of styrene and isobutylene, the SIBS material can have a range of hardnesses
from as soft as Shore 10A to as hard as Shore 1OOD. In this manner, the SIBS material can be
adapted to have the desired elastomeric and hardness qualities. In the preferred embodiment,
the SIBS material of the aqueous humor drainage device tube 201 has a hardness less than
Shore 50A and greater than Shore 20A. Details of the SIBS material is set forth in U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,741,331; 6,102,939; 6,197,240; 6,545,097, which are hereby incorporated by reference
in their entirety. The SIBS material of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 may be
polymerized under control means using carbocationic polymerization techniques such as those
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,276,394; 4,316,973; 4,342,849; 4,910,321; 4,929,683;
4,946,899; 5,066,730; 5,122,572; and Re 34,640, each herein incorporated by reference in its
entirety. The amount of styrene in the copolymer material is preferably between 16 mole %
and 30 mole % and most preferably between 20 mole % and 27 mole%. The styrene and
isobutylene copolymer materials are preferably copolymerized in solvents.
[0060]       Alternative glassy segments to the aforementioned styrene can be used to realize the
aqueous humor drainage device 201. The glassy segment provides a hardener component for
the elastomeric polyisobutylene. The glassy segment preferably does not contain any cleavable
group which will release in the presence of body fluid inside the human eye and cause toxic
side effects and cell encapsulation. The glassy segment can be a vinyl aromatic polymer (such
as styrene, a-methylstyrene, or a mixture thereof), or a methacrylate polymer (such as

                                                  16
methylmethacrylate, ethylmethacrylate, hydroxymethalcrylate, or a mixture thereof). Such
materials preferably have a general block structure with a central elastomeric polyolefinic block
and thermoplastic end blocks. Such materials have a general structure:
                BAB or ABA (linear triblock),
                B(AB)n or a(BA)n (linear alternating block), or
                X-(AB)n or X-(BA)n (includes diblock, triblock and other radial block
                copolymers), where A is an elastomeric polyolefinic block, B is a thermoplastic
                block, n is a positive whole number and X is a starting seed molecule.
Such materials may be star-shaped block copolymers (where n=3 or more) or multi-dendrite
shaped block copolymers. In addition to the glassy segments, crosslinkers can be incorporated
into the polymer to provide a thermal-set version of SIBS. Exemplary polymers incorporating
these crosslinkers are described in detail in U.S. Patent Publication 20090124773, herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety. These materials collectively belong to the polymeric
material referred to herein as SIBS material.
[0061]      Other polymeric materials can be used to provide aqueous drainage device 201
according to this invention. Exemplary materials are flexible materials that can conform to the
surface of the eye and include but are not limited to silicone rubber, polyolefins (butyl rubber,
polybutadiene, styrene-ethylene-propylene-butadiene, polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.)
polyurethane (polyether urethanes, polycarbonate urethanes, polyurethanes containing
polyisobutylene or other polyolefin soft segments, etc.); acrylics (polyacrylates, poly(2
hydroxyethylmethacrylate), etc.), fluoropolymers (PTFE, ePTFE, fluorosilicones, poly(-CH2
CF2)-, etc.), polyamides, hydrogels, biological based structures such as those comprised of
collagen, elastin, etc.; and blends of all the above materials as well as soft foams and porous
polymer materials can be used to realize the aqueous humor drainage device 201. The
polymeric material should be biocompatible and biostable within the ocular environment.
[0062]      The entire aqueous humor drainage device 201 can be formed as a unitary part by
molding the polymeric material. It is also contemplated that the polymeric material of the tabs
213A, 213B can be different from the polymeric material of the tube 203. This can be
accomplished by insert molding techniques or other suitable thermoplastic forming techniques.

                                                 17
The hardnesses of the tabs 213A, 213B can be the same as the tube 203, or they can differ from
the tube 203. In one embodiment, the hardnesses of the tabs 213A, 213B are within the range
between Shore 30A and Shore 80A.
[0063]       Turning now to FIG. 15, there is shown the aqueous humor drainage device 201
implanted such that its distal end 209 is positioned within the anterior chamber 20 of the eye
and its proximal end 207 is positioned in a pouch 300 formed between Tenon's membrane 36
and the sclera 26 (FIG. 1). The pouch 300 defines a closed space between Tenon's membrane
36 and the sclera 26 (FIG. 1). The duct 205 of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 shunts
aqueous humor from the anterior chamber 20 to the pouch 300, which forms a shallow bleb.
Aqueous humor is absorbed into the adjacent tissue and ends up in the venous system in the eye
or in the tear film or simply evaporates from the outside of the conjunctiva once it reaches such.
[0064]       The pouch 300 can extend rearward from a location at or near the limbus to the
posterior portion of the globe of the eye near or past the equator of the eye. The pouch 300 can
be defined by making an incision through the conjunctiva or Tenon's membrane 36 to the
surface of the sclera and then dissecting and separating Tenon's membrane 36 from the sclera
26 (FIG. 1) over the area of the pouch 300. If the hinge from the pouch is in the fornix of the
eye, this type of pouch is known as a fornix-based pouch. If the hinge is at the limbus and the
incision in the fornix, this type of pouch is known as a limbus-based pouch. The distal end 209
of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 is inserted through a needle-formed passage through
the angle 28 to the anterior chamber 20 of the eye. The device 201 is advanced further into the
passage such that tabs 213A, 213B (only tab 213A is shown in FIG. 15) are positioned within
the passage. The dimensions of the tabs 213A, 213B cause the surrounding tissue to directly
contact the tabs 213A, 213B in order to form a seal between the surrounding tissue and the tabs
213A, 213B. The seal surrounds the entire circumferential perimeter of the device defined by
the tabs 2213A, 213B and prevents leakage of aqueous humor through the space between the
tube 203 and the surrounding tissue. The tabs 213A, 213B can deform in the passage as they
are inserted into the passage in response to forces applied by the surrounding tissue, and/or the
surrounding tissue can deform (by stretching/thinning) as the tabs 213A, 213B are inserted into
the passage. Such deformation is controlled by the maximal cross-sectional dimension of the
tabs 213A, 213B relative to the cross-sectional dimension of the passage (as formed by the
needle body 103) as well as the hardness of the material of the tabs 213A, 213B. The tabs
213A, 213B also act to fix the tube 203 in place in the passage and minimize migration of the

                                                   18
tube 203 in both the proximal and distal directions. After proper positioning of the device 201,
the pouch 300 is closed. A sponge, blotting paper or other suitable carrier loaded with an anti
proliferative agent can be placed within the pouch 300 before it is closed. The anti-proliferative
agent may be, for example, mitomycin C or 5-Fuorouracil or other antimetabolites or other
suitable drug(s) or compound(s) that releases immediately or over time and functions to
minimize fibrosis of the conjuctiva-sclera to Tenon's membrane, thereby maintaining the
structure of the pouch 300 over an extended period of time. Alternatively, a collagen sponge or
other space-filler structure or fluid can be placed in the pouch to prevent healing of the
conjunctiva/Tenon's membrane to the sclera. Aqueous humor flows from the anterior chamber
20 through the duct 205 of the device 203 and into the sealed pouch 300. The sealed pouch 300
prevents bacteria from entering the device 201 and infecting the eye. Aqueous humor exiting
the device 201 and entering the sealed pouch 300 creates a very shallow bleb. The bleb fluid
may filter through the conjunctiva 30 (FIG. 1) into the tears or evaporate therefrom, and the
fluid may be absorbed through the lymphatic system and capillaries that interpenetrate the
conjunctiva 30 (FIG. 1). A fraction of the aqueous humor contained in the bleb may potentially
seep through the permeable sclera 26 and be absorbed by the choroidal capillaries.
[0065]       The aqueous humor drainage device 201 can be implanted into the position shown in
FIG. 15 utilizing the following method. The pouch 300 is made by dissecting the conjunctiva
30 at the limbus 32 in an incision area that is less than one quadrant using miniature scissors
(Vannas scissors or similar) and dissecting and separating Tenon's membrane 36 from the
sclera 26 over a few millimeters (a fornix-based flap). Then, holding the edge of the pouch 300
at its center with toothed forceps, the closed tips of a pair of blunt scissors (e.g. Westcott or
similar) are slowly pushed downward toward the eye equator and opened up to separate
(delaminate) Tenon's membrane 36 from the sclera 26. The scissors are again closed; its tips
pushed further forward and reopened to separate a larger area of Tenon's membrane 36. The
process is repeated until the tips of the scissors are 17 to 20mm away from the limbus 32. The
pouch 300 thusly created is larger at the equatorial base than at the limbal entry.
[0066]       The pouch 300 is formed adjacent to the limbus 32. A mark, centered in the middle
of the conjunctival opening is made 2-3mm behind the limbus' edge using a blunt caliper. A
tissue ink can be used on the tip of the caliper to increase contrast of the tissue mark. A hand
held instrument 101 with a needle body 103 (FIG. 1) is prepared and the tip of the needle body
103 is positioned at the mark made on the sclera. A surgical passage is fashioned to connect the

                                                  19
scleral outer wall to the anterior chamber by pushing the needle body 103 in a plane such that
the tip of the needle body 103 enters the eye through the angle 28 into the anterior chamber 20.
In this manner, the surgical passage passes through the conjuctiva-sclera in the vicinity of the
angle 28 and into the anterior chamber 20. The instrument 101 may be a syringe that holds a
pharmacological solution, such as epinephrine or lidocain. The surgeon may elect to dispense
the solution from the syringe into the anterior chamber 20 after introduction of the distal end of
the syringe needle body 103 into the anterior chamber 20. After waiting for some time (e.g., a
few seconds), the needle body 103 is slowly retracted. The aqueous humor drainage device
201 is inserted into the surgical passage into the position shown in FIG. 15 whereby the distal
end 209 exits into the anterior chamber 20 of the eye and the tabs 213A, 213B are positioned
within the surgical passage. Before introducing the device 201 into the surgical passage, the
proximal end of the surgical passage can be enlarged at the scleral surface by means of a stab
incision with a sharp knife (such as the knife of FIGS. 18A and 18B as described below) or by
cutting the entrance to the sclera with the sharp edge of the needle body 103 as it is withdrawn.
This stab incision can assist in the introduction of the tabs 213A, 213B of the device 201 into
the surgical passage. Alternatively, prior to making the surgical passage, the sharp knife is used
to make a shallow slit or stab-wound into the sclera. A needle is then inserted into the slit and
the surgical passage formed under the limbus. The tabs 213A, 213B are then tucked into the
stab wound as described above. The dimensions of the tabs 213A, 213B cause the surrounding
ocular tissue of the surgical passage to directly contact the tabs 213A, 213B in order to form a
seal between the surrounding ocular tissue and the tabs 213A, 213B. The seal surrounds the
entire circumferential perimeter of the device defined by the tabs 213A, 213B and prevents
leakage of aqueous humor through the space between the tube 203 and the surrounding ocular
tissue of the surgical passage. The proximal end 207 of the tube 203 is positioned in the pouch
300 as shown in FIG. 15. The aqueous humor drainage device 201 can be deployed from an
inserter device similar to that described in U.S. Patents 7,431,709, 7,594,899, and 7,837,644
with one or two slots that accommodate the tabs 213A, 213B of the device 201. Alternatively,
the aqueous humor drainage device 201 can be inserted into the passage using a stylet 301
and/or a trocar device 350 (or 410) as described below. The pouch 300 is then closed with
sutures 304. Instead of sutures, bipolar diathermy coagulation, laser welding or adhesives, such
as cyanoacrylate, fibrin glue, etc. can be used to close the pouch 300. Further, a trocar can be
used to facilitate placement of the aqueous humor drainage device through the needle passage.

                                                   20
[0067]      To minimize inflammation as well as reduce surgical time, the pouch 300 can also
be created by dissection of the conjunctiva at the limbus and, starting at one edge of the
dissection, cutting the conjuctival tissue posteriorly for about 3mm, thus creating a flap door.
After forming the surgical passage into the exposed sclera and through to the anterior chamber,
the device 201 is positioned in the surgical passage with the proximal end of the device in the
pouch 300 as shown in FIG. 12. The freed edge of the conjunctiva 30 is then juxtaposed about
2mm past its original position and held taut with a single suture, or a single laser weld, or a
single-point bipolar diathermy coagulation, or with a single dot of adhesive. The edge of the
conjunctiva 30 along the limbus 32 is never treated, but left intact to prevent tissue necrosis that
engenders fibrosis. The comea-limbal epithelium cells will rapidly recover the wound edge (1
hour or less), sealing the conjunctival limbus.
[0068]      A sponge, blotting paper or other suitable carrier loaded with one or more
therapeutic agents can be placed within the pouch 300 before it is closed. Such therapeutic
agent(s) release over time and minimizes fibrosis of Tenon's membrane to the sclera, thereby
preventing re-lamination and closure of the bleb space (the interior space of the closed pouch
300 that surrounds the proximal end 207 of the tube 203). The therapeutic agents(s) can
include cytostatic agents (i.e., anti-proliferation agents that prevent or delay cell division, for
example, by inhibiting replication of DNA, and/or by inhibiting spindle fiber formation, and/or
by inhibiting cell migration) or other agents that minimize fibrosis or blood clots. Examples of
such therapeutic agents are described below.
[0069]      FIG. 16 shows the aqueous humor drainage device 201 with a stylet 301 that is
removably inserted into the lumen 205 of the proximal portion 209 of the device 201 to aid in
the insertion of the device 201 into the needle-formed passage. The proximal end of the stylet
301 is bent in a pig-tail configuration 302 to enable the surgeon to grip the stylet 301 and
remove it from the lumen 205 of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 once it is in place.
FIG. 17 shows another embodiment of the stylet 301 where a larger tube 303 is crimped onto
the proximal end of the stylet to facilitate gripping and removal.
[0070]      FIGS. 18A and 18B show a hand-held knife 340 that can be used to make the stab
wound in the sclera to further secure the elements of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 in
the sclera. The Diameter "a" of the knife edge 341 is less than the maximal cross-sectional
diameter of the tabs 213A, 213B of the device 201 in order to enable a snug fit of the tabs

                                                 21
213A, 213B into the stab wound. The length b of the knife edge 341 can be approximately the
same dimension as the dimension a.
[0071]       FIG. 18C shows an embodiment of a hand-held instrument 342 that includes a distal
needle body 343 extending from a flat blade portion with cutting surfaces 344A, 344B. The
needle body 343 creates the passage leading through the sclera and the cutting surfaces 344A,
344B create a widened stab wound in the sclera in one motion of the surgeon's hand.
[0072]       When the needle body is removed from the needle-formed passage, the needle
passage can at times become oval (or collagen fibers cross the passage or there is a bend in the
passage), which results in difficulty placing the aqueous humor drainage device 201 through the
passage. In order to facilitate placement of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 into the
needle-formed passage through the sclera, a trocar 350 which includes a conduit 352 with a
skived slot 351 (FIG. 19) can be provided. The conduit 352 is sized to receive the needle body
103 as well as the tube 203 of the aqueous humor drainage device 201. The trocar 350 is
placed over the needle body 103 to provide the assembly 360 shown in FIG. 20A. FIGS. 20B
to 20E illustrate the function of the trocar 350. The assembly 360 is inserted into the needle
formed passage through the sclera 400 as is shown in FIG. 20B. The needle body 103 is then
removed from the assembly leaving trocar 350 in place as shown in FIG. 20C. The aqueous
humor drainage device 201 is then fed through the trocar 350 as shown in FIG. 20D. The trocar
350 is then removed leaving the aqueous humor drainage device 201 behind inside the needle
formed passage as shown in FIG. 20E. The elastic nature of the tube 203 of the device 201
allows the tube 203 to bend and deform such that it passes through the slot 351 of the trocar 350
as the trocar 305 is removed. The position of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 within
the passage can then be adjusted by the surgeon (for example, by further inserting the device
201 into the passage) such that the tabs 213A, 213B interface to the tissue wall of the passage
and provide a seal between the tissue and the device 201. In this position, the tabs 213A, 213B
also act to fixate the device in the passage.
[0073]       FIG. 21 shows another embodiment of a trocar 410, which includes a conduit 412
with a slot 411 which is skived partway along the conduit 412. A section of the lid of the
skived slot (e.g., tab 413) remains integral with the tube as is shown.  The conduit 412 is sized
to receive the needle body 103 as well as the tube 203 of the aqueous humor drainage device
201. The trocar 410 is placed over the needle body 103 with the hub 415 butting against the

                                                  22
proximal end of conduit 412 to provide the assembly shown in FIG. 22A. FIGS. 22B to 22D
illustrate the function of the trocar 410. The assembly is inserted into the needle-formed
passage through the sclera 400 as is shown in FIG. 22B. The abutment of conduit 412 to the
hub 415 prevents the trocar 410 from slipping backward on the needle body as it is inserted
through tissue. The needle body 103 is removed from trocar 410 as shown in FIG. 22C, which
is facilitated by gripping tab 413 with a forceps as needle 103 is pulled out of trocar 410. Once
the needle body 102 is removed, the trocar 410 is cut at line 420 (for example, with scissors)
and the proximal portion of the conduit 412 with tab 413 is discarded as shown in FIG. 22D.
The aqueous humor drainage device 201 is then fed through the remaining trocar portion 421
into the needle-formed passage in a manner similar to the method described above in
conjunction with FIG. 20D. The trocar portion 421 is then removed leaving the aqueous humor
drainage device 201 behind inside the needle-formed passage as shown in FIG. 20E. The
elastic nature of the tube 203 of the device 201 allows the tube 203 to bend and deform such
that it passes through the slot 411 of the trocar portion 421 as the trocar portion 421 is removed.
The position of the aqueous humor drainage device 201 within the passage can then adjusted by
the surgeon (for example, by further inserting the device 201 into the passage) such that the tabs
213A, 213B interface to the tissue wall of the passage and provide a seal between the tissue and
the device 201. In this position, the tabs 213A, 213B also act to fixate the device in the
passage.
[0074]       Another embodiment contemplated by this invention is to first form the needle tract
under the limbus with needle 103, then pre-load tube 203 of the aqueous humor drainage device
201 into trocar 350 or 410 and then push the assembly through the needle tract. The trocar is
then removed from the needle tract as explained above.
[0075]       The trocars of FIGS. 19 and 21 can be made from a stiff thin material preferably
polyimide. Other materials that may function in this capacity are PEEK, PEEKEK,
polyurethane, polypropylene, high molecular weight polyethylene, Nylon, fluoropolymers, etc.
Alternatively, the material forming the trocars can be made from metal (preferably well-known
metals used in medical devices such as stainless steel, titanium, Nitinol, etc.). The main
requirement is that when the trocar is inserted through tissue that it not buckle. The wall
thickness of the trocar should be between 0.0002" and 0.003"; preferably between 0.001 and
0.003". The inner diameter of the trocar should be equal to or larger than the diameter of the

                                                 23
needle body 103; that is, if inserted over a needle, or equal to or larger than the flexible tube
102 if the trocar is pre-loaded with the aqueous drainage device.
[0076]      The polymeric aqueous humor drainage device 201 (or parts thereof) can be loaded
with one or more therapeutic agents that release over time and minimize fibrosis of the Tenon's
membrane to the sclera, thereby preventing re-lamination and closing of the bleb space. The
therapeutic agents(s) loaded into the device 100 can include cytostatic agents (i.e., anti
proliferation agents that prevent or delay cell division, for example, by inhibiting replication of
DNA, and/or by inhibiting spindle fiber formation, and/or by inhibiting cell migration) or other
agents that minimize fibrosis or blood clots. Examples of such therapeutic agents follow.
[0077]      Representative examples of therapeutic agents include the following: Visudyne,
Lucentis (rhuFab V2 AMD), Combretastatin A4 Prodrug, SnET2, H8, VEGF Trap, Cand5, LS
11 (Taporfin Sodium), AdPEDF, RetinoStat, Integrin, Panzem, Retaane, Anecortave Acetate,
VEGFR- 1 mRNA, ARGENT cell-signaling technology, Angiotensin II Inhibitor, Accutane for
Blindness, Macugen (PEGylated aptamer), PTAMD, Optrin, AK-1003, NX 1838, Antagonists
of avb3 and 5, Neovastat, Eos 200-F and any other VEGF inhibitor.
[0078]      Other therapeutic agents can be used such as: mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil,
corticosteroids (corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide is most common), modified toxins,
methotrexate, adriamycin, radionuclides (e.g., such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,897,255,
herein incorporated by reference in it entirety), protein kinase inhibitors (including
staurosporin, which is a protein kinase C inhibitor, as well as a diindoloalkaloids and
stimulators of the production or activation of TGF-beta, including tamoxifen and derivatives of
functional equivalents, e.g., plasmin, heparin, compounds capable of reducing the level or
inactivating the lipoprotein Lp(a) or the glycoprotein apolipoprotein(a) thereof), nitric oxide
releasing compounds (e.g., nitroglycerin) or analogs or functional equivalents thereof,
paclitaxel or analogs or functional equivalents thereof (e.g., taxotere or an agent based on
Taxol@, whose active ingredient is paclitaxel), inhibitors of specific enzymes (such as the
nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II and DAN polymerase, RNA polyermase, adenl guanyl
cyclase), superoxide dismutase inhibitors, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferas, reverse
transcriptase, antisense oligonucleotides that suppress cell proliferation, angiogenesis inhibitors
(e.g., endostatin, angiostatin and squalamine), rapamycin, everolimus, zotarolimus, cerivastatin,
and flavopiridol and suramin and the like.

                                                  24
[0079]      Other examples of therapeutic agents include the following: peptidic or mimetic
inhibitors, such as antagonists, agonists, or competitive or non-competitive inhibitors of cellular
factors that may trigger proliferation of cells or pericytes (e.g., cytokines (for example,
interleukins such as IL-I), growth factors (for example, PDGF, TGF-alpha or -beta, tumor
necrosis factor, smooth muscle- and endothelioal- derived growth factors such as endothelin or
FGF), homing receptors (for example, for platelets or leukocytes), and extracellular matrix
receptors (for example, integrins).
[0080]      Representative examples of useful therapeutic agents in the category of agents that
address cell proliferation include: subfragments of heparin, triazolopyrimidine (for example,
trapidil, which is a PDGF antagonist), lovastatin; and prostaglandins E l or 12.
[0081]       Several of the above and numerous additional therapeutic agents appropriate for the
practice of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,733,925 and 6,545,097, both
of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.
[0082]      If desired, a therapeutic agent of interest can be provided at the same time as the
polymer from which the device 201 is realized, for example, by adding it to a polymer melt
during thermoplastic processing or by adding it to a polymer solution during solvent-based
processing. Alternatively, a therapeutic agent can be provided after formation of the device or
device portion. As an example of these embodiments, the therapeutic agent can be dissolved in
a solvent that is compatible with both the device polymer and the therapeutic agent. Preferably,
the device polymer is at most only slightly soluble in this solvent. Subsequently, the solution is
contacted with the device or device portion such that the therapeutic agent is loaded (e.g., by
leaching/diffusion) into the copolymer. For this purpose, the device or device portion can be
immersed or dipped into the solution, the solution can be applied to the device or component,
for example, by spraying, printing dip coating, immersing in a fluidized bed and so forth. The
device or component can subsequently be dried, with the therapeutic agent remaining therein.
[0083]      In another alternative, the therapeutic agent may be provided within a matrix
comprising the polymer of the device 201. The therapeutic agent can also be covalently
bonded, hydrogen bonded, or electrostatically bound to the polymer of the device 201. As
specific examples, nitric oxide releasing functional groups such as S-nitroso-thiols can be

                                                  25
provided in connection with the polymer, or the polymer can be provided with charged
functional groups to attach therapeutic groups with oppositely charged functionalities.
[0084]       In yet another alternative embodiment, the therapeutic agent can be precipitated onto
one or more surfaces of the device 201 (or device portion). These one or more surface(s) can be
subsequently covered with a coating of polymer (with or without additional therapeutic agent)
as described above.
[0085]       Hence, for purposes herein, when it is stated herein that the polymer is "loaded" with
therapeutic agent, it is meant that the therapeutic agent is associated with the polymer in a
fashion like those discussed above or in a related fashion.
[0086]       In some instances a binder may be useful for adhesion to a substrate. Examples of
materials appropriate for binders in connection with the present invention include silanes,
titanates, isocyanates, carboxyls, amides, amines, acrylates hydroxyls, and epoxides, including
specific polymers such as EVA, polyisobutylene, natural rubbers, polyurethanes, siloxane
coupling agents, ethylene and propylene oxides.
[0087]       It also may be useful to coat the polymer of the device 201 (which may or may not
contain a therapeutic agent) with an additional polymer layer (which may or may not contain a
therapeutic agent). This layer may serve, for example, as a boundary layer to retard diffusion of
the therapeutic agent and prevent a burst phenomenon whereby much of the agent is released
immediately upon exposure of the device or device portion to the implant site. The material
constituting the coating, or boundary layer, may or may not be the same polymer as the loaded
polymer. For example, the barrier layer may also be a polymer or small molecule from the
following classes: polycarboxylic acids, including polyacrylic acid; cellulosic polymers,
including cellulose acetate and cellulose nitrate; gelatin; polyvinylpyrrolidone; cross-linked
polyvinylpyrrolidone; polyanhydrides including maleic anhydride polymers; polyamides;
polyvinyl alcohols; copolymers of vinyl monomers such as EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate
copolymer); polyvinyl ethers; polyvinyl aromatics; polyethylene oxides; glycosaminoglycans;
polysaccharides; polyesters including polyethylene terephthalate; polyacrylamides; polyethers;
polyether sulfone; polycarbonate; polyalkylenes including polypropylene, polyethylene and
high molecular weight polyethylene; halogenated polyalkylenes including
polytetrafluoroethylene; polyurethanes; polyorthoesters; polypeptides, including proteins;

                                                  26
silicones; siloxane polymers; polylactic acid; polyglycolic acid; polycaprolactone;
polyhydroxybutyrate valerate and blends and copolymers thereof; coatings from polymer
dispersions such as polyurethane dispersions (BAYHDROL.RTM., etc.); fibrin; collagen and
derivatives thereof; polysaccharides such as celluloses, starches, dextrans, alginates and
derivatives; and hyaluronic acid.
[0088]      Copolymers and mixtures of the above are also contemplated.
[0089]      It is also possible to form the aqueous humor drainage device 201 (or device
portion) with blends by adding one or more of the above or other polymers to a block
copolymer. Examples include the following:
                 - Blends can be formed with homopolymers that are miscible with one of the
block copolymer phases. For example, polyphenylene oxide is miscible with the styrene blocks
of polystyrene-polyisobutylene-polystyrene copolymer. This should increase the strength of a
molded part or coating made from polystyrene-polyisobutylene-polystyrene copolymer and
polyphenylene oxide.
                 - Blends can be made with added polymers or other copolymers that are not
completely miscible with the blocks of the block copolymer. The added polymer or copolymer
may be advantageous, for example, in that it is compatible with another therapeutic agent, or it
may alter the release rate of the therapeutic agent from the block copolymer (e.g., polystyrene
polyisobutylene-polystyrene copolymer).
                 - Blends can be made with a component such as sugar (see list above) that can
be leached from the device 201 (or device portion), rendering the device or device component
more porous and controlling the release rate through the porous structure.
[0090]      The release rate of therapeutic agent from the therapeutic-agent-loaded polymers of
the present invention can be varied in a number of ways. Examples include:
                 - Varying the molecular weight of the block copolymers.
                 - Varying the specific constituents selected for the elastomeric and thermoplastic
portions of the block copolymers and the relative amounts of these constituents.

                                                  27
                 - Varying the type and relative amounts of solvents used in processing the block
copolymers.
                 - Varying the porosity of the block copolymers.
                 - Providing a boundary layer over the block copolymer.
                 - Blending the block copolymer with other polymers or copolymers.
[0091]       Moreover, although it is seemingly desirable to provide control over the release of
the therapeutic agent (e.g., as a fast release (hours) or as a slow release (weeks)), it may not be
necessary to control the release of the therapeutic agent. In such embodiments, one or more of
the therapeutic drug agents described herein (e.g., an antiproliferative agent derived from
mitomycin C or 5-fluorouracil) may be injected into the pouch 300 at the time of surgery.
[0092]       There have been described and illustrated herein several embodiments of glaucoma
implant devices, kits and methods that divert aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the
eye and surgical methods associated therewith. While particular embodiments of the invention
have been described, it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto, as it is intended that
the invention be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read
likewise.
[0093]       Thus, while particular methods of manufacture have been disclosed, it will be
understood that other manufacture methods can be used. For example, because the copolymer
materials described herein have a thermoplastic character, a variety of standard thermoplastic
processing techniques can be used to for the devices described herein. Such techniques include
compression molding, injection molding, blow molding, spinning, vacuum forming and
calendaring, and extrusion into tubes and the like. Such devices can also be made using
solvent-based techniques involving solvent casting, spin coating, solvent spraying, dipping,
fiber forming, ink jet techniques and the like. Also, while it is preferred that the aqueous humor
drainage device be realized by a simple tubular structure, it will be recognized that adaptations
may be made of such structures. For example, other duct forming structures and shapes can be
used. In another example, the device may include holes through the side wall of the tubular
structure. In another example, the tubular structure may include multiple lumens therein. Also,
while it is preferred that the aqueous humor drainage device be realized by simple planar tab
structures, it will be recognized that adaptations may be made of such structures. It will

                                                28
therefore be appreciated by those skilled in the art that yet other modifications could be made to
the provided invention without deviating from its spirit and scope as claimed.

                                                  29
