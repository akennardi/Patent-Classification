            ALTERNATING PADDLE MECHANISM FOR POOL CLEANER
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application
No. 61/780,481 filed on March 13, 2013, the entire contents of which are incorporated
herein by reference.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      Mechanical pool cleaners are typically classified as pressure-side cleaners or
suction-side cleaners based on their connection to a pool pump.           More specifically,
suction-side pool cleaners are connected to a suction or inlet port of the pump, while
pressure-side pool cleaners are connected to a pressure or outlet port of the pump. In both
types, water is drawn or forced through the cleaner and mechanisms are provided to
attempt to harvest energy from water movement through the cleaner in order to operate
one or more functions of the cleaner (e.g., vacuuming, steering, etc.).
[0003]      With respect to suction-side pool cleaners, a turbine or paddle wheel may be
provided within a water flow passage to harvest energy from the water flow. Generally,
design aspects of the paddle wheel are based on a tradeoff between performance and
efficiency. For example, reducing the clearances between blades of the paddle wheel and
the walls of the flow passage may increase efficiency by allowing the paddle wheel to
harness more kinetic energy from the fluid flow.        However, reduced clearance may
detrimentally affect paddle wheel performance because debris may not be allowed to pass
through the water flow passage, and/or may impede rotation of the paddle wheel. On the
other hand, increasing the clearances may improve performance by allowing debris to pass
through the passage without impeding the paddle wheel. In this instance, however, more
fluid may flow through the larger clearances without providing kinetic energy to the
paddle wheel, which may result in reduced efficiency.
[0004]      One known pool cleaning system includes a number of paddle wheel blades
that are pivotably mounted to the paddle wheel. When the blades pivot with respect to the
paddle wheel, the clearance between the blades and the housing in which they rotate may
change, which may allow larger debris to pass between the blades and the housing. The

                                                    2
use of pivoting blades, however, may contribute to increased drag or reduced efficiency, or may
increase the complexity of manufacturing or assembly of the cleaning system.
[0005]     Another known pool cleaning system includes a paddle having a number of blades
that collectively revolve around a central axis, but are each mounted, independently, on a
rotating shaft extending radially outward from the central axis. The separate rotating shafts
allow the individual blades to pivot with respect to their bulk movement around the central axis,
which may allow debris to move past the individual blades. Such an arrangement, however, may
significantly increase the complexity of manufacturing and assembly of the cleaning system, and
may also decrease overall efficiency.
OBJECT
[0006]      It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or ameliorate one or
more of the above disadvantages, or at least provide a useful alternative.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0015]      Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction
and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in
the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being
practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the
phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not
be regarded as limiting. The use of "including," "comprising," or "having" and variations
thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as
well as additional items. Unless specified or limited otherwise, the terms "mounted,"
"connected," "supported," and "coupled" and variations thereof are used broadly and
encompass both direct and indirect mountings, connections, supports, and couplings.
Further, "connected" and "coupled" are not restricted to physical or mechanical
connections or couplings.
[0016]      The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to
make and use embodiments of the invention. Various modifications to the illustrated
embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles
herein can be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from
embodiments of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not intended to be
limited to embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the
principles and features disclosed herein. The following detailed description is to be read
with reference to the figures, in which like elements in different figures have like reference
numerals. The figures, which are not necessarily to scale, depict selected embodiments
and are not intended to limit the scope of embodiments of the invention. Skilled artisans
will recognize the examples provided herein have many useful alternatives and fall within
the scope of embodiments of the invention.
 [0017]     Various types of suction-side (or other) swimming pool cleaners are operated
using energy harvested from the flow of fluid drawn through them. More specifically,
suction-side pool cleaners are connected to a suction side of a pool pump that causes fluid
to be drawn along a fluid path within the pool cleaner. A paddle wheel mechanism

                                               5
positioned within the fluid path may accordingly be utilized to harvest energy from the
fluid flow along the fluid path.
[0018]       As noted above, it may be useful to provide a paddle wheel mechanism that
balances concerns of efficiency with other performance considerations. For example, it
may be useful to provide a paddle wheel mechanism that harnesses kinetic energy from a
fluid flow with relatively high efficiency, while also preventing debris from excessively
interfering with performance of the system. In certain embodiments, such a paddle wheel
mechanism may include a paddle wheel with two different types of paddle wheel blades
arranged in an alternating fashion around the wheel. For example, one type of paddle
wheel blade may extend from a first side of a paddle wheel base (and a first side of the
cavity in which the paddle wheel is housed) part, but not all, of the way toward the other
(second) side of the paddle wheel base (and the other side of the cavity in which the
paddle wheel is housed). In contrast, another type of paddle wheel blade may extend from
the other (second) side of the paddle wheel base part, but not all, of the way toward the
first side of the paddle wheel base. With these two blade types arranged in an alternating
configuration around the paddle wheel, the blades may accordingly harvest a substantial
portion of kinetic energy of a fluid flow across the paddle wheel, while at the same time
 still providing a path for debris to travel past the paddle wheel without becoming lodged
 on the wheel or otherwise impeding its rotation (i.e., a path traveling toward the second
 side of the paddle wheel base to clear the first-type blade, back toward the first side of the
 paddle wheel base to clear the second-type blade, and so on).
 [0019]      Referring now to FIG. 1, an example pool cleaner 10 is depicted, which may
 utilize a paddle wheel mechanism 12 (see, e.g., FIG. 2) to harvest kinetic energy of fluid
 moving through the pool cleaner 10. The pool cleaner 10 may be configured as a suction
 side pool cleaner, or as various other types of pool cleaners (e.g., a pressure-side pool
 cleaner) known in the art. The pool cleaner 10 generally includes a housing 14, which is
 designed to retain a paddle wheel mechanism 12. The pool cleaner 10 further includes in
 an inlet (not shown) disposed on a lower surface of the pool cleaner that allows for fluid
 and debris to enter into the pool cleaner 10. The pool cleaner 10 also includes an outlet
 14a provided in the form of a cylindrical connection extending from an upper portion of
 the housing 14, which is designed to interact with a hose (not shown) that transports debris

                                                 6
and/or water to a pool filtering mechanism and/or collection device.              In certain
embodiments, a paddle wheel mechanism 12 may provide kinetic energy for the wheels 16
and 18, or for various other features of components.
[0020]      Referring also to FIGS. 2 and 3, paddle wheel mechanism 12 is depicted, for
optimizing debris handling and energy harvesting within the suction-side swimming pool
cleaner 10. The paddle wheel mechanism 12 includes a paddle wheel housing 30 (shown
with an upper housing portion removed), and a paddle wheel 34 supported by a paddle
wheel shaft 36. The housing 30 defines an internal paddle wheel cavity 32 surrounding
the paddle wheel 34, and includes an inlet fluid path opening 38, and an outlet fluid path
opening (not shown) on the opposing side of the paddle wheel 34 from the opening 38.
During operation of the cleaner 10, accordingly, fluid may flow into the cavity 32 via the
opening 38 and out of the cavity 32 via the outlet opening (not shown), such that the
cavity 32 defines, at least in part, an internal fluid flow area for housing 30.
 [0021]     As shown in FIG. 3, the housing 30 also includes shaft supports 40, each of
which receive a shaft bearing 42 through which the paddle wheel shaft 36 extends. The
shaft bearings 42 accordingly allow the paddle wheel shaft 36, and thus the paddle wheel
34, to rotate freely within the cavity 32 of the housing 30. It will be understood, that in
other embodiments, the paddle wheel 34 may be mounted within the housing 30 for
rotation in a variety of other known ways. For example, the shaft 36 may be rotatably
mounted directly to the housing 30, may be fixedly mounted to the housing 30 with the
paddle wheel 34 rotating around the shaft 36, or may extend through the housing 30 to
mounting points removed from the housing 30. Similarly, the shaft 36 may be a single
body shaft, may include two half-shafts, or may take a variety of other configurations.
 [0022]      The cavity 32 of the housing 30 is defined, at least in part, by a curved inner
 surface 56, which may be designed to generally provide relatively small clearance for the
rotation of paddle wheel 34. For example, the inner surface 56 may be generally curved to
follow the path traced by the radially outermost (or other) portions of the blades 52 of the
paddle wheel 34 (as discussed in greater detail below), the inner surface 56 generally
 defining a relatively small clearance between those outermost blade (or other) portions and
the surface 56. In certain embodiments, relatively larger clearance may be provided for
paddle wheel 34 over a surface portion 56a corresponding, for example, to a region in

                                                7
which fluid flows from the opening 38 into the cavity 34. The cavity 34 is also defined by
internal surfaces (e.g., side walls) 78 and 80, which may be designed to provide relatively
small clearances between lateral features of the paddle wheel 34 (e.g., sides 70 and 72 of
paddle wheel base 50), lateral edges of blades of the paddle wheel 34, or other components
(e.g., a flange 20 on the paddle wheel shaft 36).
[0023]       Referring also to FIG. 4, in one embodiment, the paddle wheel 34 includes a
paddle wheel base 50 surrounding the paddle wheel shaft 36. A plurality of paddle wheel
blades 52 protrude radially outwardly from the base 50 into the cavity 32 and, thereby,
into a flow path of fluid entering the cavity 32 via the inlet opening 38.             In the
embodiment depicted, the paddle wheel blades 52 include a generally curved profile over
the majority of their extension away from the base 50, in order to effectively harvest
kinetic energy from passing fluid.           It will be understood, however, that other
configurations are possible.
[0024]       In the embodiment depicted, two types of blades 52 extend from the paddle
wheel 34 and are characterized by first-type blades 60 and second-type blades 90,
although other embodiments may include a different number of blade types (e.g., three or
more different blade types).       Similarly, the two types of blades 52 depicted may be
generally viewed as similarly shaped, but differently oriented.              However, other
embodiments may include various blade types that are less similar in shape. Likewise,
although the depicted embodiment includes six total blades 52, with three blades of each
blade type, various other numbers of blades (and respective blade types) may be utilized.
 [0025]      As shown in FIG. 4, first-type blades 60 include curved blade portions 62
 extending radially away from the paddle wheel base 50. The blade portions 62 are each
defined by curved body portions 64 that extend outwardly and terminate at rounded distal
tips 66 at the radially outermost end of the body portions 64. The distal tips 66 are
 configured to be generally thicker than the body portions 64, and may travel along inner
 surfaces 56 of the cavity 32 with a relatively small clearance.
 [0026]       Generally, the blade portions 62 of first-type blades 60 extend along the width
 54 of the paddle wheel base 50 (e.g., axially along the base 50) from exterior edges 68 at a
 first side 70 of the base 50 toward a second, opposite side 72 of the base 50, but do not

                                                8
extend the entire length of the width 54 to reach the second side 72. Rather, each blade
portion 62 terminates at an interior edge 74, which is spaced interiorly from the second
side 72. In certain embodiments, for example, the width 76 of the blade portion 62 may be
between about 30% and about 60% of the width 54 of the base 50. In this way, the blade
portions 62 may provide a close clearance between the edges 68 and the surface 78 of the
internal cavity 32, but a substantially larger clearance between the edges 74 and the
surface 80 of the internal cavity 32.
[0027]       Still referring to FIG. 4, in certain embodiments, first-type blades 60 further
include elongate base portions 82, which may extend along the paddle wheel base 50
toward the second side 72 further than blade portions 62. This may, for example, provide
additional area to harvest kinetic energy from passing fluid, as well as providing additional
support and stability to the blade portions 62. In certain embodiments, the base portions
82 may extend across substantially all of the width of the internal cavity 32. In other
embodiments, the width 76 of the blade portion 62 is about half of the width of the base
portion 82. In a further embodiment, the width 76 of the blade portion 62 is about a third
of the width of the base portion 82. In still a further embodiment, the width 76 of the
blade portion 62 is less than half of the width of the base portion 82. As depicted in the
various figures, the base portions 82 also extend radially away from the paddle wheel
base 50, but to a lesser extent than the blade portions 62. In certain embodiments, the base
portions 82 may include a shoulder 86, such that a part of the base portion 82 that attaches
to the blade portion 62 extends farther away from the paddle wheel base 50 than does a
part of the base portion 82 that does not attach to the blade portion 62. In certain
 embodiments, the shoulder 86 may be mirrored by a similar shoulder 88 in the paddle
 wheel base 50, which in turn may correspond to one or more shoulders 36a on paddle
 wheel shaft 36 (see FIG. 3). This may, for example, allow the paddle wheel base 50 to be
 slid fully onto the paddle wheel shaft 36 only in one direction. The base portions 82 may
 be formed integrally with the base 50, or may be otherwise attached to the base 50 using a
 variety of known attachment means.
 [0028]      In certain embodiments, and as depicted in the various figures, the blade
 portions 62 are detachable from the base portions 82 at an attachment joint 84. For
 example, the blade portions 62 may be attached to the base portions 82 with snap-fit or

                                                 9
other separable attachment means at the joint 84. In this way, the blade portions 62 may
be removed and reattached to allow for relatively simple repair and maintenance of the
paddle wheel 34, as well as to provide customizability through the use of different
numbers or orientations of blades, or the use of blade portions 62 with various profiles,
thicknesses, types of tips 66, blade widths 76, and so on.
[0029]       As discussed above, the paddle wheel 34 also includes one or more second
type blades 90. Each second-type blade 90 includes curved blade portions 92 extending
radially away from the paddle wheel base 50. The blade portions 92 include body portions
94 that curve outwardly and terminate at distal tips 96 at the radially outermost end of the
body portions 94. The distal tips 96 are configured to be generally thicker than the body
portions 94, and may travel along the inner surfaces 56 of the cavity 32 with relatively
 small clearance.
 [0030]      Generally, the blade portions 92 of second-type blades 90 extend along the
width 54 of the paddle wheel base 50 (e.g., axially along the base 50) from exterior edges
 98 at the second side 72 of the base 50 toward a first side 70 of the base 50, but do not
 extend the entire length of the width 54 to reach the first side 70. Rather, each blade
 portion 92 terminates at an interior edge 100, which is spaced interiorly from the first side
 70. In certain embodiments, for example, the width 102 of the blade portion 92 may be
 between about 30% and about 60% of the width 54 of the base 50. In this way, the blade
 portions 92 may provide a close clearance between the edges 98 and the surface 80 of the
 internal cavity 32, but a substantially larger clearance between the edges 100 and the
 surface 78 of the internal cavity 32.
 [0031]      Still referring to FIG. 4, in certain embodiments, second-type blades 90 further
 include elongate base portions 104, which may extend along the paddle wheel base 50
 toward the first side 70 further than the blade portions 92. This may, for example, provide
 additional area to harvest kinetic energy from passing fluid, as well as providing additional
 support and stability to the blade portions 92. In certain embodiments, the base portions
  104 may extend across substantially all of the width of the internal cavity 32. In other
 embodiments, the width 102 of the blade portion 92 is about half of the width of the base
 portion 104. In a further embodiment, the width 102 of the blade portion 92 is about a
 third of the width of the base portion 104. In still a further embodiment, the width 102 of

                                               10
the blade portion 92 is less than half of the width of the base portion 92. As depicted in
the various figures, the base portions 104 also extend radially away from the paddle wheel
base 50, but to a lesser extent than the blade portions 92. In certain embodiments, the base
portions 104 may include a shoulder 108, such that a part of the base portion 104 that
attaches to the blade portion 92 extends further away from the paddle wheel base 50 than
does a part of the base portion that does not attach to the blade portion 92. In certain
embodiments, the shoulder 104 may be mirrored by the shoulder 88 in the paddle wheel
base 50, which in turn may correspond to one or more shoulders 36a on paddle wheel shaft
36 (see FIG. 3). The base portions 104 may be formed integrally with the base 50, or may
be otherwise attached to the base 50 using a variety of known attachment means.
[0032]      In certain embodiments, and as depicted in the various figures, the blade
portions 92 are detachable from the base portions 104 at an attachment joint 106. For
example, the blade portions 92 may be attached to the base portions 104 with snap-fit or
other separable attachment means at a joint 106. In this way, the blade portions 92 may be
removed and reattached to allow for relatively simple repair and maintenance of the
paddle wheel 34, as well as to provide customizability through the of different numbers or
orientations of blades, or use of the blade portions 92 with various profiles, thicknesses,
types of tips 96, blade widths 102, and so on. Where the blade portions 62 and 92 are
similar (e.g., as in the embodiment depicted in the various figures), this detachable
configuration may sometimes allow for the manufacturing of a single type of blade
portion, which may be connected to either of the base portions 62 or 82 to complete,
respectively, first-type blades 60 or second-type blades 90.
[0033]      As noted above, and as depicted in the various figures, first-type blades 60 and
second-type blades 90 may be oriented in an alternating arrangement around the paddle
wheel 34. For example, three first-type blades 60 may be provided, extending radially
away from the paddle wheel base 50 in an alternating configuration with three second-type
blades 92.    It will be understood that various other configurations may be possible,
including configurations having additional blade types, different numbers of one or both of
first-type blades 60 and second-type blades 90, and so on. For example, one embodiment
may include two of first-type blades 60 and three of second-type blades 90. Another
embodiment may include two of first-type blades 90 and three of second-type blades 60.

                                               11
Still another embodiment may include two of first-type blades 60, two of second-type
blades 90, and two of a third-type blade (not shown) with a different blade width (or other
geometry) than first-type blades 60 and second-type blades 90. Yet another embodiment
may include two or four of first-type blades 60 and two or four of second-type blades 90.
[0034]      In certain embodiments, the paddle wheel base width 54 may be approximately
equal to the width of the internal cavity 32. In this way, for example, where the exterior
edges 68 of first-type blades 60 are generally adjacent to the side 70 of the paddle wheel
base 50, the edges 68 may pass near the surface 78 of the cavity 32 with relatively small
clearance, while the interior edges 74 may provide relatively large clearances with respect
to the surface 80 of the cavity 32. Similarly, the exterior edges 98 of second-type blades
90 are generally adjacent to the side 72 of the paddle wheel base 50 causing the edges 98
to pass near the surface 80 of the cavity 32 with relatively small clearance, while the
interior edges 100 may provide relatively large clearances with respect to the surface 78 of
the cavity 32.
[0035]      As noted above, the paddle wheel mechanism 12 is positioned within a fluid
path of the pool cleaner 10, within the flow area provided by the internal cavity 32 so that
fluid flow through the housing 30 (i.e., into the housing 30 through the inlet opening 38,
across the paddle wheel 34, and out of the housing 30 through the outlet opening 14a
causes rotation of the paddle wheel 34 and the paddle wheel shaft 36. In other words,
kinetic energy of fluid flow across the paddle wheel 34 can be harvested through rotation
of the paddle wheel 34 and the paddle wheel shaft 36. In certain embodiments, the paddle
wheel shaft 36 may be further connected to other components of the pool cleaner, such as
steering or drive systems, so that the energy harvested by the paddle wheel 34 can provide
the power to operate such components.
[0036]      In this light, the alternating-blade design of the paddle wheel mechanism 12
may help to prevent the paddle wheel 34 from becoming clogged or otherwise restricted
by debris being carried along the noted fluid path.         Conventionally, for example, a
relatively large radial clearance between the distal tips 66 and 96 and the surfaces 56 of
cavity 32 would be required in order to allow debris to pass through the cavity 32 without
clogging or otherwise impeding the paddle wheel 34. The alternating configuration of
first-type blades 60 and second-type blades 90, however, reduces (and may even remove)

                                               12
the need for such a large radial clearance because debris may pass through the axial
clearances between the inner edges 74 and 100 and, respectively, the surfaces 78 and 80 of
the housing 30.
[0037]      Referring also to FIG. 5, a portion of fluid (e.g., water) moving through the
cavity 32 may travel along fluid paths 110 and 112 to impact the first-type blade 60 and
the second-type blade 90 and thereby transfer a portion of its kinetic energy to the paddle
wheel 34. At the same time, debris may be carried along a debris path 114 around the
blade portions 62 and 92 of the blades 60 and 90 and thereby pass through and out of the
cavity 32. Accordingly, as one beneficial result, the alternating-blade design of the paddle
wheel mechanism 12 may provide both relatively high performance characterized by a low
incidence of clogging, and relatively high efficiency.
 [0038]     In certain embodiments, various aspects of the geometries of first-type and
second-type blades 60 and 90 (or other blade types) may be varied depending on the
expected operating conditions of a particular cleaner 10. For example, the blade widths 76
 and 100 may be selected based upon expected debris sizes in a particular cleaning
 application. Likewise, in certain embodiments (not shown), the blade portions 62 or 92
 may exhibit non-uniform widths over the length of their extension away from the paddle
 wheel base 50. For example, the blade portion 62 may exhibit a first width at joint 84,
 various different widths along the body portion 64, and a different width still at the distal
 tip 66.
