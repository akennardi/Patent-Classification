                                           ABSTRACT
          Polyester plasticizer compositions for adhesives, caulk, sealants, vinyl and other
polymeric compositions comprising low molecular weight oligomeric dibenzoates prepared by
end-capping a polyester plasticizer, having alternating units of glycols or diols and dibasic acids,
with benzoic acid.     Improved methods for preparing oligomeric dibenzoates include use of a
non-halogen based catalyst, early ramping of temperature, pressure reduction and steps to reduce
or eliminate residual hydroxyl content and improve plasticizer performance by adding acetic
anhydride are also disclosed. Propylene glycol adipate and propylene glycol succinate polyesters
with benzoic acid end-caps are particularly useful, as are hybrid benzoate/acetate end-capped
polyesters formed in the process with acetic anhydride. Caulks, adhesives, sealants, and vinyl
compositions, among others, comprising the oligomeric end-capped polyesters of the invention
are also contemplated.

              POLYESTER PLASTICIZERS WITH BENZOIC ACID END-CAPS
                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001] This invention is directed to novel plasticizer compositions for use in a variety of
polymeric dispersions, including without limitation caulks, sealants, adhesives and vinyl.          In
particular, the invention is directed to polyester plasticizers comprising alternating units of
glycols and dibasic acids end-capped with benzoate and/or acetate esters. The invention is also
directed to compositions containing the novel plasticizer compositions.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002] Polyester plasticizers are generally categorized as specialty-type plasticizers and
comprise a wide variety of chemistries.       Polymeric polyester plasticizers are produced from
polyhydric alcohols (diols) esterified with dibasic acids, commonly adipic acid, in the presence
of monobasic acids or alcohols.       These polymeric polyesters comprise regularly alternating
(repeating) units of dibasic acids and glycols (or diols), as compared to monomeric plasticizers
that do not contain repeating units.
[0003] Polyester plasticizers are known in the art for use in a number of applications, such as
adhesives, caulks, sealants, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastisols. As do other plasticizers,
polyester plasticizers provide compounded polymeric compositions with improved properties,
such as low volatility, resistance to extraction, excellent flexibility, durability, and UV and heat
resistance properties, among others, depending on the structure and molecular weight of the
particular polyester utilized. Polymeric polyester plasticizers, in particular, offer low volatility,
resistance to extraction by hydrocarbon fluids, and depending on the particular plasticizer
resistance to surface marring. As one example, polyester plasticizers used in polyvinyl chloride
                                                  1

(PVC) have better extraction resistance properties than that achieved with most monomeric
plasticizers, and they also demonstrate excellent non-migration properties in vinyl plastics.
[0004] Polyester plasticizers can be used in blends to improve the performance of standard
monomeric plasticizers or as a substitute for them. They also may but are not required to be
blended with various other conventional plasticizers to enhance or augment properties of
polymeric compositions, including but not limited to improving solvating characteristics and
compatibility and processability in plastisol applications. Suitable conventional plasticizers for
use with polyester plasticizers include general purpose, specialty and/or secondary plasticizers,
examples of which include without limitation phthalate esters, dibenzoate esters, phosphate
esters, various adipate, azelate, oleate, succinate and sebacate compounds, terephthalate esters
such as dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylate esters (such as Hexamoll*
DINCH*),      epoxy plasticizers,   fatty  acid  esters, glycol  derivatives,  sulfonamides,    and
hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon derivatives that are often utilized as secondary plasticizers.
Monobenzoates, such as isononyl benzoate, isodecyl benzoate, and 2-ethylhexyl benzoate, and 2,
2, 4-trimethyl-1, 3-pentanediol diisobutyrate, among other plasticizers, can also be blended with
polyester plasticizers.
[0005] It has been discovered that certain polyester plasticizers, in particular lower molecular
weight oligomeric dibenzoates, are viable alternatives for traditional phthalate plasticizers used
in adhesives, caulks, and sealants. They are also useful substitutes alone or in combination with
other plasticizers in plastisol applications, including without limitation in PVC.            These
oligomeric dibenzoates comprise certain polyester plasticizers that are end-capped with benzoic
acid esters.
                                                 2
3428073v2

[0006] In preparation, the oligomeric dibenzoates of the invention may have a portion of
molecules which are not fully reacted, i.e., do not convert to dual benzoic acid end caps. As a
result, shorter chain, hydroxyl (-OH) terminated molecules are formed, which are more water
soluble than molecules having dual benzoic acid ester end-caps.        These hydroxyl terminated
compositions can, in some circumstances, be reactive.     Depending on application, their use may
be limited due to incompatibility with a polymer.       Decreasing the concentration of residual
hydroxyl-terminated molecules will improve compatibility by decreasing the percentage of
molecules that are extractable by water.
[0007] By adding acetic anhydride during the preparation process of the oligomeric dibenzoates
of the invention, unreacted hydroxyl groups may be eliminated or significantly reduced. Any
excess acetic anhydride is removed at the end of the process. Use of acetic anhydride may also
result in the formation of a polyester having hybrid benzoate/acetate ester end-caps. It has been
discovered that this hybrid benzoate/acetate end-capped polyester is also a viable alternative for
more traditional plasticizers in certain applications, often with improved results, even over the
non-acetic anhydride-modified oligomeric polyester plasticizers of the invention.
[0008] The oligomeric polyester plasticizers of the invention are preferably based upon
propylene glycol adipate and propylene glycol succinate polyesters that are dual end-capped
(terminated on both ends) with esters of benzoic acid, i.e., propylene glycol/adipate/benzoate and
propylene glycol/succinate/benzoate.      The benzoate end-caps change the polarity of the
polyesters making them very versatile plasticizers for use with a large number of polymers.
Alternatively, the oligomeric polyester plasticizers of the invention preferably include those
having hybrid benzoate/acetate end-caps.
                                                  3
3428073v2

[0009] The polyester plasticizers of the invention may also comprise other glycols (diols) and
dibasic acids.   Diol glycols useful in the inventive compositions, including without limitation
1,3-butane diol, 1,4-butane diol, 1,3-propane diol, and mixtures thereof. Useful dibasic acids
include without limitation azelaic, glutaric, sebacic, phthalic and terephthalic acid. Polyesters
prepared from these other diols and dibasic acids are also within the contemplation of the
invention.
[0010] Applications for use of the inventive polyester plasticizers may depend on molecular
weight. For example, the higher molecular weight propylene glycol adipate end-capped with
benzoic acid esters functions well as a substitute for industry standard phthalates in polysulfide
or other sealant and caulk applications, as well as in vinyl applications, including without
limitation automotive applications such as underbody coating and sealants. The lower molecular
weight propylene glycol succinate end-capped with benzoic acid esters also performs well in
vinyl applications. None of these oligomeric dibenzoates are known to have been used in these
applications heretofore.   Surprisingly, these oligomeric dibenzoates function as well or better
than traditional higher molecular weight phthalate plasticizers.
[0011] It has also been found that the inventive polyesters having hybrid benzoate and acetate
ester end caps are less prone to water extraction and reactivity in certain use applications. This
will result in better and longer term performance in PVC applications where exposure to
weathering is expected. Since it does not extract easily, it will perform better as a plasticizer as it
will continue to soften the polymer.
[0012] The inventive polyester plasticizers may be derived from natural sources, making them
highly desirable from an environmental perspective.

[0013] It is an object of the invention to provide novel plasticizers comprising polyesters end
capped with dual benzoate esters or hybrid benzoate/acetate esters, which are useful in a wide
variety of applications where plasticizers are traditionally used.
[0014] It is a further object of the invention to provide novel polyester plasticizers that may be
used as alternatives to traditional phthalate or other traditional plasticizers in adhesives, caulks,
sealants, plastisols, vinyl compositions, and other polymeric dispersions.
[0015] Yet another object of the invention is to provide adhesive, caulk, sealant, vinyl and other
polymeric compositions utilizing the novel polyester plasticizers of the invention.
[0016] Still another object of the invention is to provide novel polyester plasticizers that may be
blended with traditional plasticizers to improve properties of both the plasticizer and the
polymeric compositions in which the blends are used.
[0017] Still a further object of the invention is to provide novel polyester plasticizers that
achieve comparable or improved compatibility, processability, extraction resistance, hardness,
strength, surface energy retention, volatility, and migration characteristics over traditional
plasticizers used in polymeric compositions.
[0018] Other objects of the invention will be evident to one skilled in the art.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

polymeric compositions. The invention is also directed to adhesives, caulks, sealants, coatings,
and vinyl compositions, among others, comprising the inventive oligomeric polyesters as a

capped compositions utilizing a zinc acetate catalyst and altered process conditions, which is an
improvement over prior art methods of polyester preparation.
[0026] The inventive method for preparing the inventive polyester end-capped compositions
includes acetic anhydride addition in situ to reduce or eliminate undesirable hydroxyl groups,
during the preparation process for the oligomeric dibenzoate polyesters of the invention.

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[00100]          The invention is directed to oligomeric dibenzoates comprising regularly
alternating units of diols and dibasic acids dual end-capped with benzoate esters or end-capped
with hybrid benzoate and acetate esters.
[00101]          The invention is directed in particular to propylene glycol adipate and propylene
glycol succinate polyesters end-capped with benzoic acid esters, but is not limited as such.
These novel oligomeric dibenzoates are characterized by having little or no free hydroxyl groups,
which may be achieved by adding acetic anhydride to the production process.            While end
capping and reduction of free hydroxyl groups are not unique processes per se, end-capping
propylene glycol adipate and/or propylene glycol succinate polyesters with benzoate esters to
form useful plasticizer compositions is heretofore unknown.

These hybrid benzoate/acetate end-capped polyesters are also useful plasticizer compositions and
fall within the scope of the invention. These hybrid end-capped polyesters are also heretofore
unknown as plasticizer compositions.

[001041          A typical structum for the polyester plasticizer of the invention based on
propylene glycol succinate (dual end-capped with benzoic acid) is set forth below:
                                                 a                     0

                        Succinic Acid: Propylene Glycol: Benzoic Acid
[00105]          While the invention        is described primarily with reference         to polyesters
comprising propylene glycol and succinic or adipic acid, other diols and dibasic acids may be
used to form a polyester end-capped with benzoate esters or hybrid benzoate and acetate esters.
fiols useful in the inventive compositions, including without limitation 1.3-butane diol, 1,4
butane dial. 1,3-propane dial and mixtures thereof.             Useful dibasic acids include without
limitation azelaic, glutaric, sebacic, phthalic and terephthalic acids.       Polyesters prepared from
these other dios and dibasic acids are also within the contemplation ofthe invention. Polyesters
                                                    15

prepared with certain tribasic acids, such as trimellitic anhydride, are also within the
contemplation of the invention.
[00106]           The moles of glycol (diol), dibasic acid, benzoic acid and acetic anhydride used
in preparation of the inventive polyester plasticizers may vary depending on the target molecular
weight and on whether an excess of any component is used in preparation of the inventive
compositions.     The inventive oligomeric plasticizers are characterized by number average
molecular weights (Mn) ranging from about 1000 to about 2500, preferably ranging from about
300 to about 1000. Weight average molecular weights (Mw) range from 500 to about 5000. The
polydispersity index or uniformity of the inventive oligomeric compositions ranges from about
1.5 to about 3, depending on the reactants ratio, mechanism of polymerization and time of
reaction.
[00107]           For purposes of the invention, the terms "inventive polyester plasticizers" or
"inventive oligomeric plasticizer" include either oligomeric dibenzoate end-capped polyester
compositions or oligomeric benzoate/acetate end-capped polyester compositions. Other terms,
such as "oligomeric dibenzoates" and "oligomeric benzoate/acetate hybrid esters", may also be
used to describe the inventive compositions.
[00108]           "Hybrid" means a polyester of the invention having both benzoate and acetate
ester end caps.
[00109]           Methods of preparing polyesters are generally known in the art. The present
invention provides an improved method for preparing inventive oligomeric dibenzoates in a
manner that is reproducible and achieves the desired properties. The present inventive method
also utilizes a known step of acetic anhydride addition to eliminate or reduce the concentration of
residual hydroxyl groups in the process of preparing the inventive oligomeric dibenzoates, which
                                                 16
3428073v2

may result in the formation of hybrid, oligomeric benzoate/acetate           end-capped polyester
compositions. The inventive method is described below in terms of the propylene glycol adipic
acid end-capped with benzoic acid, although the method may be used to prepare other inventive
polyester plasticizers using diols and dibasic acids as described herein.
[00110]           As one embodiment, the inventive method provides for charging benzoic acid
(538 grams, 4.4 moles), adipic acid (1286 grams, 8.8 moles), propylene glycol (1048 grams, 13.8
moles) and zinc acetate as a catalyst (3.65 grams, 0.2% wt./Acid) to a 3 liter round bottom flask
equipped with a magnetic stirrer, distillation column packed with six inch stainless steel mesh,
distillation head with a 1 liter collection flask and a nitrogen inlet (100 mL/min.). The reaction
mixture was heated to 180'C and ramped to a temperature of 220'C at the rate of 10 0 C/hr. After
a minimum two-hour soak at maximum temperature, the pressure was slowly reduced to 120
mm/Hg over about 1 hour and then ramped down from 120 mm-Hg to 7 mm-Hg at
approximately 20 mm-Hg/hr.        The pressure reduction took about 6 hours. The pressure was
allowed to remain at 7 mm-Hg until the acidity was less than < 0.3%, or no less than 4 hours at
pressure. The product was filtered at 170-180' C through Whatman filter paper on a Buchner
funnel.    The product was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature and tested for Gardner
color, viscosity, acidity, and polydispersity.
[00111]           As described above, the inventive method utilizes a Zn(OAc) 2 (zinc acetate)
catalyst, which is an improvement over prior art methods using halogen-based catalysts for
preparing polyesters. The inventive method also introduces early ramping of temperatures of the
reaction mixture during the initial (esterification) phase of the process to minimize the presence
of free benzoic acid in the reaction mixture, which has a tendency to solidify in the distillation
column and condenser. In addition, pressure reduction is begun in the process when the acid
                                                  17
3428073v2

number is approximately 5, which also reduces the likelihood of benzoic acid clogging the
column.
[00112]          As discussed herein, a fraction of polyesters produced during the above
described process include residual hydroxyl groups, which are incomplete reaction products
formed during the preparation of the dual benzoic acid end-capped polyesters of the invention.
These undesirable residual hydroxyl groups affect compatibility in use.        To facilitate the
conversion of the residual hydroxyl end groups to ester end caps and drive the reaction to
completion, acetic anhydride may be added to reduce or eliminate the percentage of undesirable
free hydroxyl groups formed. As a result of acetic anhydride modification to the preparation
process, oligomeric polyesters end-capped with benzoate and acetate esters are formed. Excess
acetic anhydride can easily be removed as acetic acid upon contact with water.
[00113]          The amounts of components and their relative ratios may be adjusted in the
inventive method depending on the quantity of inventive material desired properties sought, or
the target Mn or Mw.
[00114]          Sources for components used to prepare the inventive plasticizers are known in
the art. Some of the reactants are available from natural sources, thereby allowing for greater
natural content and a greener product.
[001151          The inventive polyester end-capped compositions may be used as a plasticizer in
caulks, sealants, adhesives, vinyl and other polymeric dispersions, where plasticizers are
traditionally used.
[00116]          A large variety of homopolymers and copolymers may be used with the
inventive polyester plasticizers. As an example, for adhesives, any of the known polymers that
can be formulated into an adhesive can be used in combination with the novel inventive
                                                18

polyester plasticizers to prepare a lower VOC content, environmentally safe and non-hazardous
composition in accordance with the present invention. The inventive polyester plasticizers are
expected to be particularly useful in a wide variety of waterborne and non-aqueous adhesive
polymer compositions. Non-limiting examples of such polymers include, but are not limited to,
homopolymers and/or copolymers of: acrylics, polyvinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl acetate,
polyacrylates, methacrylates, styrene acrylates, polychloroprenes, polyurethanes, thermoplastic
polyurethanes, polysulfides, aminos, epoxies, polyamides, and nitriles.       Other polymer-based
compositions useful in adhesive applications that traditionally require plasticizers will be known
to one skilled in the art.
[00117]          The inventive polyester plasticizers may also be used in caulks and sealants, for
example in sealants based on polysulfides. A typical polysulfide insulating sealant formulation
(A side and B side) is disclosed in the examples.
[00118]          The polyester plasticizers of the present invention can generally be utilized with
numerous other thermoplastic, thermoset, or elastomeric polymers. In a preferred embodiment,
the inventive polyester plasticizers may be used to prepare a reduced viscosity PVC or acrylic
plastisol in accordance with the present invention.
[00119]          In addition to the materials identified above, other suitable polymeric materials
include without limitation homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride,
diethyl fumarate, diethyl maleate, polyvinyl butyral, polyurethanes, cellulose nitrate, and various
polyacrylates.    Particularly suitable acrylic polymer compositions include various polyalkyl
methacrylates, such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl
methacrylate, or allyl methacrylate; various aromatic methacrylates, such as for example benzyl
methacrylate; or various alkyl acrylates, such as for example methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate,
                                                 19
3428073v2

butyl acrylate, or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate; or various acrylic acids, such as methacrylic acid and
styrenated acrylics.
[00120]           Other polymers for which the inventive polyesters may be useful as a plasticizer
include epoxies, phenol-formaldehyde types; melamines; silyl-terminated polyethers and the
like. Still other polymers will be evident to one skilled in the art.
[00121]           The total amount of plasticizer used in any particular polymeric dispersion
ranges broadly depending on the particular polymer, the characteristics of the polymer and other
components, the process, the application or use and the results desired. By way of example only,
in adhesives, generally, plasticizer levels range in amounts from about 1 to about 50 wt.%,
preferably from about 5 to about 20 wt.%, based on the weight of the wet adhesive. Preferred
embodiments for an adhesive include 10 wt. % in homopolymer polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and 5
wt. % in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers. Other plasticizer levels useful in adhesives
are set forth in the examples.
[00122]           In caulks and sealants, the oligomeric dibenzoate plasticizers of the invention are
useful in levels ranging from about 5 to about 40 wt. %, based upon the weight to the total
composition. Useful levels are disclosed in the examples.
[00123]           In plastisols generally, plasticizers are used in amounts from about 30 to about
110, desirably from about 10 to about 100, and preferably from about 20 to about 80 parts by
weight for every 100 total parts by weight of the one or more thermoplastic, thermoset, or
elastomeric polymer that forms the composition, including without limitation any of the
polymers identified above. Non-limiting plastisol formulations are shown in the examples.
                                                   20
3428073v2

[00124]           The oligomeric dibenzoate plasticizers of the invention are useful in vinyl compositions
in amounts ranging from about 5 to about 60 wt. %, based upon the weight of the total composition.
Typical vinyl formulations are set forth in the examples.
[001251           It is expected that one skilled in the art would be able to arrive at additional
acceptable plasticizer levels on the intended use and desired performance in any particular
polymeric application.
[001261           The inventive polyester plasticizers may be used alone or as a substitute for
traditional plasticizers. They may also be, but are not required to be, blended with various other
conventional general purpose, specialty and/or secondary plasticizers to enhance or augment
properties of polymeric compositions, including but not limited to improving solvating
characteristics and compatibility and processability of a plastisol. Blending may be done with a
wide variety of conventional plasticizers that include, but are not limited to, phthalate esters,
dibenzoate esters, phosphate esters, various adipate, azelate, oleate, succinate and sebacate
compounds, terephthalate esters, such as DOTP, 1, 2-cyclohexane dicarboxylate esters, epoxy
plasticizers, fatty acid esters, glycol derivatives,          sulfonamides, and hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon derivatives that are often utilized as secondary plasticizers. Monobenzoates, such
as isononyl benzoate, isodecyl benzoate, 2-ethylhexyl benzoate, and 3-phenyl propyl benzoate
(3-PPB) and 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol          diisobutyrate, can also be blended with the
inventive polyester plasticizers.
[00127]           As discussed, particularly preferred applications for the inventive polyester
plasticizers are in blends of compatible monomeric plasticizers in polysulfide sealants,
waterborne PVAc and EVA adhesives, vinyl formulations, such as filled and unfilled plastisols
and films, and automotive plastisols including but not limited to underbody coatings and
                                                    21

sealants.    Other use applications are within the scope of the invention and include without
limitation other sealants, other waterborne and non-waterborne adhesives, packaging glues,
adhesive assemblies, labeling, laminates, envelopes, food packaging materials, wood glue,
construction adhesives, sound dampening materials, transportation product assemblies, electronic
product assembly, pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) applications, caulking, vinyl flooring and
melt compounded vinyl, although this list is by no means exhaustive. Still other uses will be
evident to one skilled in the art.
[00128]           Depending on application, the inventive polyester plasticizers may also be
combined with or include various amounts of conventional additives such as colorants,
surfactants, thickeners, biocides, fillers, polyvinyl alcohol, defoamers, humectants, antioxidants,
heat stabilizers, flame retardants, and the like.
[00129]           The invention is further described in the examples below. While the invention is
described in terms of propylene glycol adipate and propylene glycol succinate, end-capped with
benzoate or benzoate/acetate esters, the invention is not limited as such. Other diols useful in the
invention include without limitation 1,3-butane diol, 1,4-butane diol, and 1,3-propane diol and
mixtures thereof.     Useful dibasic acids include without limitation azelaic, phthalic, glutaric,
sebacic and terephthalic acid. Trimellitic anhydride, a tribasic acid, may also be useful.

                                                     Table 1 - Methodologies
A Side Preparation    Weighed out polymer into mixing vessel, then with mixing added remaining liquid components, mixed
                      on speed 1 with paddle mixer until liquids were well mixed (- 2 min.) Added filler in portions, making
                      sure each portion was well blended before adding the next. Continued mixing for 20-25 minutes.
                      Checked mixture on Hegman, continued mixing until the Hegman grind was 4 or higher.
B Side Preparation    Blended raw materials for 10 minutes at 200 RPM's using a dispersion blade. Ground the dispersed
                      mixture on the three roll mill set at an adequate gap until the grind was greater than 4 on a Hegman grind
                      gauge (3-5 passes).
Sealant Preparation   Mixed the A and B side together in a 10:1 volumetric ratio until the mixture was uniform in color.
Loop Test             ASTM D3291
Pot Life (Steady      A timer was started and the two sides were immediately mixed (10:1; A:B) together using a metal
Shear to 250 Pa-s)    spatula. Once mixed completely, the mixture was loaded onto the rheometer. When the run was
                      complete, the time at which the viscosity passed 250 Pa-s was recorded and added to the initial mixing
                      time. The parallel plates were set at a gap of 100 Am and run at a steady shear of 100 s -.
Roll Test             A tight loop of sealant was rolled with absorbent paper, then placed in an oven at 60" C for three days.
                      Compatibility was judged on degree of exudation in sum.
Shore A Hardness      A sample of 10:1 (A:B) was mixed until color was uniform, then degassed using the three roll mill. The
                      degassed sample was evenly spread into an aluminum weigh pan, which was then covered with a
                      polypropylene sheet. The sample was turned upside down and pressed using a glass plate. After one
                      hour, the polypropylene sheet was removed if possible, then tested using a Shore A hardness tester. The
                      initial hardness value was recorded. Tests were performed every hour between 1-4 hours, then every day
                      up until seven days, followed by weekly measurements.
Tensile Strength      Two polypropylene sheets were placed on two glass plates shimmed with three microscope slides. A
                      10:1 ratio of A:B were mixed until the color was uniform, then degassed using the three roll mill. The
                      sample was then scooped into the center of one of the polypropylene sheets, using caution to avoid
                      introducing bubbles. The sample was then topped with the second polypropylene sheet and glass plate
                      and pressed. After curing 24 hours, the samples were removed. Dogbones were cut using the ASTM
                      D412-C die, then pulled at 19.9 in/min. Tensile strength at break, 100% modulus (flexibility) and
                      elongation% were measured according to known, standard methods.
Lap Shear             The A and B components were mixed on a Hobart mixer until uniform, then degassed on the three roll
                      mill. Following the degassing the sealant was applied to 1-2 inches of substrate (either glass or
                      aluminum), then the second substrate (also either glass or aluminum) was applied to the top. The
                      specimen was then placed in ajig following ASTM C961. The specimens were cured at room
                      temperature for two days, then in an oven set at 70' C for six hours. The specimens were then allowed to
                      condition in the environmental room overnight (at a minimum) before being pulled on the tensile tester.
[001581             Inventive oligomeric dibenzoates based on propylene glycol adipate of different
molecular weights (X-121 and X-124) were compared to a traditional high molecular weight
benzyl phthalate (TBP) plasticizer in a self-curing, two-part polysulfide-insulating glass type
sealant. The inventive plasticizers were incorporated on the B side of the sealant consisting of
the catalyst suspended in plasticizer(s).
[00159]             FIG. 1 shows steady shear (to 100 s-1) viscosity results (Pa-s at 30 seconds)
obtained for each plasticizer on the B side. The results show that the inventive propylene glycol
                                                                27

adipate benzoate oligomers had slightly higher viscosity results, but overall compared favorably
to the traditional benzyl phthalate (TBP) in terms of viscosity.
[00160]           There are two reasons why viscosity is a critical parameter in the B-side. The
first is to maintain the suspension of the catalyst during long-term storage.           The second
requirement is that the viscosities of the A and B sides are closely matched so that they can be
easily mixed together.
[00161]           The stability of the suspension of the B side was measured by centrifuging the
control B-side (containing TBP as a plasticizer) and the X-124 experimental blend B-side at
1000 RPM's for one hour and measuring the extent of any separation or solids settling. Neither
the control nor the experimental B-side showed any evidence of settling.             All had good
suspension stability.
[00162]           Shore A results obtained over time (0-72 hrs) for polysulfide sealants comprising
INBP (A-side plasticizer)/TBP(B-side plasticizer) (as a typical polysulfide control), INBP/X-121
and INBP/X-124 plasticizer blends are shown in FIG. 2. The results for all compositions are
comparable and show that both of the inventive polyester plasticizer blends are efficient in the
polysulfide sealant.     The results demonstrate that X-121 and X-124 are good candidates to
substitute for a traditional benzyl phthalate in a polysulfide application.
[00163]           FIGS. 3 and 4 show tensile strength (psi), modulus (100%, psi)) and elongation
(%) properties for polysulfide sealant samples comprising the INBP/TBP control, INBP/X-121,
975P/X-121 and 975P/X-124 plasticizer blends at one-day and four weeks, respectively.           The
975P was utilized as a phthalate alternative in the A-side. The results show that, over time, the
sample containing the inventive oligomeric dibenzoate X-121 in combination with INBP
performed comparably to the INBP/TBP control. The results also showed that the X-121 and X
                                                   28

124 polyester plasticizers of the invention combined with the dibenzoate triblend plasticizer
performed comparably to the INBP/TBP control as well. These results again demonstrate that
X-121 and X-124 are good candidates to substitute for the traditional benzyl phthalate in a
plasticizer blend for a polysulfide sealant. They also show that the dibenzoate triblend is a very
viable alternative as a plasticizer blend for use on the A-side of a polysulfide sealant.
[00164]           Roll tests for compatibility were conducted at 60'C and results (not shown) were
obtained for the INBP/TBP control and the INBP/X-124 blend in the polysulfide sealant. The
results reflect that the INBP/X-124 blend is slightly less compatible over time (rating of "0" at
day 1, "1" at day 2 and "2" at day 3) than the INBP/TBP control (consistent "0" rating). The
results, while not perfect, still reflected acceptable compatibility.
[001651           Loop test results (not shown) for both samples were rated after 7 days of testing.
Both samples rated "0" after 7 days, thus establishing the compatibility of the polyester
plasticizer blend in polysulfide applications.
[00166]           Pot Life - (Time to 250 Pa-s) results were obtained for seven sealant samples
comprising:      INBP/TBP      (control), INBP/X-121,     INBP/X-124, 850S/X-121,        850S/X-124,
975P/X-121 and 975P/X-124 plasticizer blends. Results are shown in FIG. 5. The results reflect
very similar pot life for the X-124 blends as compared to the INBP/TBP control. Results for the
X-121 blends reflect a shorter pot life, indicating that this plasticizer could be used in sealants
needing an accelerated cure cycle.
[00167]           Lap shear and maximum shear stress show the strength of the sealant bond. Lap
shear results (stress at break, psi) were obtained for the INBP/TBP control, INBP/X-121,
975P/X-121 and 975P/X-124 blends of aluminum to aluminum (Al/Al), glass to glass (Gl/Gl)
and aluminum to glass (A1/Gl) samples.           The results shown in FIG. 6 reflect very similar
                                                   29

performance between the samples evaluated, with the inventive oligomeric benzoates showing
comparable or better results over the INBP/TBP control blend.
[00168]          Overall, the results above show that the inventive oligomeric dibenzoates
plasticizers performed very well in polysulfide applications and provide a viable alternative over
traditional phthalate plasticizers.

[00181]          A Loop Test for compatibility with the PVC polymer was conducted for the TBP
control and X-151 samples with readings taken at 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks
as set forth in FIG. 7. The TBP plastisol had a reading of "0" at all times, indicating excellent
compatibility. X-151 plastisol had a rating of "0" at four hours and 1 day. A rating of "1" was
recorded at 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks, reflecting good compatibility with the polymer. The
results show that X- 151 is a viable alternative plasticizer for this application.
[00182]          Initial shear results (400 gap) are shown in FIG. 8 for both the TBP and X-151
plastisol samples. The X-151 plasticizer sample had higher initial viscosity. One-day and three
day shear results are shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, which reflect good viscosity and stable rheology
for the X-151 sample over time as compared with a traditional industry phthalate.
[00183]          Gel fusion data shows the relative solvation characteristics of plasticizers.
Gel/fusion curves were obtained for the TBP and X- 151 plastisols. The results shown in FIG. 11
demonstrate that the inventive oligomeric dibenzoate has very good solvation characteristics

[00185]          A Loop test was conducted on the plastisol and ratings were made at 4 hours, 1
day and 1 week. X-151 had a "0" rating at 4 hours and 1 day. The rating increased to "1" at 1
week. The data (not shown) reflected good compatibility with the PVC polymer.
[00186]         A Roll test was conducted and ratings were made at 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days
(data not shown). X-151 had a rating of "0" at 1 day, which increased to about "2" at 2 days and
3 days. While not perfect, the data reflected acceptable compatibility with the PVC polymer.

Caps in Plastisol - Initial Screen.
[00188]          The adipate-based inventive plasticizer (X-121) was compared to the high
molecular weight, monomeric benzyl phthalate plasticizer TBP in the standard unfilled plastisol
formulation shown above in Table 3.
[00189]         Both plasticizers were utilized at 100 phr levels.
[00190]          Methodologies utilized are the same as in Example 2 above.

[00191]          Viscosity levels (mPa-s) obtained for the two plastisols (initial, one-day and
three-day) are shown in FIG. 12 and reflect that the inventive plasticizer (X-121) surprisingly is
stable in vinyl at a lower viscosity than the phthalate ester.
[00192]          Initial, one-day shear and three-day shear results obtained for the unfilled
plastisol samples are shown in FIGS. 13-15, respectively, and reflect very good, stable rheology
characteristics for the inventive adipate-based oligomeric dibenzoate (X-121).
[00193]           Surprisingly, despite being a higher molecular weight oligomeric molecule, the
gel fusion curve comparing the two plastisols (shown in FIG. 16) reflects very similar results for
the inventive plasticizer (X-121) and the traditional benzyl phthalate (TBP) plastisols, which is
surprising.
[00194]           The compatibility roll test shown in FIG. 17 reflects a higher rating for the
plastisol sample comprising inventive plasticizer X-121, while the compatibility loop test in FIG.
18 reflects almost identical results for the inventive plasticizer.     Based on these results, the
inventive oligomeric dibenzoate X-121 was deemed to be compatible in the PVC plastisol.
[00195]           The inventive plasticizer (X-121) was compared to the same industry standard
phthalate ester plasticizer, TBP, in the standard "filled" PVC plastisol formulation shown in
Table 2, above. Both plasticizers were utilized at levels of 100 phr.
[00196]          Viscosity levels (mPa-s) obtained for the two plastisols at initial, one-day, three
day and seven-day intervals are shown in FIG. 19. Surprisingly, X-121, despite the fact that it is
a high solvator, was found to be stable in vinyl at a lower viscosity than the phthalate ester.
[00197]          Initial and one-day shear rates obtained for the filled plastisol samples are shown
in FIGS. 20 and 21.      The results demonstrate good rheological characteristics for the adipate
based oligomeric dibenzoate X-121.

[001981           The gel fusion curve (FIG. 22) reflects similar gel/fusion characteristics for the
inventive plasticizer (X-121) versus the higher molecular weight phthalate ester.
[00199]           The compatibility roll data (not shown) for the inventive X-121 plasticizer in the
filled plastisol composition was rated "1" as compared to the phthalate ester which rated "0".
The compatibility loop data (not shown) for both plasticizers in the filled composition was "0".
[00200]           Overall, the above results obtained for the inventive adipate-based oligomeric
dibenzoate     plasticizer  (X-121)   reflect   good  compatibility    and   comparable    rheology
characteristics as compared to the phthalate (TBP) control, with enhanced solvation and viscosity
characteristics.   The results show that the inventive plasticizers are very good substitutes for
higher molecular weight traditional phthalate ester plasticizers.
[00201]           In the case of the polysulfide sealant evaluation (Example 1), the inventive
oligomeric dibenzoate plasticizers offer good compatibility with the polysulfide polymer,
enhanced by the polarity of the benzoic acid end caps.

70'C for seven days, making sure that the samples do not float. Dry samples with a Kimwipe
and weigh them.       Place the samples in an oven at 70'C for four hours to completely dry,
followed by reweighing once cooled.

weigh each sample on an analytical balance. Place the samples in an oven at 70'C for four hours

[00209]          The process for preparing the inventive polyester end-capped plasticizer
compositions was modified to reduce free or unreacted, residual hydroxyl content by adding
acetic anhydride to the preparation process. The resulting inventive hybrid (benzoate/acetate
end-caps) plasticizer had reduced hydroxyl content and was less prone to water extraction and
reactivity in use applications. An evaluation comparing the inventive adipate-based oligomeric
dibenzoate plasticizers prepared without acetic anhydride in the process (X-121) with the
inventive oligomeric hybrid benzoate/acetate end-capped polyester plasticizer prepared with
acetic anhydride in the process (X- 131) was conducted using a basic PVC plastisol formulation

[00211]          The results above show that the inventive oligomeric polyester plasticizers
prepared by adding acetic anhydride to the preparation process had a greater resistance to
extraction by water and acceptable compatibility.           This will result in better longer term
performance in PVC applications where exposure to weathering is expected. Additionally, since
the plasticizer will not be as easy to extract, it can perform better as a plasticizer (continue to
soften properly).

[00213]         Methodology:
[00214]         Viscosity - as above in Example 2.
[002151          Glass Transition Temperature:     DSC Glass Transition Method: 10 mil (wet)
films were drawn down on glass and left to dry overnight.        After 24 hours, the films were
removed from the plates and approximately 10 mg were placed in a closed aluminum DSC pan.
The temperature was equilibrated at -75 C, then ramped at 50 C/min to 65'C. Glass transition
was measured as the onset of Tg.
[00216]          Set Time: Set time determinations were made using two strips of 50 lb.
unbleached Kraft paper measuring 1"x 14" (top piece) and 1.5" x 14" (bottom piece). A small
amount of adhesive was applied to the bottom strip, and a #20 wire wound rod metered the
adhesive onto the bottom strip while a #16 wire wound rod (rubber banded to the #20)
simultaneously pressed down the top strip. A timer was then immediately started and the strips
were pulled apart until significant force was required to tear apart the strips and fiber tear was
noted. Time at this point was recorded as the set time. A minimum of three repetitions were
performed. Evaluations were performed blind.
[00217]          Open Time: A 1.5" x 14" piece of 50 lb. unbleached Kraft paper was placed on a
glass surface, with a 1" x 14" piece of Kraft clipped to its top, rolled back so that the bottom
piece was left uncovered. The top piece was sandwiched between a #0 and a #14 wire wound
rod with the #0 on top. A small amount of adhesive was applied to the top of the bottom strip
and a #20 wire wound rod metered out the adhesive over the entire strip. A timer was started,
and at a specified time interval (with intervals of 5 seconds) the top strip was laminated to the
bottom using the #0 rod. The strips were then peeled apart and assessed for adhesion and fiber
                                                37

tear. This process was repeated until a specific time interval was confirmed in duplicate as the
last time interval to result in significant fiber tear/adhesion. Evaluations were performed blind.
[00218]           The adipate-based inventive polyester end-capped with benzoic acid esters (X
121) was evaluated in two waterborne adhesives and compared to a traditional dibenzoate
(diethylene glycol dibenzoate/propylene glycol dibenzoate) diblend (K-FLEX* 850S or KF850S,
an industry standard for use in adhesives). The waterborne adhesive utilized in this evaluation
was polyvinyl acetate homopolymer (PVAc) (PACE* 383 by Fuller). X-121 and KF850S were
compared at levels in PVA of 5, 10, 15 and 20% by weight, wet.
[00219]          FIG. 23 shows initial viscosity measurements (mPa-s) obtained for X-121 and
KF850S PVAc samples.            The results reflect comparable viscosity, with a lower viscosity
achieved by the X-121 PVAc samples at the 15 and 20 weight percent levels.              Even so, the
viscosity for X-121 is still good. The results suggest that X-121 is less efficient; however, these
results are useful as a formulation tool as less water would be needed to achieve a processing
viscosity. In this way, the adhesive with X-121 can have a higher solids content at comparable
viscosity/performance levels.
[00220]          Viscosity measurements (mPa-s) at one-day, three-day and seven-day (FIGS. 24,
25 and 26 respectively) were obtained for both PVAc samples.                The results showed that
inventive X-121 plasticizer has comparable viscosity stability over time as compared to a
traditional dibenzoate diblend (KF850S) used in adhesives.
[00221]           Glass transition temperatures (Tg) obtained for the PVAc samples are reflected
in FIG. 27. Glass transition temperature is the temperature at which mechanical properties of a
plastic (adhesive) change radically.       As such, it defines the temperature range to which the
adhesive may be exposed. The results reflect similar Tg at 5 wt. % levels. At higher plasticizer
                                                    38

levels, results are comparable but with a demonstrated advantage for the dibenzoate blend
plasticizer in cold temperatures at higher plasticizer levels. Even so, the X-121 sample still
depresses Tg effectively to make it very useful in adhesive products.
[00222]           Set and open times (sec.) obtained for the PVAc samples are reflected in FIGS.
28 and 29, respectively. Set times are comparable over the levels evaluated. Open times with X
121 were lower than for the dibenzoate diblend. These properties are important as formulation
tools to tailor the properties achieved with each plasticizer to a particular application.
[00223]           Example 6 - Waterbome Adhesive Evaluation in EVA
[00224]           The plasticizers (X-121 and KF850S) of Example 5 were evaluated and
compared in an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer adhesive (EVA) (Elvace* 735 by Fuller) at 5,
10 and 15% by weight, wet.
[002251           FIG. 30 shows initial viscosity measurements (mPa-s) obtained for X-121 and
KF850S samples.        The results reflect lower viscosity for the X-121 plasticizer as plasticizer
levels increased at the 10 and 15 weight percent levels.
[00226]           Viscosity measurements (mPa- s) at one-day, three-day and seven-day (FIGS. 31,
32 and 33, respectively) were obtained for both samples. The results reflect that the inventive X
121 plasticizer had comparable or better viscosity stability over time as compared to the
traditional dibenzoate diblend.
[00227]           Glass transition temperatures (Tg) obtained for the samples are reflected in FIG.
34. The results show a slight advantage in Tg suppression for the traditional dibenzoate at cold
temperatures, but results are still comparable.
[00228]           Set and open times (sec.) obtained for the samples are reflected in FIGS. 35 and
36 respectively. Comparable results were obtained for both samples.

[002411          The following plasticizers were evaluated: DINP, DOTP, X- 121, X- 124 and X
131. All plasticizers were used at 50 phr.
[00242]          Time to fusion (minutes) results (mill fusion) obtained for the samples are
reflected in FIG. 37. All of the inventive polyester plasticizers had better (lower) fusion times as
compared to the traditional phthalate plasticizers, DINP and DOTP, which is an advantage over
typical polymeric plasticizers that are slower to fuse.
[00243]          Shore A hardness results obtained initially and at 10 seconds for each sample are
set forth in FIG. 38. Results reflect higher Shore A hardness results for compounds comprising
the inventive plasticizers as compared to the phthalate samples.
[00244]          Volatile Loss (%) results obtained for each sample at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days are
set forth in FIG. 39. The results show that all three inventive plasticizers performed the same,
but all three had a greater loss (of plasticizer) as compared to the traditional phthalates likely due
to some low molecular weight fractions inherent in polymeric plasticizers. Overall, due to the
high molecular weights of the inventive polyester plasticizers, volatility in the long term is
expected to be low, after the lower molecular weight fractions volatilize off.
[00245]          As shown in FIG. 40, the inventive plasticizers demonstrated excellent extraction
resistance in heptane, soapy water and peanut oil as compared to the two phthalates.

was also conducted by hanging the film in a bottle over water at 600 C overnight, followed by
surface energy testing. These tests are indicators of aging and compatibility and resistance to
water extraction as well as printability of the vinyl film.

formulation set forth in Table 9, using 0, 25, 35 and 45 phr of the X-121 and X-124 plasticizers.

[00267]          Example 10 - Automotive Plastisol Sealants & Underbody Coatings Evaluation
[00268]          Plasticizers (X-121 and X-124) were tested in automotive plastisol sealants and
underbody coatings. The plasticizers were tested with other plasticizers (such as tributyl
phosphate/diisononyl phthalate). It was found that the blends with X-121 and X-124 have higher
initial Burrell Severs viscosity.

[00288]          The automotive seam sealants results indicate that the X-121 and X-124 offer the
potential as an offset to higher phthalates. Furthermore, the possibility of wet on wet use exists.
Furthermore, the results suggest that the reduction or elimination of the use of copolymers exists
with dibenzoates.
[00289]          The automotive underbody coating results suggests that X-121 functions well in
the coating, is a good solvator and provides damping. Furthermore, dibenzoates are significantly
better on their own in regards to processing. However, the results indicate that the dibenzoates
can be still be used in combination with plasticizers to improve processing
