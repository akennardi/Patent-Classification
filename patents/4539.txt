            TREATMENT OF ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY ASSOCIATED
                                                                    SYMPTOMS
                   This application is a divisional application of Australian ApplicationNo. 2015315431
   the specification and drawings of which as originally filed are incorporated herein in their
 5 entirety by reference.
                   The present invention relates to the treatment of Androgen Deprivation Therapy
   associated                   symptoms                    using  (S)-(7-cyano-4-pyridin-2-ylmethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro
   cyclopenta[b]indol-2-yl)-carbamic acid isopropyl ester, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
   thereof.
10                 The present invention is in the field of treatment of symptoms associated with
   Androgen Deprivation Therapy.                                  Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) or androgen
   suppression therapy is a common therapy used to decrease the aggressiveness of prostate
   cancer in conjunction with other therapeutic options focused on the eradication of the cancer.
   During ADT, the levels of androgens, or male hormones, are reduced in the body to prevent
15 them from reaching prostate cancer cells.                                    Androgens, such as testosterone       and
   dihydrotestosterone (DHT), stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. However, it has
   been discovered that prostate cancers may grow more slowly or even shrink if androgen levels
   are lowered. In the United States, it is estimated that approximately one third of prostate
   cancer patients will have received ADT at some point during the treatment of their disease.
20                 There are several treatment options available to lower androgen levels, such as
   orchiectomy or surgical castration, luteinizing hormone-relasing hormone (LHRH) analogs,
   such as leuprolide (marketed in the United States as Lupron@, Eligard@), goserelin (marketed
   in the United States as Zoladex@), triptorelin (marketed in the United States as Trelstar@), and
   histrelin (marketed in the United States as Vantas@), and LHRH antagonists, such as degarelix
25 (marketed in the United States as Firmagon@) and abiraterone (marketed in the United States
   as Zytiga@).
                   Most men with advanced prostate cancer respond well to ADT. ADT is typically
   indicated when prostate cancers extend beyond the prostate capsule based upon clinical
   staging (T3 disease),                               when first line in metastatic prostate cancer with GnRH
30 agonists/antagonists or chemical castration.

                There are potential side effects associated with hormone therapy which can have
detrimental effects on quality of life and increase the risks of patient discontinuation of the
ADT therapy. For example, the side effects can include reduced or absent libido, erectile

    dysfunction, shrinking of the male sexual organs, hot flashes, osteoporosis, anemia,
    reduced muscle mass, decreased muscle strength, increase in body fat, and weight gain,
    due to the changes in the levels of the hormones testosterone and estrogen. Current
    treatments for the side effects associated with ADT are known in the art. See US
 5  2009/0143344 (hot flashes - 5HT2A or D2R antagonist); US 2007/0281977 (hot flashes
    muscarinic receptor antagonist); US 2008/0080143 (osteoporosis, bone fractures, loss of
    BMD, hot flashes gynochomastia, hair loss ---torimifene). However, there remains a need
    in the art for alternate therapies wherein certain side effects of ADT may be reduced. In
    fact, until recently, intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) was recommended to attempt
10  to minimize the adverse effects of medical castration by withdrawing treatment in patients
    who have responded to ADT and then reinstituting ADT when there is evidence of
    recurrent or progressive disease. However, a trial of 1749 patients randomized to
    continuous ADT versus IAD for a median follow-up of 9.8 years demonstrated that
    continuous ADT is superior to IAD. A therapy to improve tolerability of the side effects
15  of ADT could lead to improvements in compliance and result in better outcomes to
    patients.
            Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have been found to display a
    differentiated profile of activity in androgenic tissues. In particular, such agents preferably
    display androgen agonist activity in anabolic tissues such as muscle or bone, yet are only
20  partial agonists or even antagonists in other androgenic tissues such as the prostate or
    seminal vesicles. Thus, the use of an androgen receptor (AR) modulator may alleviate the
    symptoms of ADT for prostate cancer patients.
            Figure 1 illustrates that Example 1 resulted in no significant accrual of seminal
    vesicle weight after treatment of 8 weeks in a rat orchidectomized for 8 weeks and which
25  was hyper responsive to any androgenic stimulation.
            Figure 2 illustrates that Example 1 resulted in significant accrual of, lumbar
    vertebra trabecular bone mineral density (LV-TBMD) and showed a trend towards
    increase in lumbar vertebra trabecular bone mineral content (LV-TBMC), and cross
    sectional area (LV-TA) after treatment of 8 weeks in a rat orchidectomized for 8 weeks.

            Figure 3 illustrates that the combination with testosterone enanthate (TE) (1
    mg/Kg-day) and various doses of Example 1 suggest a trend in decreasing seminal vesicle
    wet weight in mg normalized to body weight in grams, which is induced by TE alone.
            Figure 4 illustrates that co-treatment of Example 1 to SD rats along with 1 mg/Kg
 5  TE resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in prostate wet weight in milligrams normalized
    to body weight in grams.
            Figure 5 illustrates that the combination with TE (1 mg/Kg-day) and various doses
    of Example 1 suggest a trend in decreasing seminal vesicle wet weight in milligrams
    normalized to body weight in grams, which is induced by TE alone.
10          Figure 6 illustrates that the co-treatment of Example 1 to SD rats along with 1
    mg/Kg TE results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostate wet weight in milligrams
    normalized to body weight in grams.
            Figure 7 illustrates an increase in calf muscle area as measured by peripheral
    Computer Tomography based imaging at the gastrocnemius bundle (calf muscle area) after
15  administration of Example 1 to healthy human volunteers.
            Figure 8 illustrates an increase in whole body lean muscle mass after
    administration of Example 1 to healthy human volunteers as measured by DEXA. The
    effect in males (blue bar) at the 5 mg dose level is statistically significant compared to the
    0 mg placebo dose, using a Dunnett's test (p<0.05).
20          Figure 9 illustrates that there are no significant changes from baseline in prostate
    specific antigen (SPA) levels when compared with placebo at any time point or any dose
    of Example 1.
            Figure 10 illustrates a decrease in serum testosterone levels after administration of
    Example 1 to eugonadal healthy human volunteers. The decrease after treatment is more
25  pronounced in males given their relatively higher serum testosterone levels. The table on
    the right reflects the exposure assessment after the Phla study at the 5 mg dose.
            Figure 11 illustrates a positive exposure-response relationship for N-terminal
    propeptide of procollagen type 1 (P1NP), a biomarker for bone anabolism, after
    administration of Example 1 to eugonadal healthy human volunteers.

             As used herein, the term "patient" refers to a human.
10           As used herein, the terms "treating", "to treat", or "treatment", include restraining,
    slowing, stopping, reducing, or reversing the progression or severity of an existing
    symptom, disorder, condition, or disease.
             As used herein, the terms "Ti -T4" refer to the T category of the TNM staging
    system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) to describe how far a cancer
15  has spread. The T category indicates the presence of tumors and describes the extent of
    the primary tumor. Higher numbers indicate increased size, extent, or degree of
    penetration. Each cancer type has specifics to classify under the number. For prostate
    cancer, TI indicates that the doctor cannot feel the tumor or see it with imaging such as
    transrectal ultrasound. T2 indicates that the doctor can feel the cancer with a digital rectal
20  exam (DRE) or see it with imaging such as transrectal ultrasound, but it still appears to be
    confined to the prostate gland. T3 indicates that the cancer has begun to grow and spread
    outside the prostate and may have spread into the seminal vesicles. T4 indicates that the
    cancer has grown into tissues next to the prostate (other than the seminal vesicles), such as
    the urethral sphincter (muscle that helps control urination), the rectum, the bladder, and/or
25  the wall of the pelvis.
             As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to the amount or dose of
    compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, upon administration

   WO 2016/040234                                                              PCT/US2015/048801

    to the patient, provides the desired effect in the patient under diagnosis or treatment. In
    determining the effective amount for a patient, a number of factors are considered by the
    attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to the patient's size, age, and general
    health; the specific disease or disorder involved; the degree of or involvement or the
 5  severity of the disease or disorder; the response of the individual patient; the particular
    compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of
    the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant
    medication; and other relevant circumstances.
             The compound of Formula I and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are generally
10  effective over a broad dosage range. For example, dosages per day of individual agents
    normally fall within the range of about 1 mg/day to about 1000 mg/day, preferably about 1
    mg/day to about 500 mg/day, about 1 mg/day to about 250 mg/day, about 1 mg/day to
    about 100 mg/day, 1 mg/day to about 75 mg/day, and 1 mg/day to about 25 mg/day. Most
    preferably, dosages per day of individual agents normally fall within the range of about 1
15  mg/day to about 5 mg/day. Most preferably the compound of Formula I is used at a dose
    per day selected from 1 mg, 5mg, 25 mg, and 75 mg per day.
             An androgen receptor modulator compound of Formula I is preferably formulated
    as a pharmaceutical composition administered by any route which makes the compound
    bioavailable. The route of administration may be varied in any way, limited by the
20  physical properties of the drugs and the convenience of the patient and the caregiver.
    Preferably, an androgen receptor modulator compound of Formula I is formulated for oral
    or parenteral administration including intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Such
    pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing same are well known in the art.
    (See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (D.B. Troy, Editor, 21st
25  Edition, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2006).
             It is preferred that the compound of Formula I is the free base.

    elute from chiral chromatography first and second, respectively, and if chiral
20  chromatography is initiated early in the synthesis, the same designation is applied to
    subsequent intermediates and examples. Additionally, certain intermediates described in
    the following schemes may contain one or more nitrogen protecting groups. The variable
    protecting group may be the same or different in each occurrence depending on the
    particular reaction conditions and the particular transformations to be performed. The
25  protection and de-protection conditions are well known to the skilled artisan and are
    described in the literature (See for example "Greene's Protective Groups in Organic

                                 Four week oral toxicity study in rats
             This study is conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity and toxicokinetics of
    Example 1 in rats after 4 weeks of exposure.      Three treatment groups of 10 male and 10
15  female CD* [Crl:CD*(SD)] rats are administered the test article at respective dose levels
    of 15, 150, and 1500 mg/kg/day.      One additional group of 10 animals/sex serves as the

    Dow Coming Antifoam 1510-US in reverse osmosis-derived purified water.             The test
    article or vehicle is administered to all groups via oral gavage, once a day for 28
    consecutive days, at a dose volume of 15 mL/kg. Additionally, three groups of 18
    animals/sex/group serves as toxicokinetic (TK) animals and receives the test article in the
 5  same manner and dose volume as the main study groups at respective dose levels of 15,
    150, and 1500 mg/kg/day.       One additional group of three animals/sex serves as
    the toxicokinetic control and receives the vehicle in the same manner and dose volume as
    the treated groups.
             Observations for morbidity, mortality, injury, and the availability of food and water
10  are conducted twice daily for all animals.     Observations for clinical signs are conducted
    weekly for main study animals only.       Body weights were measured and recorded weekly
    for all animals and food consumption is measured and recorded weekly for main study
    animals. Ophthalmoscopic examinations are conducted pretest on all animals and prior to
    terminal necropsy for main study animals only.       Blood samples for clinical pathology
15  evaluations are collected from all main study animals at necropsy.      Urine samples are
    collected on the last day of dosing. Blood samples for determination of the plasma
    concentrations of the test article are collected from TK animals at designated time points
    on Days 1 and 28. After the final blood collection, the TK animals are euthanized and the
    carcasses are discarded without further evaluation.     Liver samples for hepatic enzyme
20  induction analysis are collected at terminal necropsy from main study animals.       At study
    termination, necropsy examinations are performed, organ weights are recorded, and
    prostate and seminal vesicle tissues are microscopically examined.       Additional
    microscopic examination is performed on the left testis from the first five male rats/group
    at necropsy.    The ovary, uterus with cervix, vagina, and mammary gland of females are
25  determined to be target organs.
             Following a protocol essentially as described above, systemic exposure (AUCo_
    24h) was highly variable and increased in a less-than-dose- proportional manner with
    exposure in females exceeding that seen in males. There was no evidence of hepatic
    microsomal enzyme induction following 28 days of dosing.
30           There were no unscheduled deaths during the study, and no test article-related
    clinical signs. Body weight and food consumption were greater among females that

    received > 150 mg/kg/day relative to controls.       These effects did not impact the overall
    health of the animals and are not considered to be adverse.      There were no body weight
    or food consumption effects evident in males.
            There were no test article-related effects on hematology, coagulation, or urinalysis
 5  parameters in either sex and no test article-related effects on clinical chemistry parameters
    in males.    Test article-related effects on clinical chemistry parameters in females were
    limited to increases in alkaline phosphatase at dosages of 150 and 1500 mg/kg/day (1.33
    and 1.45-fold increases, respectively), decreases in total protein at dosages of 150 and
    1500 mg/kg/day (9% and 10% decreases, respectively), decreases in albumin at dosages of
10  150 and 1500 mg/kg/day (12 % decrease at both dosages) and decreases in globulins at
    1500 mg/kg/day only (11% decrease relative to controls). These changes are of minimal
    magnitude and are not considered to be adverse.
            There were no test article-related macroscopic or organ weight changes in either
    sex and no test article-related microscopic changes in males.      Test article-related
15  microscopic changes were present in females in the mammary gland and ovaries at dose
    levels > 15 mg/kg/day and in the uterus (with cervix) and vagina at dose levels > 150
    mg/kg/day.     These microscopic changes, which are consistent with a dose-related
    prolongation of the reproductive cycle in female rats at dose levels > 150 mg/kg/day, are
    considered to be related to the pharmacology of the test article and are not considered to be
20  adverse.
            Based on the results outlined above, the NOAEL for this study is considered to be
    1500 mg/kg/day, the highest dose administered. Mean steady- state systemic exposure
    (AUCo-2 4 ) at the NOAEL dose of 1500 mg/kg/day was 102337 ng*hr/mL in males and
    216853 ng*hr/mL in females.

                                 Six month oral toxicity study in rats
            The purpose of this study is to investigate the toxicity and to determine the
    toxicokinetics of Example 1 in the Sprague-Dawley rat following daily oral gavage for 26
    weeks and to assess the reversibility of any findings following a recovery period of 12
30  weeks. Treated animals receive Example 1 in 5% Vitamin E TPGS, 1%
    hydroxyethylcellulose, 0.05% Dow Corning Antifoam 1510-US in purified water by oral

    gavage at daily doses of 15, 150, or 1500 mg/kg/day. Vehicle controls (15 rats/sex in main
    study and 5 rats/sex in recovery study) are given daily oral gavage dose of 5% Vitamin E
    TPGS, 1%hydroxyethylcellulose, 0.05% Dow Coming Antifoam 15 10-US in purified
    water. Fifteen males and 15 females are assigned to each treatment main study group.
 5  Five males and 5 females are assigned to the recovery study for the vehicle control and
    150 mg/kg/day groups. Additional satellite groups of 6 rats/sex for the vehicle control
    group and 12 rats/sex for the Example 1-treated groups are evaluated for toxicokinetics.
    All administrations are given in a 15 mL/kg volume.
             Following daily oral gavage administration, exposure to Example 1 is highly
10  variable at all doses although non-overlapping mean AUC(0-24h) values are observed in
    both males and females between the lowest and highest doses, particularly at Days 91 and
    182. Generally, single-dose and multiple dose exposures (Cmax and AUC(0-24h))
    increase less than proportionally from 15 to 1500 mg/kg/day for both males and females.
    Females exhibit higher exposures than males on all days. On Day 1, female exposure is up
15  to 7-fold higher than the males but this difference decreases to I to 3-fold by Day 182.
    After multiple doses, accumulation of Example 1 is not observed for any dose group up to
    Day 182.
             Following a protocol essentially as described above, there were no mortalities
    attributed to Example 1 administration during the course of the study. There were no
20  compound-related effects on ophthalmology, or urinalysis parameters.
             Example 1-related clinical signs were noted in a dose-dependent fashion in the
    treated females and consisted of an increase in the incidence of oily fur and a decrease in
    the incidence of thin cover of the fur. During the first 6 weeks of the recovery period, oily
    fur was also noted in the females previously treated with 150 mg/kg/day, but was no
25  longer present in these animals in the latter half of the 12-week recovery period. There
    was no difference in the incidence of thin cover of the fur in the treated and the control
    females at the end of the recovery period.
             In males treated with Example 1, there was a decrease in body weight at all dose
    levels, reaching -12% when compared to control males at the end of the treatment period.
30  In females, there was an opposite trend, with treated females reaching a 22% higher body

   WO 2016/040234                                                                PCT/US2015/048801
                                                   -25
    weight than concurrent controls at the end of the treatment period. The change in males
    was still noted at the end of the recovery period, but not in females.
             Treated males showed lower food consumption, and treated females generally
    showed higher food consumption than controls throughout the study correlating with the
 5  treatment-related effects on body weight. Food consumption for treated males remained
    lower than controls during the recovery period, but the magnitude of the difference became
    negligible at the end of the 12-week period. There was no difference in food consumption
    of the treated females as compared to the controls during the recovery period.
             Administration of Example 1 at dosages >150 mg/kg/day was associated with
10  increased neutrophil count, absolute reticulocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, potassium
    and decreased globulins in females. There was an increase in aspartate aminotransferase,
    alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase and total
    bilirubin at 1500 mg/kg/day in males. Minimal decreased total protein and albumin was
    observed in females at all dose levels. Following a 12-week recovery period, there were
15  no differences in the hematology, clinical biochemistry and urinalysis parameters in rats
    receiving 150 mg/kg/day indicating reversibility of those findings.
             Findings related to treatment with Example 1 were primarily associated with male
    and female reproductive tissues and were in general attributed to the pharmacology of the
    molecule. Adverse findings were confined to the testes and occurred in all Example 1
20  treated groups. There was a decrease in testes and epididymides weight in the 1500
    mg/kg/day group, and in individual males given 15 or 150 mg/kg/day that had testicular
    lesions. Macroscopic findings in male reproductive tissues related to administration of
    Example 1 were observed in testes and epididymides. Soft and/or small testes and small
    epididymides were observed in males given >50 mg/kg/day and a single male given 15
25  mg/kg/day. Microscopic findings in the testes were seen at all dose levels, were
    degenerative in nature and included depletion of elongating spermatids, interstitial cell
    atrophy, and single cell necrosis of spermatocytes. The testicular findings were consistent
    with decreased circulating luteinizing hormone (LH) resulting in decreased LH signaling
    at the level of the interstitial cells. Moreover, the decrease in circulating LH levels
30  resulted in decreased testosterone secretion from the testes thereby reducing androgen
    signaling at the level of the seminiferous tubules. Treatment with Example 1 was also

   WO 2016/040234                                                            PCT/US2015/048801
                                                 -26
    associated with decreased prostate weight observed in males given ?150 mg/kg/day.
    These reproductive and endocrine changes in males could be related to the
    pharmacological activity of Example 1 but were not previously identified in a 4-week
    study. Although consistent with Example 1-related pharmacology, based on magnitude
 5  the morphologic findings in the testes seen at all dose levels were considered to be
    adverse. The effects on male reproductive tissues and LH and testosterone were reversed
    by the end of the 12-week recovery period.
            Administration of Example 1 was associated with decreased weight of ovary and
    macroscopically small ovaries in females at all dose levels. A decrease in pituitary weight
10  and in circulating levels of LH was observed in females given >150 mg/kg/day.
    Microscopic findings were observed in female reproductive tissues related to the
    administration of Example 1. The microscopic findings in uterus and vagina were
    observed at dose levels >150 mg/kg/day while the findings in ovary, and mammary gland
    were observed at all dose levels. The microscopic findings observed in the female
15  reproductive tissues and the decrease in circulating LH levels were likely related to the
    pharmacological activity of Example 1. Findings in the female reproductive tissues,
    including mammary gland, were consistent with those previously reported in the 4-week
    repeat-dose toxicity study. The female reproductive changes would likely have affected
    reproductive capability, but not the overall health of the animals. The effects on the
20  female reproductive tissues and LH were reversed by the end of the 12-week recovery
    period.
            Administration of Example 1 was associated with decreased weight of the thymus
    in females at all dose levels and in males given >150 mg/kg/day. Macroscopic findings of
    small thymus were observed in males given 1500 mg/kg/day. Additional microscopic
25  findings related to the administration of Example 1 were observed in liver, spleen, thymus
    (males), and skin (females), at dose levels >150 mg/kg/day. Microscopic findings in the
    skin were observed at all dose levels. All of these changes were no longer present at the
    end of the 12-week recovery period. There were no other microscopic findings, organ
    weight changes and macroscopic findings related to the administration of Example 1.
30          In conclusion, administration of Example 1 by daily oral gavage at dose levels of 0,
    15, 150 and 1500 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks was associated with morphologic and hormonal

   WO 2016/040234                                                             PCT/US2015/048801

    changes in male and female reproductive tissues that were in general attributed to the
    pharmacology of the molecule, and were reversible after 12 weeks in animals previously
    treated with 150 mg/kg/day. Adverse findings were confined to the testes and occurred in
    all Example 1-treated groups. Based on the magnitude of these degenerative testicular
 5  changes, a no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be established in this
    study and is therefore considered to be <15 mg/kg/day.
                           Male fertility and toxicokinetic study in rats
             The purpose of this study iss to determine the potential adverse effects in the
10  reproductive process resulting from treatment of male rats prior to, and during, the mating
    period. This includes identification of functional reproductive effects in the male. In
    addition, a toxicokinetic assessment of plasma levels of Example 1 is performed in satellite
    animals.
             Example 1 is given orally by gavage at doses of 0, 3, 30, and 1000 mg/kg. Male
15  rats (20/group) are treated daily for 10 weeks prior to mating, throughout the 3-week
    mating period, and continuing through the day prior to euthanasia (for a total of 100 to 101
    doses). Female rats are not treated. All animals are observed twice daily for moribundity
    and mortality. Clinical observations are recorded daily for male rats; body weights and
    food consumption are recorded for males twice weekly. All males are euthanized 1 day
20  following the last dose administration. Spermatogenic endpoint evaluations conducted on
    all males include motility and morphology and epididymal sperm concentration. Testes,
    epididymis, prostate and seminal vesicle/coagulating gland/fluid from all males are
    weighed and retained. Testes, epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicles and coagulating
    glands from surviving males are examined microscopically. A laparohysterectomy is
25  performed on Gestation Day 15 for each female with evidence of mating. An additional 3,
    18, 18, and 18 males assigned to the toxicokinetic phase are given the compound at doses
    of 0, 3, 30, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively, and are sampled for toxicokinetic evaluation at
    appropriate intervals following dose administration on Study Days 0 and 70.
             Following daily oral administration of Example 1 to male rats, the time to Cmax is
30  between 2 and 8 hours on Day 0 and 0.5 to 2 hours on Day 70. Mean exposures (measured
    by AUCO-24hr) increase between 3 and 30 mg/kg by approximately 7.8-fold and 4.5-fold

   WO 2016/040234                                                             PCT/US2015/048801
                                                 -28
    on Day 0 and 70, respectively, but remain similar between 30 and 1000 mg/kg doses
    suggesting a plateau in exposure beyond 30 mg/kg. Exposures are generally similar
    between single and multiple doses.
            Following a protocol essentially as described above, one male in the 30 mg/kg
 5  group of the toxicokinetic phase and 1 male in the vehicle control group of the main phase
    were found dead on Study Days 24 and 70, respectively. In the absence of mortality in the
    1000 mg/kg group, the death at 30 mg/kg was not considered to be compound-related. At
    the daily examinations, an increased incidence of red material around 1 or both eyes was
    noted for 4 males in the 30 mg/kg group and 3 males in the 1000 mg/kg group beginning
10  as early as Study Day 8 and 20, respectively. No other compound-related clinical findings
    were noted for males in the 3, 30, and 1000 mg/kg groups at the daily examinations or
    approximately 1 hour following dose administration. Mean body weights, body weight
    gains, and food consumption were unaffected by compound administration at all dosage
    levels.
15          Dose-dependent lower absolute and relative (to body and brain weight) male
    reproductive organ weights including testes, epididymides (intact and cauda), prostate
    gland, and seminal vesicles/coagulating gland/accessory fluids were noted in the 30 and
    1000 mg/kg groups. The organ weight effects observed in the testes corresponded to
    histologic changes characterized by atrophy of the interstitial Leydig cells and germinal
20  epithelium. These findings along with reduced populations of mature spermatozoa in the
    epididymides in both groups and reduced secretions in accessory sex glands noted in the
    1000 mg/kg group were considered to be consistent with down regulation of androgen
    (testosterone) synthesis and/or secretion by Leydig cells or by inhibition of hormone
    receptors in target organs. The effects noted in the reproductive organs in the 1000 mg/kg
25  group corresponded to reduced reproductive function. In the 30 and 1000 mg/kg groups,
    the organ weight effects noted in the accessory sex glands (prostate gland, seminal
    vesicles, and coagulating glands) were considered to be related to the pharmacology of the
    compound.
            Compound-related effects on spermatogenic endpoints were noted in the 1000
30  mg/kg group. Lower epididymal weights were noted in the 1000 mg/kg group and
    corresponded to a lower mean epididymal sperm concentration in this group. In addition,

   WO 2016/040234                                                             PCT/US2015/048801
                                                  -29
    a compound-related decrease in the percentage of morphologically normal sperm was
    observed at 1000 mg/kg as a result of higher numbers of sperm with the head absent or
    separated from the flagellum. These effects correlated with lower mating, fertility, and
    copulation indices in the 1000 mg/kg group males. In addition, a slightly longer pre-coital
 5  interval was observed in the 1000 mg/kg group compared to the vehicle control group.
    Spermatogenic endpoints and reproductive performance in the 3 and 30 mg/kg groups
    were unaffected by compound administration.
            Intrauterine survival of the embryos was unaffected by compound administration to
    males at dose levels of 3, 30, and 1000 mg/kg.
10          In conclusion, there were no effects on male body weights or food consumption or
    adverse compound-related clinical findings at any dosage level. Compound-related
    adverse effects on male reproductive tissues and spermatogenic parameters occurred at 30
    and 1000 mg/kg. Decreases in male reproductive organ weights occurred in the 1000
    mg/kg and corresponded to effects on epididymal sperm concentration and morphology.
15  In addition, microscopic alterations were observed in the testes, epididymides, prostate,
    seminal vesicles, and coagulating gland at 1000 mg/kg which corresponded to reductions
    in mating, fertility, and copulation indices in this group. Although the reduction in
    reproductive performance generally correlated with histologic changes in male
    reproductive tissue on a group basis, the correlation on an individual animal basis was not
20  always apparent. In the 30 mg/kg group, decreases in reproductive organ weights and
    microscopic alterations in the testes and epididymides were noted. No corresponding
    effects on reproductive function were noted at 30 mg/kg which suggests that the
    pharmacological signal while present was not great enough to affect functional
    reproduction. Based on these findings, the NOAEL for male reproductive toxicity and
25  male systemic toxicity was 3 mg/kg. A dose level of 3 mg/kg corresponds to an exposure
    (AUCO-24 hours) value on Study Day 70 of 10,954 ng-hrs/mL.

    beagle dogs are administered the test article at respective dose levels of 6, 60, or 300
    mg/kg/day. One additional group of three animals/sex serves as the control and receives
    the vehicle, 80% PEG 3350/20% Vitamin E TPGS (v/v) via oral capsule. The test article
    or vehicle is administered to all groups via oral capsule, twice a day for 28 consecutive
 5  days, at a dose volume of 1.5 mL/kg/dose.
             Observations for mortality, morbidity, injury, and the availability of food and water
    are conducted twice daily for all animals. Detailed clinical observations are conducted
    weekly. Body weights are measured and recorded the day after receipt, prior to
    randomization, and weekly during the study. Food consumption is measured and recorded
10  weekly. Ophthalmoscopic examinations are conducted pretest and prior to the terminal
    necropsy. Physical examinations are conducted pretest. Neurological examinations are
    conducted during Weeks 1 and 4. ECG examinations are conducted twice prior to the
    initiation of dosing and prior to and approximately 2 hours ( 15 minutes) after the
    morning test article administration on Days 3 and 26. Blood samples are collected twice
15  pretest, and blood and urine samples for clinical pathology evaluations are collected from
    all animals prior to the terminal necropsy. Blood samples for determination of the plasma
    concentrations of the test article are collected from all animals at designated time points on
    Days 1 and 28. The toxicokinetic parameters are determined for the test article from
    concentration-time data in the test species. At study termination, necropsy examinations
20  are performed, organ weights are recorded, and testes, epididymis, and prostates are
    microscopically examined. The potential of Example 1 to induce cytochromes P450 is
    determined by analyzing frozen liver samples for total cytochrome P450 content.
             Following a protocol essentially as described above, no measurable (<1 ng/mL)
    concentrations of Example 1 were found in any of the plasma samples from the control
25  animals. No differences in Example 1 plasma concentrations were noted between males
    and females indicating no gender effect on exposure. Exposure of Example 1 increased in
    a less than dose proportional manner in animals given 6 and 60 mg/kg/day and appeared to
    reach a plateau at 60 mg/kg/day, as plasma concentrations were similar to those at 300
    mg/kg/day.

             Assessment of toxicity is based on mortality, clinical signs, body weight and body
    weight change, food consumption, ophthalmic and neurologic evaluations, ECG
    measurements, hormone analysis (testosterone, progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and
    follicle stimulating hormone), semen evaluation (ejaculate volume and sperm number,
20  density, morphology, and motility), and clinical and anatomic pathology. Blood samples
    are collected for exploratory metabolite analysis and toxicokinetic evaluations.
             Following a protocol essentially as described above, systemic exposure to Example
    1 increased with the increase in dose level from 3 to 100 mg/kg. The increases in mean
    Cmax and AUCo-24hr were generally less than dose proportional. No consistent sex-related
25  differences were observed in the toxicokinetic parameters. Accumulation of Example 1
    was observed after multiple dosing of Example 1 in dogs.

            All animals survived until the scheduled sacrifice. Compound-related clinical
    signs were increased observations of lacrimation in animals given >3 mg/kg and reduced
    or absent estrous cycling in females given >3 mg/kg.
            No toxicologically important differences were noted in mean body weights, body
 5  weight gains, and food consumption. No ophthalmic or neurologic abnormalities
    occurred.
            Prolonged QT interval and corrected QT (QTc) interval was noted predose and 2
    hours postdose on Days 3, 86, and 359 of the dosing phase in combined sexes given 100
    mg/kg. The magnitude of the increase in mean QTc interval in combined sexes given 100
10  mg/kg across all dosing phase intervals ranged from 14 to 21 msec (6 to 9%) over mean
    values for control animals. No compound-related changes on QT or QTc interval were
    noted on Day 88 of the recovery phase in combined sexes given 100 mg/kg or on Days 3,
    86, or 359 of the dosing phase in animals given 3 or 10 mg/kg. No Example 1-related
    changes in PR interval, QRS duration, RR interval, or heart rate were observed on Day 3,
15  86, or 359 of the dosing phase in animals given 3, 10, or 100 mg/kg or on Day 88 of the
    recovery phase in animals given 100 mg/kg. No rhythm abnormalities or qualitative ECG
    changes were attributed to Example 1 during qualitative assessment of the
    electrocardiograms.
            Example 1-related, dose-dependent decreases in total sperm count occurred during
20  the dosing phase for males at all dose levels and were attributed to decreases in ejaculate
    weight. At the Week 52 assessments (Days 355 and 360 of the dosing phase), total sperm
    count relative to controls was decreased >55, >50, and >91% for males administered 3, 10,
    or 100 mg/kg, respectively. Effects on total sperm count completely reversed during the
    recovery phase. No Example 1-related effects on mean sperm density, motility, or
25  morphology were noted for any group.
            Hormonal changes were noted in males and females given > 3 mg/kg. The changes
    were consistent with the pharmacology of the test article and correlated with microscopic
    changes. In males, reductions in testosterone and increases in LH were observed.
    Increased LH and decreased progesterone in the female were consistent with anestrus and
30  reduction of corpora lutea noted microscopically. Hormonal levels returned to control
    levels during the recovery phase.

   WO 2016/040234                                                             PCT/US2015/048801

             Compound-related clinical pathology effects were limited to minimally to mildly
    increased alanine aminotransferase activity for males and females at all dose levels
    (females given 100 mg/kg were most affected) and minimally to moderately decreased
    cholesterol for males and females given 3 or 10 mg/kg (animals given 3 mg/kg were most
 5  affected). The effect on alanine aminotransferase activity at 100 mg/kg exhibited
    reversibility following the recovery phase. Reversibility of the effect on cholesterol
    concentration at 3 and 10 mg/kg could not be assessed because no animals at these dose
    levels were in the recovery phase. Neither of these effects was associated with correlative
    microscopic findings.
10           Pharmacologically expected compound-related morphologic changes were noted in
    reproductive tissues of males and females. Compound-related and reversible decreased
    prostate, epididymis, and liver/gall bladder weights occurred in males, which, with the
    exception of the liver/gall bladder changes, correlated with microscopic findings. In the
    prostate gland, males given >3 mg/kg had reversible prostate gland acinar epithelial
15  atrophy. Males given >3 mg/kg had reversible decreased ductular diameter of the cauda
    (tail) of the epididymis, and males given 100 mg/kg had reversible epididymal ductular
    epithelial atrophy. Females given >3 mg/kg had decreased/absent corpora lutea with
    anestrus cycle stage in the ovary. This change was generally accompanied by a lack of
    lobular development in the mammary gland as well as expected responses of secondary
20  reproductive tissues to anestrus: the uterus, cervix, vagina, and mammary gland, had stage
    appropriate features of atrophy commensurate with prolonged anestrus.
             Collectively, these findings in females are consistent with compound-related
    disruption of normal reproductive cycling. In the recovery phase, 2/3 females given 100
    mg/kg had diestrus reproductive cycle stage and lobular mammary development,
25  indicating a return to normal cyclic activity, although no clinical evidence of reproductive
    cycling was noted during the recovery phase.
             Additionally, compound-related and reversible microscopic findings were observed
    in the adrenal gland and skin/subcutis. In the adrenal gland, males given >10 mg/kg and
    females given 100 mg/kg had decreased vacuolation of the zona fasciculata and reticularis.
30  In the skin, decreased sebaceous gland vacuolation was noted in animals
    given >3 mg/kg.

               In summary, daily administration of Example 1 by capsule to dogs for 52 weeks at
    a dose level of 3, 10, or 100 mg/kg resulted in no adverse compound-related findings.
    Changes in reproductive function occurred in males (decreased sperm count and ejaculate
    volume) and females (reduced/absent estrous cycling) of all Example 1-treated groups and
 5  correlated with microscopic findings. These changes do not affect the overall health of the
    animals; are consistent with the pharmacologic action of the test article; and are reversible.
    Therefore, the NOAEL is 100 mg/kg. After 361 days of dosing, a dose of 100 mg/kg
    corresponded to mean Cmax values of 1496 and 1885 ng/mL and AUCo-24 h values of 22582
    and 31505 ng-hr/mL in males and females, respectively.

    modestly reduced.

            This Phase 1 study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose,
    incomplete-crossover, dose-escalation design, conducted in 3 dosing cohorts consisting of
    healthy men and postmenopausal women. Thirty subjects (10 per cohort) are randomly
    assigned to each dosing cohort.
20          During both dosing periods, subjects are admitted to the clinical research unit
    (CRU) for overnight stays. Subjects are dosed orally after breakfast on Day 1 and remain

    at the CRU for approximately 24 hours after dosing. Within each cohort, the washout
    period between dosing periods ranges from 14 to 45 days. A study discharge visit occurs
    approximately 5 days after the last dose, Period 2. The appropriateness of dose escalation
    is determined by safety measurements at each step of the escalation. A subject
 5  investigator double blinded crossover design is used for this study to provide between
    subject data for all safety and tolerability measurements. This design facilitates objective
    assessment of AEs.
            A protocol essentially as described above was followed. As a result of the
    incomplete crossover design, approximately 50% of subjects received a single dose of
10  Example land a placebo dose in order to enhance detection of significant safety or
    tolerability signals. Approximately 50% of the subjects received Example 1 at 2 dose
    levels, which allowed for a within subject analysis of the dose-dependency of PK
    parameters and other endpoints. A minimum 5-day dosing interval period was chosen to
    minimize carryover effects between treatment periods.
15          The planned dose range for this study was from 5 to 1000 mg of Example 1 and
    was based on in vivo efficacy in rat, using the assumption that the exposure required to
    produce an 80% bone effect (average of mid-shaft load and femoral neck load) in rat is the
    same as the exposure required in human. Based on the allometrically predicted human
    clearance (33 L/h, 90% confidence interval [CI]: 24 to 46 L/h) and bioavailability (49%),
20  such a response in humans is expected to occur at doses of around 71 mg/day (90% CI: 29
    to 321 mg/day).
            These data demonstrate an increase in calf muscle area as measured by peripheral
    Computer Tomography based imaging at the gastrocnemius bundle (calf muscle area) after
    administration of Example 1 to healthy human volunteers as shown in Figure 7.
