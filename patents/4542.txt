The present invention pertains to a method for the production of novel T-cell receptors (TCR)
which provide a reduced risk of adverse events in immune therapy, specifically in adoptive T
cell transfer. The TCRs produced according to the method of the invention are specific for
tumor cells and do not react with healthy tissue. Furthermore provided are nucleic acids en

as well as the use of these compounds in the treatment of tumorous diseases.
                                         DESCRIPTION
Despite remarkable technological advancements in the diagnosis and treatment options avail
able to patients diagnosed with cancer, the prognosis still often remains poor and many pa
tients cannot be cured. Immunotherapy holds the promise of offering a potent, yet targeted,
treatment to patients diagnosed with various tumors, with the potential to eradicate the malig
nant tumor cells without damaging normal tissues. In theory the T cells of the immune system
are capable of recognizing protein patterns specific for tumor cells and to mediate their de
struction through a variety of effector mechanisms. Adoptive T-cell therapy is an attempt to
harness and amplify the tumor-eradicating capacity of a patient's own T cells and then return
these effectors to the patient in such a state that they effectively eliminate residual tumor,
however without damaging healthy tissue. Although this approach is not new to the field of
tumor immunology, still many drawbacks in the clinical use of adoptive T cell therapy impair
the full use of this approach in cancer treatments.
A TCR is a heterodimeric cell surface protein of the immunoglobulin super-family which is
associated with invariant proteins of the CD3 complex involved in mediating signal transduc
tion. TCRs exist in ap and y6 forms, which are structurally similar but have quite distinct ana
tomical locations and probably functions. The extracellular portion of native heterodimeric
ajTCR consists of two polypeptides, each of which has a membrane-proximal constant do
main, and a membrane-distal variable domain. Each of the constant and variable domains in
cludes an intra-chain disulfide bond. The variable domains contain the highly polymorphic

    WO 2014/083173                              - 2 -                   PCT/EP2013/075141
loops analogous to the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies. The use
of TCR gene therapy overcomes a number of current hurdles. It allows equipping patients'
own T cells with desired specificities and generation of sufficient numbers of T cells in a
short period of time, avoiding their exhaustion. The TCR will be transduced into central
memory T cells or T cells with stem cell characteristics, which may ensure better persistence
and function upon transfer. TCR-engineered T cells will be infused into cancer patients ren
dered lymphopenic by chemotherapy or irradiation, allowing efficient engraftment but inhibit
ing immune suppression. Transgenic mice expressing human MHC molecules and a diverse
human TCR repertoire serve as a tool to rapidly analyze whether peptide antigens are immu
nogenic, i.e. are they efficiently processed and presented by MHC molecules, do they effi
ciently induce T cell responses following immunization (Li et al. 2010 Nat Med).
Using the human TCR transgenic mouse, any human peptide sequence not encoded by the
mouse genome is suitable for immunization and will yield TCRs with optimal affinity. Opti
mal affinity means that the T cells are restricted to human self-MHC molecules and recognize
the peptide antigen as foreign, e.g. represent the non-tolerant repertoire. By using pep
tide/MHC multimers, specific T cells of the transgenic mice can be sorted, human TCRs iso
lated, e.g. by single cell PCR, the TCRs optimized for efficient expression while avoiding
mispairing with endogenous TCR and used for transduction of patients' T cells with viral vec
tors (Uckert et al. 2008 Cancer Immunol Immunother; Kammertoens T et al. 2009 Eur J Im
munol).
The key problem of ATT is to target the right antigen to prevent tumor recurrence and toxic
side effects. This sounds simple given the large number of putative tumor antigens. However,
most are tumor-associated (self) antigens (TAAs). TAAs are also expressed by normal cells.
Expression by rare but vital cells has usually not been analyzed. Moreover, TAA expression
may be heterogeneous within the tumor/metastases of a given individual. Thus, targeting
TAAs bears the risk of ineffective long-term responses and destruction of normal tissues.
Clinical trials with TCR (or chimeric antibody receptor; CAR)-engineered T cells, e.g. di
rected against Melan-A/MART-1, gp 100, HER-2 and carcinoembryonic antigen, support this
assumption.

                                                -3
Morgan RA and colleagues present a case report on a patient with ERBB2 overexpressing
cancer that was treated by infusing T cells transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor recog
nizing ERBB2 into the patient. After 15 minutes of the infusion the patient experienced res
piratory distress and dramatic pulmonary infiltrate. The patient died after 5 days. This dra
matic outcome underlines the problem of toxic adverse effects in the context of adoptive T
cell therapy.
Another approach makes use of the immunization of mice, the subsequent isolation of the T
cells and T cell receptors from these cells, in order to transduce autologous peripheral lym
phocytes of a tumor patient. The transduced lymphocytes were expanded and then re-infused.
Although tumor regression was observed, the patients still showed the destruction of normal
cells (Johnson LA et al. 2009 Blood).
Parkhurst and colleagues (2010 Mol Ther) genetically engineered autologous T lymphocytes
of patients suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard treatments. The T
lymphocytes were altered to express a murine T cell receptor directed at the carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA). Again the report shows regression of the tumor, however with severe transient
inflammatory colitis as side effect in all patients.
Thus, for many, if not most, tumor associated antigens substantial toxicity by effective adop
tive T cell therapy is predictable.
In view of the above described major drawbacks in the background art, in one broad form the
present invention provides novel approaches for adoptive T-cell therapy which can overcome
the severe side effects observed in immune therapy when genetically engineered T cell recep
tors are introduced into autologous lymphocytes and re-infused into a human patient. In an
other form of the present invention there is provided a novel antigen recognizing constructs
which specifically target tumor cells and not healthy cells.
In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for the production of a
human T cell receptor (TCR) or a T-cell, which is specific for tumorous cells and has reduced
adverse effects in adoptive T-cell therapy, comprising the method steps of
        a.      Providing a host organism expressing un-rearranged human TCR loci,

    WO 2014/083173                                                          PCT/EP2013/075141
        b.      Immunizing said host organism with a peptide comprising an epitope specific
                for a tumor specific antigen (TSA),
         c.     Isolating from said host organism or cell a T cell clone having an activity
                against said human mutated TSA,
         d.     Optionally, isolating from said T cell clone the TCR,
wherein said TSA is selected out of the class of somatic mutated antigens.
The surprising finding of the present invention is that if, by contrast to the state of the art ap
proaches, mutant cancer-driving oncogenes, specifically TSAs out of the class of somatic mu
tated antigens, are targeted by adoptive T cell therapy (ATT), many of the problems with
TAAs as known in the state of the art are resolved. Except for antigens encoded by cancer
viruses, mutated antigens are the only exclusively tumor-specific antigens.
Of course, the TCRs produced in accordance with the herein described method of the inven
tion do not only provide their advantageous effects in adoptive T cell therapy, but also in any
other therapeutic approach wherein the specific binding of the TCR to its target is employed.
The TCRs isolated in accordance with the method of the present invention are advantageous
over the state of the art antigen recognizing constructs due to their reduced risk for adverse
effects which are observed in adoptive T cell therapy. Adverse effects in context of adoptive
T cell transfers are mainly due to autoimmune reactions or to off-target reactions. The present
invention specifically intends to solve the former problem by providing T cells which are
highly specific to tumor cells and do not mediate an immune reaction against a patient's
healthy tissue. Adverse events following infusion of human autologous or allogeneic lym
phocytes that the present invention seeks to reduce can be various. In a preferred embodiment
of the present invention the TCR obtained by the present invention provide a reduced risk
when used in adoptive T cell therapy for inducing healthy tissue damage, which might result
in edema and necrosis.
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention said host organism further comprises a
transgene for the expression of a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II
allele. Preferably the MHC is a human leucocyte antigen (HLA) type which is known or sus
pected to be able to present said mutated TSA. Even more preferred is that the HLA type
which is expressed in said host organism is known or suspected to be able to present a peptide

    WO 2014/083173                                                         PCT/EP2013/075141
derived from said mutated TSA. This peptide should comprise an amino acid sequence in
cluding the mutation which is specifically present in the mutated TSA opposed to the corre
sponding un-mutated (wild type) version of the same protein.
HLAs corresponding to MHC class I comprise the types A, B, and C. HLA class I complexes
present peptides which are processed inside the presenting cell (including alien peptides'such
as viral peptides if present). In general, such HLA class I peptides are small polymers, about 9
amino acids in length. HLAs corresponding to MHC class II comprise the types DP, DM,
DOA, DOB, DQ, and DR. HLA class II complexes present antigens originating from the out
side of the cell. They can be of a length between 12 and 18 amino acids. The characterization
of the responsible HLA alleles presenting an antigen of choice is a methodology generally
known in the art.
In said host organism used in accordance with the present invention - insofar it is not a hu
man - the un-rearranged human TCR loci are preferably present as one or more transgenes in
the genome of said host organism. Preferably these loci encode TCR a and 0 chains, and pref
erably comprise a plurality, ideally all, of human TCR V, D, J, and/or C genes.
For the method in accordance with the present invention it is preferably a prerequisite that
said host organism has an adaptive immune system and/or is able to mount a VDJC rear
rangement within said human TCR loci. Furthermore a host organism is preferred which is
able to express heterologous TCRs. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention said
host organism is a transgenic animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a non-human
mammal, most preferably a mouse, a rat, a donkey, a rabbit, a hare or a monkey, or any ani
mal which is known in the art to be a host for the generation of T-cells.
In the context of such embodiments of the invention which relate to the above method and
wherein non-human host organisms are used, such a non-human host organism preferably
further comprises inactivated endogenous TCR loci, preferably wherein said endogenous
TCR loci encode for the TCR a and 0 chains of said non-human host organism.
In one very specific embodiment of the present invention said host-organism is an "ABabDII"
mouse. The term "ABabDII" mouse refers to the transgenic animal produced as described in
Li et al., 2010;16:1029-34 Nature Medicine. Of course it is understood that also any other

    WO 2014/083173                             - 6 -                         PCT/EP2013/075141
transgenic animal produced with the same methodology as described in Li et al. shall be en
compassed as a suitable host organism for use in the herein described embodiments of the
invention.
An alternative embodiment relates to a method, wherein a human, for example a healthy indi
vidual or a human patient suffering from a tumorous disease, is immunized with said peptide
as described herein. In this embodiment T cells can be isolated subsequent to the immuniza
tion process from the blood of the human subject. This embodiment has the advantage that the
improved T cell receptor is expressed on human, ideally autologous, T cells which can then
be used for reinfusion in adoptive T cell therapy.
The peptide used for the immunization of the host organism in context of the method of the
present invention comprises an amino acid sequence which is in at least one amino acid resi
due mutated compared to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding wild-type cellular
protein. The present invention relates to the use of tumor specific antigens, therefore proteins
which were mutated in the development of tumor cells and thus in this specific mutated form
exclusively are present in tumor cells. Normal, healthy, cells however might still express the
original un-mutated (wild type) protein. Thus, for the herein described invention it is specifi
cally preferred that the peptide used for immunization comprises in its sequence the mutation
which differentiates the TSA from the original un-mutated cellular protein. Preferred peptides
for use in the method of the invention comprise any of the sequences shown in SEQ ID No. 1
to 27. In preferred embodiments of the invention the peptide for immunization comprises the
amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID No. 1.
Antigens which are specifically expressed in tumor cells and not in healthy tissue can be cate
gorized into four types: (I) mutated antigens develop during tumor-genesis by point mutations
or translocations within the tumor cells. Those antigens are strictly tumor-specific. In the con
text of the invention these antigens are referred to as tumor specific antigens (TSA). (II) can
cer/germline antigens are usually expressed solely within the germ cells of an adult organism
and not in healthy somatic tissue. In cancer cells, however, due to the loss of epigenetic regu
lation, germ-cell specific genes can be activated. (III) differentiation antigens are expressed in
tumors and their healthy progenitor cells. CTL responses against such antigens often result in
auto-immune reactions. (IV) overexpressed TAA show only minor expression in healthy cells

    WO 2014/083173                                                           PCT/EP2013/075141
whereas in a tumor those antigens are strongly activated. For the present invention it is pre
ferred that only antigens of the first type are used.
For the invention TSAs formed by any kind of mutation are comprised. For merely illustrative
reasons the following types of mutations are described: amino acid substitution, deletion, ad
dition, insertion, or chemical or post-translational modification. Furthermore included are
chromosomal translocations and exclusively in tumor cells expressed splice variants, for ex
ample which occur by unspecific splicing mutations resulting in new splice sites.
For the immunization process said peptide can have any length. A minimum requirement is
however the presence of the epitope containing the above mentioned mutated sequence. Pre
ferred peptides of the invention have a length of 100 amino acids, preferably of 50 amino ac
ids, more preferably of 30 amino acids, even more preferably 8 to 16 amino acids. The exact
peptide length might vary depending on whether the TSA is MHC class I or MHC class II
presented.
In order to enhance immunization of the host organism, it is preferred that an adjuvant is used
together with the peptide. An adjuvant is for example, without being limiting thereto, CpG
and/or incomplete Freunds adjuvant. After the initial immunization with the peptide, said
host organisms is treated preferably at least one or two, three or four more times with said
peptide and/or the adjuvant of choice. Freund's adjuvant is a solution of (mineral) oil wherein
the antigen for immunization is emulsified. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant, as preferably used
in this invention, does not contain any mycobacterial components.
During and after the immunization process said host-organism should develop T cells ex
pressing rearranged T cell receptors specific against the TSA of the invention. Such T-cell
clones are then in a preferred embodiment isolated from said host organism. For example the
cells can be isolated from spleen cells, lymph node cells or blood. T cell clones are selected
for example via the surface expression of CD4 or CD8, depending on whether the TSA
epitope is MHC class I or II. Methods for the isolation of single T cell clones form host or
ganisms are well known for the person of skill in the art. The present invention is not restrict
ed to a specific methodology for isolating T cells. However, in one preferred embodiment of
the invention, said T cells or said T cell clone is after isolation further tested for the expres
sion of a TCR binding to the TSA used in the method of the invention. This is preferably done

    WO 2014/083173                                                         PCT/EP2013/075141
by tetramer binding (staining) using TSA specific HLA tetramers. Optionally, the isolated T
cell or T cell clone is also tested for its specificity to the TSA compared with the un-mutated
version of the cellular protein. To this end, T cell reactivity against peptides comprising the
mutation and against peptides comprising the wild-type version is compared. In a preferred
embodiment such T cells or T cell clones are isolated in accordance with the method of the
invention, which are highly selective for the TSA and not the un-mutated version of the cellu
lar protein.
Another embodiment of the invention relates to a method as described herein, where after
isolation of the T cell or T cell clone, the TCR sequence is cloned. In this embodiment the
method in step d. as described above, comprises the further method steps of (i) preparing
cDNA from said T-cell clone, and (ii) amplifying said cDNA, and (iii) cloning the respective
TCR a and 0 genes into a vector. Preferably a retroviral vector for the transduction of human
peripheral blood lymphocytes is used as a vehicle for the TCR of the invention. Means and
methods for such a cloning procedure are well known to the skilled person.
In another preferred embodiment of the invention the TSA used is expressed in a tumor cell or
tumor disease.
As used herein, the term "tumor " or "tumor disease" means both benign and malignant tu
mors or neoplasms and includes melanomas, lymphomas, leukemias, carcinomas and sarco
mas. Illustrative examples of tumor tissues are cutaneous such as malignant melanomas and
mycosis fungoides; hematologic tumors such as leukemias, for example, acute lymphoblastic,
acute myelocytic, or chronic myelocytic leukemia; lymphomas such as Hodgkin's disease or
malignant lymphoma; gynecologic tumors such as ovarian and uterine tumors; urologic tu
mors such as those of the prostate, bladder, or testis; soft tissue sarcomas, osseus, or non
osseous sarcomas, breast tumors; tumors of the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal cortex; gastro
intestinal tumors such as those of the esophagus, stomach, intestine, and colon; pancreatic and
hepatic tumors; laryngeae papillomestasas and lung tumors. Preferred tumors in the context of
the present invention are selected from melanoma, lung tumor, endometrial tumors, glioma,
lymphoma, leukemia or prostate tumor.
Exemplary TSAs which can be subject to the inventive method described herein - without
being limiting for the invention -are described in Krauthammer et al. 2012 (Nature Genetics).

has the activity/ability for binding its TSA. In addition to that, the nucleic acid molecule op
tionally has further sequences which are necessary for protein expression of the nucleic acid
sequence, specifically for an expression in a mammalian/human, most preferably an immune
cell. The nucleic acid used can be contained in a vector suitable for allowing expression of the

Example 1:      RAC1 specific TCR against the FSGEYIPTV Epitope
For the generation of T-cells bearing a RAC 1 TSA specific TCR, mice deficient in their en
dogenous TCR loci and expressing the human TCR repertoire were used. The production and
setup of the transgenic mice (ABabDII mice) are in detail described elsewhere (Li LP, Lam
pert JC, Chen X, Leitao C, Popovic J, Muller W, et al. Transgenic mice with a diverse human
T cell antigen receptor repertoire. Nat Med. 2010;16:1029-34.).
ABabDII mice were immunized twice with mutated RAC1P29S epitope (see above). Seven
days after the last immunization, pooled spleen and lymph node cells were stimulated in vitro
with RACI mutant or wildtype peptides and analyzed for expression of CD3, CD8 and intra
cellular IFN-y. Figure 1 shows CD8+ and IFN-y+ cells within the CD3+ cell population (per
centages indicated by numbers). In parentheses, the percentage of CD8+ and IFN-y+ T cells
within the CD8+ T cell population is given.
