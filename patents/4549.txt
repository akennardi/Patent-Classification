   Detailed Description
10 Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   where clues are issued to a player based on a player's
   game play activity in at least one primary game.                     The
   clues are intended to assist the player in playing of a
   secondary game.  In an alternative embodiment, pieces of a
15 set of pieces intended to be redeemed for a prize are
   issued to a player instead of clues.        The gaming system
   can take a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
20 wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
25 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
30 gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
35 and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
                                   77087371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                               - 5
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.   For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
 5 gaming server are selectively modifiable.              For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on.   Other variations will be apparent to persons
10 skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several core components.   At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
15 60 as illustrated in Figure 1.    The player interface is
   arranged to enable interaction between a player and the
   gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions and play the game.
20
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54 and a game
25 play mechanism 56 that enables a player to input game play
   instructions.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
30 that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display.   Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
35 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                   a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
                                   77087371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                               - 6
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   The gaming system of the embodiment includes a clue
 5 entitlement mechanism for determining whether a player is
   entitled to be issued a clue based on the player's game
   play activity in relation to at least one primary game and
   a clue issuer for issuing the clue to the player.                      Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that in some
10 embodiments there may be a plurality of different primary
   games from which a player may obtain clues.                Indeed, in
   some embodiments different clues for the same secondary
   game may be available from different games.                Persons
   skilled in the art will also appreciate that the clue
15 entitlement mechanism and clue issuer can take a number of
   different forms; the two main forms are illustrated in
   Figures 6 and 7.
   In Figure 6, the clue issuer 66 is a component of the game
20 controller 60 and incorporates the clue entitlement
   mechanism 67.   The clue entitlement mechanism 67 monitors
   game play activity and determines whether a player has
   become entitled to a clue based on their game play
   activity.   When the clue entitlement mechanism 67
25 determines that a player has become entitled to a clue,
   the clue issuer 66 sends a clue to the clue output
   mechanism 58.   The clue output mechanism 58 may take a
   number of forms, for example, a display for displaying a
   message, a ticket issuer, or a write mechanism for writing
30 data to a player tracking device.
   The other main form of a gaming system including a clue
   issuer 70 is illustrated in Figure 7.         In this form, the
   clue issuer 70 is provided as a separate component to the
35 clue entitlement mechanism 67.    In this embodiment, clue
   entitlement mechanism 67 determines whether a player is
   entitled to a clue and, if it does, it controls clue
                                   77087371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                              - 7
   entitlement output 59 to output a clue entitlement to the
   player in the form of a message, a ticket, data to a
   player tracking device, etc.   The player then subsequently
   retrieves the clue by providing the clue entitlement to a
 5 clue entitlement input 72 of a clue issuer 70.                  The clue
   issuer 70 incorporates a clue output mechanism 74 for
   outputting the clue to a player as described in relation
   to Figure 6, the clue output mechanism 74 may be a
   display, a printer or configured to output data sent to
10 the player's player tracking device.        In an embodiment, as
   described in further detail below, the clue issuer 70 may
   form part of a gaming machine arranged to play the
   secondary game and it may issue clues during play of the
   secondary game.
15
   The game play activity used as the basis of determining
   the entitlement can be, for example, turnover on the
   gaming machine, the outcome of a game or a feature game,
   time, a machine related event, or an event related to a
20 system to which the machine is connected.             Persons skilled
   in the art will appreciate that the clue entitlement
   mechanism will be configured to respond to the relevant
   game play activity.  For example, in the case of turnover,
   the clue entitlement mechanism 67 may incorporate a meter
25 for monitoring turnover and issuing of a clue entitlement
   based on a threshold being passed.      Similarly, if time is
   measured, the clue entitlement mechanism 67 may
   incorporate a timer for monitoring expired time.
30 As described above, a clue can be delivered to a player by
   one of many methods, including but not limited to a ticket
   printed by the gaming machine, a message on the machine, a
   message on a piece of auxiliary equipment, a ticket issued
   by an attendant or issued onto a player card and redeemed
35 at a player information terminal, or issued on a player
   tracking device, or redeemed during playing of another
   game.
                                    77 371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                               - 8
   The delivery method may be adapted to suit the needs of
   the player, the regulators and the market in which the
   gaming system is deployed.
 5
   As in the example given in Figure 7, the clue entitlement
   can be issued separately.    For example, in the form of a
   message to "Call Mr Cashman on ***      and use your PIN number
   ### to redeem your clue" or "Log into our website and use
10 your PIN number ###  to redeem your clue.".               Clues can also
   be delivered in other ways, for example by mail or
   messenger.
   In any embodiment where there is an interim step between
15 determining that the player is entitled to a clue and
   redeeming of a clue, this is referred to as a clue
   entitlement.   A clue entitlement can be issued by a
   machine that is then subsequently redeemed by a clue
   issuer.  The clues obtained from the clue issuer will
20 typically be downloaded to the clue issuing machine over a
   network.   For example a PIN number can be correlated to a
   specific clue held in the database.
   Alternatively, the clues are programmed into the game code
25 software run on the gaming machine and released at times
   to suit play of the secondary game.         For example, a
   primary game can be designed to generate a set of
   different clue entitlements corresponding to different
   clues that may be released by a secondary game.                    A
30 plurality of clue entitlements can be stored on a player
   tracking device.   The player supplies the player tracking
   device to a gaming machine when playing the secondary game
   and clues are supplied to the player at appropriate times
   during play of secondary game on the electronic gaming
35 machine based on the entitlements stored in the player
   tracking device.   Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that the primary and secondary games could be
                                    77087371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                              - 9
   played on the same gaming machine.      That is, in some
   gaming systems, gaming machines are configured to allow a
   player to select which game they play on a particular
   gaming machine.  Alternatively, the secondary game could
 5 be a bonus or feature game.
   The clue will be of the nature to enable the player to use
   the clue in the play of the secondary game.               Preferably
   the chance of winning the secondary game is enhanced by
10 having large numbers of different clues.            Once the
   secondary game is concluded, the previously issued clues
   will be redundant and a new set of clues that are required
   will become available.
15 In some embodiments, the clues can be categorised into
   different classes of clues.   Different classes of clues
   can be found, for example in different types of machines
   or can be available from different games.             For example,
   clues can be in the categories of time, place or person
20 and the time clues are found on $1 machines, place clues
   are found on 10c machines and person clues are found on 1c
   machines.
   In the embodiment, clues can only be used to play the
25 secondary game.  Ideally the secondary game is a game
   which requires the player to use the clues acquired from
   the play of the primary game.   Preferably, the clues are
   designed such that the player with the most clues will
   have a better chance of solving the special game and
30 winning.  Alternatively, some clues will have more "value"
   than others and the player with the more favourable clues
   will have more chance of solving the second game.
   In another embodiment, the clues can provide a key or
35 information to a player which enables the player to enter
   a special feature or play a special game which has an
   enhanced player return.
                                    77 371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                             - 10
   In another embodiment, the player receives clues from a
   gaming machine or preferably many gaming machines which,
   with all clues in hand, can lead the player to some
 5 destination.  At this destination, a "hidden treasure" can
   be retrieved which can subsequently be redeemed.                    By way
   of example, clues may direct the player to a location,
   provide an instruction or a limit.
10 A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2.          The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.  Depending on the embodiment, display 14 may
15 also be used to output clues or clue entitlements.                     A
   mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of
   buttons 22 for enabling a player to interact with the
   gaming machine, in particular during game play and thus
   provide a game play mechanism.   The mid-trim 20 also
20 houses a credit input mechanism 24 which in this example
   includes a coin input chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.
   Other credit input mechanisms may also be employed, for
   example, a card reader for reading a smart card, debit
   card or credit card.  A read/write device            (not shown) may
25 also be provided for the purpose of reading and writing a
   player tracking device, for example as part of a loyalty
   program or if clues or clue entitlements are to be issued
   to the player tracking device.   The player tracking device
   may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
30 portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device.  The player tracking device reader may be
   provided in player marketing module connected to the
   gaming machine and adapted to communicate with the gaming
   machine.

   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
                                  77087371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

   information or images relating to the game.                  Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
 5 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
10 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
15 type.   In some embodiments, clues or clue entitlements may
   be displayed on a top box video display.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
20 different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.   Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
25 which is in data communication with the processor 102.                             A
   subset of the instructions and data will relate to
   implementation of the game.    The clue entitlement
   mechanism and clue issuer may be implemented as another
   subset of the instructions implemented by the processor.
30 Alternatively, separate hardware may be provided for issue
   clues and/or clue entitlements.      For example, a circuit
   that monitors meters 104.    Typically, the gaming machine
   100 will include both volatile and non-volatile memory and
   more than one of each type of memory, with such memories
35 being collectively represented by the memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
                                     708737_1 (GHIatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                             - 12
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0)      interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
 5 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.                Persons
10 skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
15 controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader
   108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input
   mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111.                  In some
   embodiments, ticket reader 108 may read clue entitlement
20 tickets and printer 109 may print clues or clue
   entitlements.  Additional hardware may be included as part
   of the gaming machine 100, or hardware may be omitted as
   required for the specific implementation.
25 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
30 data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
35 103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                    The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                    The
                                  708737_1 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                             -  13
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.      The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
 5 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
10 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figures 8 and 9 show two possible implementations of a
   clue issuer and clue entitlement mechanism in a networked
15 gaming environment.  In Figure 8, an electronic gaming
   machine 810 is used by a player to play a primary game,
   noting that there may be a plurality of eligible primary
   games from which clues are distributed.            In order to
   obtain clues, the player enters a player ID using player
20 ID input 812 of the electronic gaming machine 810.                       It is
   envisaged that the player ID input would typically be a
   player tracking device reader of the gaming machine (or
   connected to the gaming machine) so that the player ID
   would be provided by supplying a player tracking device to
25 the tracking device reader but it could also be a keypad,
   touch screen or the like.   The gaming machine 810 includes
   a clue entitlement mechanism 814 that determines that the
   player is entitled to a clue in the general manner
   described above.  When the player is entitled to a clue
30 the clue entitlement mechanism communicates the clue
   entitlement to a player database where it is a stored in a
   player record 822 of a player database 820 containing a
   series of player records.   A player may at some later time
   provide their player ID to clue issuer, for example in the
35 form of a kiosk specially designed to issue clues.                       The
   clue issuer 830, examines the player record 822 for the
   player corresponding to the player ID input using the
                                   708737_1 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                             -  14
   player ID input 832, determines what clues the player is
   entitled to base on the clue entitlements stored in the
   player record and outputs the clues using clue output
   mechanism 834.  The clue output mechanism 834 can be in
 5 any of the forms described above including a ticket
   printer.
   In the alternative arrangement of Figure 9, the player
   uses a first electronic gaming machine 910 to play a
10 primary game.  Before playing the primary game, the player
   inputs their player ID using player ID input 912 in the
   manner described above.  During play of the primary game,
   the electronic gaming machine 910 determines whether the
   player is entitled to a clue entitlement 914 and sends
15 entitlement data to the player database which updates the
   player record 922.
   In this embodiment, clues are issued to a player during
   play of a secondary game on a second electronic gaming
20 machine 940 arranged for play of the secondary game.
   Prior to playing the game, the player enters their ID
   using ID input 942, and clue issuer 944 determines based
   on the ID whether their associated player record 922
   contains any clue entitlements required for the secondary
25 game.  The clue issuer 914 issues clues on the basis of
   the player's clue entitlement during appropriate parts of
   play of the secondary game.
   It will be appreciated that in such networked embodiments,
30 the player database may be implemented as part of an
   existing loyalty program.   At least in this embodiment,
   the clue entitlement may be combined with the player
   reward program.  For example, if a player obtains a series
   of rewards based on turnover, these rewards may be
35 redeemable for clues for use in the secondary game.                        In
   this embodiment, the clue issuer is typically configured
   to allow the player to selectively redeem rewards for
                                   77087371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                             - 15
   clues.  In at least this embodiment, things other than
   game play that contribute to reward entitlements may thus
   contribute to clue entitlements, for example other
   purchases made at a gaming venue.

   Figure 5 shows more detail of a gaming system 200 that
   includes a network 201, which for example may be an
   Ethernet network.  Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in
   three banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5,
10 are connected to the network 201.     The gaming machines 202
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or
   may have simplified functionality depending on the
   requirements for implementing game play.            While banks 203
15 of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks
   of one, three or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  The displays 204 may, for example, be
20 associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
25
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game.  With this embodiment, as both the game server and
30 the gaming machine implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller.           Thus, depending
   on the embodiment, the clue issuer or clue entitlement
   mechanism could be provided on the gaming machine or the
   game server or a combination thereof.        A database
35 management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.          Typically, if the
                                  708737_1 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

   gaming system 200 enables players to participate in a
   Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to
   monitor and carry out accounting functions for the Jackpot
   game.
 5
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.      With this embodiment,
10 the game server 205 provides the game controller.                     Hence,
   the clue entitlement mechanism and/or clue issuer would
   typically be provided by the server with the gaming
   machine merely acting to output the clue or clue
   entitlements.  The gaming machine will receive player
15 instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
   machine for display.  In a thin client embodiment, the
   gaming machines could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs
   running software that provides a player interface operable
20 using standard computer input and output components.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming system 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
25 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.  An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   Server 212 may implement a player rewards program where
30 reward data is collected against a record identifying the
   player.  As described above, clue entitlements may be
   stored in, and retrieved from, the player's player record.
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
35 systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
 5 plurality of different computers.       For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.      For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
10 could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
15
   Figure 10 shows a variation on the above embodiments.                           In
   this embodiment, rather than clues being issued, a series
   of "pieces" are issued.  Thus, instead of a clue issuer,
   the system includes a piece issuer and a piece entitlement
20 mechanism 66A, 67A and a piece output mechanism 58A.                          The
   technique for deciding when to issue a piece operates
   substantially as described above in relation to clues.                             In
   this alternative, a player attempts to collect all pieces
   of a set and when they do so they can redeem the set for a
25 prize.  In some embodiments, this will form a secondary
   game, for example where the secondary game is to be the
   first person to redeem the set.      In some embodiment, the
   player's establishment of an entitlement to all the pieces
   will be sufficient and accordingly, depending on the
30 embodiment, the input 1020 to prize issuer 1010 may be a
   piece and/or entitlement -   i.e. the player will not have
   to provide the pieces in some embodiments.
   The method of the first embodiment is summarised in Figure
35 11.  The method 1100 involves establishing that a player
   is entitled to a clue in a primary game 1110, issuing a
   clue entitlement 1120, receiving the clue entitlement 1130
                                    77087371 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                             -  18
   and issuing a clue 1140 which then can be employed in the
   secondary game 1150.
   The method of the alternative embodiment is summarised in
 5 Figure 12.  The method 1200 involves establishing that a
   player is entitled to a piece 1210, issuing a piece
   entitlement 1220, receiving a piece entitlement 1230,
   issuing the piece 1240, determining whether all pieces
   have been received and if so awarding the prize and if not
10 returning to step 1210.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the above
   functions, such as the clue issue entitlement mechanism
   and the clue issuer can be embodied, for example, in part,
15 by program code executed by processor 60.               Persons skilled
   in the art will appreciate that such program code can be
   supplied in a number of forms, for example, on a computer
   readable medium such as a disk or a memory or as a data
   signal which can be downloaded.
20
   In an alternative embodiment, the clues or clue
   entitlement are issued in response to play in the primary
   game for subsequent use during later play of the primary
   game.
25
   Example 1
   Great American Treasure Hunt   (GATH)
30 This is a version of the game, where the clues are used to
   solve a puzzle in a special secondary game.
   The special games are played at regular intervals -                       in
   this example one per week.
35
   A special game features a treasure hunt, where the players
   with a predetermined number of clues are required to find
                                    708737_1 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                              - 19
   the treasure using the information provided in the clues.
   Players acquire the clues by playing clearly identified
   GATH machines in the week preceding the special game. The
 5 clues are downloaded each week to equipment attached to
   the GATH machines.
   In the course of playing the GATH machines, tickets are
   issued to players which include a printed image or message
10 of a clue and a date on which the ticket was issued.
   A Master of Ceremonies will conduct the special game.
   Players prove their entitlement to play the special game
   by showing sufficient of their tickets to the master of
15 ceremonies to prove their entitlement.          When the master of
   ceremonies announces the commencement of the game, the
   entitled players play the treasure hunt game and use their
   clues to try to find the treasure.
20 After a period of time, the master of ceremonies declares
   the treasure hunt completed and players are awarded prizes
   according to the treasure which they have found.
   There can be a number of variations, for example:
25
   Small time event - players play machines, get clues, use
   the clues to solve a problem (e.g. a treasure hunt) win a
   prize.  All this can happen in one night.              This can happen
   at a different machine or at a Board and this can                      be run
30 by a Master of Ceremonies.
   Bigger event - players play machines, get clues, at a
   special time - e.g. once per week, they use their clues to
   solve a problem.   A Master of Ceremonies can oversight
35 this.  The problem can be solved at a machine or
   independent of a machine.
                                   708737_1 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                              - 20
   Bigger event -  same as above, but players who reach a
   certain standard in round one, once per week are invited
   to participate in a bigger event once per month.                      Once
   again, a Master of Ceremonies can oversight.
 5
   Biggest event -  same as above, but played say once per
   year.  Entry to the event comes from success in the prior
   rounds  (so you are earning your way up the success ladder
   or we can market it as a platinum level player).                      All
10 players gather at a location and use their clues to hunt
   the grounds with their spades etc. to find the treasure.
   This event is run by a Master of Ceremonies
   Example 2 - Matilda
15
   In this implementation of the game, players aim to solve a
   puzzle on an electronic gaming machine.
   Players play machines and are awarded tickets.                    The
20 tickets can only be used in a Matilda machine.                    When
   players play the Matilda machine, the machine will reveal
   clues as to the location of treasure.          The Matilda machine
   will have a series of feature games where the player is
   required to make selections.    The correct selections can
25 be made by using the clues.   The ultimate prize is awarded
   by making all the correct selections.          Prizes can be
   awarded for making some correct selections.
   Example 3 - Aristocrat Web Game
30
   In this implementation, the players aim to solve a puzzle
   over the internet.
   Players play machines and are awarded clues.                  These clues
35 can be used in a game accessible via the internet.                        In the
   internet game, the player is asked to solve a number of
   puzzles which are correctly solved using the clues.
                                    708737_1 (GHKatters) P62605.AU.5 DEBORAY 23/03/18

                              - 21
   Example 4 - Happy Families
   In this implementation of the game, players aim to collect
 5 a complete set of information.
   Players play machines which are clearly identified as
   Happy Family machines and in the course of play, they are
   issued with tickets which indicate a member of a family
10 such as Mr Baker or Miss Nurse.    When a player has
   collected a complete set of a family such as Mr Baker, Mrs
   Baker, Master Baker and Miss Baker, the player can redeem
   the set for a prize.  The prize can be the right to enter
   a special game or a non-cash prize or a cash prize.
15
   The chance of issuing a ticket with a particular character
   on it is determined by a probability table to ensure that
   a range of prizes is available with different
   probabilities.
20
   In this case, it is not necessary to hold a special event
