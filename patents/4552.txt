A CURTAIN LOCKING MECHANISM
ABSTRACT
A curtain locking mechanism (10) for a curtain (16) on a truck or trailer which includes a latch
assembly (12) and a lock assembly (14). The latch assembly (12) is actuatable between a
tensioned position in which the latch assembly (12) provides tension to the curtain (16), and a
released position in which the latch assembly (12) releases tension from the curtain (16). The
lock assembly is (14) is operatively associated with the latch assembly (12), wherein after
actuation to position the latch assembly (12) in the tensioned position the lock assembly (14) is
configured to automatically engage the latch assembly (12) to prevent movement of the latch
assembly (12) away from the tensioned position, and after actuation to release the latch assembly
(12) from the tensioned position the lock assembly (14) automatically disengages from the latch
assembly (12) to allow movement of the latch assembly (12) to the released position.

Field
[0001] The present invention relates to a curtain locking mechanism for a curtain-sided truck or
trailer, and in particular to a curtain locking mechanism for tensioning the curtain on the truck or
trailer.
Background
[0002] Curtain restraint systems for restraining cargo in trucks and trailers are known, as are
locking mechanisms for tensioning the curtain. One known locking mechanism is a latch
assembly that allows a user to simultaneously lock/unlock the curtain by operation of a single
switch. The latch assembly is driven by a pneumatic cylinder to engage a series of hooks
integrated into the curtain to lock the curtain in place. This system relies on the air in the
cylinder to hold the latch in the locked configuration. If pressure is applied to the inside of the
curtain, for example by unrestrained cargo pushing against the curtain, the pressure can cause
the piston and shaft on the primary cylinder to be pulled out causing movement of the hooks and
allowing the curtain to bulge more than the legal requirement, hence not conforming with load
restraint requirements.
Object of the Invention
[0003] It is the object of the present invention to substantially overcome or ameliorate one or
more of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to at least provide a useful alternative.
Summary of Invention
[0004] The present invention provides a curtain locking mechanism for a curtain on a truck or
trailer, the locking mechanism including:
             a latch assembly actuatable between a tensioned position in which the latch assembly
provides tension to the curtain, and a released position in which the latch assembly releases

primary pneumatic cylinder during actuation to release the curtain locking mechanism.
[0009] In one embodiment a primary conduit connects the actuator with the primary pneumatic
cylinder and a secondary conduit connects the actuator with the secondary pneumatic cylinder,
and the primary conduit is configured to restrict air flow to the primary pneumatic cylinder
during actuation to release the latch assembly.

Description of Embodiments
[0020] Figures 1 to 6 show an embodiment of a locking mechanism for a curtain locking system
according to the present invention.
[0021] Referring to Figure 1, the locking mechanism 10 includes a latch assembly 12 and a lock
assembly 14. As best shown in Figure 6, the latch assembly 12 is configured to tension a curtain
16 suspended from a curtain rail assembly 18 on a truck or trailer (not shown). The curtain 16
includes a series of straps 17 attached to a series of hooks 19. The hooks 19 are configured to
receive an extension bar 21 that is fixed to the latch assembly 12. The latch assembly 12
includes a lever 20 pivotably attached 22 to a shaft 24 which is driven by a primary pneumatic
cylinder 26. The primary pneumatic cylinder 26 is a dual acting cylinder. Lever 20 includes a
pin 28 configured to receive the lock assembly 14 as described below. The lock assembly 14

                                                  4
includes a locking claw 30 attached to a shaft 32. The shaft 32 is pivotably mounted 34 at the
opposite end 36 to the locking claw 30. A linkage 38 attaches the shaft 32 to a secondary
pneumatic cylinder 40. The secondary pneumatic cylinder 40 is pivotably mounted 42 to the
primary pneumatic cylinder 26. The linkage 38 is positioned between the locking claw 30 and
the pivot 42.
[0022] The primary pneumatic cylinder 26 is a dual acting cylinder having two air inlets 60, 62.
A primary conduit 46 is connected to air inlet 62 and is configured to supply air to one end 58 of
the cylinder 26. A second primary conduit 54 is connected to air inlet 60 and is configured to
supply air to the other end 56 of the cylinder 26. The secondary pneumatic cylinder 40 also has
two air inlets 64, 66. However, only one secondary conduit 48 is connected to an air inlet 64
and is configured to supply air to the cylinder 40.
[0023] The locking mechanism 10 is operated by a single switch 43. As will be described in
detail below, the lock assembly 14 is operatively associated with the latch assembly 12 so that
after actuation to position the latch assembly 12 in the tensioned position the lock assembly 14
automatically engages the latch assembly 12 to prevent movement of the latch assembly 12
away from the tensioned position, and after actuation to release the latch assembly 12 from the
tensioned position the lock assembly 14 automatically disengages from the latch assembly 14 to
allow movement of the latch assembly 12 to the released position.
[0024] Figure 2 shows the locking mechanism 10 in the unlocked, or released configuration, and
Figure 3 shows the schematic to release the locking mechanism 10. Air is supplied to the
primary pneumatic cylinder 26 via a primary conduit 46 and to the secondary pneumatic
cylinder 40 via a secondary conduit 48. Air may be supplied in any suitable manner for the
actuation of the pneumatic cylinders 26, 40. For example, air may be supplied from an air tank
on the truck or trailer (not shown). The primary conduit 46 has a smaller diameter than the
secondary conduit 48. Restrictors 50, 52 act to reduce air flow through the primary conduit 46.
The reduced air flow to the primary pneumatic cylinder 26 allows the secondary pneumatic
cylinder 40 to operate faster than the primary pneumatic cylinder 26. The secondary pneumatic
cylinder 40 acts to lift the locking claw 30 out of engagement with the latch assembly 12 before
the primary pneumatic cylinder 26 has enough volume of air to operate the lever 20 to rotate and

                                                   5
release tension from the curtain 16. A spring 44 attached to the linkage 38 biases the locking
claw 30 rearward to facilitate return to the unlocked position.
[0025] Figure 4 shows the locking mechanism 10 in the locked, or tensioned configuration, and
Figure 5 shows the schematic to lock the locking mechanism 10. To position the locking
mechanism 10 in the tensioned position air is supplied via a second primary conduit 54 to the
opposite end 56 of the primary pneumatic cylinder 26. This forces the release of air from the
first end 58 and causes the shaft 24 to retract. This, in turn, causes the lever 20 to pivot to
tension the curtain 16. At the same time air is released via the secondary conduit 48 through an
exhaust port 68 on the switch 43. The unconnected air inlet 66 acts as air bleeder to let the air
into the cylinder 40 so that the shaft 32 can move forward to allow the claw 30 to automatically
drop and engage the pin 28. A spring 44 may also be used to control movement of the claw 30.
The locking claw 30 restricts the movement of the shaft 24 when pressure is applied to the
inside of the curtain 16 thus ensuring that tensioning of the curtain 16 is maintained and not
altered by significant pressure on the curtain from unrestrained cargo.
[0026] Although the invention has been described with reference to a specific example, it will
be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in other forms.
