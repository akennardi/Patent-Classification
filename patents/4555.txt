   Detailed Description
30 Referring to the drawings, there is shown an embodiment of
   an electronic gaming system wherein the symbols of a
   plurality of predetermined symbol display positions within
   a symbol display are evaluated to determine whether a
   symbol lock event should be triggered.  When triggered,
35 the electronic gaming system identifies symbols in the
   symbol display which contribute in combination with
   symbols in the predetermined symbol display positions to

   at least part of an award configuration.  These symbols
   and the symbols of the predetermined display positions are
   locked in a subsequent game.
 5 In a subsequent game the remaining symbols are modified by
   selecting symbols from a symbol set for display at the
   respective ones of the symbol display positions.  The
   modified symbol display is evaluated to determine whether
   to make and award and to make any determined award.
10
   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms.  In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
15 wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
20 the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
25 gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
30 and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player. The gaming machine
   could be in the form of many electronic devices including
   PC, laptop, mobile phone.
35 However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server

                              - 8
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.   For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
 5 depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system 1 has several
10 core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
15 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
20 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54,  a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions   (e.g. to
25 place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
30 with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
35 accordance with game play rules and may include:   a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer

                                - 9
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.   That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory    and generating outputs   (for example on
 5 the display).   Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units    (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit   (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
10 array   (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a standalone gaming machine
   10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine 10
   includes a console 12 having a first video display 14.       A
15 mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of
   buttons 22 for enabling a player to interact with the
   gaming machine, in particular during game play. The video
   display 14 may also have a touch screen to enable the user
   to input instructions.    The video display 14 shown in
20 Figure 2 is in the form of a video display unit,
   particularly a cathode ray tube device.     Alternatively,
   the display 14 may be a liquid crystal display, plasma
   screen, any other suitable video display unit.      The top
   box 26 has a secondary video which may be of the same type
25 as the display 14,   or of a different type.
   While not shown in Figure 2, the mid-trim 20 also
   typically houses a credit input mechanism such as a coin
   input chute and a bill collector.     Figure 2 also shows the
30 another credit input mechanism in the form of a player
   marketing module 50 having a reading device 52 for the
   purpose of reading a player tracking device, for example
   as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking device
   may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
35 portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. The player marketing module 50 also allows
   the player to transferring credits to the gaming machine

                               - 10
   from credits stored on the player tracking device or by
   transferring credits from a player account in data
   communication with the player marketing module. Other
   embodiments  of gaming machines may have a ticket reader
 5 for reading tickets having a value and crediting the
   player based on the face value of the ticker.
   Artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
10 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
15 different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
20 processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
25 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output   (I/O) interface 105 for
30 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
35 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.    Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to

                               - 11
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
 5 controller 101 including one or more displays 106,   a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108,  a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
10 included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
15 input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
20 devices,  for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
25 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
30 controller, central controller, server or database.    In
   embodiments  employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
35 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of

                              - 12
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.   The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.   The
 5 EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
10 or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
15 provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
20 Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5 are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
25 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
30 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
35 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.

                              - 13
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
 5 the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
10 gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.   A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
15 In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
20 gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
25 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
30 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200,  including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208,  and a
35 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the

                               - 14
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
 5 network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
10 server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
15 Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
20 terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
25 a wager and hence the win entitlement which will be
   evaluated for this play of the game and initiates a play
   of the game. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that a player's win entitlement will vary from game to
   game dependent on player selections. In most spinning reel
30 games, it is typical for the player's entitlement to be
   affected by the amount they wager and selections they make
    (i.e. the nature of the wager). For example, a player's
   win entitlement may be based on how many lines they play
   in each game -  e.g. a minimum of one line up to the
35 maximum number of lines allowed by the game   (noting that
   not all permutations of win lines may be available for
   selection) and how much they wager per line.    Such win

                              - 15
   lines are typically formed by a combination of symbol
   display positions, one from each reel, the symbol display
   positions being located relative to one another such that
   they form a line.
 5
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of paylines and are an inherent part of
10 the win entitlement.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play and an amount to wager
15 per reel. Such games are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The
   selection of the reel means that each displayed symbol of
   the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one or more
   designated display positions. In other words, all symbols
20 displayed at symbol display positions corresponding to a
   selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations with
   symbols displayed at a designated, symbol display
   positions of the other reels. For example, if there are
   five reels and three symbol display positions for each
25 reel such that the symbol display positions comprise three
   rows of five symbol display positions, the symbols
   displayed in the centre row are used for non-selected
   reels. As a result, the total number of ways to win is
   determined by multiplying the number of active display
30 positions of each reel, the active display positions being
   all display positions of each selected reel and the
   designated display position of the non-selected reels. As
   a result for five reels and fifteen display positions
   there are 243 ways to win.
35
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 of
   gaming system 1 is shown implementing a number of modules

                              - 16
   based on game program code  646 stored in memory 64.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that various of
   the modules could be implemented in some other way, for
   example by a dedicated circuit.
 5
   These modules include the outcome generator 620 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
   the game and generates a game outcome which will then be
10 evaluated by outcome evaluator 626.
   The first part of forming the game outcome is for a symbol
   selector 623 to select symbols  from a set of symbols
   specified by symbol data 642 using random number generator
15 622 that are to make up a symbol display.   The selected
   symbols are advised to the display controller 629 which
   causes them to be displayed as a symbol display on display
   54 at a set of display positions. If wild symbols are to
   be incorporated into the final symbol display, in some
20 embodiments this may occur while the reels are spinning.
   In other embodiments, this may occur as the reels reach
   their stop positions. In other embodiments, this may occur
   after the reels have been stopped and the initially
   selected symbols have been displayed. In some embodiments,
25 some wilds may be added at different times. For example,
   single wilds and multi-wild symbols may be added as the
   reels are spinning while the single wilds stemming from
   the multi-wilds may be added after the reels have been
   stopped.
30
   In one game embodiment the display positions of the symbol
   display are arranged in a matrix comprising a plurality of
   columns and a plurality of rows.  In the embodiment
   described below the symbol display is arranged as a
35 rectangular matrix having five columns and four rows to
   provide twenty display positions.

                              - 17
   The outcome generator 620 is arranged to generate one or
   more game outcomes. All outcomes are displayed on video
   display 54 under control of display controller 629.   One
   example of generating a first game outcome is for the
 5 symbol selector 623 to select symbols for display from
   symbol data in the form of a plurality of symbol sets 642
   corresponding to respective ones of a plurality of reels.
   The symbol sets specify a sequence of symbols for each
   reel such that the symbol selector 623 can select all of
10 the symbols to be displayed for each reel by selecting a
   stopping position in the sequence randomly based on a
   result obtained from random number generator 622. It is
   known to use a probability table stored in memory 64 to
   vary the odds of a particular stop position being
15 selected. Other techniques can be used to control the odds
   of particular outcomes occurring to thereby control the
   return to player of the game.
   In embodiments adjacent symbol display positions may be
20 independent reels or may be a common reel.  For example a
   column may include symbol display positions which all
   display symbols from a single reel.  This can be referred
   to as a single strip.
25 In some embodiments, during a game reels can be locked.
   When a reel is locked, the symbol displayed on the reel is
   held for a subsequent game during which reels which are
   not locked are spun and the display symbol updated.   It
   will be clear to those skilled in the art that when a reel
30 is spun and updated it may or may not display a different
   symbol depending on the final position of the reel.
   In an embodiment, processor 62 executes an unlock game.
   The unlock game is independent of any base games being
35 displayed on display 54.  If a player obtains a successful
   outcome in the unlock game he is provided access to a
   further game.  The further game may be an additional base

                                - 18
   game or a feature game.    In some embodiments a successful
   outcome in the unlock game may provide the player with
   access to other games or events.
 5 Embodiments of the invention implement an unlock game.
   The unlock game is an independent game for which a winning
   outcome may result in a player being awarded access to
   additional   'unlocked' games.   Unlock games may be
   displayed simultaneously with base games displayed on
10 display 54.    On obtaining a winning result of the unlock
   game a player is awarded a win feature, for example a
   feature game or an additional base game.     The win feature
   is  'unlocked' by the winning result.
15 Activation of an unlock game is triggered during a game
   sequence.   Upon triggering an unlock game at 700,
   processor 62 retrieves unlock game code 646 from memory
   64.    Display controller 629 designates a position on
   display 54 for displaying the unlock game.     The display
20 position may be specified within unlock game code 646.
   The unlock game includes displayed symbols.     The symbols
   may be displayed at separate designated symbol display
   positions on video display 54 or may share a display
   position with the symbol display position for other games
25 being displayed on display 54.    In some embodiments the
   symbol display for the unlock game is co-located with one
   or multiple symbol display positions of other displayed
   games.
30 On activation of the unlock game, game generator 620
   generates one or more game outcomes for the unlock game at
   710.   The unlock game operates independently of any other
   games displayed on display 54 and controlled by controller
   62.   The game outcome is displayed on video display 54
35 under control of display controller 629.     In an example,
   symbol selector 623 selects symbols    for display at the
   designated position from unlock symbol set 642.      The

                               - 19
   unlock symbol set specifies symbols associated with the
   unlock game.   Symbol selector selects an unlock game
   symbol for display at the designated position based on a
   result obtained from random number generator 622.    It is
 5 known to use a probability table stored in memory 64 to
   vary the odds of a particular stop position being
   selected.   Other techniques can be used to control the
   odds of particular outcomes occurring to control the
   return to player of the game.
10
   The selected unlock game symbol is displayed at the
   designated positioned on the display.    Outcome evaluator
   626 determines whether the displayed symbol relates to a
   winning outcome based on winning unlock game data 647
15 stored in memory 64 at 720.
   In the event that the game outcome is a winning outcome at
   730 a player may be awarded a prize at 740 in accordance
   with winning unlock game prize data 648.    The prize may be
20 access to a feature game or access to an additional base
   game.   In further embodiments the prize may entitle the
   player to further credits.    It will be clear to those
   skilled in the art that the prize may take different forms
   depending on the game sequence.
25
   In embodiments of the invention the unlock game may be
   displayed at an independent position on display 54 from
   any base games the player is currently playing.
   Alternatively the unlock game may be co-located with
30 display symbols of active base games.    The symbols of the
   unlock game may be superimposed onto display symbols of
   base games.    In embodiment the symbol position for an
   unlock game corresponds to the symbol position for a base
   game.   The symbols are directly overlaid and have the same
35 sizing.   In further embodiments the size of the symbol
   positions is different, for example when the unlock symbol
   is bigger than the symbols   for the base game the symbol

                               - 20
   position for the unlock game corresponds to multiple
   symbol positions for the base game.
   In embodiments of the invention the symbol set of the
 5 unlock game may be different from the symbol set of base
   games displayed on display 54.    The symbol set may include
   a designated 'unlock' symbol which identifies an unlock
   event.   Alternatively, symbols used in other games may be
   designated as unlock symbols for the purpose of the unlock
10 game.  In some embodiments, the symbol set for the unlock
   game includes an unlock symbol and blank symbols.
   In embodiments the unlock game may be played concurrently
   with base games.   In such embodiments the symbol positions
15 for a base game and an unlock game are spun
   simultaneously.   Alternatively, symbol positions for a
   base game are spun separately from those of a base game.
   For example, a base game may be executed and symbols
   selected for display before the unlock game is executed
20 and the unlock game display position spun.
   In embodiments the unlock symbols are arranged on a reel.
   A reel is a predefined sequence of the unlock symbols.    On
   execution of an unlock game the random number generator
25 622 in combination with symbol selector 623 determines a
   display position for the reel.    In an embodiment in which
   only a single symbol is displayed, the displayed symbol
   will be the symbol which corresponds to the display
   position of the reel.   In further embodiments the random
30 number generator 622 and symbol selector generate a single
   symbol for display.
   Examples
35 An example of an embodiment of the invention is
   illustrated in Figures 8a,   8b and 8c, Figure 9 and with
   further reference to Figure 6.

                              - 21
   Figure 8a shows a video display 800 controlled by game
   controller 60.  Video display 800 includes six game
   windows 801 802 803 804 805 806. Each game window is
 5 arranged to display a plurality of symbol display
   positions arranged in a rectangular matrix having five
   columns and four rows.  Windows may be active, in which a
   game is displayed within the window and played by a
   player, or inactive, in which no game is displayed.
10
   In Figure 8a game windows 801 802 are active.   Game
   windows 803 804 805 806 are inactive.   A base game defined
   in base game code 646 is displayed in active game windows
   801 802.  An unlock game defined in unlock game code 646
15 is displayed in active game window 802.   The base game
   includes twenty symbols incorporating symbol display
   positions from each of the five columns and four rows.
   The unlock game includes one symbol displayed across the
   display positions of columns 812 813 814.   The symbol of
20 the unlock game extends across twelve symbol positions.
   At 901 the outcome generator 620 generates a game outcome
   for the base games of windows 801 802.   The game outcome
   is determined by the random number generator in
25 combination with symbol selector 623 using symbol sets of
   the base game from the symbol sets memory module 642.
   At 902 outcome generator 620 generates a game outcome for
   the unlock game of window 802.  The game outcome is
30 determined by the random number generator in combination
   with symbol selector 623 using the symbol set of the
   unlock game from the symbol sets memory module 642.
   The game outcomes are generated simultaneously by
35 processor 62.  In further embodiments game outcomes may be
   generated at separate times by processor 62.   During
   processing of the game outcomes or for a predetermined

                              - 22
   time period, display controller may display symbols in the
   symbol display positions.   The symbols may be displayed as
   animated spinning reels.
 5 At 905 display controller 629 determines which symbols
   should be displayed at the display positions of active
   windows 801 802.  The unlock game code 646 defines the
   display requirements for the outcome symbols of the unlock
   game.  The outcome symbols of the unlock game are
10 displayed in preference to any symbols from other games
   using the same display positions.
   At 905 display controller 629 determines the display
   requirements of the base game and unlock game and resolves
15 any conflicting display requirements.   At 906 display
   controller 629 displays the game outcomes in windows 801
   802.
   Figure 8a shows the resulting display from step 906.    A
20 first base game outcome is displayed in window 801.    The
   outcome includes base game outcome symbols in each of the
   display positions of rows 811 812 813 815 816 and rows 821
   822 823 824.  The outcome of the game in window 801 is
   fully visible to the player.
25
   Two games are played in window 802, a second base game and
   an unlock game.  The base game uses all twenty of the
   display positions including rows 811 812 813 814 815 and
   rows 831 832 833 834.  The unlock game uses display
30 positions of rows 812 813 814 and rows 831 832 833 834.
   Therefore, the unlock game uses twelve of the twenty
   display positions of window 802.   As mentioned above,
   unlock game code 646 identifies that the outcome symbols
   of unlocks games are displayed in preference to any
35 symbols from other games using the same display positions.

                               - 23
   In 802, the outcome of the unlock game is superimposed on
   the outcome of the base game in columns 812   813 814.
   Consequently, in window 802 display positions of columns
   811 and 815 display the symbols of the outcome of the base
 5 game and columns  812 813 814 display the symbols of the
   outcome of the unlock game.    Outcome generator 620 has
   generated an outcome for the second base game for display
   in columns 812 813 814 of window 802 but display
   controller 629 has determined not to display those symbols
10 at the current time.
   At 907 unlock game outcome evaluator 627 determines the
   outcome of the unlock game.    Winning combination data for
   the unlock game is retrieved from winning combination data
15 memory module 648.   In the example of Figure 8a the
   Wonder4 Tower logo is a winning symbol.    The winning
   outcome of the unlock game triggers an unlock event.
   Upon unlock game outcome evaluator 627 determining a
20 winning outcome, window 803 is activated by display
   controller 629, as shown in Figure 8b.    In window 801
   display controller 629 maintains the displayed outcome of
   the first base game.   In window 802 display controller 629
   replaces the unlock symbols with the outcome symbols from
25 the second base game.   In window 803 display controller
   displays symbols identifying window 803 is unlocked.     In
   the example of Figure 8b the unlock symbol is the Wonder4
   Tower logo.   The unlock symbol is animated in window 803
   to identify to the player that the window is about to be
30 unlocked.   The unlocked symbol is displayed for a
   predefined time period.   In further embodiments the
   unlocked symbols may be displayed until a player interacts
   with the game, for example provides input to initiate a
   new game.
35

                              - 24
   When the unlocked symbol is removed from window 803 a
   third base game is displayed, as shown in Figure 8c.    The
   third base game is then active.
 5 In further embodiments unlock games are triggered at
   various times during the game sequence.   At each unlock
   game a player plays the game to unlock the next inactive
   window until all windows are active.
10 In an embodiment the unlock symbol set includes unlock
   symbols and blanks.  In the event that the outcome of the
   unlock game is unsuccessful the blank is displayed.
   The animation of the unlock game and base games can be
15 controlled to spin the different reels at different times.
   In an embodiment the display controller animates the reels
   of the base game spinning and stops reels of different
   display positions at different times.   The unlock game
   reel is stopped as the last reel of the base game stops.
20
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
25 executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
30 sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
35 values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program

                                 - 25
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
 5 a data signal   (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
10 instructions executable by the processor.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art is referred
   to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission
   that the prior art forms a part of the common general
15 knowledge in the art in any country.
   In the claims which follow and in the preceding
   description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary
20 implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as
   "comprises" or   " comprising" is used in an inclusive sense,
   i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but
   not to preclude the presence or addition of further
   features in various embodiments of the invention.
