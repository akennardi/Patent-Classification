                     ROTARY ACTUATOR WITH PASS-THROUGH FLUID CIRCUIT
                                                  Field of the Disclosure
                The present disclosure relates to fluid-powered rotary actuators generally, and more
 5 particularly to mobile apparatus employing rotary actuators for rotatably coupling a
   pressurized fluid-operated implement to a base structure.
                                              Background of the Disclosure
                Rotary helical splined actuators have been employed to achieve high-torque output
10 from a piston driven along a linear path. In typical arrangements, the actuator includes a
   cylindrical body with a rotary output shaft extending coaxially within the body, with an end
   portion of the shaft providing the drive output. An elongated angular piston sleeve has a
   sleeve portion splined to cooperate with corresponding splines on a ring gear attached to the
   side wall of the body, as well as with splines on an outer surface of the output shaft. The
15 piston sleeve is reciprocally mounted within the body, such that pressurized fluid may be
   applied to opposing sides of the head to produce reciprocal axial movement of the piston
   sleeve.
                As the piston sleeve linearly reciprocates in an axial direction within the body, the
   outer splines of the sleeve portion engage or mesh with the splines of the ring gear to cause
20 rotation of the sleeve portion. The resulting linear and rotational movement of the sleeve
   portion is transmitted through the inner splines of the sleeve portion to the splines of the shaft
   to cause the shaft to rotate. Bearings rotatably support the shaft relative to the body.
                Fluid-powered rotary actuators find wide application to move, support, and position
   rotary loads.                 Example industries in which rotary actuators are widely used include
25 agriculture, construction, material handling, and mining. A common use for fluid-powered
   rotary actuators is in connection with a boom, wherein the actuator is employed to rotate an
   implement mounted to a distal end of the boom about the output shaft axis.               Examples
   include aerial work platforms for platform, basket, and jib rotation, as well as construction
   equipment and agricultural harvesters for the positioning of boom attachments.
30              Certain boom attachments require the supply of pressurized fluid for operation, such
   as working implements. A particular example is tree-trimming apparatus, which includes a
                                                              1
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

   large diameter circular saw mounted at the distal end of the boom, and powered by a high
   speed hydraulic motor. Pressurized fluid supply lines must therefore extend between the
   pressurized fluid-powered motor and a pressurized fluid source. Pressurized fluid supply
   lines positioned along the boom exterior may become entangled among foreign objects at the
 5 worksite, and may also be at risk for damage through puncture or cutting. Such risks and
   drawbacks are exacerbated when the boom has a telescoping function, wherein the
   pressurized fluid tubing must be provided with sufficient/excess length to accommodate the
   adjustable extension of the boom.
                It would therefore be considered an advancement in the art, were it possible to supply
10 working implements at the end of a boom with pressurized fluid lines that are protected from
   interference and damage. The pressurized fluid supply lines may be so protected within the
   interior of the boom, wherein a need exists to communicate pressurized fluid from within the
   interior of the boom to an operating implement, and particularly in circumstances wherein the
   operating implement is rotatably coupled to the boom with one or more rotary actuators.
15              It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such
   reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common
   general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
20                                             Summary of the Disclosure
                Disclosed is an embodiment of a mobile apparatus which includes a mobile carriage,
   a pedestal supported by the mobile carriage, and a boom having a proximal portion coupled
   to the pedestal. An implement connection apparatus rotatably connects a pressurized fluid
   driven implement to a distal portion of the boom for rotation of the implement about an
25 actuator axis.                The implement connection apparatus includes a rotary actuator having a
   housing defining a chamber, a shaft having first and second ends and extending axially
   through the chamber for rotation relative to the housing about the actuator axis. The shaft is
   rotated by a translator member that is axially driven parallel to the actuator axis in the
   chamber. The implement connection apparatus further includes a pressurized fluid circuit for
30 delivery of a pressurized fluid through the rotary actuator to the implement.             The circuit
   includes a feed manifold at the first end of the shaft, a delivery manifold at the second end of
                                                           2
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

   the shaft, and first and second channels fluidically coupling the feed manifold to the delivery
   manifold through the shaft. The feed and delivery manifolds are rotatable with the shaft
   relative to the housing. The implement connection apparatus is connected to the boom with
   the feed manifold positioned within the boom lumen.
 5              Also disclosed is an embodiment of a mobile apparatus which includes a self
   propelled mobile carriage including a frame, a pedestal pivotally mounted to the frame for
   pivoting about first and second substantially orthogonal pivot axes, a boom having a
   proximal portion pivotally mounted to the pedestal, a cutting apparatus, and a connection
   apparatus rotatably connecting the cutting apparatus to a distal portion of the boom for
10 rotation of the cutting apparatus about an actuator axis. The connection apparatus includes a
   rotary actuator having a housing defining a chamber, a shaft having first and second ends and
   extending axially through the chamber for rotation relative to the housing about the actuator
   axis. The connection apparatus further includes a pressurized fluid circuit for delivery of
   pressurized fluid through the actuator to the cutting apparatus. The circuit includes a feed
15 manifold at the first end of the shaft, a delivery manifold at the second end of the shaft, and
   first and second channels fluidically coupling the feed manifold to the delivery manifold
   through the shaft. The implement connection apparatus is connected to the boom with the
   feed manifold positioned within the boom lumen.
                Also presently disclosed is a means by which a pressurized fluid for operating a
20 working implement may be communicated through a rotary actuator. A fluid circuit with
   first and second channels extends through the rotary actuator and is fluidically coupled to
   feed and delivery manifolds to properly receive and distribute the pressurized fluid. The feed
   manifold may receive and distribute the pressurized fluid at an interior environment such as
   within a boom lumen, and the delivery manifold may receive and distribute pressurized fluid
25 at an exterior environment, such as external to a boom and proximate to the working
   implement. Pressurized fluid may therefore be supplied to a pressurized fluid-driven motor
   for operating the implement through an interior of the boom, and through a rotary actuator.
                A rotary actuator for selectively rotating a pressurized fluid-driven implement about
   an actuator axis includes a housing defining a chamber and a splined shaft having first and
30 second ends extending axially through the chamber for rotation relative to the housing about
   the actuator axis.                 One of the housing and the shaft are configured for coupling to the
                                                            3
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

   implement.                A piston is mounted in the chamber, and is axially responsive to pressurized
   fluid in the chamber to reciprocally axially drive a splined member between the splined shaft
   and a grooved portion in the chamber.               Meshed engagement among the splined shaft, the
   splined member, and the grooved portion translates axial movement of the splined member
 5 into rotary movement of the splined shaft. A pressurized fluid circuit is provided in the
   rotary actuator for delivery of pressurized fluid through the actuator to the implement. The
   circuit includes a feed manifold at the first end of the shaft, a delivery manifold at the second
   end of the shaft, and first and second channels fluidically coupling the feed manifold to the
   delivery manifold axially through the splined shaft. The feed and delivery manifolds may be
10 rotatable with the splined shaft relative to the housing.

                                      Detailed Description of the Disclosure
                The objects and advantages enumerated above together with other objects, features,
   and advances represented by the present disclosure will now be presented in terms of detailed
   embodiments described with reference to the attached drawing figures, which are intended to
10 be representative of various possible configurations of the disclosure.         Other embodiments
   and aspects of the disclosure are recognized as being within the grasp of those having
   ordinary skill in the art.
                For the purposes of describing the apparatus of the present disclosure, the terms "up",
   "down", "horizontal", "vertical", "above", "below", "proximal", "distal", or similar related
15 terms may be used herein to describe the component parts of the apparatus and their relative
   positions. Such terms are used for convenience in reference to the attached drawing figures,
   but should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of the present disclosure.
                With reference now to the drawing figures, and first to Figure 1, a mobile apparatus
   10 includes a mobile carriage 12 with a frame 14 that supports a pedestal 16 and a boom
20 support 18. A boom 20 includes a proximal end 22 and a distal end 24. Proximal end 22 of
   boom 20 may be secured to boom support 18. Mobile apparatus 10 may further include an
   operating implement 26 secured to boom 20.                In the illustrated embodiment, operating
   implement 26 may include a cutting apparatus, such as a circular saw. Distal end 24 of boom
   20 and operating implement 26 may be operably elevated substantially above carriage 12 by
25 boom support 18.
                An example mobile apparatus is described in co-pending U.S. Patent Application
   Serial No. 13/819,844, assigned to the present Applicant assignee, and herein incorporated by
   reference.            Another example mobile apparatus is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,411,070,
   assigned to the present Applicant assignee, and incorporated herein by reference.               The
30 example mobile apparatus described in the above-cited references are adapted to be
   selectively driven to locations at which the operating implement, in some cases a cutting
                                                        5
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

   apparatus, may operably reach and cut vegetation. Such a procedure may be useful in, for
   example, right of way clearing for roadways and electrical power lines, storm damage repair
   and cleanup, and otherwise aesthetic vegetation removal. While such apparatus is described
   in terms of a tree-trimming device, it is contemplated that mobile apparatus 10 of the present
 5 disclosure may be useful in a variety of other configurations requiring the stable elevation of
   boom 20, and a rotatable operation of operating implement 26 at distal end 24 of boom 20.
   Such alternative applications include lift operations for lifting one or more persons in a
   bucket secured to boom 20, firefighting equipment, and other servicing equipment for
   servicing elevated positions such as elevated electrical power lines, window washing
10 equipment, roofing equipment, and so on. Therefore, apparatus 10 should be considered as
   being useful in applications other than tree trimming operations, wherein operating
   implement 26 may include one or more of a variety of attachments rotatable secured to boom
   20.
                An enlarged view of an example operating implement 26 rotatably secured to distal
15 end 24 of boom 20 is illustrated in Figure 2. In the illustrated embodiment, operating
   implement 26 is a cutting apparatus including a pressurized fluid-operated motor 30 for
   driving a circular saw 32 about a saw axis 34.         Motor 30 may be any of a variety of
   pressurized fluid-operated motors, including conventional hydraulic or pneumatic motors
   suitable for driving circular saw 32 at a high rotational speed. A saw guard 36 is supplied to
20 help eliminate the possibility of debris being thrown backward in the direction of the
   operator. Saw guard 36 may be designed so that it allows a maximum amount of a cutting
   surface of circular saw 32 to be exposed while still affording protection to the operator. A
   motor housing 38 at least partially surrounds motor 30, and a debris guard 40 acts as a barrier
   to debris impacting pressurized fluid conduits for motor 30.
25              A connection apparatus 42 rotatably connects operating implement 26 to distal
   portion 24 of boom 20 for rotation of operating implement 26 about an actuator axis 44. In
   the illustrated embodiment, actuator axis 44 is parallel to boom 20, and may be substantially
   coextensive with a longitudinal axis of boom 20.        Consequently, operating implement 26
   may be rotated by connection apparatus 42 with respect to boom 20 about actuator axis 44
30 which, in this embodiment, is non-parallel to saw axis 34. In some embodiments, actuator
   axis 44 may be substantially perpendicular to saw axis 34. However, it is contemplated that
                                                   6
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

   connection apparatus 42 may be arranged to provide one or more rotation axes about which
   operating implement 26 may be rotated, including actuator axes that are non-perpendicular to
   saw axis 34.
                Boom 20 may be telescopingly extendable, with an inner boom 21a telescopingly
 5 received in an outer boom 21b. An outer boom ring 46 preferably aids in maintaining the
   concentricity of inner boom 21a within outer boom 21b as inner boom 21a is telescopingly
   extended and retracted along a longitudinal boom axis. Outer boom ring 46 has an opening
   with a diameter that is substantially equal to, but slightly larger than, an outer diameter of
   inner boom 21a to retain inner boom 21a in a substantially coaxial alignment with outer
10 boom 21b.
                An end cutaway view of the apparatus is illustrated in Figure 3. A mounting bracket
   48 is externally affixed to inner boom 21a with bracket bolts 50, with the mounting bracket
   48 serving as a brace to secure a connection shell 52 to an inner surface of inner boom 21a at
   distal end 24. Connection shell 52 includes a cylindrical portion 54 and a brace portion 56
15 that connects cylindrical portion 54 to rotary actuator 60.            In some embodiments, brace
   portion 56 may be welded to cylindrical portion 54 to fixedly secure brace portion 56 with
   cylindrical portion 54, wherein the connection of cylindrical portion 54 to an inner surface of
   inner boom 21a affixes connection shell 52 with respect to inner boom 21a.                   A rear
   perspective view of connection apparatus 42 is shown in Figure 4 with inner boom 21a
20 removed from view.                 Brace portion 56 may be configured as a disk with an outer radial
   surface 58 secured to an inner surface 57 of cylindrical portion 54. In some embodiments,
   connection between brace portion 56 and cylindrical portion 54 may be made by welding or
   other techniques. Other arrangements for the securement of brace portion 56 to cylindrical
   portion 54 are also contemplated by the present disclosure, including embodiments wherein
25 connection shell 52 is a unitary body formed without weldments or other securing means.
   Brace portion 56 may be substantially annular to define an inner opening 59 for access to
   rotary actuator 60 disposed within a chamber at least partially defined by cylindrical portion
   54. Brace portion 56 may further include a cutout portion 61 to permit access to an annular
   space between rotary actuator 60 and cylindrical portion 54.
30              Figure 5 illustrates connection apparatus 42 with additional parts removed, including
   connection shell 52, to reveal rotary actuator 60. An example actuator device useful for
                                                          7

   rotary actuator 60 is a helical, hydraulic rotary actuator available from Helac Corporation of
   Enumclaw, Washington, under model no. L10.                 An example helical rotary actuator
   description is provided in U.S. Patent No. 5,447,095, herein incorporated by reference.
   Rotary actuator 60 may be operated to selectively rotate operating implement 26 about
 5 actuator axis 44. In this embodiment, rotary actuator 60 includes a housing 64 that is secured
   in place within connection shell 52 by housing bolts 66 secured through brace portion 56 and
   into housing 64. The fixed securement of housing 64 to brace portion 56 maintains rotary
   actuator 60 in a stationary secured relationship with respect to connection shell 52, and
   correspondingly to inner boom 21a through mounting bolts 50 and mounting bracket 48.
10              A cross-sectional view of rotary actuator 60 taken along cut line 6 is illustrated in
   Figure 6, with housing 64 defining a chamber 68. The interior components of rotary actuator
   60 are shown schematically for the purpose of simplicity. A shaft 70 includes first and
   second ends 72, 74, and extends axially through chamber 68 for rotation relative to housing
   64 about actuator axis 44. As described above, shaft 70 may be splined to operably engage
15 with a piston sleeve to impart rotary motion to shaft 70. An output plate 76 is secured to
   second end 74 of shaft 70 for rotation with shaft 70. Shaft output plate 76, in the illustrated
   embodiment, is positioned at an end of rotary actuator 60 proximate to operating implement
   26, such that operating implement 26 may be coupled to shaft output plate 76 for rotary
   motion with shaft 70.
20              In an example embodiment, rotary actuator 60 includes a piston 80 mounted in
   chamber 68 and axially responsive along actuator axis 44 to pressurized fluid at respective
   opposed sides 84, 85 of piston head 82. Pressurized fluid is selectively injected and removed
   from chamber 68 through first and second sets of fluid ports 86, 88. Axial reciprocation of
   piston 80 within chamber 68 occurs when the pressurized fluid selectively enters through a
25 first port 86 to one side of piston head 82, or through a second port 88 at second side 85 of
   piston head 82. The application of pressurized fluid to one side of piston head 82 axially
   drives piston 80 along actuator axis 44.          The movement of piston 80 correspondingly
   reciprocally axially drives a splined member 90 between splined shaft 70 and a grooved
   portion 92 in chamber 68. Meshed engagement among splined shaft 70, splined member 90,
30 and grooved portion 92 translates axial movement of splined member 90 into rotary
   movement of splined shaft 70. In the illustrated embodiment, splined member 90 forms part
                                                     8
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

   of piston 80, so as to axially reciprocate therewith.       Outer helical splines 91 of splined
   member 90 slidably engage or mesh with inner helical splines 93 of grooved portion 92 to
   cause rotation of splined member 90. The axial and rotational movement of splined member
   90 is transmitted through inner helical splines 96 of splined member 90 slidably engaging or
 5 meshing with outer helical splines 98 of shaft 70, so as to cause shaft 70 to rotate relative to
   housing 64. The application of fluid pressure through port 86 produces axial movement of
   splined member 90 toward first end 72 of shaft 70. The application of fluid pressure through
   port 88 produces axial movement of splined member 90 toward second end 74 of shaft 70.
   Rotary actuator 60 provides relative rotational movement between housing 64 and shaft 70
10 through the conversion of this linear movement of splined member 90 into rotational
   movement of shaft 70.
                An implement adaptor plate 102 may be bolted to shaft output plate 76 with shaft
   bolts 78, such that implement adaptor plate 102 rotates with shaft output plate 76 and
   correspondingly with shaft 70. Motor housing 38 may be welded or otherwise secured to
15 implement adaptor plate 102.           In this manner, operating implement 26 rotates with
   implement adaptor plate 102, and correspondingly with shaft 70.
                An aspect of the present disclosure is the capability to deliver pressurized fluid to
   operating implement 26 through an internal, and thereby protected pathway.             Pressurized
   fluid circuit 104 is preferably configured for delivery of pressurized fluid through rotary
20 actuator 60 to operating element 26. Accordingly, pressurized fluid circuit 104 is adapted to
   transfer pressurized fluid between an interior of inner boom 21 a and operating implement 26
   through rotary actuator 60. Pressurized fluid circuit 104 includes a feed manifold 106 at first
   end 72 of shaft 70, a delivery manifold 108 at second end 74 of shaft 70, and first and second
   channels 110, 112 fluidically coupling feed manifold 106 to delivery manifold 108 axially
25 through shaft 70. Preferably, first and second channels are coaxial with one another along
   actuator axis 44, so that both of first and second channels 110, 112 remain radially centered
   in shaft 70 as shaft 70 is rotated about actuation axis 44. First channel 110 may be defined as
   a lumen within a first channel tube 111 that is held coaxially in place within a second channel
   tube 113 at first channel tube fittings 116, 118 in feed manifold 106 and delivery manifold
30 108, respectively. Second channel tube 113 may be positioned within an axial bore 114 of
   shaft 70, and may be secured coaxially about first channel tube 111 at second channel tube
                                                     9

   fittings 120, 122 in feed manifold 106 and delivery manifold 108, respectively.            Second
   channel 112 may therefore comprise an annular space between second channel tube 113 and
   an outer surface of first channel tube 111.
                First channel tube fittings 116, 118 include machined grooves 117, 119 for receiving
 5 a securing and sealing ring, such as a resilient gasket in the form of an o-ring positioned
   about an outer surface of first channel tube 111. The securing/sealing gaskets both coaxially
   position first channel tube 111 within axial bore 114 of shaft 70, and also form a fluid-tight
   seal to second channel 112. In this manner, second channel 112 fluidically communicates
   only between a return inlet port 126 and a return outlet port 128, and thereby is sealed from
10 fluidic communication with first channel 110.           Machined grooves 130, 132 in respective
   second channel tube fittings 120, 122 may be configured to receive a resilient gasket for
   securing second channel tube 113 in place coaxially about actuation axis 44 through axial
   bore 114 in shaft 70. Second channel tube 113 may accordingly be secured coaxially about,
   and radially spaced from first channel tube 11, so as to define an annular second channel 112
15 between first and second channel tubes 111, 113.
                Feed manifold 106 includes a mounting plate 134 press fit or otherwise secured to
   first end 72 of shaft 70. A series of feed manifold bolts 136 may secure feed manifold 106
   through mounting plate 134 to first end 72 of shaft 70. In some embodiments, mounting
   plate 134 may include tapped and threaded recesses to threadably receive feed manifold bolts
20 136. In other embodiments, feed manifold bolts 136 may be threadably received directly into
   shaft 70 in order to secure feed manifold 106 to shaft 70. Feed manifold bolts 136 extend
   through bolt sleeves 138 to secure feed manifold head 140 to mounting plate 134, and
   ultimately to shaft 70.
                A similar arrangement is provided for the securement of delivery manifold 108 to
25 second end 74 of shaft 70. Namely, delivery manifold bolts 142 extend through bolt sleeves
   144 to secure delivery manifold head 146 to second end 74 of shaft 70.                   In some
   embodiments, a mounting plate 148 is press-fit or otherwise secured to second end 74 of
   shaft 70 to act as an intermediate securing part to connect delivery manifold head 146 to
   second end 74 of shaft 70. Mounting plates 134, 148 may be arranged to rotate with shaft 70,
30 such that feed and delivery manifolds 106, 108 are rotatable with shaft 70 relative to housing
   64.
                                                       10
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

                In some embodiments, delivery manifold bolts 142 may be configured to be
   threadably received in threaded sockets 150 of shaft 70. Such sockets 150 may be standard
   original equipment for rotary actuator 60 to facilitate the mounting of a body to shaft 70 for
   rotatable movement thereof with respect to housing 64.
 5              Feed manifold 106 includes an inlet port 152 that fluidically communicates with first
   channel 110, but is fluidically disconnected from second channel 112 through the mounting
   arrangement of first channel tube 111 in feed manifold 106, as described above. Inlet port
   152 may be arranged to securely receive a flexible tubing end to convey pressurized fluid
   from the flexible supply conduit, through inlet port 152, to first channel 110. Pressurized
10 supply fluid may therefore be delivered through rotary actuator 60 via first channel 110
   axially through shaft 70 to delivery manifold outlet port 154. A delivery tube (not shown)
   may convey pressurized supply fluid from delivery manifold outlet port 154 to pressurized
   fluid operated motor 30 for operating motor 30.              Typically, pressurized fluid operated
   motors, such as motor 30, require a return of pressurized fluid to the pressurized fluid source.
15 To accommodate such a return line, delivery manifold 108 includes a return inlet port 126
   that fluidically communicates with second channel 112, but is fluidically disconnected from
   first channel 110. Consequently, return pressurized fluid from motor 30 may be directed
   through return inlet port 126 to second channel 112 axially through shaft 170 to return outlet
   port 128 in feed manifold 106. A pressurized fluid conduit may then convey the return
20 pressurized fluid from return outlet port 128 to the pressurized fluid source. An example
   pressurized fluid circuit therefore conveys pressurized fluid along a path through feed
   manifold inlet port 152, through first channel 110, and through delivery manifold outlet port
   154 to a conduit conveying the pressurized fluid to pressurized fluid-operated motor 30. The
   circuit continues by returning pressurized fluid from motor 30 through a fluid conduit to
25 return inlet port 126 in delivery manifold 108, and through second channel 112 to return
   outlet port 128 in feed manifold 106, wherein a conduit conveys the return pressurized fluid
   to the pressurized fluid source.
                Rotary actuator 60 actuates as a result of reciprocal axial motion of piston 80, which
   moves as the result of pressurized fluid alternately supplied to fluid ports 86, 88. Rotary
30 actuator pressurized fluid supply lines may be routed through an interior of inner boom 21a
   through cutout portion 61 in brace portion 56 of connection shell 52, so as to connect to fluid
                                                       11
   10328580 1 (GHMatters) P98171.AU.1

   ports 86, 88 at housing 64 of rotary actuator 60. In this manner, the pressurized fluid supply
   lines to rotary actuator 60 may be contained within an interior environment not exposed to
   the external hazards introduced in the operation of implement 26.                Moreover, such
   pressurized fluid supply lines connect to the rotary static housing 64 of rotary actuator 60, in
 5 that such supply lines do not rotate with shaft 70. Accordingly, the pressurized fluid supply
   lines to rotary actuator 60 may avoid tangling and damage that may result with twisting of
   fluid supply lines.
                With reference back to Figure 1, pedestal 16 of apparatus 10 may be supported by
   frame 14, and may be pivotable about first and second substantially orthogonal axes 230,
10 232. A pivot mechanism 240 may actuate pedestal 16 individually or simultaneously about
   such first and second axes 230, 232, such that pedestal 16 may be actuated about a partial
   spheroid to a desired extent.        In one embodiment, pedestal 16 may be tilted up to a 200
   attitude relative to a vertically oriented central axis 242.     Boom support 18 is capable of
   pivoting boom 20 relative to pedestal 16.
