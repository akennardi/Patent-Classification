   The invention relates to methods for predicting risk of major adverse cardiac events and
   detecting the presence of severe disease based on circulating levels of ST2 and natriuretic
   peptides (NP), e.g., NT-proBNP, alone or in combination with other biomarkers.
15                                                                BACKGROUND
                     Clinical evaluation for determination of disease severity and risk of major
   adverse cardiac events (MACE), e.g., mortality due to heart failure, may not always
   be apparent. The decision whether to treat a subject aggressively or conservatively, or
   to admit the subject as an inpatient or to send them home, may sometimes be made
20 solely on a physician' s clinical assessment or "gutfeeling" as to the individual' s
   actual condition. A formula for determining a subject' s likelihood of an adverse
   outcome, e.g., mortality, transplantation, and/or readmission, would significantly
   enhance the physician' s abilityto make informed treatment decisions, improve patient
   care and reduce overall healthcare costs.

   The present invention is based, at least in part, on the use of changes in serum levels of
   the biomarker ST2 (Growth Stimulation-Expressed Gene 2, also known as Interleukin 1
   Receptor Like 1 (IL1RL-1)), in combination with levels of a natriuretic peptide (NP)
30 such as the inactive N-terminal fragment of brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP),

                                                                  -2
   to predict the likelihood of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), e.g., recurrence of the
   initial cardiac event (e.g., a second MI); angina; decompensation of heart failure;
   admission for cardiovascular disease (CVD); mortality due to CVD; or transplant, within
   a specific time period, e.g., 30 days, 3 or 6 months, or a year or more, or to detect the
 5 presence of severe disease (e.g., severe disease likely to require transplantation or other
   aggressive treatment). These methods can be used to predict clinical outcome, e.g., in
   patients hospitalized after an acute cardiac event.
                     In some embodiments, the methods described herein include monitoring changes
   in ST2 levels over time (e.g., an ST2 ratio) and determining an NP level, to provide
10 diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients, e.g., patients with non-specific
   symptoms, e.g., acutely dyspneic patients and those with chest pain, or patients who have
   been diagnosed with heart failure.                           NPs include the forms of the brain natriuretic
   peptides, i.e., NT-proBNP, proBNP, and BNP, and the atrial natriuretic peptides, i.e., NT
   proANP, proANP, and ANP. In preferred embodiments, the NP is NT-proBNP.
15                   In some embodiments, the invention features methods for evaluating the risk
   of a MACE within a specific time period, e.g., 30, 60, 90, or 180 days (e.g., one, two,
   three, or six months), or one, two, or five years, for a subject. The methods can
   include determining ratios of ST2 and a level of an NP, e.g., NT-proBNP, and using
   those ratios and levels to determine risk of MACE, as described herein. Determining
20 a ratio of ST2 can include obtaining at least two samples, e.g., samples of blood,
   serum, plasma, urine, or body tissue from the subject (both samples are from the same
   fluid or tissue, taken at two different time points); determining levels of ST2 in the
   samples; and dividing the biomarker levels of ST2 in the earlier samples into the
   levels of ST2 in the later sample, thereby arriving at a ratio of ST2. Such a ratio
25 provides an indication of how the levels of ST2 are changing in the subject over time.
   Thus, in some embodiments, the methods include determining or obtaining a first ST2
   level, e.g., a baseline level in a sample taken, e.g., at admission or at initiation of
   treatment, and a second ST2 level, e.g., in a sample taken some time later, e.g., one,
   two, three, four, or more days later. In addition, the methods will generally include
30 determining or obtaining an NP level, e.g., an NT-proBNP level at least at the second

                                                                          -3
   time point, e.g., in a sample of blood, serum, plasma, urine, or body tissue from the
   subject.
                     In one aspect, the invention provides methods, e.g., computer-implemented
   methods, for evaluating the risk of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) for a
 5 subject within one year. The methods include determining a MACE risk score
   (MACERS) for a subject based upon, at least in part, the ratio of a second level of
   Growth Stimulation-Expressed Gene 2 (ST2) in the subject at a second time (ST2 TO)
   to a first level of ST2 in the subject at a first time (ST2 TI), in combination with a
   weighted logarithm of a level of a natriuretic peptide (NP) in the subject at the second
10 time (NP TI), and comparing the MACERS to a reference MACERS; wherein the
   MACERS in comparison with the reference MACERS indicates the subject' s risk of a
   MACE within one year.
                     In some embodiments, the methods described herein include the use of the
   following formula to determine a subject' s risk ofa MACE:
15                                                    X     =   (ST2 T1/ST2 TO) + aln(NP TI)
                     In preferred embodiments, the ST2 ratios and NT-proBNP levels, are used to
   determine a MACE risk score using the following formula:
                                              X   =    (ST2 TI/ST2 TO) + aln(NTproBNP TI)
   In some embodiments, the coefficient alpha is 0.33.
20                   In some embodiments, the subject' s MACE risk scoreis compared to a
   reference MACE risk score (e.g., a threshold value). A comparison of the subject' s
   MACE risk score versus the reference score indicates the subject' s risk of a MACE
   within the specific time period. In some embodiments, the specific time period is one
   year.
25                   In some embodiments, the reference MACE risk score represents the score in
   a subject or group of subjects who have a low risk of death within one year. In some
   embodiments, a subject MACE risk score that is greater than or equal to the reference
   MACE risk score indicates that the subject has an elevated, i.e., statistically
   significantly elevated, risk of death within one year. In some embodiments, the
30 elevated risk of death is at least 20% higher, e.g., 30%, 40%, or 50% higher.

                                                                 -4
                     In some embodiments, the methods include determining a MACE risk score,
   and optionally selecting or modifying a treatment for the subject, based on the MACE
   risk score. For example, if the MACE risk score is more than a selected reference,
   then the subject has a high risk and should be treated more aggressively; if the subject
 5 is already being treated, then the subject is not responding favorably to the current
   treatment and a new treatment should be selected, i.e., an alternate treatment to which
   the patient may respond more favorably.
                     In some embodiments, the subject exhibits one or more non-specific
   symptoms, e.g., chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath (dyspnea), nausea,
10 vomiting, eructation, sweating, palpitations, lightheadedness, fatigue, and fainting. In
   some embodiments, the symptom is dyspnea or chest pain.
                     In some embodiments, the subject does not have a cardiovascular disorder. In
   various embodiments, the subject has a pulmonary disorder, e.g., acute infection (e.g.,
   pneumonia), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary
15 embolism.
                     In certain embodiments, the subject has a liver disorder, e.g., a liver disorder
   associated with chemotherapy, alcohol toxicity, or drug toxicity as determined by
   standard liver function laboratory tests.
                     In some embodiments, the methods further include determining the level of an
20 adjunct (non-ST2, non-IL-33, non-NT-proBNP) biomarker, e.g., Troponin, CRP, D
   dimers, BUN, albumin, liver function enzymes, measures of renal function, e.g.,
   creatinine, creatinine clearance rate, or glomerular filtration rate, and/or bacterial
   endotoxin, in the sample; and comparing the level of the adjunct biomarker in the
   sample to a reference level of the adjunct biomarker. The level of the adjunct
25 biomarker in the sample as compared to the reference, in combination with the MACE
   risk score in the sample as compared to a reference MACE risk score, indicates
   whether the subject has an elevated risk of death within a specific time period, and/or
   has a present severe disease. In some embodiments, the methods include determining
   a change in levels over time (e.g., a ratio) for the adjunct biomarker, by comparing a
30 first level, e.g., a baseline level, to a second level, e.g., a level taken some time later,
   e.g., one, two, three, four, or more days later.

                     In some embodiments, the subject has a BMI of 25-29, a BMI of > 30, or
   renal insufficiency, e.g., the subject is selected on the basis that they have a BMI of
   25-29, a BMI of >30, or renal insufficiency.
                     In another aspect, the invention includes methods for evaluating a subject' s
 5 condition over time, e.g., for evaluating the efficacy of a treatment in a subject. The
   methods include determining a first MACE risk score in a subject, based upon a ratio
   of a first, baseline level of ST2 and a second level of ST2 taken at a second time
   point, and a first level of an NP, e.g., NT-proBNP, taken at the second time point, to
   determine a first MACE risk score; and determining a second MACE risk score based
10 upon a ratio of the first, baseline level of ST2 and a third ST2 level taken at a third
   time point, and a level of an NP, e.g., NT-proBNP, taken at the third time point,
   wherein the third time point is some time after the second time point, e.g., days,
   weeks, months, or years later. A comparison of the first and second MACE risk
   scores indicates whether the subject is declining, improving, or maintaining the same
15 status, e.g., indicates the efficacy of the treatment in the subject. For example, a
   second MACE risk score that is lower than the first MACE risk score indicates that
   the treatment is effective.
                     As used herein, a "sample" includes any bodily fluid or tissue, e.g., one or
   more of blood, serum, plasma, urine, and body tissue. In certain embodiments, a
20 sample is a serum, plasma, or blood sample.
                     An antibody that "binds specifically to" an antigen, binds preferentially to the
   antigen in a sample containing other proteins.
                     The methods and kits described herein have a number of advantages. For
   example, the methods can be used to determine whether a patient should be admitted
25 or held as an inpatient for further assessment, regardless of whether a definitive
   diagnosis has been made. For example, the methods can be used for risk stratification
   of a given subject, e.g., to make decisions regarding the level of aggressiveness of
   treatment that is appropriate for the subject, based on their MACE risk score as
   determined by a method described herein. Better treatment decisions can lead to
30 reduced morbidity and mortality, and better allocation of scarce health care resources.
   The methods described herein can be used to make general assessments as to whether

   a patient should be further tested to determine a specific diagnosis. The methods
   described herein can also be used for patient population risk stratification, e.g., to
   provide information about clinical performance or expected response to a therapeutic
   intervention. The methods described herein can be used regardless of the underlying
 5 cause or ultimate diagnosis, and therefore are not limited to specific indications.

                                                            DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                     Clinical evaluation of patients, particularly patients with non-specific symptoms
   such as dyspnea or chest pain, is often challenging. The results described herein provide
   evidence that MACE risk scores based on ST2 and NT-proBNP are useful in the
 5 prognostic evaluation of patients, regardless of the underlying cause of their disease. The
   MACE risk score is a powerful indicator of severe disease and imminent death, as
   demonstrated herein in several different populations.
   Predicting MACE
10                   Elevated concentrations of ST2 are markedly prognostic for death within one
   year, with a dramatic divergence in survival curves for those with elevated ST2 soon after
   presentation, regardless of the underlying diagnosis. As one example, there is a dramatic
   relationship between elevations of ST2 and the risk for mortality within one year
   following presentation with dyspnea.                             The relationship between ST2 and death in
15 dyspneic patients was independent of diagnosis, and superseded all other biomarker
   predictors of mortality in this setting, including other markers of inflammation,
   myonecrosis, renal dysfunction, and most notably NT-proBNP, a marker recently
   described as having value for predicting death in this population (Januzzi et al., Arch.
   Intern. Med. 166(3):315-20 (2006)). Indeed, most of the mortality in the study was
20 concentrated among subjects with elevated ST2 levels at presentation; however, the
   combination of an elevated ST2 and NT-proBNP was associated with the highest rates of
   death within one year.
                     Such a multi-marker approach for risk stratification has been generally proposed
   for patients with acute coronary syndromes (Sabatine et al., Circulation105(15):1760-3
25 (2002)), but no such strategy has yet been proposed for the evaluation for the patient with
   non- specific symptoms such as undifferentiated dyspnea or general complaint of chest
   pain.
   Determining Severity of Disease
30                   Elevated MACE risk scores are correlated with the presence of severe disease in a
   subject, regardless of the underlying cause of the disease. As one example, in a

   II \aar\lnterwoen\NRPortbl\DCC\AAR\16735280 I docx-3 04 2018
                                                                    - 10
   population of patients presenting with chest pain, the highest scores were associated with
   an increased risk of adverse events, including transplantation, which are generally
   associated with the presence of severe disease.
                     Therefore, for undiagnosed subjects, the methods described herein can be used to
 5 determine how aggressively a diagnosis should be sought; a high ST2 level would
   indicate the presence of severe disease, and suggest that the subject should be treated as a
   high-risk case. For subjects with a known diagnosis, the methods described herein can be
   used to help determine the severity of the underlying pathology; again, a higher ST2 level
   is associated with more severe disease.
10
   General Methodology - Determining a Subject' s MACE Risk Score
                     In general, the methods described herein include evaluating circulating levels
   (e.g., levels in blood, serum, plasma, urine, or body tissue) of ST2 and NT-proBNP in
   a subject, e.g., a mammal, e.g., a human. These levels provide information regarding
15 the subject' s lilelihood of experiencing an adverse outcome, e.g., mortality, e.g.,
   within a specific time period, e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 6 months, one year, two
   years, three years, or five years. These levels also provide information regarding the
   severity of disease in the subject. In some embodiments, a level of ST2 is determined
   a first time (TO), e.g., at presentation, e.g., at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and/or 24 hours, and/or
20  1-3 or 1-7 days, after the onset of symptoms. Then levels of ST2 and NT-proBNP are
   determined a second time (T1); the second time point can be, e.g., at least 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
    12, 18, or 24 hours, 1-7 days, 1-14 days, or 2-14 days, e.g., up to 14 days, after the
   first time point. These levels are used to determine a MACE risk score, using the
   following formula:
25                                            X   =    (ST2 T1/ST2 TO) + aln(NTproBNP TI)
   The coefficient alpha is a weighting factor for the variable it acts on.                 In some
   embodiments, the coefficient alpha is between 0.25 and 0.5, e.g., about 3, e.g., 0.33.
   Evaluating circulating levels of ST2 and NTpro-BNP in a subject typically includes
   obtaining a biological sample, e.g., serum, plasma or blood, from the subject. Levels of
30  ST2 and NTpro-BNP in the sample can be determined by measuring levels of
   polypeptide in the sample, using methods known in the art and/or described herein, e.g.,

   II \aar\lnterwoen\NRPortbl\DCC\AAR\16735280 I docx-3 04 2018
                                                                - 11
   immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). For example, in
   some embodiments a monoclonal antibody is contacted with the sample; binding of the
   antibody is then detected and optionally quantified, and levels of the protein are
   determined based on levels of antibody binding. Alternatively, levels of ST2 and NTpro
 5 BNP mRNA can be measured, again using methods known in the art and/or described
   herein, e.g., by quantitative PCR or Northern blotting analysis.
                     In some embodiments, the MACE risk score is calculated using a computing
   device, e.g., a personal computer.
                     Once a MACE risk score has been determined, the MACE risk score can be
10 compared to a reference score. In some embodiments, the reference score will represent
   a threshold level, above which the subject has an increased risk of death, and/or has a
   severe disease. The reference score chosen may depend on the methodology used to
   measure the levels of ST2. For example, in some embodiments, where circulating levels
   of soluble ST2 are determined using an immunoassay, e.g., as described herein, the
15 reference score is about 3, e.g., 3.2 or 3.5, and a score above that reference level indicates
   that the subject has an increased risk of death, and/or has a severe disease.
                     Where more than one MACE risk score has been determined as described herein,
   a change in the score indicates whether the subject has an increased or decreased risk of
   death. A score that increases means that the subject has an increasing risk of imminent
20 death, e.g., an increasingly poor prognosis, and that a treatment is not working or should
   be changed or initiated. Scores that decrease over time indicate that the subject has a
   decreasing risk of imminent death, e.g., an increasingly positive prognosis, and can be
   indicative of the efficacy of a treatment, for example, and the treatment should be
   continued, or, if the score becomes low enough, possibly discontinued. As one example,
25 increasing scores may indicate a need for more aggressive treatment or hospitalization
   (e.g., initial admission or hospitalization in a more acute setting, e.g., in an intensive care
   unit, or the use of telemetry or other methods for monitoring the subject' s cardiac status),
   while decreasing scores may indicate the possibility of less aggressive treatment, a short
   hospitalization, or discharge. This information allows a treating physician to make more
30 accurate treatment decisions; for example, the subject may be admitted to the hospital as
   an inpatient, e.g., in an acute or critical care department.

                     Additional testing can be performed, e.g., to determine the subject' s actual
   condition.                  More aggressive treatment may be administered either before or after
   additional testing. For example, in the case of a suspected myocardial infarction (MI),
   the subject may be sent for more extensive imaging studies and/or cardiac catheterization.
 5                   In some embodiments, the methods include the use of additional diagnostic
   methods to identify underlying pathology. Any diagnostic methods known in the art can
   be used, and one of skill in the art will be able to select diagnostic methods that are
   appropriate for the subject' s symptoms. In some enbodiments, the methods described
   herein include other diagnostic methods in addition to or as an alternative to the
10 measurement of other biomarkers, e.g., physical measurements of lung function or
   cardiac function as are known in the art.
                     For example, the methods described herein include determining a MACE risk
   score along with measuring one or more additional biomarkers that aid in the subject' s
   diagnosis. As one example, for a subject who has chest pain or dyspnea, biomarkers
15 indicative of cardiac disease can be measured, e.g., cardiac troponin (cTn), e.g., cTnI,
   BNP, and/or ANP; alternatively or in addition, biomarkers of pulmonary disease can be
   measured, e.g., D-dimers for pulmonary embolism. Thus, in subjects presenting with
   symptoms that include MI in their differential diagnoses, the methods can include
   measuring levels of, e.g., cTnI, BNP, or proBNP in addition to determining a MACE risk
20 score, to determine whether the subject is having an MI. In subjects presenting with
   symptoms that include heart failure (HF) in their differential diagnoses, the methods can
   include measuring levels of BNP or proBNP in addition to determining a MACE risk
   score, to determine whether the subject is having HF. In subjects presenting with
   symptoms that include COPD in their differential diagnoses, the methods can include
25 measuring lung function in addition to determining a MACE risk score, to determine
   whether the subject has COPD. One of skill in the art will appreciate that there are a
   number of additional diagnostic methods that can be applied, depending on the situation
   and the subject' s condition. In some embodimentsqhe methods include measuring levels
   of BUN, and the presence of elevated BUN and elevated determining a MACE risk score
30 places the subject in the highest risk category.

    ST2
                     The ST2 gene is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, whose protein
   product exists both as a trans-membrane form, as well as a soluble receptor that is
   detectable in serum (Kieser et al., FEBS Lett. 372(2-3):189-93 (1995); Kumar et al., J.
 5 Biol. Chem. 270(46):27905-13 (1995); Yanagisawa et al., FEBS Lett. 302(1):51-3
   (1992); Kuroiwa et al., Hybridoma 19(2):151-9 (2000)). ST2 was recently described to
   be markedly up-regulated in an experimental model of heart failure (Weinberg et al.,
   Circulation                  106(23):2961-6                  (2002)), and preliminary results suggest that ST2
   concentrations may be elevated in those with chronic severe HF (Weinberg et al.,
10 Circulation 107(5):721-6 (2003)) as well as in those with acute myocardial infarction
   (MI) (Shimpo et al., Circulation 109(18):2186-90 (2004)).
                     The trans-membrane form of ST2 is thought to play a role in modulating
   responses of T helper type 2 cells (Lohning et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.
   95(12):6930-5 (1998); Schmitz et al., Immunity 23(5):479-90 (2005)), and may play a
15 role in development of tolerance in states of severe or chronic inflammation (Brint et al.,
   Nat. Immunol. 5(4):373-9 (2004)), while the soluble form of ST2 is up-regulated in
   growth stimulated fibroblasts (Yanagisawa et al., 1992, supra).                               Experimental data
   suggest that the ST2 gene is markedly up-regulated in states of myocyte stretch
   (Weinberg et al., 2002, supra) in a manner analogous to the induction of the BNP gene
20 (Bruneau et al., Cardiovasc. Res. 28(10):1519-25 (1994)).
                     Tominaga, FEBS Lett. 258:301-304 (1989), isolated murine genes that were
   specifically expressed by growth stimulation in BALB/c-3T3 cells; they termed one of
   these genes St2 (for Growth Stimulation-Expressed Gene 2). The St2 gene encodes two
   protein products: ST2, which is a soluble secreted form; and ST2L, a transmembrane
25 receptor form that is very similar to the interleukin-1 receptors.                                  The HUGO
   Nomenclature Committee designated the human homolog, the cloning of which was
   described in Tominaga et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1171:215-218 (1992), as
   Interleukin 1 Receptor-Like 1 (ILIRL1). The two terms are used interchangeably herein.
                     The mRNA sequence of the shorter, soluble isoform of human ST2 can be found
30 at GenBank Acc. No. NM_003856.2, and the polypeptide sequence is at GenBank Acc.

   9173, MIM ID # 601203, and UniGene No. Hs.66. In general, in the methods described
   herein, the soluble form of ST2 polypeptide is measured.
 5                   Methods for detecting and measuring ST2 are known in the art, e.g., as described
   in U.S. Pat. Pub. Nos. 2003/0124624, 2004/0048286 and 2005/0130136, the entire
   contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.                                 Kits for measuring ST2
   polypeptide are also commercially available, e.g., the ST2 ELISA Kit manufactured by
   Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (MBL International Corp., Woburn, MA),
10 no. 7638. In addition, devices for measuring ST2 and other biomarkers are described in
   U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0250156.
   Natriuretic Peptides
                     Natriuretic peptides are a family of vasoactive peptide hormones that act as
15 balanced arterial and venous vasodilators, regulating natriuresis and diuresis. Circulating
   levels of these hormones are under investigation for use in enhancing diagnostic and
   prognostic assessment of patients with cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that circulating levels of NT-proBNP are increased in patients with acute
   MI and predict mortality (Talwar et al., Eur. Heart J. 21:1514-1521 (2000); Omland et
20 al., Am. J. Cardiol. 76:230-235 (1995) Sabatine et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 44:1988
    1995 (2004), demonstrated a link between the severity of an acute ischemic insult and the
   circulating levels of BNP. Methods for measuring NT-proBNP are known in the art, see,
   e.g., Talwar et al., 2000, supra; Omland et al., 1995, supra; Sabatine et al., 2004, supra;
   Alehagen and Dahlstr6m, "Can NT-proBNP predict risk of cardiovascular mortality
25 within 10 years? Results from an epidemiological study of elderly patients with
   symptoms of heart failure," Int J Cardiol. 2008 Apr 11 [Epub ahead of print]; and Kavsak
   et al., Clin Chem. 54(4):747-51 (2008).
                     It is believed that, while the examples presented herein relate to NT-proBNP, any
   of the NPs can be used in the methods described herein. In some embodiments, more
30 that one NP can be measured.

   Other Biomarkers
                     The methods described herein can also include measuring levels of other
   biomarkers in addition to ST2 and an NP. Suitable biomarkers include troponin, CRP, IL
   6, D-dimers, BUN, liver function enzymes, albumin, measures of renal function, e.g.,
 5 creatinine, creatinine clearance rate, or glomerular filtration rate, and/or bacterial
   endotoxin. Methods for measuring these biomarkers are known in the art, see, e.g., U.S.
   Pat. Pub. Nos. 2004/0048286 and 2005/0130136 to Lee et al.; Dhalla et al., Mol. Cell.

   which are incorporated herein by reference. Liver function enzymes include alanine
   transaminase (ALT); aspartate transaminase (AST); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and
   total bilirubin (TBIL).
                     In these embodiments, a MACE risk score and levels of one or more additional
15 biomarkers are determined, and the information from the score and a comparison of the
   biomarkers with their respective reference levels provides additional information
   regarding the subject' s risk of death and/or the pesence of a severe disease in the subject,
   which may provide more accurate and specific information regarding the subject' s risk.
   The levels can then be compared to a reference ratio that represents a threshold ratio
20 above which the subject has an increased risk of death, and/or has a severe disease.
    Selecting a Treatment - Aggressive vs. Conservative
             Once it has been determined that a subject has a MACE risk score above a
   predetermined reference score, the information can be used in a variety of ways. For
25 example, if the subject has an elevated score, e.g., as compared to a reference level, a
   decision to treat aggressively can be made, and the subject can be, e.g., admitted to a
   hospital for treatment as an inpatient, e.g., in an acute or critical care department.
   Portable test kits could allow emergency medical personnel to evaluate a subject in the
   field, to determine whether they should be transported to the ED. Triage decisions, e.g.,
30 in an ED or other clinical setting, can also be made based on information provided by a

   method described herein. Those patients with high scores can be prioritized over those
   with lower scores.
             The methods described herein also provide information regarding whether a subject is
   improving, e.g., responding to a treatment, e.g., whether a hospitalized subject has
 5 improved sufficiently to be discharged and followed on an outpatient basis. In general,
   these methods will include d determining a MACE risk score for the subject multiple
   times. A decrease in MACE risk score over time indicates that the subject is likely to be
   improving. The most recent MACE risk score can also be compared to a reference score,
   as described herein, to determine whether the subject has improved sufficiently to be
10 discharged.
             The subject may also be considered for inclusion in a clinical trial, e.g., of a treatment
   that carries a relatively high risk. The subject can be treated with a regimen that carries a
   relatively higher risk than would be considered appropriate for someone who had a lower
   risk of imminent MACE, e.g., a MACE within 30 days or within 1 year of presentation.
15 Beyond the clinical setting, information regarding a subject' s MACE risk score can be
   used in other ways, e.g., for payment decisions by third party payors, or for setting
   medical or life insurance premiums by insurance providers. For example, a high MACE
   risk score, e.g., a score above a predetermined threshold score, may be used to decide to
   increase insurance premiums for the subject.
20
   Patient Populations
             The methods described herein are useful in a wide variety of clinical contexts. For
   example, the methods can be used for general population screening, including screening
   by doctors, e.g., in hospitals and outpatient clinics, as well as the ED. As one example, a
25 MACE risk score can be determined at any time, and if the MACE risk score is elevated,
   the physician can act appropriately.
             Although the methods described herein can be used for any subject, at any time, they
   are particularly useful for those subjects for whom a diagnosis, or the severity of a
   condition, is difficult to determine. For example, such subjects may present with non
30 specific symptoms, e.g., symptoms that do not indicate a specific diagnosis. Non-specific
   symptoms include, but are not limited to, chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath,

                                                                  -17
   nausea, vomiting, eructation, sweating, palpitations, lightheadedness, fatigue, and
   fainting. Each symptom can have varied etiology.
    Chest Pain
             Chest pain is the chief complaint in about 1 to 2 percent of outpatient visits, and
 5 although the cause is often noncardiac, heart disease remains the leading cause of death
   in the United States. Therefore, distinguishing between serious and benign causes of
   chest pain is crucial.                             The methods described herein are useful in making this
   determination.
             A subject presenting to the ED with chest pain may have esophageal pain, an ulcer,
10 acute lung problems such as pulmonary embolus (PE) (potentially fatal), rupturing or
   dissecting aneurysm (highly lethal), gall bladder attack, pericarditis (inflammation of the
   sack around the heart), angina pectoris (cardiac pain without damage), or an MI
   (potentially fatal). A precise diagnosis may be difficult to make immediately, but the
   decision whether to admit the subject or to treat them conservatively should generally be
15 made immediately. If the methods described herein indicate that the subject has an
   increased risk of an adverse clinical outcome, e.g., imminent MACE or severe disease,
   then the decision can be made to treat the subject aggressively, to potentially prevent the
   adverse outcome.
                     Additional information about treatment and diagnosis of chest pain may be found,
20 e.g., in Cayley, Am. Fam. Phys. 72(10):2012-2028 (2005).
   Dyspnea
             Dyspnea, or shortness of breath (also defined as abnormal or uncomfortable
   breathing), is a common symptom of subjects on presentation to the ED. The differential
   diagnosis for dyspnea includes four general categories: (1) cardiac, (2) pulmonary, (3)
25 mixed cardiac or pulmonary, and (4) noncardiac or nonpulmonary.
             Cardiac causes of dyspnea include right, left, or biventricular congestive heart failure
   with resultant systolic dysfunction, coronary artery disease, recent or remote myocardial
   infarction, cardiomyopathy, valvular dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy with
   resultant diastolic dysfunction, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, pericarditis, and
30 arrhythmias.

             Pulmonary causes include obstructive (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) and asthma) and restrictive processes (e.g., extrapulmonary causes such as
   obesity, spine or chest wall deformities, and intrinsic pulmonary pathology such as
   interstitial fibrosis, pneumoconiosis, granulomatous disease or collagen vascular disease).
 5           Mixed cardiac and pulmonary disorders include COPD with pulmonary hypertension
   and cor pulmonale, deconditioning, pulmonary emboli, and trauma.
             Noncardiac or nonpulmonary disorders include metabolic conditions such as anemia,
   diabetic ketoacidosis and other, less common causes of metabolic acidosis, pain in the
   chest wall or elsewhere in the body, and neuromuscular disorders such as multiple
10 sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. Obstructive rhinolaryngeal problems include nasal
   obstruction due to polyps or septal deviation, enlarged tonsils, and supraglottic or
   subglottic airway stricture.
             Dyspnea can also present as a somatic manifestation of psychiatric disorders, e.g., an
   anxiety disorder, with resultant hyperventilation.
15           Additional information regarding the evaluation and treatment of dyspnea can be
   found, e.g., in Morgan and Hodge, Am. Fam. Phys. 57(4):711-718 (1998).
   Special Populations
             Certain populations of subjects may benefit particularly from the methods described
   herein. These subjects include people for whom BNP orNT-proBNP alone is less useful,
20 such as in those with impaired renal function (Anwaruddin et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol.
   47(1):91-7 (2006); McCullough et al., Am. J. Kidney Dis. 41(3):571-9 (2003)), or in
   those who are overweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25-29) or obese (BMI > 30)
   (Krauser et al., Am. Heart J. 149(4):744-50 (2005); McCord et al., Arch. Intern. Med.
    164(20):2247-52 (2004)). It is known and accepted in the field that patients with a high
25 BMI usually have levels of natriuretic peptide that are lower than expected relative to a
   normal body mass patient for the same level of disease; the exact mechanism for this
   phenomenon is not known. It has been shown that circulating levels of ST2 are not
   influenced by BMI, therefore, the determination of a MACE risk score is more useful
   than natriuretic peptide levels alone in subjects with high BMI. Thus, the methods
30 described herein can include determining a subject' s BMI, and if the subject is

                                in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (HF)
                                  Measurement of either ST2 or NT-proBNP at presentation or at time
   points during treatment or follow-up have been individually shown to be valuable for
10 prognosis. It has also been determined that the strongest measurement for prognosis is
   the change in ST2 between two time points. In this analysis forty-eight (48) patients with
   established symptomatic HF attending two HF clinics with signs and symptoms of
   worsening HF were evaluated. Baseline (TO) and week 2 (TI) measurements of sST2
   and amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations were
15 obtained. Adverse cardiac events (death, admission for HF, and heart transplant) were
   reported in 56% of patients during the 1 year follow-up period. The area under the ROC
   curve (AUC) values shown in Table 1 calculated for a series of measurements made in
   this data set illustrate this point when using all cardiac events as the outcome.

                     Using the ST2 ratio in a simple binary stratification approach we get the results
   shown in Table 2, in this case using the ROC optimal threshold value of 0.75.

                     As can be seen in this Table the ROC optimal threshold is lower than either the
   median or the mean. However if a higher threshold, such as the median value is used, the
10 relative risk decreases to 1.9 so for the purpose of this analysis the threshold of 0.75,
   which provides the highest prognostic accuracy, will be used.
                     In other studies (Januzzi et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 50:607-613 (2007); Mueller
   et al., Clin. Chim. 54(4):752-756 (2008)) it has also been observed that there is a
   synergistic relationship between ST2 and NT-proBNP when used for risk stratification or
15 prognosis. In an effort to both confirm that relationship in this cohort and to identify the
   most powerful method for using ST2 and NT-proBNP together various mathematical
   combinations were considered. Table 3 represents the best results obtained in a simple
   binary analysis where the change in ST2 represented as a ratio is combined with the NT
   proBNP value at the second time point. The threshold of 0.75 for the ST2 ratio value was
20 determined by ROC analysis, and verified subjectively, to be optimal and an NT-proBNP
   value of 1000 pg/ml is generally considered ideal for prognosis within a 1 year followup
   period.

                     Although effective at identifying both the highest risk and lowest risk patients, the
   weakness in this approach is that there is a very small number of patients in the lowest
   risk group and a large percentage of patients in the indeterminate range.
                     To better define the functional utility of the ST2 ratio combined with an NT
10 proBNP value a formula was developed:
                                              X   =    (ST2 T1/ST2 TO) + aln(NTproBNP TI)
                     This formula was developed by evaluating the result as a function of ROC AUC
15 for a range of coefficients associated with the NT-proBNP term. The result from this
   series of calculations is shown in Figure 1.
                     The maximum AUC value was achieved at a coefficient for a of 0.33 resulting in
   the final equation being:
                                           X    =  (ST2 T1/ST2 TO) + 0.331n(NTproBNP TI)
20
                     Using this algorithm in a series of calculations comparing the sensitivity,
   specificity and relative risk (right side axis) we get the plot in Figure 2.
                     In this plot the score value resulting in the maximum relative risk value is 3.2.
   ROC analysis of this data confirms that the optimal threshold value is 3.3, illustrated in

                                                                         -23
   Figure 3. Also note that the AUC value using this score is 0.80 as compared to 0.77 for
   the ST2 ratio and 0.72 for the NT-proBNP ratio, which generated the next highest AUC
   values.
                     When this score is used, at the threshold value of 3.2, to stratify patients in this
 5 cohort who are at risk of events; admission, transplant or mortality, a clear distinction
   between low risk and high risk patients is achieved. These results are illustrated in Table
   4.

                     Directly comparing these results with the results using the ST2 ratio alone, shown
   in Table 2, illustrates that by combining the ST2 ratio with an NT-proBNP value all of
   the relevant parameters representing assessment of risk prediction are stronger; PPV,
15 NPV and RR.
                     For comparison the stratification results for the next strongest value, the NT
   proBNP ratio is summarized in Table 5. The values using the NT-proBNP ratio are much
   lower than when the ST2 ratio is used or from the formula combining ST2 with NT
   proBNP.

                    In this analysis, the only variable that had an AUC greater than 0.7 is the ST2
   ratio. For the outcome of death or transplant a threshold value of 0.85 for the ST2 ratio
   was determined by ROC analysis to be optimal, as shown in Table 9.

                     Although each biomarker had similar predictive strength, of the five patients
   identified below the threshold, only one was predicted by both biomarkers.
                     Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis also showed that, when considered
   individually in this population, the ST2 ratio and the NT-proBNP ratio were functionally
 5 indistinguishable in regards to outcome prediction, although the curve for the NT
   proBNP ratio diverges early and remains divergent, whereas the curve for the ST2 ratio
   diverges much later. For the ST2 ratio the HR is 2.66 (p=0.0506), while for the NT
   proBNP ratio the HR is 2.60 (P=0.0201).
                     The results obtained by Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis are slightly
10 different. When analyzed individually the HR values were 1.94 for the ST2 ratio and
   0.55 for the NT-proBNP ratio, and were almost the same when analyzed together at 2.03
   for the ST2 ratio and 0.53 for the NT-proBNP ratio. The p value was not significant for
   either variable, at 0.176 and 0.168 respectively.
                     However, as was observed when events were evaluated as the outcome parameter,
15 if the ST2 ratio was combined with the second NT-proBNP value the results of ROC
   analysis illustrate greater predictive accuracy using this formula, as shown in Figure 9.
   Although ROC analysis identified 3.5 as the optimal threshold, additional analysis
   confirms that the previously identified threshold of 3.2 provides better prognostic
   accuracy.                   The HR from Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Figure 10) was 6.02
20 (p=0.0060). The HR calculated from the Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis
   was very similar at 6.08 (p=0.016).
                     Table 11 provides a summary of relative risk calculations comparing the values
   previously determined for the ST2 and NT-proBNP ratios as well as the MACE risk
   score.

   the median values do not overlap with the 25-75% boundary. This same comparison for
   the ST2 ratio and the NT-proBNP ratio is shown in Figures 12 and 13. The p values for
   these plots are 0.0 17 and 0.046 respectively and the distinction between the event and no
10 event group is not as definitive as it is for the MACE risk score.
   Conclusion
                      As derived from this data set, the described formula combining the ratio of ST2
   values between two time points and an NT-proBNP value measured at the second time
15 point provides the strongest and most accurate measure of risk that a patient will
   experience an adverse cardiac event defined as admission, transplant or death.

                             combining ST2 with NT-proBNP for MACE risk prediction
                     In the study described in this example, 150 patients hospitalized with acutely
 5 destabilized HF were followed at the Veteran Affairs Healthcare System in San Diego,
   California. Multiple cardiac-related parameters were measured, including ST2, BNP,
   NT-proBNP, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Plasma samples were collected at six time
   points between admission and discharge. Biomarker concentrations were correlated to
   survival at 90 days. These 150 patients were sorted further by the following criteria to
10 optimize coordination between the various measurements that were made and the times
   that these measurements were made:
              1. ST2 value on day 1
             2.      ST2 value on day 3 or later for a minimum elapsed time of 2 days
             3.      NT-proBNP value on the same last day as the last ST2 value
15           4. Alive at discharge
                     This sort resulted in a total remaining N of 107 patients, with 35 events,
   readmission or death, within 90 days and 13 of those events were deaths within 90 days.
   The following analysis compares the various individual measurements for accuracy in
20 predicting mortality within 90 days and validates the formula combining ST2 with NT
   proBNP.
                     If the biomarkers are reported by day and as a function of whether the patient
   survived or died there is a clear distinction over time. In patients who did not survive the
   values for ST2, as well as BNP and NT-proBNP increased, whereas in those patients who
25 did survive these values decreased and remained low. In Figures 14-16, the median is
   plotted with error bars representing the 25 th-75th percentile.
                     In this analysis, by day four (three elapsed days), all three biomarkers achieved
   maximum separation in median values between survivors and decedents, but only ST2
   and NT-proBNP were also able to achieve and maintain significant resolution not only
30 between the median values but also between the 25 th-75th percentile values.

                     ROC analysis, summarized in Table 13, affirmed this observation with maximum
   AUC values for each biomarker at either the individual day 4 measurement or of the
   change, reported as a ratio, between baseline and day 4. However, the functional strength
   of using the measurements from day 4 was limited in this instance because from this
 5 cohort of 107 patients there were only 60 values reported for day 4. To maximize the
   number of patients that were included in the analysis, a value for last (L) was obtained by
   taking the last value available for each patient from day 3 or later. It is noted that the
   AUC values for the last value were not significantly different than the values for the day
   4 value from each biomarker, nor were the AUC values for the ratio of the 4:1
10 measurements or the L:F measurements. Consequently, for the remainder of this analysis
   the values used were the first (1), last (L) and the last to first (L:F) ratio.

10 Conclusion
   A                 s was determined using the peptide cohort data (Example 1)the MACE risk score
   formula described herein provides the greatest prognostic accuracy, specifically when the
   outcome parameter is mortality, as determined by ROC, hazard ratio and relative risk
   calculation. There is a small but likely significant difference between the threshold
15 values in these two cohorts. The peptide cohort described in Example 1 is an outpatient
   group with an ST2 ratio threshold of 0.75 and a MACE risk score formula threshold of
   3.2, whereas the VET cohort described in this Example 2 is an inpatient group, and the
   respective threshold values are 0.85 and 3.5. This difference in threshold values may be
   due to the difference in disease severity between inpatient and outpatient conditions or

   may be due to the difference in time between measurements, as there was a 2 week time
   frame between measurements in the outpatient cohort as compared to a 3-5 day time
   frame in the inpatient cohort.                               Shimpo et al., Circulation 109(18):2186-90 (2004),
   reported that ST2 values increase rapidly for the first 12 hours following a myocardial
 5 infarction. The results described in these two examples clearly illustrate that there is also
   a dynamic change in ST2 levels in patients with heart failure but the absolute kinetic
   parameters are yet to be determined.

a subject within one year, the method comprising:
                  determining a MACE risk score (MACERS) for a subject based upon, at least
in part, the ratio of a second level of Growth Stimulation-Expressed Gene 2 (ST2) in
the subject at a second time (ST2 TO) to a first level of ST2 in the subject at a first
time (ST2 TI), in combination with a weighted logarithm of a level of a natriuretic
peptide (NP) in the subject at the second time (NP T1), and
                  comparing the MACERS to a reference MACERS;
wherein the MACERS in comparison with the reference MACERS is indicative of the
subject' s risk ofa MACE within one year.
2.                The method of Claim 1, further comprising:
                  obtaining a first level of ST2 in the subject at a first time point, to determine
 ST2 TO;
                  obtaining a second level of ST2 in the subject at a second time point, to
determine ST2 TI; and
                  obtaining a level of an natriuretic peptide (NP) in the subject at the second
time point, to determine NP TI.
3.                The method of Claim 1, wherein the logarithm of NP TI includes a natural
logarithm.
4.                The method of Claim 1, wherein the MACERS is determined using the
following formula:
                                               MACERS        = (ST2 Ti/ST2 TO) + aln(NP TI),
wherein the coefficient alpha is a weighting factor for the variable it acts on.
5.                The method of Claim 4, wherein the coefficient alpha is about 0.33.
