                    ANTI-TUMOUR COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS
        Field of the Invention
       The present invention provides compositions for use in the treatment of
 5     tumours and cancers. Also provided are methods for the treatment,
       suppression and amelioration of tumours and for the improved treatment
       of cancers using the compositions of the invention.
        Background to the Invention
10      Each year 10.9 million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer and
       there are 6.7 million cancer deaths. There is clearly an urgent need for
        improved therapeutic cancer strategies. Current methods of treatment
        include the use of anti-tumour agents to prevent and/or reduce tumour
       growth.
15
       There are a number of possible mechanisms of action by which anti
       tumour agents may act. These include, but are not limited to, inhibition of
       angiogenesis, inhibition of DNA synthesis, regulation of DNA/RNA
       transcription, inhibition of enzymes, gene regulation, inhibition of
20     microtubule assembly, intercalation of DNA, induction of apoptosis and
        induction of cross-linking of DNA. Some anti-tumour agents involve more
       than one mechanism of action. For example, in certain cases the
        induction of cross-linking of DNA may result in apoptosis. Monoclonal
       antibodies may be used to specifically target cancer cells for destruction
25     by recognising and binding to receptors found on cancer cells.
        In some cases, the use of anti-tumour agents is limited due to the toxicity
       of the anti-tumour agents. This toxicity may be linked to the dose of the
       anti-tumour agent administered. Accordingly, it would be beneficial if the

   WO 2009/153319                                                   PCT/EP2009/057617
       dose of the anti-tumour agent could be reduced without a corresponding
       loss in effectiveness of the treatment.
       Cisplatin (also known as cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II)
 5     (CDDP)) is one example of a commonly used anti-tumour agent. Cisplatin
        is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug. Platinum complexes are formed
        in cells that bind and cause cross-linking of DNA leading to apoptosis.
       Cisplatin may be used to treat various types of cancers, including
       sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian
10     cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumours. Other members of the same
       class include carboplatin and oxaliplatin. Cisplatin has a number of known
       side effects which can limit its use in the treatment of cancer. The main
       side effects include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting,
       ototoxicity, alopecia and electrolyte disturbance.
15
        In certain cases, Cetuximab (marketed under the name Erbitux) may be
       administered to cancer patients who can no longer be treated with
       cisplatin due to side effects, primarily nephrotoxicity. Cetuximab is a
       chimeric monoclonal antibody which is believed to bind the extracellular
20     domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thus preventing
       the binding of ligands to the EGFR. This blocks activation of the EGFR,
       which in turn blocks downstream signalling and results in impaired cell
       growth and proliferation. Cetuximab is also thought to mediate antibody
       dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Cetuximab may be administered
25     by intravenous injection for treatment of metastatic colectoral cancer and
       head and neck cancer. Possible side effects include allergic reactions,
       skin changes, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and
       conjunctivitis.

        Despite the wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents used for the
       treatment and suppression of tumours, a need remains for improved anti
       tumour compositions preferably having reduced side effects.
 5     Summary of the Invention
       The inventor of the present invention has determined that when oltipraz
       (5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1 ,2-3-th ione) is administered with other known
       anti-tumour agents, such as platinum-based chemotherapy drugs,
        including cisplatin, or monoclonal antibodies, including Cetuximab,
10      improved therapeutic effects are observed with an increased reduction in
       tumour growth. This determination may advantageously be used to
       provide improved compositions and methods for the treatment of tumours
       and cancer. Further, this determination may be used to reduce the
       required treatment dose of an anti-tumour agent, such as cisplatin or
15     Cetuximab, as, when an anti-tumour agent is administered in combination
       with oltipraz, the same therapeutic effect may be obtained using a lower
       dose as compared to the therapeutic effect obtained when the anti-tumour
       agent is administered alone at a higher dose. This may reduce the side
       effects, such as nephrotoxicity, which often occur with anti-tumour
20     treatments.

        Pharm. ScL, Vol. 66, pp. 1-19.
       The term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a
 5     complex of solute (e.g., active compound or salt of active compound) and
       solvent. If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred
       to as a hydrate, for example, a hemihydrate, monohydrate, dihydrate,
       trihydrate, tetrahydrate and the like.
10     The term "prodrug" is used herein to refer to a compound which can
       convert to the biologically active compound by metabolism or hydrolysis.
       A prodrug can be made using pharmacological techniques known to those
       skilled in the art.
15     Metabolites may result from the metabolism, for example by molecular
       rearrangement, or hydrolysis of oltipraz following administration to a
       subject.
       The present invention is further intended to encompass the use of
20     derivatives and analogues of oltipraz. In this context, derivatives or
       homologues are molecules having substantial structural similarities to
       oltipraz and analogues are molecules having substantial biological
       similarities regardless of structural similarities. Preferably the analogue or
       derivative will retain the appropriate functional activity of oltipraz, though
25     not necessarily to the same degree as oltipraz.
       As used herein, the term "subject" or "patient" refers to an animal,

       As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means the
       amount of a composition which is sufficient to show benefit to the subject.
        In particular, the benefit may be the treatment, partial treatment or
       amelioration of at least one symptom associated with cancer and/or a
 5     tumour. In the case of prophylaxis, the benefit may be to prevent or
       suppress the initial onset, progression or recurrence of cancer and/or a
       tumour, or at least one symptom thereof. The benefit includes a reduction
        in the rate of tumour formation and/or in the size of a tumour, in particular
       a malignant tumour. The benefit further includes a reduction in the side
10     effects and/or toxicity associated with treatment with an anti-tumour agent.
       The terms "side effect" and "toxicity" as used herein refer to unwanted
       effects of the treatment of a subject with an anti-tumour agent. The effects
       are caused by the treatment of the subject with the anti-tumour agent, but
15     are not beneficial to the subject.
       The term "reducing" or "reduction" as used herein to refer to the reduction
       of side effects and/or toxicity of an anti-tumour agent observed when the
       agent is combined with oltipraz is intended to encompass both prevention
20     and lessening of the side effects. It includes lessening of the severity of
       the side effects and the progression and onset of the side effects. It also
        includes a reduction in the number of side effects.

20      In certain embodiments, the composition of the invention is co
       administered along with, or formulated with, carboxymethyl cellulose
       (CMC).      In certain embodiments, 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3-thione, or
       the analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug, solvate or pharmaceutically
       acceptable salt thereof, is formulated in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC).

       The inventor has surprisingly identified that administering 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4
       methyl-1,2-3-thione along with carboxymethyl cellulose results in a marked
       reduction in toxicity associated with 5-[2-pyrazinyl] -4-methyl-1,2-3-th ione
       administration. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is a cellulose derivative

   WO 2009/153319                                                        PCT/EP2009/057617
       with carboxymethyl groups bound to some of the hydroxyl groups of the
       glucopyranose monomers that make up the cellulose backbone.
       Specifically, the inventor has identified that when formulated with CMC, 5
 5      [2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3-thione can be administered to a subject in an
       amount of up to 2000 mg/kg without significant toxicity resulting. Without
       wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesised that when formulated
       with carboxymethyl cellulose, 5-[2-pyrazinyl] -4-methyl-1 ,2-3-th ione is not
       absorbed into the bloodstream but becomes associated with the outer wall
10     of the digestive tract, this resulting in an effective lining of the digestive
       tract, which serves to protect against damage, such as gastrointestinal
       damage.
        In certain embodiments, the 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3-thione
15     compound is administered with, or formulated with, a sulphur-containing
       amino acid such as cysteine or an analogue, derivative, salt or solvate
       thereof.
       Oral administration of 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3-thione with cysteine
20     has been shown to result in a marked increase in both the extent and rate
       of 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3-thione bioavailability (Hassan M. Ali et al.,
        1984; Chemotherapy 30: 255-261).
        In certain embodiments of the invention, the anti-tumour agent is a
25     platinium-based agent. In other embodiments, the anti-tumour agent is a
       monoclonal antibody. Typically, the monoclonal antibody has binding
       specificity to epidermal growth factor receptors or EGFRs. In certain
       embodiments, the anti-tumour agent mediates antibody-dependent cellular
       cytotoxicity (ADCC). In certain embodiments, the anti-tumour agent is
30     cisplatin. In other embodiments, the anti-tumour agent is Cetuximab.

        In certain embodiments, the anti-tumour agent is selected from the group
       comprising, but not limited to, angiogenesis inhibitors, DNA synthesis
        inhibitors, DNA/RNA transcription inhibitors, enzyme inhibitors, gene
 5     regulators, microtubule assembly inhibitors, DNA intercalators, apoptosis
        inducers and DNA cross-linkers.
        In still other embodiments, the anti-tumour agent is selected from the
       group comprising, but not limited to, dexamethasone; mitotic inhibitors,
10     such as vinblastine; alkylating agents, such as carboplatin and
       cyclophosphamide; inhibitors of microtubule assembly, such as paclitaxel
       or other taxanes; anti-metabolites, such as 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine,
       cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea; intercalating antibiotics, such as,
       adriamycin and bleomycin; immunostimulants, such as trastuzumab; DNA
15     synthesis inhibitors, such as, gemcitabine; enzymes, such as
       asparaginase; topoisomerase inhibitors, such as etoposide; biological
       response modifiers, such as interferon; and anti-hormones, for example,
       antioestrogens, such as tamoxifen, or antiandrogens, such as (4'-cyano-3
       (4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3'-(trifluoromethyl)
20     propionanilide and other therapeutic agents and principles as described in,
       for example, DeVita, V. T., Jr., Hellmann, S., Rosenberg, S. A.; in: Cancer:

25      In certain embodiments, the use of 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1 ,2-3-thione,
       or an analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug, solvate or
       pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, allows a lower dose of the anti
       tumour agent to be used without a corresponding reduction in the
       observed therapeutic effect. In certain embodiments, the use of 5-[2
30     pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1 ,2-3-thione, or an analogue, derivative, metabolite,

       prodrug, solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, reduces or
       limits side effects caused by the anti-tumour agent. Without being bound
       by theory, this reduction may be due to the reduced dosage of the anti
       tumour agent.

        In certain embodiments, the combination of 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3
       thione, or an analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug, solvate or
       pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the anti-tumour agent
       results in a synergistic effect. In certain embodiments, the synergistic
10     effect leads to a reduction in tumour volume which is greater than the
       reduction in tumour volume observed when 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1,2-3
       thione, or an analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug, solvate or
       pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or the anti-tumour agent is
       administered alone at the same dose. In certain embodiments, the
15     synergistic effect leads to a reduction in toxicity and/or side effects of the
       anti-tumour agent wherein the toxicity and/or side effects of the anti
       tumour agent are less than those observed when the anti-tumour agent is
       administered alone at the same dose.

       methyl-1,2-3-thione, or an analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug,
       solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are provided
       sequentially, simultaneously or separately. Said compounds may be in
       the same or different forms, for example a solid and a liquid, and may be
25     administered by the same or different routes. Where the compounds are
       administered sequentially, in certain embodiments, the anti-tumour agent
       may be administered first. In certain further embodiments, the anti-tumour
       agent may be administered following administration of 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4
       methyl-1,2-3-thione, or an analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug,
30     solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-

       analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug, solvate or pharmaceutically
       acceptable salt thereof, and anti-tumour agents used are preferably
       sufficient to provide a synergistic effect. In certain embodiments, tumour
       growth inhibition using 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4-methyl-1 ,2-3-thione, or an
10     analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug, solvate or pharmaceutically
       acceptable salt thereof, in combination with the anti-tumour agent can be
       at least 65%, more preferably at least 69%, more preferably at least 75%,
       yet more preferably at least 80%, yet more preferably 85% and most
       preferably at least 89%.

        In certain embodiments, the side effects and/or toxicity which are reduced
       are selected from one or more of the group comprising nephrotoxicity,
       neurotoxicity, nausea, vomiting, ototoxicity, alopecia, electrolyte
       disturbance, allergic reactions, skin changes, breathlessness, diarrhoea,
20     fever and conjunctivitis, or a combination thereof.
        In certain embodiments, a further anti-tumour agent may also be
       administered or a further cancer treatment also applied, for example,
       radiotherapy.

        In certain embodiments, the anti-tumour agent and 5-[2-pyrazinyl]-4
       methyl-1,2-3-thione, or an analogue, derivative, metabolite, prodrug,
       solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are co-administered.
       Co-administration means that these compounds may be administered
30     together as a single composition or as part of the same unitary dose or are

   WO 2009/153319                                                    PCT/EP2009/057617
       administered separately, but as part of the same therapeutic regimen or
       treatment program. In certain embodiments, the compounds are
       administered to the subject at the same time. Where the compounds are
       administered separately, the co-administration of the components does
 5     not impose a restriction on the timing, frequency, dosage or order of
       administration of the compounds.
       Suitably administration is by parenteral administration. Parenteral
       administration may be intravenous administration or subcutaneous
10     administration. In further embodiments, the route of administration is
       rectal, for example by means of a suppository, transdermal or
       transmucosal.
        In certain embodiments administration may be by topical application
15      including, but not limited to, buccal and sublingual administration. Suitable
       formulations for topical administration include creams, gels, jellies,
       mucliages, pastes and ointments. In certain embodiments, the
       composition may be formulated for transdermal administration, for
       example in the form of transdermal patches. There is no specific limitation
20     to the form of administration of an anti-tumour compound and where two
       anti-tumour compounds are administered each compound may have a
       distinct form of administration.

       Weights and Survival
       All animals were weighed every day and their survival recorded in order to
 5     assess possible differences in animal weight among treatment groups as
       an indication of possible toxicity resulting from the treatments. Any
       animals exhibiting a loss of >20% of starting weight during the course of
       the study were euthanized.
10     Tissue Culture
       A549 human lung cancer cells were obtained from ATCC. These cells
       were grown in F-1 2 supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS),
       penicillin and streptomycin, and 2mM L-Glutamine. Cells were sub
       cultured by removing the medium, rinsing twice with sterile calcium-free

   WO 2009/153319                                                  PCT/EP2009/057617
       and magnesium-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and adding 1 to 2
       ml of 0.25% trypsin and 0.03% EDTA solution. The flask was allowed to
       sit at 37 C until the cells detached. Cells were then sub-cultured at a ratio
       of 1:3.
 5
       Animals
        Female Nude Mice which are homozygous for the nu gene (nu+/nu+)
       (Charles River Labs), aged 5 to 6 weeks at the point of tumour inoculation,
       with a mean pre-treatment body weight of 27.9 grams were used. Animals
10     were individually numbered using an ear punch and housed in groups of
        12 animals per cage. Animals were acclimatized prior to study
       commencement. During this period of at least 2 days, the animals were
       observed daily in order to reject animals that presented in poor condition.
15      Housing
       The study was performed in animal rooms provided with filtered air at a
       temperature of 70 F +/-5 F and 50% +/-20% relative humidity. Animal
       rooms were set to maintain a minimum of 12 to 15 air changes per hour.
       The room was on an automatic timer for a light/dark cycle of 12 hours on
20     and 12 hours off with no twilight. Sterilized Bed-O-Cobs bedding was
       used. Bedding was changed a minimum of once per week. Cages, tops,
       bottles, etc. were washed with a commercial detergent and allowed to air
       dry. Prior to use, these items were wrapped and autoclaved. A
       commercial disinfectant was used to disinfect surfaces and materials
25      introduced into the hood. Floors were swept daily and mopped a minimum
       of twice weekly with a commercial detergent. Walls and cage racks were
       sponged a minimum of once per month with a dilute bleach solution. A
       cage card or label with the appropriate information necessary to identify
       the study, dose, animal number and treatment group marked all cages.

   WO 2009/153319                                                   PCT/EP2009/057617
       The temperature and relative humidity were recorded during the study,
       and the records retained.
        Diet
 5     Animals were fed with sterile Labdiet* 5053 (pre-sterilized) rodent chow
       and sterile water was provided ad libitum.
       Animal Randomization and Allocations
       Mice were randomly and prospectively divided into four treatment groups
10     (Table 1) prior to the initiation of treatment. Each animal was identified by
       ear punching corresponding to an individual number. A cage card was
       used to identify each cage and marked with the study number, treatment
       group number and animal numbers.
15     Assessment of Results
       Statistical differences between treatment groups were determined using
       Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square analysis with a
       critical value of 0.05.
20      Experimental Procedures
       Tumours were measured once every two days with micro-calipers, and
       tumour volume was calculated as (length x width) 3 rr/3. The tumour growth
        index (TGI) was calculated using the formula 100-(Vc*100/Vt), where Vc is
       the mean volume of the tumours in the control group and Vt is the mean
25     volume of the tumours in the test group.
        Results
       Survival
        No deaths occurred during this study.

       Animal Weiqhts (Figures 1 and 2)
       The mean daily percentage weight change for each treatment group is
       shown in Figure 1. The mice in the vehicle control group gained an
       average of 7.6 % of their starting weight by day 21. The mice treated with
 5     cisplatin 5 mg/kg on day 2 gained an average of 8.3% of their starting
       weight by day 21. The mice treated with oltipraz 100 mg/kg on days 1, 3,
       8 and 10 gained an average of 4.9 % of their starting weight by day 21.
       The mice treated with cisplatin 5 mg/kg on day 2 and oltipraz 100 mg/kg
       on days 1 and 3 gained an average of 3.7 % of their starting weight by day
10     21.
       The significance of these differences was evaluated by calculating the
       mean area under the curve (AUC) for the percentage weight change for
       each animal and comparing the groups using an ANOVA on ranks test,
15     with Dunn's post test. The One-Way ANOVA test was not used on this
       data because the data failed a normality test, indicating that the ANOVA
       on ranks test was more appropriate for the data set. There was a
       significant difference between the group treated with cisplatin plus oltipraz
       group and the vehicle control group (P=0.025). The AUC data is shown in
20      Figure 2. The AUC calculation was made using the trapezoidal rule
       transformation. Group means were calculated and are shown with error
       bars representing SEM for each group. Groups were compared using the
       ANOVA on ranks method. Statistically significant differences were seen
       between cisplatin plus oltipraz treated groups and control groups
25     (P=0.025).
       Tumour Volumes (Figures 3 and 4)
       Tumour volumes were calculated from the length and width
       measurements taken on alternating days by calculating the mean radius
30     (r), which was the sum of length and width divided by 4, and using the

   WO 2009/153319                                                   PCT/EP2009/057617
       formula 4/3 -rrr 3 to calculate the volume. The mean tumour volume data is
       shown in Figure 3. The mean tumour volume for the vehicle control group
        increased from 95 mm3 on day 1 to 536 mm3 on day 21. The mean
       tumour volume for the group treated with cisplatin at 5 mg/kg on day 2
 5      increased from 93 mm3 on day 1 to 275 mm3 on day 21. The mean
       tumour volume for the group treated with oltipraz at 100 mg/kg on days 1,
       3, 8 and 10 increased from 93 mm3 on day 1 to 200 mm3 on day 21. The
       mean tumour volume for the group treated with cisplatin at 5 mg/kg on day
       2 plus oltipraz at 100 mg/kg on days land 3 increased from 93 mm 3 on
10     day1to163mm 3 on day21.
        Further analysis of the data was performed by calculating the mean area
       under the curve (AUC) for the tumour volume for each animal (Figure 4)
       and comparing the groups using an ANOVA on ranks test, with Dunn's
15     post test. The area under the curve (AUC) calculation was made using
       the trapezoidal rule transformation. Group means were calculated and are
       shown in Figure 4 with error bars representing SEM for each group.
       Groups were compared using the ANOVA on ranks method. Statistically
       significant differences were seen between the vehicle control group and
20     the treatment group (P=0.006). Further comparison of individual groups to
       the control using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test showed that all three
       treatment groups had significant reduced tumour growth, with the P values
       shown in Figure 4.
25     The One-Way ANOVA test was not used on this data because the data
       failed a normality test, indicating that the ANOVA on ranks test was more
       appropriate for the data set. This analysis indicated that there were
       significant differences between the treated groups and the vehicle control
       group (P=0.006), but did not generate P values for individual groups.
30      Individual comparisons of the treated groups to the vehicle control group

   WO 2009/153319                                                      PCT/EP2009/057617
       showed a significant difference using a Rank Sum test between the
       cisplatin treated group and the vehicle control group (P=0.040), the group
       treated with oltipraz and the vehicle control group (P=0.006) and the group
       treated with both cisplatin and oltipraz and the vehicle control group
 5     (P=0.001). The Tumour Growth Inhibition (TGI) was calculated for both
       the cisplatin, oltipraz and the cisplatin plus oltipraz treated groups. The
       TGI for the group treated with cisplatin alone was 48.8%, and for the group
       treated with cisplatin plus oltipraz, the TGI was 69.6%. The TGI for
       oltipraz alone was 62.3%. There was no indication from these data that
10     oltipraz was in any way protective of the A549 tumours. On the contrary,
       these data indicate that oltipraz was having a significant anti-tumour effect,
       which was increased when oltipraz was combined with cisplatin. The anti
       tumour effect observed for the oltipraz plus cisplatin treatment group was
       greater than that observed with either oltipraz alone or cisplatin alone.
15
       Conclusion
       Treatment with oltipraz alone showed no evidence of toxicity in this study
       based on observations of survival and weight change. Treatment with
       oltipraz in combination with cisplatin caused a statistically significant
20     reduction in weight gain (P=0.025). Tumours in animals treated with a
       combination of cisplatin and oltipraz grew more slowly than tumours in
       animals treated with vehicle (P=0.001) and had a TGI of 69.6%. Tumours
        in animals treated with a combination of cisplatin and oltipraz also grew
       more slowly than tumours in animals treated with either oltipraz alone or
25     cisplatin alone. There was no evidence that oltipraz negatively interfered
       with the anti-tumour action of cisplatin in this study. Further, there was no
       evidence in this study that oltipraz protected the tumours.

       Weights and Survival
       All animals were weighed every day and their survival recorded, in order to
 5     assess possible differences in animal weight among treatment groups as
       an indication of possible toxicity resulting from the treatments. Any
       animals exhibiting a loss of >20% of starting weight during the course of
       the study were euthanized.
10     Tissue Culture
       A549 human lung cancer cells were obtained from ATCC. These cells
       were grown in F-1 2 supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS),
       penicillin and streptomycin, and 2mM L-Glutamine. Cells were sub
       cultured by removing the medium, rinsing twice with sterile calcium-free
15     and magnesium-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and adding 1 to 2
       ml of 0.25% trypsin and 0.03% EDTA solution. The flask was allowed to

   WO 2009/153319                                                  PCT/EP2009/057617
       sit at 37 C until the cells detached. Cells were then sub-cultured at a ratio
       of 1:3.
       Animals
 5      Female Nude Mice which are homozygous for the nu gene (nu+/nu+)
       (Charles River Labs), aged 5 to 6 weeks, with a mean pre-treatment body
       weight of 24.6 grams were used. Animals were individually numbered
       using an ear punch and housed in groups of 12 animals per cage.
       Animals were acclimatized prior to study commencement. During this
10     period of at least 2 days, the animals were observed daily in order to reject
       animals that presented in poor condition.
        Housing
       The study was performed in animal rooms provided with filtered air at a
15     temperature of 70 F+/-5 F and 50% +/-20% relative humidity. Animal
       rooms were set to maintain a minimum of 12 to 15 air changes per hour.
       The room was on an automatic timer for a light/dark cycle of 12 hours on
       and 12 hours off with no twilight. Sterilized Bed-O-Cobs* bedding was
       used. Bedding was changed a minimum of once per week. Cages, tops,
20     bottles, etc. were washed with a commercial detergent and allowed to air
       dry. Prior to use, these items were wrapped and autoclaved. A
       commercial disinfectant was used to disinfect surfaces and materials
        introduced into the hood. Floors were swept daily and mopped a minimum
       of twice weekly with a commercial detergent. Walls and cage racks were
25     sponged a minimum of once per month with a dilute bleach solution. A
       cage card or label with the appropriate information necessary to identify
       the study, dose, animal number and treatment group marked all cages.
       The temperature and relative humidity were recorded during the study,
       and the records retained.

        Diet
       Animals were fed with sterile Labdiet 5053 (pre-sterilized) rodent chow
       and sterile water was provided ad libitum.
 5     Animal Randomization and Allocations
       Mice were randomly and prospectively divided into three treatment groups
       prior to the initiation of treatment. Each animal was identified by ear
       punching corresponding to an individual number. A cage card was used
       to identify each cage and marked with the study number, treatment group
10     number and animal numbers.
       Assessment of Results
       Statistical differences between treatment groups were determined using
       Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square analysis with a
15     critical value of 0.05.
        Experimental Procedures
       Tumours were measured once every two days with micro-calipers, and
       tumour volume was calculated as (length x width) 3 r/3. The tumour growth
20      index (TGI) was calculated using the formula 100-(Vc*100/Nt), where Vc is
       the mean volume of the tumours in the control group and Vt is the mean
       volume of the tumours in the test group.
        Results
25     Survival
       One animal died in this study on day 21 in the Cetuximab only treated
       group. The reason for the death of this animal is unclear. The tumour
       burden was relatively high but there was no evidence of significant weight
       loss.

       Animal Weights (Figures 5 and 6)
       The mean daily percentage weight change for each treatment group is
       shown in Figure 5. The mice in the vehicle control group gained an
       average of 6.5 % of their starting weight by day 21. The mice treated with
 5     Cetuximab 1.7 mg/kg on day 2 and 1.0 mg/kg on day 9 gained an average
       of 4.8% of their starting weight by day 21. The mice treated with
       Cetuximab 1.7 mg/kg on day 2 and 1.0 mg/kg on day 9 and oltipraz 100
       mg/kg on days 1, 3, 8 and 10 gained an average of 4.9 % of their starting
       weight by day 21.
10
       The significance of these differences was evaluated by calculating the
       mean area under the curve (AUC) for the percentage weight change for
       each animal and comparing the groups using a One-Way ANOVA test.
       There were no significant differences between the oltipraz treated groups
15     and the vehicle control groups (P=0.828). The AUC data is shown in
        Figure 6. This calculation was made using the trapezoidal rule
       transformation. Group means were calculated and are shown with error
       bars representing SEM for each group. Groups were compared using the
       One-Way ANOVA method. No statistically significant differences were
20     seen between oltipraz treated and control groups (P=0.828).
       Tumour Volumes (Figures 7 and 8)
       Tumour volumes were calculated from the length and width
       measurements taken on alternating days by calculating the mean radius
25     (r), which was the sum of length and width divided by 4, and using the
       formula 4/3 -rrr 3 to calculate the volume. The mean tumour volume data is
       shown in Figure 7. The mean tumour volume for the vehicle control group
        increased from 103 mm3 on day 1 to 1553 mm3 on day 21. The mean
       tumour volume for the group treated with Cetuximab at 1.7 mg/kg on day 2
30     and 1.0 mg/kg on day 9 increased from 112 mm 3 on day 1 to 607 mm3 on

   WO 2009/153319                                                  PCT/EP2009/057617
       day 21. The mean tumour volume for the group treated with Cetuximab at
        1.7 mg/kg on day 2 and 1.0 mg/kg on day 9 plus oltipraz at 100 mg/kg on
       days 1, 3, 8 and 10 increased from 99 mm3 on day 1 to 164 mm3 on day
       21.
 5
        Further analysis of the data was performed by calculating the mean area
       under the curve (AUC) for the tumour volume for each animal (Figure 8).
       This calculation was made using the trapezoidal rule transformation.
       Group means were calculated and are shown with error bars representing
10     SEM for each group. Groups were compared using the One-Way ANOVA
       method. This analysis did not reveal significant differences between either
       of the treated groups and the vehicle control group (P=0.176). Individual
       comparisons of the treated groups to the vehicle control group showed no
       significant differences using a Rank Sum test between either the
15     Cetuximab treated group and the vehicle control group (P=0.583) or the
       group treated with Cetuximab and oltipraz and the vehicle treated control
       group (P=0.078). There were no statistically significant differences
       between the Cetuximab treated group and the Cetuximab plus oltipraz
       treated group (P=0.214).
20
       The comparison between the vehicle treated group and the other two
       groups was characterized by an unusually high degree of variation in the
       control group. Animal #2 in particular had the smallest tumour in the study
       on day 21. If the data from this animal is excluded, the group treated with
25     Cetuximab plus oltipraz shows a significant reduction in tumour volume
       AUC (P=0.025). This suggests a synergistic effect of Cetuximab and
       oltipraz which resulted in decreased tumour volume.
       The Tumour Growth Inhibition (TGI) was calculated for both the Cetuximab
30     and the Cetuximab plus Oltipraz treated groups. The TGI for the group

   WO 2009/153319                                                     PCT/EP2009/057617
       treated with Cetuximab alone was 61%, and for the group treated with
       Cetuximab plus oltipraz, the TGI was 89.4%. There was no indication
       from these data that oltipraz was in any way protective of the A549
       tumours.
 5
       Conclusions
       Oltipraz showed no evidence of toxicity in this study based on
       observations of survival and weight change. Tumours in animals treated
       with Cetuximab grew more slowly than tumours in animals treated with
10     vehicle and had a TGI of 61%. Tumours in animals treated with
       Cetuximab and oltipraz grew more slowly than tumours in animals treated
       with vehicle and had a TGI of 89.4%. There was no evidence that oltipraz
       negatively interfered with the anti-tumour action of Cetuximab in this study.
       There was no evidence in this study that oltipraz protected the tumours.
