                      FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5
        The following invention is generally related to
   instrumentalities and methodologies in gaming devices.
   More specifically, the  instant invention is   directed to a
   method and apparatus that features a primary game and at
10 least one concurrent game, with both games    displayed on
   the same playfield but each being separate and distinct
   games or features.
                   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
15
        Prior art gaming devices generally feature a primary
   game having a plurality of reels    showing symbols generated
   in a random fashion. When the reels    stop spinning, the
   resulting orientation of symbols    is compared to a paytable
20 and the player is awarded for any matches.    Some games
   extend this idea by allowing awards to be given for
   orientations other than mere    'symbols in a row',         bestowing
   "scatter pay" awards  and offering creative payline
   orientations. Additionally, several devices    offer "bonus
25 games" played subsequent to the primary game, often
   presenting the player with an enhanced opportunity to win
   larger awards than on the primary game, or merely offering
   the player an opportunity to play an entirely different
   game than the primary game,   such as a bonus  game.
30      The following prior art   reflects the  state of the art
   of which applicant  is aware and is included herewith to
   discharge applicant's acknowledged duty to disclose
   relevant prior art.  It is stipulated, however, that none
   of these references teach singly nor render obvious when
35 considered in any  conceivable combination the nexus of the
   instant invention as  disclosed in greater detail
   hereinafter and as particularly claimed.

                DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 5       Considering the drawings, wherein like reference
   numerals denote like parts throughout the various drawing
   figures,  reference numeral   10 as  shown in FIG. 2 is
   directed to the device according to the present invention.
10       In its essence, the device 10 includes a housing 16
   which  supports a visual display 2, preferably a video
   monitor, therewithin. The   display 2 may include a window 8
   for special messages or for incrementing counting of
   credits accumulated by the player. The device also
15 includes an LED or other readout     4 for prompting the
   player and can provide similar verbiage as     the window              8 or
   in lieu thereof, to   stimulate the player. The device
   includes an inlet   6 for the   reception therein for coins,
   currency or the like to auger in the inception of play. A
20 plurality of decision-making buttons 12 are     located on the
   face of the apparatus 10,   preferable below the display 2,
   and a pull handle 14 can be used to initiate play as an
   alternative to supplement the decision-making buttons                  12.
   A coin hopper 18 or other payment methods,     i.e.,        ticket
25 printers, may be included to effectuate an output of an
   award due the player. The   device 10 may have a top portion
   32 with a display thereon having a motif correlative with
   the game to be played and can include a paytable. A
   plurality of speakers 34 may be included on the          device for
30 aural interaction with the player. The apparatus also
   includes a processor P coordinating all     functions and a
   random number generator G operatively coupled thereto for
   generating outcomes. A   card 9, having a read/write
   instrumentality 17 thereon,     can be read via input         7 as a
35 substitute  for or supplement to credit transfers as well
   as player  identification.
                                                                                29/03/18
                                                    101244601(6Maues) P88125.AU.4

                                 -  7
         Referring to FIG. 1,  the flow chart     associated with
   the present invention can be explored. The device 10 is
   enabled when a player deposits a wager. The       features of
   the present invention are preferentially operative upon
 5 the  deposit of a maximum wager. Assume a maximum wager is
   deposited. A primary game    (base game)    appears for play on
   the  display 2.  The primary game may be of any type, but                      is
   preferably a reel type game.     The primary game outcome is
   compared to a paytable and the player is awarded credits
10 for any matching outcomes.
         The concurrent  game or games     (also referred to herein
   as feature games) are played in association with, and in
   certain embodiments on, the     same base game displayed
15 playfield;  that is,  with the same display from the primary
   reel game. Each reel 50a-50e may be separately enabled for
   use  in the concurrent game or games. Should a non-reel
   game be used as the base or primary game, the playfield
   can be broken up into "regions" that behave as the reels
20 50a-50e do according to this embodiment. Thus,           each reel
   50a-50e is a "region" in a reel type game.       Other regions
   could be defined for the game display matrix        such as by
   being associated with each or a selected some of the base
   game pay lines, rows, quadrants or the like.
25
         The manner  in which concurrent games are enabled is
   preferentially dependent on the amount       of the initial
   wager. For example, Figure 3 shows       a standard 5-reel, 20
   payline game, in which a player may choose to play one,
30 five, ten,  fifteen, or twenty paylines 52.      The 5-reels
   display defines a 3-row, 5-column       (3x5) RxC array 54.               if
   the player chooses to play one payline 52,       the concurrent
   game with respect to the first      reel 50a is enabled, as in
   Figure 4.  If the player chooses to play five, ten,
35 fifteen, or twenty paylines     52,  the  concurrent games with
   respect to the   second, third, fourth and fifth reels                  50b
   50e,  respectively, are enabled in addition to that of the
                                                      10124460_1(GMaUes) P88,2AU.4 29/03/18

                                 -  8
   first reel  50a.  It is also within the scope     of the present
   invention to associate one    concurrent game per payline.
         In a further embodiment one or more wagers in
 5 addition to any base game wager, are required to, in
   essence, buy-up or enable,    concurrent game(s) features.
         The concurrent   game may be of any suitably adapted
   game of chance, including, but not      limited to:      card games,
10 such as blackjack, baccarat, or poker;      variations of craps
   or other dice games;    lotteries;   other casino games of
   chance,  such as roulette or keno;     and other non-casino
   games of chance, such as    "finger games"    (e.g, 'odd/even',
   'rock, paper,  scissors',   etc.).   The embodiment described
15 hereinbelow uses a variation of the game of craps as                    its
   concurrent game. It is also within the scope of the
   present invention to provide a concurrent game which is
   not  chance dependent,   such as   conventional "Indian casino"
   slot machines   (e.g.,  Class II gaming).
20
         When the wager   is made, the   appropriate reels            50a-50e
   are enabled. Figure 3 shows a playfield in which all                    20
   paylines  52 are played, the paylines 52     indicated along
   the vertical margins 56 of the array 54,       and all         five
25 reels 50a-50e are enabled. Figure 4 shows a playfield in
   which only the   first reel 50a is enabled. Each enabled
   reel  50a-50e shows a target value 58a-58e, also called a
   winning feature outcome or "point", preferably in a
   graphical box 60   located above or otherwise adjacent the
30 reel  50a-50e. Alternatively, point values 58a-58e               for all
   reels 50a-50e  could be displayed on a table in another
   portion of the display 2,    separate from the reels 50a-50e.
   The  "point" 58a-58e displayed on each reel      50a-50e is
   preferably determined independently of that       displayed on
35 the  other reels. Alternatively, the point values on
   enabled reels  could be related by an algorithm. Where a
   point value has not been established for a concurrent
                                                      10124460_1(GMaUes) P88,2AU.4 29/03/18

                                -  9
   game, the game processor selects     a default value, e.g.
        The primary   (base) game outcome is displayed and the
 5 player is awarded according to the primary game paytable,
   if appropriate in a manner as     known in the prior art.               Base
   game awards may be   in the form of line pay awards            (winning
   symbol combinations on wagered upon pay lines, scatter
   pays or the like).   Success in the concurrent game is
10 determined by the occurrence or non-occurrence of a
   special  indicator or symbol   62,  such as a picture of a
   pair of dice, on enabled regions as,     in this embodiment,
   defined by reels   50a-50e. In a preferred embodiment,                if
   the special indicator 62 occurs on an enabled reel,                 the
15 dice animate to produce a value. The value displayed on
   the dice  (feature outcome)  is compared to the
   predetermined   (or default) point value 58a-58e on the
   enabled reel 50a-50e on which the dice are displayed, and
   the player is awarded for matching the point value 58a
20 58e. The animated dice may then be replaced by an award
   animation 64,  for example,  showing the amount awarded the
   player as  in Figure  4.
        The algorithm for selecting the point value 58a-58e
25 preferably begins by assigning a default point value of
   seven. Alternatively, the beginning point value may be
   randomly selected when each    reel 50a-50e is  enabled.
30      If the point is   seven and the dice show a seven, the
   player is awarded. If the point     is seven and the dice               show
   anything other than a seven, the point for the enabled
   region, changes to the value shown on the dice, with the
   graphical box 60   or table being updated with the new point
35 value.
        If the point is   something other than a seven and the
                                                    10124460_1(GHMaes) P88125AU.4 29/03/18

                                 -   10
   dice roll matches the point, the player is awarded and the
   point changes back to a    seven. If the point     is something
   other than a seven and the dice       roll is a  seven, the point
   changes back to a seven and no award is paid. If the point
 5 is something other than a seven and a value is shown that
   is neither a seven or the point, the point does not                    change
   and no award is paid.
         The amount of the award paid is preferably tied to
10 the  statistical probability of values in the dice roll,
   e.g.,  results of two and twelve are       least statistically
   likely to occur and therefore pay higher than other
   values.  That is,  if the point is     "4"  and the feature
   indicator results in a matching outcome of        "4"     the player
15 is paid an award reflecting the       2:1 probability of
   obtaining a  "4" versus a   "7"    (3 ways to roll a      "4"       versus
   six ways to roll a "7").    Alternatively, the award values
   could be equal,   if the  concurrent game chosen lends                 itself
   to various equal probability results.
20
         The preferred embodiment is      described with reference
   to a primary reel game, but      could easily be implemented in
   other types of games,    such as video poker or other matrix
   type games. Any game that lends       itself to the concept of
25 "enablement", as   described herein, is suitable for use as
   a primary game.   Similarly, any game of chance that may be
   structured as a simple    comparison may be used as the
   concurrent game.
30       Further, the invention is not limited to use of
   simple comparisons   in the concurrent game.      The combination
   of values on enabled reels      50a-50e could be used to
   provide a more complex    concurrent game, such as           a game
   that uses two enabled reels      50a-50e to set boundary values
35 for the winning feature outcome       58a-58e, with the feature
   indicator 62 providing a means for generating or
   displaying a value    (feature outcome)     for comparison to the
                                                       10124460_1(GMaUes) P8812AU.4 29/03/18

                              - 11
   boundary values.
        In addition to the enablement of reels 50a-50e based
   on the initial wager, the player may instead be offered
 5 the option of "purchasing" feature, e.g. concurrent,
   games. Such a choice may be offered in addition to the
   decisions about paylines 52,  or if a game offers only
   fixed paylines 52, the player could be offered the
   opportunity to enable reels 50a-50e. Another embodiment
10 contemplates the player choosing which reels 50a-50e to
   enable, as opposed to following a default decision path in
   the device without player choice.
        Turning to Figure 5, a system application of the
15 present invention is illustrated. According to this
   embodiment, each gaming device 10 is linked via electronic
   communication means to a host processor 100.   In one
   embodiment, the host processor 100 operates to download
   and control the operation for each individual device 10 to
20 select base game outcomes as well as any feature
   indicators defining a central determination arrangement.
   In another embodiment, each device 10 includes its own
   game control processor of the type described above for
   selecting and displaying base game outcomes. In either
25 arrangement, the host processor 100 includes a jackpot
   database 102 which, in association with the host processor
   100, provides for the selection of one or more jackpot
   outcomes. In but one example, the host processor 100 and
   database may cooperate to randomly select, from a field of
30 numbers 1-1,000,000, a specific number, e.g. 799. Upon a
   device selecting and displaying a feature indicator, one
   of the base game processor or host processor 100 selects a
   number between 1 and 1,000,000. The number could be
   selected randomly. If the number selected as a result of
35 the selection of the feature indicator matches the jackpot
   outcome number, the player wins a jackpot. Otherwise the
   player wins nothing, a minor award of a consolation prize.
                                                 10124460_1(GMaUes) P88,2AU.4 29/03/18

                              - 12
        In other embodiments, the feature indicator may
   result in a Bingo play, Keno play, or the like.
 5      The feature indicator, as described above, may be a
   symbol which is displayed in the base game display. The
   symbol, when selected, can be treated as a wild symbol,
   multiplier symbol, or the feature symbol as  described
   above. That is, upon selection of the feature symbol,                its
10 attribute of being wild, a pay line multiplier, an outcome
   multiplier of driving the selection for the concurrent
   (feature) game is also selected and applied.
        Moreover, having thus described the invention, it
15 should be apparent that numerous structural modifications
   and adaptations may be resorted to without departing from
   the scope and fair meaning of the instant invention as set
   forth hereinabove and as described hereinbelow by the
   claims.
