                                  DESCRIPTION
                           MIRROR-COATED LENS
Technical Field
 [0001]
        The present invention relates to a mirror-coated lens
having a functional film on each of a front                 surface and a back
surface thereof,       and particularly       relates      to a mirror-coated
lens used for eyeglasses.
Background Art
 [0002]
      Ingeneral, various sunglasses are commerciallyavailable,
and some of them are sunglasses using a mirror-coated eyeglass
lens having ametallic      luster      ona surface thereof.        Theeyeglass
lens has a reflection      enhancing effect         in a convex lens surface
thereof and has a light     absorbing characteristic            due to a further
disposed metal layer.        Therefore, when wearing sunglasses with
the eyeglass lens, a wearer can see scenery, but the eyes of
the wearer are not visually           recognized easily       from the outside
because the eyeglass        lens has a mirror-like function due to
processing on the convex surface side.
 [0003]
        Patent Literature       1 has proposed a plastic         mirror-coated
lens having a reflection          enhancing effect      in   a convex surface,
                                         1

having an antireflection effect in a concave surface, and having
a functional film obtained by laminating specific first to
seventh layers sequentially from a surface of a plastic substrate
as a plastic mirror-coated lens not deteriorating a reflection
enhancing effect of a lens convex surface, enhancing an
antireflection effect of a lens concave surface, and improving
a luminous transmittance in a plastic mirror-coated lens.
 [0004]
        In Patent Literature 2, it has been found that by coloring
a lens in mirror-coated sunglasses providing excellent wearing
feeling without feeling of back surface reflection, reflection
on a back side of the mirror-coated lens can be reduced due to
a transparent dielectric and a color balance during wearing can
be made to be easily visible even when the mirror coating reflects
only light having a specific wavelength.      Patent Literature 2
has proposed mirror-coated sunglasses obtained by coating a
convex surface of a synthetic resin lens colored using a dye
and/or a pigment with mirror coating formed of a dielectric
multilayer film and coating a concave surface thereof with an
antireflection film formed of a dielectric multilayer film.
 [0005]
        Patent Literature 3 has proposed an optical element
including a multilayer inorganic vapor deposition film as a film
structure on at least one surface of a transparent base material
as an optical element    (for example,  eyeglass lens) exhibiting
                                  2

an effect of cutting heat rays in a wide wavelength range of
near-infrared         rays,    desirable       from a viewpoint of protecting
eyes, and providing cool feeling due to cutting heat rays in
intense heat or the like.                The inorganic vapor deposition film
includes,      sequentially         from a surface side of the transparent
base material, a heat ray cutting                composite layer and an optical
composite layer.            The heat ray cutting         composite layer is      formed
of a metal layer formed of or based on at                  least     one metal element
selectedfromthe group 10 intheperiodical                      table,     andanadhesive
layer formed of titania              (including a composite oxide) adjacent
to upper and lower surfaces of the metal layer.

Summary of       Invention
Technical Problem
 [0007]
           Conventional mirror-coated lenses indicated in Patent
Literatures       1 to 3 have a problem in         clarity       of vision  of a wearer
due to a low transmittance.                In  recent years,         in  sports glasses
                                              3

andfashionapplications,             inordertoemphasizeclarityof                vision
of a wearer,          there has been a demand for a mirror-coated lens
having a high transmittance.                  On the other hand, in order to
increase the transmittance of the mirror-coated lens, it                              is
considered to reduce the thickness of a metal layer of mirror
coating formed on a surface.                  However, in this case, the
transmittance is increased, but it has been found that
conspicuous glare and a flare             phenomenon and a ghost phenomenon
occurdisadvantageously.               Ontheotherhand, inorder             to suppress
reflection of a film formed on a surface by observation from
a back surface side, it          is  only required to impart an absorption
characteristic           to a lens base material           (coloring or the like)       .
However,       in   this   case,  the transmittance            is largely  decreased
disadvantageously.
           Therefore, an object of the present invention is                to provide
a mirror-coated lens having a high transmittance and capable
of suppressing the flare            phenomenon and the ghost phenomenon.
Solution to Problem
 [0008]
           Regarding the above object, it has been found that the
flare     phenomenon and the ghost phenomenon can be suppressed by
adjusting        a luminous reflectance         and a luminous transmittance
on a front       surface side of a lens base material with a functional
film      (Cl)    on the front surface side and reducing a luminous

reflectance on a back surface side of the lens base material
with a functional film (C2)    on the back surface side,  and the
present invention has been completed.
        That is, the present invention relates to the following
 [1] to   [6].

and a high refractive        index layer on a back surface of the lens
base material.        The functional film (Cl) contains a metal layer.
Therefore,       a mirror-coated lens having a surface exhibiting                    a
mirror-like reflection characteristic can be obtained.
          Here,   the "back surface" of the lens base material means

the back surface.        More specifically,        in  a case of a lens having
a convex surface and a concave surface,               the front surface means
the convex surface, and the back surface means the concave
surface.

luminous reflectance        on the front       surface side is       from 3 to 30%
such that      the front   surface exhibits        a mirror-like        reflection
characteristic when the mirror-coated lens is visually
recognized from the outside.               The luminous reflectance             on the
front     surface side is   preferably from 5 to 25%,             more preferably
from 5.0 to 18.0%,       and still     more preferably from 7.0 to 9.5%.
          The above luminous reflectance is obtained by
appropriately       changing a film thickness while a film thickness
                                            7

of the metal layer of the functional film (Cl) and the refractive
indices of the low refractive        index layer and the high refractive
index layer are considered.            The luminous reflectance on the
front   surface side is measured by a measurement method described
in Examples.
 [0013]
         In the mirror-coated lens of the present invention, in
order tomakevisionofawearerclear,            the luminous transmittance
of the mirror-coated lens is from 55 to 80%, preferably from
58to80%, morepreferablyfrom60to80%,             andstillmorepreferably
from 67 to 79%.
        The luminous transmittance is        obtained by appropriately
changing a film thickness while a film thickness of the metal
layer of the functional film (Cl)         and refractive         indices of the
low refractive       index layer and the high refractive             index layer
are considered.         The luminous transmittance is measured by a
measurement method described in Examples.
 [0014]
         In the mirror-coated lens of the present invention, in
order to suppress the flare        phenomenon and the ghost phenomenon,
the luminous reflectance          on the back surface side of the lens
base material is        from 0.1 to 9%,   preferably from 0.5 to 8.0%,
more preferably from 1.0 to 7.0%, and still            more preferably from

low refractive        index layer and the high refractive             index layer
of the functional film (C2)          are considered.       A light     absorption
characteristic        may be adjusted using a light        absorbing material
suchasacolormaterial.              However, byadjustinga        layer structure
of the functional film (C2)           such that   the luminous reflectance
on the back surface side is           within the above range,           use of the
light absorbing material can be avoided, and therefore the
luminous transmittance of the mirror lens can be increased.
           The luminous reflectance is measured by a measurement
method described in Examples.

          A difference in the luminous reflectance           between the front
surface side of the mirror-coated lens and the back surface side
thereof         (the front surface side -       the back surface side)           is
preferably 0% or more in           order to enhance an effect            of making
eyes of a wearer not easily        recognized from the outside and making
the wearer see scenery of the outside easily.                    The difference
 (the front      surface side  - thebacksurface side) ismorepreferably
3% or more, and still more preferably 5% or more in order to

          A blue light    cutting     ratio       on the front       surface side of
the mirror-coated lens is preferably from 10 to 60%, more
preferably from 30 to 55%, and still more preferably from 40
to 55% in      order to protect     the eyes of a wearer.             The blue light
cutting ratio on the front              surface side is measured by a
measurement method described in Examples.
 [0017]
          As described above,       according to the present invention,
by the luminous reflectance on the front surface side, the
luminous transmittance of the mirror-coated lens, and the
luminous reflectance on the back surface side within a
predetermined range,          a mirror lens having a high transmittance
and having the flare phenomenon and the ghost phenomenon
suppressed can be obtained.              By enhancing the transmittance of
the mirror lens, the flare           phenomenon and the ghost phenomenon
emphasized can be suppressed.
 [0018]
 (Color of reflected light)
           In the mirror-coated lens of the present invention, a main
wavelength of reflected light on the front surface side is
preferably from 380 nm to 600 nm, and a difference between a
maximum reflectance           Rt at  the main wavelength and a minimum
reflectance        Rb of reflected       light      on the front       surface   at a
wavelength of 380 nmto 780 nm (Rt              -  Rb)  (hereinafter,      also simply
referred       to as "(Rt  -  Rb)  value")       is   preferably 8% or more.         By
                                           10

such a structure, colored reflected light can be obtained on
the front surface side.
           By adjusting the main wavelength of reflected light on
the front surface side, an obtained color can be adjusted.          The
main wavelength is a wavelength determined by tristimulus values
defined by a CIE color system, and is         defined by JIS Z-8701 and
the international         standard IS07724.    Incidentally,   in the
present invention, the "main wavelength" is assumed to be a value
obtained by a measurement method of the main wavelength described
in Examples.
           The  (Rt - Rb)  value is more preferably 9% or more,     and

visibility       of the color.   The (Rt - Rb) value is  preferably 90%
or less, and more preferably 50% or less.
           The above luminous reflectance is obtained by
appropriately changing a film thickness while refractive indices
of the low refractive index layer and the high refractive index
layer of the functional film (Cl) are considered.              The main
wavelength and the (Rt - Rb) value are measured by a measurement
method described in Examples.

maximum reflectance of reflected light on the back surface side
at a wavelength of 380 nm to 780 nm is         preferably 15% or less.
That is,      by the maximum reflectance of 15% or less in a visible
                                     11

light     region at a wavelength of 380 nm to 780 nm,                    a noticeable
wavelength peak in reflected              light   can be removed, and reflected
light      on the back surface side can be colorless.                      The maximum
reflectance         ismorepreferably10%orless,             stillmorepreferably
8% or less, and usually 1% or more.
           The above luminous reflectance is obtained by
appropriately           changing a filmthickness       while refractive         indices
of the low refractive              index layer and the high refractive            index
layer of the functional film (C2)                 are considered.          The maximum

index layer (Cla) at awavelengthof 500 nmto 550 nm is preferably
from 1.35 to 1.80, and more preferably from 1.45 to 1.50.
        For example, the lowrefractive                  index layer (Cla) is      formed
of an inorganic oxide, preferably of Si0                      2  .

a substance which is at least one selected from a metal, a metal
oxide,   a metal nitride, a metal carbide,   and a metal nitrogen
oxide and has a metallic color.      A metal is preferable from a
viewpoint of easy availability.

Industrial Applicability
 [0056]
        The mirror-coated lens of the present invention has a high
transmittance and can suppress a flare                   phenomenon and a ghost
phenomenon,   and therefore         can be used as a lens for eyeglasses
in sports glasses and fashion applications.
