ABSTRACT
Instantaneous human powered 100% reusable, wearable flotation, with the buoyancy reservoir
worn stand alone, under or inside of your standard sun protection swimwear/rash shirt.
Constructed with inverted pocket or "reservoir" filled with recycled oxygen form you lungs via a
valveless tube directly into lower portion of the reservoir
Simplified, an inverted reservoir 1* filled via an air tube 2* into the lower portion of the reservoir
As the reservoir fills with air 4* the water 3* is pushed out 6* creating positive buoyancy and
raising the reservoir and payload out of the water 5*. To disperse the buoyancy the flexible reservoir
can be collapsed or inverted (figure 2).

SWIM FREE X1
[001] Until now instantaneous human powered 100% reusable wearable flotation has not been
available. With the simple, reliable and practical buoyancy reservoir underneath or inside of your
standard sun protection swimmer/rash shirt, positive buoyancy can be achieved in seconds via one
breath of air.
[002] Using an inverted pocket or "reservoir" filled with recycled oxygen form you lungs, enough
positive buoyancy can be created to be able to float without the need to tread water. The 100%
reusable reservoir has no valves and is deflated through the lower part of the pocket, that is
permanently open. The pocket uses an elastic type UV rash shirt or front cover to keep it from back
filling with water when not inflated.
[003] The reservoir could be worn by its self, under a rash shirt, or be built into a rash shirt, wetsuit
or other swimwear. This design is ideal for swimming, surfing, snorkelling, windsurfing, kite
boarding, kayaking, rock fishing along with other water activities not requiring a regulatory safety
vest.
[004] The air reservoir 1* is filled with recycled oxygen from the users lungs, via the inlet air tube
8* through the fabric pocket/tube 4* into the air reservoir/pocket. The air is held within the inverted
pocket by the static water pressure, creating positive buoyancy (figure 1).
[005] Invert yourself and the air held within the reservoir will promptly exit via the open section of
the pocket 5* this opening and air exit speed can be modified by the ribs/dividers 2* or restricted
exit points.
[006] Individual pockets created by the ribs/dividers 2* can be used to increase the rigidity of the
reservoir, they can also be used to control the air exit speed of the reservoir when diving.
[009] The wast strap and or groin strap 3 * holds the reservoir from rising when inflated and the
shoulder straps 7* restrain the reservoir from moving forward from the chest and create a wearable
system when out of the water.

                                                    3.
[007] Built using an elastic type swim/rash shirt and flexible sealed and materials for the reservoir
such as plastic, rubber, canvas or similar for the reservoir.
[008] Simplified, an inverted reservoir 1* filled via an air tube 2* into the lower portion of the
reservoir As the reservoir fills with air 4* the water 3* is pushed out 6* creating positive buoyancy
and raising the reservoir and payload out of the water 5*. To disperse the buoyancy the flexible
reservoir can be collapsed or inverted (figure 2).
[009] A prototype reservoir ready for the straps to be fitted (figure 3).

CLAIMS
       1. Reservoir with no valves filled via a tube or pipe into the lower section
          of the sealed inverted bucket style reservoir. See figure 2
      2.  100% reusable reservoir with no waiting times or refill cartridges.
      3.  Elastic shirt, pouch or front cover, keeping the water from backfilling
          the flexible reservoir when not in use.
      4.  Lower wast band and or groin strap to secure reservoir from moving
          upwards when inflated.
      5.  Structural tubes or ribs within the reservoir provide greater rigidity
          and fit, built to control the deflation speed and tilt angle before deflation.
