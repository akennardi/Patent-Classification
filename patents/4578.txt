     Mode for the Invention
[51]   Hereinafter, various exemplary embodiments will be described in detail with
     reference to the accompanying drawings. Further, in the following description, a
     detailed explanation of known related functions or configurations may be omitted to
     avoid unnecessarily obscuring the subject matter. In addition, terms to be described
     below may vary according to a user's and an operator's intentions, the convention, or
     the like as terms defined by considering functions. Therefore, the definition should be

                                            6
     made according to the contents throughout this specification.
[52]   An apparatus and a method proposed in the exemplary embodiments can be, of
     course, applied to various communication systems including mobile broadcasting
     services including a digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) service, digital video
     broadcasting handheld (DVB-H), an advanced television systems committee mobile/
     handheld (ATSC-M/H) service, an Internet protocol television (IPTV), and the like,
     communication systems including a moving picture experts group (MPEG) media
     transport (MMT) system, an evolved packet system (EPS), a long-terms evolution
     (LTE) mobile communication system, a long-term evolution-advanced (LTE-A)
     mobile communication system, a high speed downlink packet access (HDSPA) mobile
     communication system, a high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) mobile commu
     nication system, a 3rd generation project partnership 2 (3GPP2) high rate packet data
     (HRPD) mobile communication system, a 3GPP2 wideband code division multiple
     access (WCDMA) mobile communication system, a 3GPP2 code division multiple
     access (CDMA) mobile communication system, an Institute of Electrical and
     Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16m communication system, a mobile Internet
     protocol (Mobile IP) system, and the like.
[53]   FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a hierarchical structure of a transmitting system
     according to an exemplary embodiment.
[54]   Referring to FIG. 1, a service includes media data 1000 and signaling 1050 for
     transferring information required to acquire and consume the media data at a receiver.
     The media data may be encapsulated in a format suitable for transmission prior to the
     transmission. An encapsulation method may follow a Media Processor (MPU) defined
     in ISO/IEC 23008-1 MPEG Media Transport (MMT) or a DASH segment format
     defined in ISO/IEC 23009-1 Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). The
     media data 1000 and the signaling 1050 are packetized according to an application
     layer protocol.
[55]   FIG. 1 illustrates a case in which an MMT protocol (MMTP) 1110 defined in the
     MMT and a Real-Time Object Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (ROUTE)
     protocol 1120 are used as the application layer protocol. In this case, a method for
     notifying information about an application protocol, in which a service is transmitted,
     by an independent method different from the application layer protocol is required for
     the receiver to know by which application layer protocol the service is transmitted.
[56]   A service list table (SLT) 1150 illustrated in FIG. 1 represents or indicates a
     signaling method and packetizes information about the service in a table for satisfying
     the aforementioned object. Detailed contents of the SLT will be described below. The
     packetized media data and the signaling including the SLT are transferred to a
     broadcasting link layer 1400 through a user datagram protocol (UDP) 1200 and an

                                            7
     Internet protocol (IP) 1300. An example of the broadcasting link layer 1400 includes
     an ATSC 3.0 link-layer protocol (ALP) defined in the ATSC 3.0 standard (hereafter,
     referred to as 'ATSC 3.0'). The ALP protocol generates an ALP packet by using an IP
     packet as an input, and transfers the ALP packet to a broadcasting physical layer 1500.
[57]   However, according to FIG. 2 to be described below, it is noted that the broadcasting
     link layer 1400 does not use only the IP packet 1300 including the media data and/or
     the signaling as the input, and instead, may use an MPEG2-TS packet or general
     formatted packetized data as the input. In this case, signaling information required to
     control the broadcasting link layer is also transferred to the broadcasting physical layer
     1500 in the form of the ALP packet.
[58]   The broadcasting physical layer 1500 generates a physical layer frame by signal
     processing the ALP packet as the input, converts the physical layer frame into a radio
     signal, and transmits the radio signal. In this case, the broadcasting physical layer 1500
     has at least one signal processing path. An example of the signal processing path may
     include a physical layer pipe (PLP) of ATSC 3.0 or the Digital Video Broadcasting
     Second Generation Terrestrial (DVB-T2) standard, and one or more services or some
     of the services may be mapped to the PLP.
[59]   FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of the broadcasting link
     layer 1400, according to an exemplary embodiment.
[60]   Referring to FIG. 2, the input of the broadcasting link layer 1400 includes the IP
     packet 1300, and may further include link layer signaling 1310, an MPEG2-TS packet
     1320, and other packetized data 1330.
[61]   Input data may be subjected to additional signal processing based on the type of the
     input data before ALP packetization 1450. As an example of the additional signal
     processing, the IP packet 1300 may be subjected to an IP header compression process
     1410 and the MPEG2-TS packet may be subjected to an overhead reduction process
     1420. During the ALP packetization, input packets may be subjected to dividing and
     merging processes.
[62]   FIG. 3A is a diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of a transmitting system
     or a transmitting apparatus, according to an exemplary embodiment. According to FIG.
     3A, a transmitting system 10000 according to the exemplary embodiment may include
     input formatting blocks 11000 and 11000-1, bit interleaved and coded modulation
     (BICM) blocks 12000 and 12000-1, framing/interleaving blocks 13000 and 13000-1,
     and waveform generation blocks 14000 and 14000-1.
[63]   The input formatting blocks 11000 and 11000-1 generate a baseband packet from an
     input stream of data to be serviced. Herein, the input stream may be a transport stream
     (TS), Internet packets (IP) (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6), an MPEG media transport (MMT), a
     generic stream (GS), generic stream encapsulation (GSE), and the like. For example,

                                            8
     an ATSC 3.0 link-layer protocol (ALP) packet may be generated based on the input
     stream, and the baseband packet may be generated based on the generated ALP packet.
[64]   The bit interleaved and coded modulation (BICM) blocks 12000 and 12000-1
     determine an forward error correction (FEC) coding rate and a constellation order
     according to an area (fixed PHY frame or mobile PHY frame) to which the data to be
     serviced will be transmitted, and perform encoding and time interleaving. Signaling in
     formation about the data to be serviced may be encoded through a separate BICM
     encoder according to user implementation or encoded by sharing a BICM encoder with
     the data to be serviced.
[65]   The framing/interleaving blocks 13000 and 13000-1 combine the time-interleaved
     data with a signaling signal including the signaling information from a signaling block
     15000 to generate a transmission frame.
[66]   The waveform generation blocks 14000 and 14000-1 generate an orthogonal
     frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal in a time domain for the generated
     transmission frame, modulate the generated OFDM signal into an RF signal, and
     transmit the RF signal to a receiver.
[67]   The transmitting system 10000 according to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in
     FIG. 3A includes normative blocks marked with a solid line and informative blocks
     marked with dotted lines. Herein, the blocks marked with the solid line are normal
     blocks, and the blocks marked with the dotted lines are blocks which may be used
     when informative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is implemented.
[68]   FIGs. 3B and 3C are diagrams illustrating a multiplexing method, according to
     exemplary embodiments.
[69]   FIG. 3B illustrates a block diagram for implementing time division multiplexing
     (TDM), according to an exemplary embodiment.
[70]   A TDM system architecture includes four main blocks (alternatively, parts) of the
     input formatting block 11000, the BICM block 12000, the framing/interleaving block
     13000, and the waveform generation block 14000. This TDM system architechure also
     includes a signalling block 15000.
[71]   Data is input and formatted in the input formatting block 11000 and forward error
     correction is applied the data in the BICM block 12000. Next, the data is mapped to a
     constellation. Subsequently, the data is time and frequency-interleaved in the framing/
     interleaving block 13000 and a frame is generated. Thereafter, an output waveform is
     generated in the waveform generation block 14000.
[72]   FIG. 3C illustrates a block diagram for implementing layered division multiplexing
     (LDM), according to an exemplary embodiment.
[73]   An LDM system architecture includes several other blocks as compared with the
     TDM system architecture. In detail, two separated input formatting blocks 11000 and

                                             9
     11000-1 and the BCIM blocks 12000 and 12000-1 for one of respective layers of the
     LDM are included in the LDM system architecture. The blocks are combined in an
     LDM injection block before the framing/interleaving block 13000. And, the waveform
     generation block 14000 and the signalling block are similar to the TDM system.
[74]   FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a detailed configuration of the input formatting
     block illustrated in FIG. 3A, according to an exemplary embodiment.
[75]   As illustrated in FIG. 4, the input formatting block 11000 includes three blocks that
     control packets distributed to PLPs. In detail, the input formatting block 11000
     includes an encapsulation and compression block 11100, a baseband formatting block
     (alternatively, baseband framing block) 11300, and a scheduler block 11200.
[76]   An input stream input to the encapsulation and compression block 11100 may be
     various types. For example, the input stream may be a transport stream (TS), an
     Internet packets (IP) (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6), an MPEG media transport (MMT), a
     generic stream (GS), a generic stream encapsulation (GSE), and the like.
[77]   Packets output from the encapsulation and compression block 11100 become ALP
     packets (generic packets) (also referred to as L2 packets). Herein, a format of an ALP
     packet may be one of the Type Length Value (TLV), the GSE, and the ALP.
[78]   The length of each ALP packet is variable. The length of the ALP packet may be
     easily extracted from the ALP packet itself without additional information. The
     maximum length of the ALP packet is 64 kB. The maximum length of a header of the
     ALP packet is 4 bytes. The ALP packet has a length of integer bytes.
[79]   The scheduler block 11200 receives an input stream including the encapsulated ALP
     packets to form physical layer pipes (PLPs) in a baseband packet form. In the TDM
     system, only one PLP called a single PLP (S-PLP) or multiple PLPs (M-PLP) may be
     used. One service may not use four or more PLPs. In the LDM system constituted by
     two layers, one in each layer, that is, two PLPs are used.
[80]   The scheduler block 11200 receives the encapsulated ALP packets to designate how
     the encapsulated ALP packets are allocated to physical layer resources. In detail, the
     scheduler block 11200 designates how the baseband formatting block 1130 outputs a
     baseband packet.
[81]   A function of the scheduler block 11200 is defined by a data size and a time. A
     physical layer may transmit some of data in the distributed time. The scheduler block
     11200 generates a solution which is suitable in terms of a configuration of a physical
     layer parameter by using inputs and information such as constraints and configuration
     from an encapsulated data packet, the quality of service metadata for the encapsulated
     data packet, a system buffer model, and system management. The solution is targets of
     a configuration and a control parameter which are usable and an aggregate spectrum.
[82]   An operation of the scheduler block 11200 is constrained to a set of dynamic, quasi-

                                            10
     static, and static components. Definition of the constraint may vary according to user
     implementation.
[83]    Further, a maximum of four PLPs may be used with respect to each service. A
     plurality of services which include a plurality of types of interleaving blocks may be
     implemented by up to a maximum of 64 PLPs with respect to a bandwidth of 6, 7, or 8
     MHz.
[84]    The baseband formatting block 11300 includes baseband packet construction blocks
     3100, 3100-1,...3100-n, baseband packet header construction blocks 3200, 3200-1, ...,
     3200-n, and baseband packet scrambling blocks 3300, 3300-1, ..., 3300-n, as illustrated
     in FIG. 5A. In an M-PLP operation, the baseband formatting block generates a
     plurality of PLPs as necessary.
[85]    The baseband packet construction blocks 3100, 3 100-1, ..., 3100-n construct
     baseband packets. Each baseband packet 3500 includes a header 3500-1 and a payload
     3500-2 as illustrated in FIG. 5B. A baseband packet is fixed to a length Kpayload. ALP
     packets 3610 to 3650 are sequentially mapped to a baseband packet 3500. When the
     ALP packets 3610 to 3650 do not completely fit in the baseband packet 3500, these
     packets are distributed between a current baseband packet and a next baseband packet.
     The ALP packets are distributed in a unit of a byte.
[86]    The baseband packet header construction blocks 3200, 3200-1, ..., 3200-n construct a
     header 3500-1. The header 3500-1 includes three parts, that is, a base field (also
     referred to as, a base header) 3710, an optional field (also referred to as, an option
     header) 3720, and an extension field (also referred to as, an extension header) 3730, as
     illustrated in FIG. 5B. Herein, the base field 3710 is shown in every baseband packet
     and the optional field 3720 and the extension field 3730 may not be shown in every
     baseband packet.
[87]    A main function of the base field 3710 provides a pointer of an offset value as bytes
     to indicate a start of a next ALP packet in a baseband packet. When an ALP packet
     starts a baseband packet, the value of the pointer becomes 0. When there is no ALP
     packet that starts in the baseband packet, the value of the pointer may be 8191 and a
     base header of 2 bytes may be used.
[88]    The extension field 3730 may be used afterwards and for example, used for a
     baseband packet counter, baseband packet time stamping, additional signaling, and the
     like.
[89]    The baseband packet scrambling blocks 3300, 3300-1, ..., 3000-n scramble the
     baseband packet.
[90]    FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a frame, according to an exemplary
     embodiment.
[91]    Referring to FIG. 6, the frame 600 may be represented by a combination of three

                                             11
      basic components. In detail, the frame 600 may include a bootstrap 610 positioned in a
      start portion of each frame, a preamble 620 positioned behind the bootstrap 610, and a
      payload 630 positioned behind the preamble 620.
[92]    Here, the preamble 620 includes LI control signaling used to process data included
      in the payload 630.
[93]    In addition, the payload 630 includes at least one subframe, and when a plurality of
      subframes are present in the payload 630, all of the plurality of subframes are disposed
      to be connected to each other based on a time axis illustrated in FIG. 6.
[94]    Each subframe includes a fast Fourier transform (FFT) size, a GI length, a scattered
      pilot pattern, and the number of carriers (NoC), and the FFT size, the GI length, the
      scattered pilot pattern, and the NoC are not changed in the same subframe. However,
      the FFT sizes, the GI lengths, the scattered pilot patterns, and the NoCs may be
      different from each other between different subframes in the frame 600.
[95]    Particularly, the bootstrap 610 may include a synchronization symbol positioned in a
      start portion of each frame in order to detect a signal, precisely perform synchro
      nization, estimate a frequency offset, and perform initial channel estimation.
[96]    In addition, the bootstrap 610 may include control signaling required for receiving
      and decoding portions (the preamble 620 and the payload 630) other than the bootstrap
      610 in the frame 600.
[97]    In detail, the bootstrap 610 uses a fixed sampling rate of 6.144Ms/sec and a fixed
      bandwidth of 4.5MHz, regardless of a channel bandwidth used for the portions other
      than the bootstrap 610.
[98]    FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of a transmitting apparatus
      according to an exemplary embodiment.
[99]    According to FIG. 7, the transmitting apparatus 700 includes a frame generator 710
      and a GI inserter 720.
[100]   The frame generator 710 generates a frame including a plurality of orthogonal
      frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols. Here, the plurality of OFDM
      symbols are divided into a plurality of components including a bootstrap, a preamble,
      and a payload, which has been described above in FIG. 6. Therefore, a detailed de
      scription will be omitted.
[101]   In addition, the GI inserter 720 inserts a guard interval (GI) into the generated frame.
      Here, the GI inserter 720 is included in the waveform generation block 14000
      described in FIG. 3A. In detail, a process performed in the waveform generation block
      14000 will be described.
[102]   FIG. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a detailed configuration of the waveform
      generation block, according to an exemplary embodiment.
[103]   Referring to FIG. 8, the waveform generation block 14000 includes a pilot insertion

                                             12
      810, an MISO 820, an IFFT 830, a PAPR 840, a guard interval insertion 850, and a
      bootstrap 860.
[104]   The pilot insertion 810 inserts at least one of a preamble pilot, a scattered pilot, a
      subframe boundary pilot, a continual pilot, and an edge pilot into the frame generated
      in the frame generator 710.
[105]   In addition, the MISO 820 applies a transmit diversity code filter to the frame to
      perform MISO pre-distortion, and the IFFT 830 performs inverse-Fast Fourier
      transform (IFFT) on the frame to allow each OFDM symbol to be divided into a useful
      region and a guard interval.
[106]   In addition, the PAPR 840 may perform correction of the OFDM signal, tone
      reservation, active constellation, and the like, in order to decrease a peak to average
      power ratio of the output OFDM signal.
[107]   Then, the guard interval insertion 850 may insert the guard intervals into the frame,
      and patterns of the guard intervals that may be inserted depending on the FFT size of
      the OFDM symbol may be defined as represented by the following Table 1.

[109]   The above-mentioned guard interval insertion 850 may correspond to the GI inserter
      720 according to an exemplary embodiment. In addition, a process of inserting first
      GIs having a size corresponding to the FFT size of each of the OFDM symbols by a GI
      inserter 720 to be described below may be performed based on the above Table 1.
[110]   The bootstrap 860 inserts the generated bootstrap into the frame.
[111]   Again, referring to FIG. 7, the GI inserter 720 inserts first GIs having a size corre-

      sponding to a fast Fourier transform (FFT) size of each of OFDM symbols configuring
      the payload into front ends of each of the OFDM symbols, inserts second GIs having a
      size corresponding to a quotient obtained by dividing an extra region of the payload
      calculated based on the FFT size of the OFDM symbols configuring the payload, the
      number of OFDM symbols, and the size of the first GIs by the number of OFDM
      symbols into front ends of each of the first GIs, and inserts a cyclic postfix (CP) having
      a size corresponding to the remainder remaining after dividing the extra region of the
      payload by the number of OFDM symbols into a rear end of a final OFDM symbol
      configuring the payload.
[112]    In detail, the payload includes N OFDM symbols. Here, since a length of the frame is
      fixed and the FFT size of the OFDM symbol is also fixed, the payload may include a
      region remaining after it includes all of the N OFDM symbols. Here, the region
      remaining after the payload includes all of the N OFDM symbols is defined as an extra
      region.
[113]    In detail, the extra region may be calculated through the following Equation 1 and
      Equation 2:

        Tbootstrap
         means an entire time length of the bootstrap included in the frame. In addition,
        Tfrae
         means an entire time length of the frame. BSR means a baseband sampling rate for a
      region except the bootstrap in the frame.

           preamble
[119]  NGI

[120]    Nsub means the number of subframes included in the frame.

[125]    Therefore, referring to the above Equation 1, it may be appreciated that the extra
      region according to an exemplary embodiment is calculated when a length corre
      sponding to the bootstrap is subtracted from the entire length of the frame, a length
      corresponding to the preamble symbol is subtracted in consideration of the FFT size
      and the GI of the preamble symbol, and a length corresponding to all the subframes is
      subtracted in consideration of the FFT size and the GI of each of the subframes.
[126]    In addition, the above Equation 2 means the total number of OFDM symbols except
      the preamble in the frame.
[127]    FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating a process of inserting first GIs and second GIs into
      the frame, according to an exemplary embodiment.
[128]    Referring to FIG. 9, the GI inserter 720 may insert first GIs 910 having a size corre
      sponding to an FFT size of each of OFDM symbols 940 configuring the payload into
      front ends of each of the OFDM symbols. Here, the size of the first GI 910 may be de
      termined depending on a size of the GI corresponding to the FFT size of each of the
      OFDM symbols defined in the above Table 1.
[129]    In addition, the GI inserter 720 may calculate the extra region of the payload based
      on the FFT size of the OFDM symbols 940 configuring the payload, the number of
      OFDM symbols 940, and the number of first GIs 910. Here, the GI inserter 720 may
      calculate the extra region of the payload through the above Equations 1 and 2, the FFT
      size of the OFDM symbols 940 corresponds to
           k

       N   symbols
        and the number of first GIs 940 corresponds to
       N
[130]    In addition, the GI inserter 720 inserts second GIs 920 having a size corresponding to
      a quotient obtained by dividing the calculated extra region by the number of OFDM
      symbols into front ends of each of the first GIs 910, and inserts a cyclic postfix (CP)
      930 having a size corresponding to the remainder remaining after dividing the
      calculated extra region by the number of OFDM symbols into a rear end of a final
      OFDM symbol configuring the payload.
[131]    For example, when it is assumed that a size of the calculated extra region is 11 and
      the number of OFDM symbols 940 configuring the payload is 2, the GI inserter 720
      may insert second GIs 920 having a size corresponding to a quotient obtained by
      dividing 11 by 2, that is, 5 into front ends of each of the first GIs 910, and may insert a
      CP 930 having a size corresponding to the remainder remaining after dividing 11 by 2,
      that is, 1 to a rear end of a final OFDM symbol configuring the payload.
[132]    The CP includes portions of the final OFDM symbol configuring the payload. In
      addition, the first and second GIs may include portions of each of the OFDM symbols.
      It will be described in detail through FIG. 10.
[133]    FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating configurations of the first GI, the second GI, and the
      CP in detail, according to an exemplary embodiment.
[134]    Referring to FIG. 10, the CP 930 includes samples 940-2 from a start point of the
      final OFDM symbol to a point corresponding to a size of the remainder remaining after
      the calculated extra region is divided by the number of OFDM symbols, among a
      plurality of samples configuring the final OFDM symbol 940.
[135]    For example, when it is assumed that the calculated extra region is 11 and the
      number of OFDM symbols is 2, the CP 930 includes samples from a start point of the
      final OFDM symbol to a point corresponding to a size of 1 remaining after 11 is
      divided by 2, among the plurality of samples configuring the final OFDM symbol 940.
[136]    In addition, the first and second GIs are illustrated as a guard interval (including extra
      samples) 950 in FIG. 10, and the guard interval 950 illustrated in FIG. 10 includes the
      first and second GIs. The extra samples illustrated in FIG. 10 mean the second GIs.
[137]    Here, the first and second GIs, that is, the guard interval 950 includes samples 940-1
      from a final point of the OFDM symbol 940 to a point corresponding to the sum of a
      size corresponding to the FFT size of the OFDM symbol 940 and a size of the quotient,
      among the plurality of samples configuring the OFDM symbol 940.
[138]    For example, when it is assumed that the calculated extra region is 11 and the

                                             16
      number of OFDM symbols is 2, the guard interval 950 includes samples from a final
      point of the OFDM symbol 940 to a point corresponding to the sum of a size (that is, a
      size of the first GI) corresponding to the FFT size of the OFDM symbol 940 and corre
      sponding to 5, which is a quotient obtained by dividing 11 by 2, among the plurality of
      samples configuring the OFDM symbol 940.
[139]   The GI inserter 720 may insert the calculated extra region into the frame by various
      methods, which will be described.
[140]   FIGs. 11 to 16 are diagrams illustrating various methods of distributing and inserting
      the calculated extra region, according to an exemplary embodiment.
[141]   [In the case in which OFDM symbols having the same FFT size are included in the
      frame]
[142]   Referring to FIG. 11, all of a plurality of OFDM symbols 110 included in the frame
      have the same FFT size, and first GIs 120 are inserted into front ends of each of the
      OFDM symbols. Here, the first GI 120 is denoted by GI.
[143]   In addition, the GI inserter 720 may calculate an extra region 130 based on the above
      Equations 1 and 2 in consideration of an FFT size of the OFDM symbols 110, a length
      of the first GIs 120, and the number of OFDM symbols 110.
[144]   In addition, the GI inserter 720 inserts second GIs 140 having a size corresponding to
      a quotient obtained by dividing the extra region 130 by the number of OFDM symbols
      110 in the calculated extra region 130 into front ends of each of the first GIs 120, and
      inserts the remainder region 150 remaining in the calculated extra region 130, that is, a
      region 150 corresponding to a size corresponding to the remainder remaining after
      dividing the extra region 130 by the number of OFDM symbols 110 into a rear end of a
      final OFDM symbol.
[145]   Here, the remainder region 150 inserted into the rear end of the final OFDM symbol
      may be used to perform channel estimation of the following frame.
[146]   In addition, the GI inserter 720 may also apply different disposition references
      depending on a size of the remainder region 150 inserted into the rear end of the final
      OFDM symbol.
[147]   In detail, when the size of the remainder region 150 is smaller than or equal to a
      preset reference, for example, 1/2 or 2/3 of the number of OFDM symbols, the GI
      inserter 720 may insert the remainder region 150 into the rear end of the final OFDM
      symbol, as illustrated in FIG. 11, and when the size of the remainder region 150 is
      equal to or larger than the preset reference, for example, 1/2 or 2/3 of the number of
      OFDM symbols, the GI inserter 720 may sequentially insert regions having sizes
      obtained by dividing the remainder region 150 by the number of the plurality of
      OFDM symbols with respect to the plurality of OFDM symbols included in the
      payload.

[148]   Referring to FIG. 12, when the size of the remainder region 150 is the preset
      reference, for example, 1/2 or 2/3 of the number of OFDM symbols, the GI inserter
      720 may insert the remainder region 150 into front ends of the second GIs 140 inserted
      into front ends of each of the plurality of OFDM symbols included in the payload.
[149]   For example, when the number of the plurality of OFDM symbols included in the
      payload is 2, the GI inserter 720 may insert halves of the remaining region divided by
      the total number of symbols into the front ends of the second GIs 140 inserted into the
      front ends of the plurality of OFDM symbols.
[150]   In addition, referring to FIG. 13, the remainder region 150 inserted into the rear end
      of the final OFDM symbol described in FIG. 11 may include information including a
      pilot pattern into which a pilot 150-1 is inserted so that it may be used to perform
      channel estimation of the following frame.
[151]   [In the case in which OFDM symbols having two or more FFT sizes are included in
      the frame]
[152]   In the case in which OFDM symbols having two or more FFT sizes are present in the
      frame, an example in which an extra region is inserted will be described.
[153]   Referring to FIG. 14, one or more OFDM symbols 211 having a 32K FFT size and
      one or more OFDM symbols 221 having a 16K FFT size are included in one frame,
      first GIs 212 corresponding to the 32K FFT size are inserted into front ends of each of
      the OFDM symbol 211 having the 32K FFT size, and first GIs 222 corresponding to
      the 16K FFT size are inserted into front ends of each of the OFDM symbol 221 having
      the 16K FFT size. In addition, an extra region 230 is present.
[154]   Here, the GI inserter 720 does not insert regions having sizes corresponding to the
      quotient and the remainder obtained by dividing the extra region 230 by the number of
      the plurality of OFDM symbols into the front ends of each of the OFDM symbols and
      the rear end of the final OFDM symbol, respectively, as described in FIG. 11, but
      inserts the extra region 230 in a boundary portion between the OFDM symbol 211
      having the 32K FFT size and the OFDM symbol 221 having the 16K FFT size to allow
      the extra region 230 to function as a reference signal used for synchronization and
      channel estimation.
[155]   In addition, even in the case in which the OFDM symbols having the two or more
      FFT sizes are present in one frame, the GI inserter 720 may also divide and insert the
      extra region by the method as described in FIG. 11.
[156]   Referring to FIG. 15, one or more OFDM symbols 211 having a 32K FFT size and
      one or more OFDM symbols 221 having a 16K FFT size are included in one frame,
      first GIs 212 corresponding to the 32K FFT size are inserted into front ends of each of
      the OFDM symbol 211 having the 32K FFT size, and first GIs 222 corresponding to
      the 16K FFT size are inserted into front ends of each of the OFDM symbol 221 having

                                             18
      the 16K FFT size.
[157]   In addition, the GI inserter 720 may insert second GIs 230-1 having a size corre
      sponding to a quotient obtained by dividing the extra region 230 by the total number of
      OFDM symbols without considering the FFT sizes into front ends of each of the first
      GIs 212 and 222. In addition, the GI inserter 720 may insert a CP having a size corre
      sponding to the remainder remaining after dividing the extra region 230 by the total
      number of OFDM symbols without considering the FFT sizes into a rear end of the
      final OFDM symbol of the payload.
[158]   Alternatively, referring to FIG. 16, the GI inserter 720 may insert a CP 240 having a
      size corresponding to the remainder remaining after dividing the extra region 230 by
      the total number of OFDM symbols without considering the FFT sizes into the rear end
      of the final OFDM symbol when the size of the CP 240 is a preset reference, for
      example, 1/2 or 2/3 of the number of OFDM symbols, and sequentially insert regions
      having sizes obtained by dividing the extra region 230 by the number of the plurality
      of OFDM symbols with respect to the plurality of OFDM symbols included in the
      payload when the size of the CP 240 is equal to or larger than the preset reference, for
      example, 1/2 or 2/3 of the number of OFDM symbols.
[159]   In addition, the GI inserter 720 may also distribute and insert the CP 240 having a
      size corresponding to the remainder in consideration of a ratio between the FFT sizes
      of the OFDM symbols included in the frame in FIGs. 14 to 16.
[160]   For example, in the case in which the number of the plurality of OFDM symbols
      included in the payload is 2, the GI inserter 720 does not insert halves of the entire size
      of the remainder CP obtained by dividing the total number of symbols of the CP 240
      having a size corresponding to the remainder by 2, which is the number of the plurality
      of OFDM symbols into front ends of the second GIs 230-1 inserted into the front ends
      of each of the plurality of OFDM symbols, but may divide the entire size of the CP 240
      having the size corresponding to the remainder in a ratio of 2:1 and insert regions
      having sizes divided in the ratio of 2:1 into the front ends of the second GIs 230-1
      inserted into the front ends of each of the plurality of OFDM symbols in the case in
      which the FFT sizes are 32K and 16K, respectively.
[161]   The GI inserter 720 may generate information on whether the extra region of the
      payload is distributed and a disposition reference of the extra region. In addition, the
      transmitting apparatus 700 according to an exemplary embodiment may further include
      a transmitter (not illustrated) transmitting the frame including the information on
      whether the extra region of the payload is distributed and the disposition reference of
      the extra region. In detail, the transmitter (not illustrated) may transmit the information
      on whether the extra region of the payload is distributed and the disposition reference
      of the extra region as LI signaling.

                                              19
[162]    FIGs. 17 to 19 are diagrams illustrating information on whether the extra region of
      the payload is distributed and a disposition reference of the extra region, according to
      an exemplary embodiment.
[163]    Referring to FIG. 17, in the case in which an extra region 310 is evenly distributed
      and inserted (320) into front ends of first GIs inserted into front ends of each of the
      OFDM symbols (in the case in which the extra region is inserted by the same method
      as the method described in FIG. 11), the GI inserter 720 may generate information on
      whether the extra region 310 is distributed in a form of an ECP flag 330.
[164]    For example, the ECP flag 330 has a value of "0" in the case in which the extra
      region 310 is not distributed, and has a value of "1" in the case in which the extra
      region 310 is distributed.
[165]    In addition, the GI inserter 720 may generate information 340 on a disposition
      reference of the extra region 310. The information 340 on the disposition reference
      may include information on a method in which the extra region 310 is divided and
      disposed, and information on a disposition position of the extra region 310. For
      example, information on whether the extra region 310 is evenly divided and is inserted
      into front ends of each of the OFDM symbols or inserted into rear ends of each of the
      OFDM symbols, information on which the extra region 310 is differently divided
      depending on a ratio between the FFT sizes and is inserted into front ends of each of
      the OFDM symbols or inserted into rear ends of each of the OFDM symbols, in
      formation on which the extra region 310 is inserted into a boundary region between the
      OFDM symbols having different FFT sizes, or the like, may be included in the in
      formation 340 on the disposition reference. In addition, the information on the preset
      reference described above (for example, the information on whether the remainder
      region 150 is smaller than and equal to or equal to and larger than 1/2 or 2/3 of the
      number of OFDM symbols) may also be included in the information 340 on the dis
      position reference.
[166]    In FIG. 17, the extra region 310 is evenly divided and inserted into the front ends of
      each of the OFDM symbols, which corresponds to "Evenly distribution(Forward)" 341.
      Therefore, the information 340 on the disposition reference may store a value of "011".
[167]    Referring to FIG. 18, the extra region 310 is inserted into a boundary between the
      OFDM symbol having the 32K FFT size and the OFDM symbol having the 16K FFT
      size without being distributed, which corresponds to "No Distribution(Center)" 351.
      Therefore, the information 350 on the disposition reference may store a value of "001".
[168]    In addition, referring to FIG. 19, the extra region 310 is evenly divided and inserted
      into the front ends of each of the OFDM symbols, which corresponds to "Evenly Dis
      tribution(Forward)" 361. Therefore, the information 360 on the disposition reference
      may store a value of "010".

                                            20
[169]   In addition, the information 360 on the disposition reference may include information
      370 on a disposition ratio. In the case of FIG. 19, the extra region 310 is evenly divided
      and inserted into the front ends of each of the OFDM symbols, which corresponds to
      "Ratio(Equally)". Therefore, the information 370 on the disposition ratio may store a
      value of "001".
[170]   FIG. 20 is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of a receiving apparatus
      according to an exemplary embodiment.
[171]   The receiving apparatus 2000 includes a receiver 2100, a bootstrap detector 2200,
      and a signal processor 2300.
[172]   The receiving apparatus 2000 may be implemented to receive data from the
      transmitting apparatus mapping and transmitting data included in an input stream on at
      least one signal processing path.
[173]   The receiver 2100 receives a stream including the frame including the bootstrap, the
      preamble, and the payload. In detail, the receiver 2100 may receive signaling in
      formation and the stream including the data mapped on at least one signal processing
      path. Here, the signaling information may include information about an input type of
      the input stream input to the receiving apparatus and information about a data type
      mapped on at least one signal processing path. Here, the information about the input
      type of the input stream may represent whether all of the signal processing paths in the
      frame are the same input type.
[174]   The signaling information may be a layer 1 (LI) signaling signal transmitting an LI
      signal for frame synchronization, and a preamble into which the LI signaling in
      formation is inserted may include an LI pre signaling area and an LI post signaling
      area. Further, the LI post signaling area includes a configurable field and a dynamic
      field.
[175]   The LI pre signaling area may include information for analyzing the LI post
      signaling and information about the entire system, and the LI pre signaling area may
      be implemented to have the same length at all times. Further, the LI post signaling
      area may include information about the respective PLP and information about the
      system, and in one superframe, the Li signaling areas included in respective frames
      have the same length, but contents included in the LI signaling areas may vary.
[176]   In addition, the bootstrap detector 2200 detects the bootstrap in the frame. In detail,
      the bootstrap detector 2200 may detect the bootstrap based on a correlation between an
      input signal and a pre-stored reference signal. In detail, the bootstrap detector 2200
      may decide whether the input signal and the pre-stored reference signal coincide with
      each other to detect the correlation between the input signal and the pre-stored
      reference signal. In addition, the bootstrap detector 2200 may detect the bootstrap by
      measuring a start point of the bootstrap based on the detected correlation.

                                            21
[177]   In addition, the signal processor 2300 signal-processes the preamble based on the
      detected bootstrap, and signal-processes the payload based on the signal-processed
      preamble.
[178]   Here, first GIs having a size corresponding to an FFT size of each of OFDM symbols
      configuring the payload may be inserted into front ends of each of the OFDM symbols,
      second GIs having a size corresponding to a quotient obtained by dividing an extra
      region of the payload calculated based on the FFT size of the OFDM symbols con
      figuring the payload, the number of OFDM symbols, and the size of the first GIs by the
      number of OFDM symbols may be inserted into front ends of each of the first GIs, and
      a cyclic postfix (CP) having a size corresponding to the remainder remaining after
      dividing the extra region of the payload by the number of OFDM symbols may be
      inserted into a rear end of a final OFDM symbol configuring the payload.
[179]   In addition, the signal processor 2300 may signal-process the payload based on in
      formation on whether the extra region of the payload is distributed and a disposition
      reference of the extra region, included in the bootstrap and the preamble. Here, the in
      formation whether the extra region of the payload is distributed and the disposition
      reference of the extra region may be included as LI signaling in the bootstrap and the
      preamble.
[180]   In detail, the signal processor 2300 may effectively remove ISI based on the first GIs
      and the second GIs inserted into each of the OFDM symbols. In addition, the signal
      processor 2300 may perform channel estimation based on the remainder region
      remaining after distributing the extra region disposed at the end of the frame.
[181]   In addition, in the case in which OFDM symbols having different FFT sizes are
      present in one frame, the signal processor 2300 performs channel estimation based on
      an extra region disposed in a boundary between the OFDM symbols having the
      different FFT sizes, thereby making it possible to solve a channel estimation problem
      occurring when moving to regions having different FFT sizes.
[182]   FIG. 21 is a block diagram provided to explain in detail a signal processor according
      to an exemplary embodiment.
[183]   Referring to FIG. 21, the signal processor 2300 includes a demodulator 2310, a
      decoder 2320 and a stream generator 2330.
[184]   The demodulator 2310 performs demodulation according to OFDM parameters from
      the received RF signals, performs sync-detection, and recognizes whether a currently
      received frame includes necessary service data when the sync is detected from
      signaling information stored in a sync area. For example, the demodulator 2310 may
      recognize whether a mobile frame is received or a fixed frame is received.
[185]   In this case, if OFDM parameters are not previously determined regarding a signaling
      area and a data area, the demodulator 2310 may perform demodulation by obtaining

                                             22
      OFDM parameters regarding the signaling area and the data area stored in the sync
      area, and obtaining information about OFDM parameters regarding the signaling area
      and the data area which are disposed right after the sync area.
[186]   The decoder 2320 performs decoding of necessary data. In this case, the decoder
      2320 may perform decoding by obtaining parameters of an FEC method and a
      modulating method regarding the data stored in each data area based on the signaling
      information. Further, the decoder 2320 may calculate positions of necessary data based
      on the data information included in a configurable field and a dynamic field. Thus, it
      may calculate which positions of the frame a requested PLP is transmitted.
[187]   The stream generator 2330 may generate data to be served by processing a baseband
      packet input from the decoder 2320.
[188]   For example, the stream generator 2330 may generate an ALP packet from the
      baseband packet in which errors are corrected based on an ISSY mode, buffer size
      (BUFS), time to output (TTO) values and input stream clock reference (ISCR) values.
[189]   Specifically, the stream generator 2330 may include de-jitter buffers. The de-jitter
      buffers may regenerate correct timing to restore an output stream based on the ISSY
      mode, BUFS, TTO values and ISCR values. Thereby, a delay for sync between a
      plurality of PLPs can be compensated.
[190]   The detailed components (the demodulator 2310, the decoder 2320, and the stream
      generator 2330) included in the signal processor 2300 described above may signal
      process the preamble based on the detected bootstrap, and signal-process the payload
      based on the signal-processed preamble.
[191]   In addition, the detailed components (the demodulator 2310, the decoder 2320, and
      the stream generator 2330) included in the signal processor 2300 may effectively
      remove the ISI based on the first GIs and the second GIs inserted into the payload, and
      perform the channel estimation based on the CP inserted into the rear end of the final
      OFDM symbol.
[192]   FIG. 22 is a block diagram of a receiving apparatus according to an exemplary em
      bodiment.
[193]   Referring to FIG. 22, the receiving apparatus 4400 may include a controller 4410, an
      RF receiver 4420, a demodulator 4430, and a service player 4440.
[194]   The controller 4410 determines an RF channel and a PLP in which a selected service
      is transmitted. At this process, the RF channel may be defined by a center frequency
      and a bandwidth, and the PLP may be defined by a PLP identifier (ID). Certain
      services may be transmitted through more than one PLP belonging to more than one
      RF channel per component constituting services. However, it is assumed in the
      following descriptions that all data required for playing one service are transmitted
      through one PLP with one RF channel for convenient explanation. Thus, services are

                                             23
      provided with a unique data obtaining path to play services, and the data obtaining path
      is specified by an RF channel and a PLP.
[195]   The RF receiver 4420 extracts RF signals from a selected RF channel by the
      controller 4410, and delivers OFDM symbols, extracted by performing signal
      processing of the RF signals, to the demodulator 4430. The signal processing may
      include synchronization, channel estimation and equalization. Information required for
      the signal processing is predetermined between a transmitting apparatus and the
      receiving apparatuses or transmitted to the receiving apparatus in a predetermined
      OFDM symbols among the OFDM symbols.
[196]   The demodulator 4430 extracts a user packet by performing signal processing of the
      OFDM symbols, and delivers to the service player 4440. The service player 4440 plays
      and outputs the service selected by a user with the user packet. A format of the user
      packet may be different according to implementing services. For example, a TS packet
      or an IPv4 packet may be the user packet.
[197]   FIG. 23 is a block diagram describing the demodulator of FIG. 27 according to an
      exemplary embodiment.
[198]   Referring to FIG. 23, the demodulator 4430 may include a frame demapper 4431, a
      BICM decoder 4432 for LI signaling, a controller 4433, a BICM decoder 4434, and an
      output processor 4435.
[199]   The frame demapper 4431 selects OFDM cells constituting FEC blocks belonging to
      a selected PLP from a frame constituted with OFDM symbols based on controlling in
      formation delivered from the controller 4433, and delivers to the decoder 4434.
      Further, the frame demapper 4431 selects OFDM cells corresponding to more than one
      FEC block included in the LI signaling, and delivers to BICM decoder 4432 for the LI
      signaling.
[200]   The BICM decoder 4432 for the LI signaling signal-processes the OFDM cells cor
      responding to the FEC blocks belonging to the LI signaling, extracts LI signaling bits,
      and delivers to the controller 4433. In this case, the signal processing may include ex
      tracting log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values for decoding low density parity check
      (LDPC) codes in OFDM cells, and decoding the LDPC codes by using the extracted
      LLR values.
[201]   The controller 4433 extracts an LI signaling table from the LI signaling bits, and
      controls operations of the frame demapper 4431, the BICM decoder 4434, and the
      output processor 4435 by using values of the LI signaling table. FIG. 37 illustrates that
      the BICM decoder 4432 for the LI signaling does not use controlling information of
      the controller 4433 for convenient explanation. However, if the LI signaling includes a
      layer structure similar to the LI pre-signaling and the LI post-signaling described
      above, the BICM decoder 4432 for the LI signaling may be constituted with more than

                                             24
      one BICM decoding block, and operations of the BICM decoding blocks and the frame
      demapper 4431 may be controlled based on upper-layer LI signaling information, as
      clearly understood in the above description.
[202]   The BICM decoder 4434 signal-processes the OFDM cells constituting FEC blocks
      belonging to the selected PLP, extracts baseband packets, and delivers the baseband
      packets to the output processor 4435. The signal processing may include extracting
      LLR values for coding and decoding LDPC codes in OFDM cells, and decoding the
      LDPC codes by using the extracted LLR values. These two operations may be
      performed based on the controlling information delivered from the controller 4433.
[203]   The output processor 4435 signal-processes the baseband packets, extracts a user
      packet, and delivers the extracted user packet to the service player. In this case, the
      signal processing may be performed on the controlling information delivered from the
      controller 4433.
[204]   According to an exemplary embodiment, the output processor 1235 may include an
      ALP packet processor (not illustrated) which extracts an ALP packet from a baseband
      packet.
[205]   FIG. 24 is a flowchart provided to briefly explain an operation of a receiving
      apparatus from a time point when a user selects a service to a time point when the
      selected service is played.
[206]   It is assumed that service information about all the services that can be selected at an
      initial scan process of S4600 is obtained prior to a service select process at S4610. The
      service information may include information about an RF channel and a PLP which
      transmits data required for playing a specific service in a current broadcasting system.
      One example of the service information may be Program-Specific Information/Service
      Information (PSI/SI) of an MPEG-2 TS, which may be usually obtained through L2
      signaling and an upper layer signaling.
[207]   When a user selects a service at S4610, the receiving apparatus modifies a frequency
      transmitting the selected service at S4620, and performs extracting RF signals at
      S4630. While performing S4620 modifying the frequency transmitting the selected
      service, the service information may be used.
[208]   When the RF signals are extracted, the receiver performs S4640 extracting LI
      signaling from the extracted RF signals. The receiving apparatus selects the PLP
      transmitting the selected service by using the extracted LI signaling at S4650, and
      extracts baseband packets from the selected PLP at S4660. At S4650 selecting the PLP
      transmitting the selected service, the service information may be used.
[209]   Further, S4660 extracting the baseband packets may include selecting OFDM cells
      belonging to the PLP by demapping a transmission frame, extracting LLR values for
