                                                        ELECTRICAL SUPPLY SYSTEM
[0001] This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013350321, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Background of the Invention
[0002] The present invention relates to an electrical supply system for use in an electrical
supply, and in particular, to an electrical supply system including fault detection.
Description of the Prior Art
[0003] The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from
it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or
admission or any form of suggestion that the prior publication (or information derived from it) or
known matter forms part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which
this specification relates.
[0004] Electrical supply systems are known, and in particular supply systems which use DC-DC
voltage converters exist. However, typically these systems suffer from a number of drawbacks,
including the difficulty in detecting and isolating faults such as arc faults, or open circuit faults,
or the like.
[0005] In one particular application, photovoltaic (PV) systems, the consequence of an arcing
fault in a roof-mounted PV array presents a serious and potentially life threatening hazard. The
risk of an arcing fault is mitigated by various methods of arc detection applied to the PV array
and associated wiring.
[0006] However, one of the difficulties with these conventional circuit breakers in PV systems is
that the PV cell is not a voltage source; it is a very weak current source. Under these conditions
it is difficult for typical magnetic arc detection to distinguish a fault current from normal load
currents. This means that magnetic arc blow out techniques do not work effectively and that
other techniques need be used to extinguish the arc. DC breakers are also polarity sensitive and
may catch fire if connected in the reverse polarity or if there is a reverse power fault where the
polarity of the dc current is reversed by an arcing fault.

including a DC bus connected to the output of a voltage converter by an output diode and a
controller, wherein in use the controller at least one of:
                 a) attempting to detect a shunt arc by:

Brief Description of the Drawings
[0039] An example of the present invention will now be described with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:
[0040] Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a first example of an electrical supply system;
[0041] Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a second example of an electrical supply system;
[0042] Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of a third example of an electrical supply system; and,

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0044] An example of an electrical supply system 100 will now be described with reference to
Figure 1.
[0045] In this example, the electrical supply system 100 includes a voltage converter 110
including a voltage converter input 110.1 electrically coupled to a supply S for receiving a
supply signal, and a voltage converter output 110.2 for supplying an output signal, the output
signal having a output voltage Vo different to a supply voltage Vs of the supply signal.
[0046] The electrical supply system 100 also includes a diode 120 including a diode input 120.1
electrically coupled to the voltage converter output 110.2, and a bus 130 electrically coupled to a
diode output 120.2 and one or more of a load L and a store T. In this example, both the load L
and the store T are shown, however this is not essential and either or both of the load L and the
store T may be electrically coupled to the bus 130.
[0047] The electrical supply system 100 further includes a voltage sensor 140 for detecting the
output voltage Vo, and a current sensor 160 for detecting a diode input current IDI. An optional
second voltage sensor 150 can be provided for detecting a bus voltage VB, although alternatively
the bus voltage VB could be from the output voltage Vo, for example based on the voltage drop
that would occur across the diode 120. An electronic processing device 170 is coupled to the

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16482377 _.doc-16/02/2018
                                                              -8
voltage sensor 140 and current sensor 140, 160 and optionally a second voltage sensor 150, if
this is included. This allows the electronic process device 170 to monitor the diode input current
IDI, and the output voltage Vo , as well as derive or monitor the bus voltage VB and, detecting a
fault in the electrical supply system based on the diode input current IDI, and depending on the
output and bus voltages Vo , VB.
[0048] According to the above described arrangement, the electrical supply system 100 includes
an electronic processing device 170 for monitoring current and voltages, IDI, Vo, VB, and
detecting one or more faults in the electrical supply system 100. In particular, this arrangement
provides for increased safety over previous systems, as faults such as arcing faults, component
faults, open or short circuit faults, and the like, can be detected, and optionally isolated, thus
preventing serious injury or death to people or serious faults or breakage to any peripheral
equipment.
[0049] In addition, the electrical supply system 100 in this example enables faults to be detected
when the supply S includes a weak current source. This is particularly useful in PV systems
where a fault can represent a serious and potentially life threatening hazard.                    However, this
particular application is not essential, and the electrical supply system 100 may be used with any
type of supply S, capable of supplying a DC signal.
[0050] Furthermore, the voltage converter 110 can act to provide electrical isolation of the
supply S from the bus 130, and hence the load L or battery T.                    In this regard, and as will be
explained in more detail below, in one example the voltage converter 110 includes a switching
circuit coupled to a transformer, with the switching circuit operating to selectively apply the DC
supply current to the transformer, to thereby generate the output signal.                   In this instance, by
deactivating the switching, so that either no current, or only a DC current is applied to the
transformer, this will ensure that no output signal is generated, thereby isolating supply S from
the bus 130.                     This therefore provides a straightforward and reliable mechanism to provide
isolation in the event that a fault occurs.
[0051] A number of further features will now be described.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16482377 _.doc-16/02/2018
                                                                       -9
[0052] In one example, the electronic processing device 170 may include any suitable device,
including a processing system. Accordingly, the processing system can include any suitable
form of electronic processing system or device that is capable of receiving and interpreting
signals from the voltage and/or current sensors 140, 150, 160.
[0053] In one example, the processing system includes a processor, a memory, an input/output
(1/0) device, such as a keyboard and display, and an external interface coupled together via a
processing system bus. It will be appreciated that the I/O device may further include an input,
such as a keyboard, keypad, touch screen, button, switch, or the like which thereby allowing a
user to input data, however this is not essential. The external interface is used for coupling the
processing system to peripheral devices, such the first voltage, second voltage and current
sensors 140, 150, 160, as well as to devices, such as communications networks, databases, other
storage devices, or the like. In addition, the external interface may be coupled to the voltage
converter 110, supply S, or the like, however this is not essential, and in any event will be
discussed in further detail below.                              It will also be appreciated that additional hardware
components, may be incorporated into the processing system, depending on the particular
implementation.
[0054] In use, the processor executes instructions in the form of applications software stored in
the memory to allow signals from the sensors 140, 150, 160 to be interpreted and used, for in
detecting a fault.                             Accordingly, for the purposes of the following description, it will be
appreciated that actions performed by the processing system are typically performed by the
processor under control of instructions stored in the memory, and this will not therefore be
described in further detail below.
[0055] Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the processing system may be formed from any
suitably programmed processing system. Typically however, the electronic processing device
would be in the form of a microprocessor, microchip processor, logic gate configuration,
firmware optionally associated with implementing logic such as an FPGA (Field Programmable
Gate Array), an EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), or any other electronic
device, system or arrangement capable of interacting with the sensors 140, 150, 160.

[0056] The supply S in this example may include any suitable DC supply, for example a PV cell,
a current supply, a voltage supply, a DC power supply, battery, generator, alternator, or the like.
In addition, the voltage converter 110 may also include any suitable converter, including a DC
DC converter, or the like.
[0057] Furthermore, the voltage converter 110 may include isolation, for example, galvanic
isolation in which functional sections of the voltage converter 110 are electrically isolated, and
instead energy is exchanged using inductance, capacitance, or the like.
[0058] The diode 120 may include any suitable device or component in which current is
substantially allowed to flow from the diode input 120.1 to the diode output 120.2, however is
substantially prevented from flowing from the diode output 120.2 to the diode input 120.1, for
example a semiconductor diode, vacuum tube diode, or the like.
[0059] In this example, the voltage sensor 140, the optional second voltage sensor 150, and
current sensor 160 may include any suitable sensor. In this regard, the first voltage sensor and
optional second voltage sensor 140, 150 may include similar or different respective sensors,
including a voltmeter, multimeter, vacuum tube voltmeter (VTVM), field effect transistor
voltmeter (FET-VM), or the like. The current sensor 160 may include a multimeter, ammeter,
picoammeter, or the like.
[0060] The load L and/or store T may also include any suitable component(s), for example, the
store T may include a battery for storing the power collected from the bus 130 for use at another
time. Alternatively, the load L may include any number of various electronic and electrical
devices, and can include an inverter for converting DC power to an AC supply, for example to
replace mains electricity within a building or the like. However, this feature is not essential, and
instead the electric supply system 100 may include any suitable load L and/or store T.
[0061] In one example, the electronic processing device 170 uses the voltage converter 110 for
isolating the supply S from the bus 130 in response to detection of a fault. This may be achieved
in any suitable manner, for example, by deactivating the voltage converter 110, creating an open
circuit at the voltage converter input or output 110.1, 110.2, or diode input or output 120.1,
120.2, or the like. However this feature is not essential, and instead the electronic processing

                                                             - 11
device 170 may provide an indication of the fault to a user or operator via a communications
system, keyboard, or any suitably output, in order that the user may manually isolate the supply
S, or take other appropriate action.
[0062] In addition, after isolation the electronic processing device 170 may take any appropriate
action, for example, reactivating the voltage converter 110 after a predefined delay, or upon
determination of a user input, or the like.
[0063] In order to detect the faults, the electronic processing device 170 is typically adapted to
cause certain operating conditions to arise, then monitor the response of the system to those
conditions and use this information to detect faults.
[0064] For example, the electronic processing device 170 can cause the output voltage Vo to be
lower than the bus voltage VB, and then monitor the diode input current IDI, and detecting a fault
depending on the diode input current. In particular, when the output voltage Vo is lower that the
bus voltage VB the diode input current IDI should be substantially zero, or near zero. However, if
the diode input current IDI is not substantially zero, this indicates a fault such as a short circuit or
a shunt arcing fault has occurred, for example at a point after the voltage converter output 110.2.
[0065] The output voltage Vo can be lowered below the bus voltage VB, typically known as a
Reduced Voltage Zero power state, in any suitable manner, such as causing the voltage converter
to increase the output current Vo. In addition, the output voltage Vo may remain lower than the
bus voltage VB for any suitable amount of time, for example, typically between 1 ms and 100 ms,
more typically 5 ms and 50 ms, and more typically 1Oims. In addition, the output voltage Vo may
be any suitable lower voltage relative to the bus voltage VB, for example, typically 1% to 50%
lower than the bus voltage VB, more typically 10% to 30% lower, and more typically 20% lower.
[0066] Additionally or alternatively, the electronic processing device 170 can cause the output
voltage Vo to be lower than the bus voltage VB, before causing the output voltage Vo to increase
over a predefined time until the output voltage Vo is greater than the bus voltage VB. During this
process, the electronic processing device 170 monitors changes in the diode input current IDI and,
detects a fault depending on the change in diode input current IDI-.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16482377 doc-16/02/2018
                                                           - 12
[0067] In this example, the diode input current IDI should increase at a rate substantially
corresponding to the rate of change of the output signal Vo after the output signal Vo becomes
higher than the bus voltage VB. However, if this does not occur, this indicates that a series arc or
other similar fault may be present, for example at a point after the voltage converter output
110.2.
[0068] Again the electronic processing device 170 may cause the output voltage Vo to be lower
than the bus voltage VB in any suitable manner, as described above, and in addition may cause
the output voltage Vo to increase over a predefined time in a similar manner, for example by
causing the voltage converter to increase the output current Vo. In addition, the output voltage
Vo may be any suitable higher voltage relative to the bus voltage VB at the end of the predefined
time, for example, typically 1% to 10% higher than the bus voltage VB, more typically 2% to 7%
higher, and more typically 5% higher.
[0069] In a further example, the electronic processing device 170 causes the output voltage Vo to
be higher than the bus voltage VB, monitors the diode input current IDI and detects a fault
depending on the diode input current IDI. In the event that the monitored diode input current IDI
is substantially zero, this indicates a fault in the diode or an open circuit, for example at a
particular location such as after the voltage converter output 110.2. As described above, the
output voltage Vo may be caused to be higher than the bus voltage VB in any suitable manner.
[0070] It will be appreciated that this therefore provides three different mechanisms for detecting
different faults within the electrical supply system, and that typically these methods would be
repeatedly performed in sequence at a given frequency to allow continuous monitoring of the
system, and thereby ensure the system is isolated as rapidly as possible in the event that a fault
occurs.
[0071] For example, the fault detection process can be performed in response to user input, or
automatically or semi-automatically, for example periodically.        In this regard, periodic fault
detection may occur at any suitable period, and typically every 50 ms to 2 s, more typically 100
ms to 15OOms, and more typically 200ms to 1OOOms. However, this feature is not essential.

[0072] A second example electrical supply system 200 is shown in Figure 2. Features similar to
those of the example described above have been assigned correspondingly similar reference
numerals.
[0073] In this example, the electrical supply system 200 includes a voltage converter 210
including a voltage converter input 210.1 electrically coupled to a supply S2 , and a voltage
converter output 210.2, a diode 220 including a diode input 220.1 electrically coupled to the
voltage converter output 210.2, and a bus 230. The electrical supply system 200 further includes
a first voltage sensor 240, a second voltage sensor 250, and a current sensor 260 for detecting a
diode input current ID2. An electronic processing device 270 is coupled to the first voltage,
second voltage and current sensors 240, 250, 260 for monitoring the diode input current ID12,
output and bus voltages V0 2                                 , VB2 and, detecting a fault in the electrical supply system. It will
therefore be appreciated that these features are largely similar to those described above with
respect to Figure 1, however further specific features will now be described.
[0074] In this example, the voltage converter 210 includes galvanic isolation, as discussed
above. In addition, the voltage converter 210 includes a rectifier prior to the voltage converter
output 210.2, and this will be discussed in more detail below.
[0075] A third example electrical supply system 300 is shown in Figure 3. Features similar to
those of the example described above have been assigned correspondingly similar reference
numerals.
[0076] In this example, the electrical supply system 300 includes three voltage converters 311,
312, 313 including respective voltage converter inputs 311.1, 312.1, 313.1 electrically coupled to
three supplies S3.1 , S3 .2 , S3.3 , respectively, and three respective voltage converter outputs 311.2,
312.2, 313.2, three diodes 321, 322, 323 including three respective diode inputs 321.1, 322.1,
323.1 electrically coupled to the voltage converter outputs 311.2, 312.2, 313.2, and a bus 330.
The electrical supply system 300 further includes three first voltage sensors 341, 342, 343, a
second voltage sensor 350, and three current sensors 361, 362, 363 for detecting respective diode
input currents ID3.1, ID13.2, ID13.3. An electronic processing device 370 is coupled to the first
voltage, second voltage and current sensors 341, 342, 343, 350, 361, 362, 363 for monitoring the
diode input currents ID3.1, ID13.2, ID13.3, output and bus voltages V0 3. 1, V 0 3.2 , V0 3.3 , VB3 and,

detecting one or more faults in the electrical supply system 300. It will therefore be appreciated
that these features are largely similar to those described above with respect to Figure 1, however
further specific features will now be described.
[0077] In this example, the system includes three DC/DC voltage converters, 311, 312, 313,
each of which is coupled to a respective one of three supplies S3.1, S3.2, S33, with these being
coupled in parallel to the bus 330, allowing power from multiple supplies to be utilised. It will
be appreciated from this that any number of supplies and voltage converters may be provided in
this arrangement and that the use of three in Figure 3 is for the purpose of illustration only.
[0078]             In this example, the supplies S3 1, S3.2, S3 .3 include PV cells, and in this regard the supply
voltages Vss. 1 , Vss. 2 , Vs3.3 are typically less than 80 Volts DC. However, it will be appreciated
that any DC supply could be used and that as a result, different supply voltages may be used.
The voltage converter includes galvanic isolation, and provides output voltages V0 3 .1 , V0 3.2 , V03 .3
greater than +400 Volts DC. This allows for a bus voltage VB3 of greater than +400 Volts DC,
which can be beneficial for energy storage, as compared to lower voltage systems. In particular,
this allows a high voltage battery B to be coupled to the bus 330, which in use stores power for
use at a different time. For example, the battery B may store the power generated during the day
while the sun is incident on the PV cells included in the supplies S3.1, S3.2, S3.3                   for use at a
different time when the sun is no longer incident on the PV cells, such as at night, or during
periods of rain or cloud.
[0079] In addition, the inverter I allows the DC on the bus 330 to be converted to AC for use in a
power network, such as a mains power grid, or household power network, or the like.
[0080] A fourth example electrical supply system 400 is shown in Figure 4. Features similar to
those of the example described above have been assigned correspondingly similar reference
numerals.
[0081] In this example, the electrical supply system 400 includes a voltage converter 410
including a voltage converter input 410.1 electrically coupled to a supply S 4 , and a voltage
converter output 410.2, a diode 420 including a diode input 420.1 electrically coupled to the
voltage converter output 410.2, and a bus 430. The electrical supply system 400 further includes

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16482377 _.doc-16/02/2018
                                                                      - 15
a first voltage sensor 440, a second voltage sensor 450, and a current sensor 460 for detecting a
diode input current ID4. An electronic processing device 470 is coupled to the first voltage,
optional second voltage and current sensors 440, 450, 460 for monitoring the diode input current
ID2,        output and bus voltages Vo 441 , VB4 and, detecting a fault in the electrical supply system. It
will therefore be appreciated that these features are largely similar to those described above with
respect to Figure 1, however further specific features will now be described.
[0082] In this example, the voltage converter 410 includes a switching circuit formed from a
plurality of switches                           Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, a transformer TR, and a controller for controlling the
switches            Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 to thereby selectively apply the supply signal to a transformer input to
thereby generate the output signal at a transformer output.
[0083] In one example, the switches                           Q1, Q2,  Q3, Q4 include  transistors, and in particular metal
oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), however this is not essential, and any
switch or transistor may be used, including junction field effect transistors (JFETs), simple
switches, or the like.
[0084] The controller causes the switches                         Q1,  Q2, Q3, Q4 to toggle to thereby periodically reverse
the polarity of the supply signal applied to the transformer TR input. The frequency at which this
is performed can be used to control the output voltage Vo 4+1.                           In addition, the voltage converter
410 includes a rectifier D 1, D 2, D3 , D 4 , for coupling the transformer TR to the voltage converter
output 410.2, to thereby generate a DC output signal, as well as to ensure any ripples or
anomalies in the signal from the output of the transformer TR are substantially removed, such
that the output voltage Vo 441 is rectified. Similarly, by apply either a switched DC signal or no
signal to the transformer, this will prevent an output signal being generated, which will in turn
isolate the power supply S from the bus 130.
[0085] In this example, the controller is the electronic processing device, however it will be
appreciated that this is not essential, and instead the controller may be separate firmware
implemented using appropriate hardware, and which is coupled to, or included in the electronic
processing device 470. In this regard, the electronic processing device 470 is able to control the
voltage converter 410, for example in order to isolate the supply S 4 in the event of a fault is
detected. In addition, the electronic processing device 470 may control the power output of the

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16482377 _.doc-16/02/2018
                                                             - 16
voltage converter. For example, if the supply S4 includes a PV cell, it may be desirable to control
the voltage controller in order to achieve maximum power point tracking (MPPT).
[0086] Accordingly, the above described arrangements can be used in arc detection and circuit
interruption for the high voltage side of a galvanically isolated DC/DC converter that does not
depend upon a mechanical switch to interrupt the circuit. This arrangement utilises a DC/DC
converter where the DC power to be transmitted is converted to high frequency alternating
current (AC) and then applied to the primary of a transformer including a suitable primary to
secondary ratio. The secondary side is then rectified and the power transmitted to the load/s.
[0087] The galvanically isolated DC/DC converter is used to detect and isolate DC faults in the
high voltage side of the arrangement of Figure 2, and in particular, the DC/DC converter
operational capabilities are used to test the high voltage circuit for DC arc faults, as well as open
circuit, short circuit wiring and coupling diode failures.
[0088] The system provides a current interruption method using the DC/DC converter in Figure
4, which includes four MOSFET switches on the input (Qi-Q4) that are protected against
reverse polarity connection by a fifth MOSFET Q5 and its associated components.             The fifth
MOSFET Q5 will only conduct when the gate is enhanced via the resistor and the clamping
diode, thereby protecting the input against reverse polarity. The same circuit topology may be
used to protect the output against a reverse polarity protection if desired.      Thus, the DC/DC
converter will not work at all if the input polarity is reversed, and hence the converter can be
protected against inadvertent reverse polarity connection on either the input or the output.
[0089] The DC converter can provide an ideal circuit breaker, if it is shut down (ie if the four
MOSFETs are not switched) no current can flow from the output to the input and as it is
inherently uni-directional and the input and output are galvanically isolated.
[0090] Detection of faults is performed by selectively controlling the DC converter, and hence
the converter output states, and monitoring the effect on current flow in the high voltage side.
[0091] To achieve this, controller in the converter periodically reduces (say every 200ms - 1000
ms) the output voltage to less than the DC bus voltage (say-20%) for about 10 ms. This reduction
is called the Reduced Voltage Zero power state. If the current goes to near zero then the bus

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16482377 _.doc-16/02/2018
                                                             - 17
diode is operational and there is no short circuit or shunt arcing fault. However, if the current
does not go to zero there is a short circuit or a shunt arcing fault on the DC HV link, in which
case the converter is shut down and the DC fault is isolated and a fault indicated on DC/DC
converter controller.
[0092] To test for a series arc the DC/DC converter power is reduced and the voltage lifted from
the Reduced Voltage Zero power state - at a controlled ramp rate back to 5% above the DC bus
voltage - if the current does not exactly track this ramp rate it means that there is a series arc. As
the converter output voltage attempts to rise above the DC bus c voltage the current should
increase unless the voltage is impressed across the series arc. In the event that the current during
ramp up does not match the voltage ramp rate it can be safely assumed that there is a series arc
present, in which case the converter is shut down and the DC fault isolated and fault indicated on
DC/DC converter controller.
[0093] In the event that the output current falls to zero with voltage input greater than zero then
the converter is shut down and the open circuit fault isolated and fault indicated on DC/DC
converter.
[0094] Figure 3 is a single line diagram of a typical system. It should be noted that the DC bus
isolation diodes protect against reverse current flow from the DC bus into an arcing or short
circuit fault.
[0095] It will be appreciated that an electrical supply system 100, 200, 300, 400, and
corresponding method 500, with the above described examples, provides for increased safety,
and accuracy in fault detection.
[0096] Accordingly, the above described systems and processes allow for fault detection and
absolute electrical isolation in an electrical supply system.
[0097] In one example, the electrical supply system includes a DC bus connected to the output
of one or more voltage converters by an output diode, with operation of the system being
controlled by a controller.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\16482377 _.doc-16/02/2018

[0098] The DC bus is by definition a voltage source, so that if current flows from the converter
to the DC bus, when the converter output voltage is below the DC bus voltage, there must be a
shunt path and hence a fault.
[0099] To detect a shunt arc fault:
                e       the controller reduces the voltage converter output voltage to a preset voltage
                        (typically at least 2 V) below the DC bus voltage on the other side of the diode;
                e       the controller measures the change of current;
                e       if the current drops to zero there is no shunt arcing fault;
                e       if current continues to flow there is a shunt arc present.
[0100] If current flows and a shunt arc fault is detected the converter shuts down. An optional
notification of this can be provided. It should be noted that a shunt arc is the most probable and
dangerous arc.
[0101] On the other hand, if it is possible to raise the converter output voltage above the diode
forward voltage plus the DC bus voltage, there must be an increase in the impedance between
the converter output and the DC bus, as seen by the converter and again a fault exists.
[0102] To detect a series arc fault:
                e       the controller attempts increase the output voltage of the converter to a preset voltage
                        (typically at least 3 V) above the DC bus voltage on the other side of the diode;
                e       the controller measures the change of current and the voltage;
                e       if the voltage rises above the DC bus voltage and diode drop by a threshold amount
                        (say 1.5V) there is high probability of a series arcing fault.
[0103] If the converter output voltage rises above the DC bus voltage and diode drop by the
threshold amount a series arc fault is detected the converter shuts down. An optional notification
of this can be provided.
[0104] It will be noted that a shut down on the DC/DC converter can be totally and absolutely
guaranteed to interrupt the current under all circumstances as the transformer is an isolated
DC/DC converter and as such relies upon the generation of a high frequency waveform to

transfer energy from the primary winding to the secondary winding through the coupling
magnetic field. If the high frequency waveform generator is shut down, energy transfer must
cease. The isolation potential between the two transformer windings is at least 2.5 kV.
