[0003] AU2004240161 describes a wave-generating apparatus including a pool having a
deeper area surrounding a substantially central area; a pool edge bounding the pool; a body
having a wave-generating shaped surface located within the pool adjacent the pool edge and
moveable along the pool edge relative thereto to generate a wave in the water in the pool, and
impeller means generating a current in the water in a direction opposite to the direction of
movement of the body.
[0004] AU2009316496 describes a surface gravity wave generator and wave pool. The wave
pool is formed of opposing side walls and a centre channel of water. The channel includes a
bottom contour with a depth that runs from a deep end to a shoal or beach. One or more
three-dimensional foils are vertically arranged along at least one side wall and moved against
the water in the channel. Each foil has a curvilinear cross-sectional geometry that defines a
leading surface that is adapted to generate a wave in water moving past the leading surface,
and a trailing surface configured for flow recovery to avoid separation of the flow of water in
the wave and to mitigate drag from the foil from the water moving past the leading surface.
[0005] However, these arrangements suffer from a number of issues, including a lack of
wave configurability and a lack of a viable propulsion system for moving the wave
generating body.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
[0045] An example of a surfing wave pool system will now be described with reference to
Figures 1A and 1B.
[0046] In this example, the pool system 100 includes a pool 110 having a side wall 111
defining a first pool edge and a bottom 112 that extends away from the side wall towards a
second pool edge 113. A variety of different pool shapes could be used, with the first and
second edges being inner and outer edges, or vice versa.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 6071666 _.docx-27/11/2017
                                                              -6
[0047] At least one rail 121 traverses the pool proximate the first side wall 111. In one
example, spaced apart parallel rails are provided although this is not essential and a single
monorail system could alternatively be used.
[0048] A carriage 130 is movably mounted to the rail, typically using one or more sets of
wheels that engage the rail(s). The carriage 130 includes a hull 132 that is at least partially
submerged in water within the pool.
[0049] The pool system further includes a cable drive system 140, including a cable 142,
which is coupled to the carriage 130, allowing the cable to be used to urge the carriage along
the rail(s). This in turn drives the hull through the water so as to generate a wave in the
surfing wave pool.
[0050] The above described arrangement provides a number of benefits. For example, the use
of a cable drive system enables the hull to be easily drawn through the water without
requiring driver mechanisms to be mounted on the carriage, for example to drive the carriage
along the rail.                This simplifies construction of the carriage, and avoids the need for the
carriage to support heavy drive systems. Despite this, the cable drive system can allow
significant driving power to be employed, which in turn allows for the creation of large
waves, as well as allowing multiple carriages to be used, enabling multiple waves to be
created. Additionally, the use of the rails ensures that the carriages travel along a defined path
at a set height relative to the pool, which in turn ensures consistency of the waves.
[0051] Accordingly, the above described configuration allows for the creation of consistent
large waves to be generated.
[0052] A number of further features will now be described.
[0053] Whilst a number of different pool configurations can be utilised, in one preferred
example, the pool has a generally race track shape, including two intermediate linear sections
connected via 1800 curved end portions. The wave pool is typically configured with the first
wall 111 provided at a centre of the pool, to thereby define an island 114, allowing the cable

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 6071666 _.docx-27/11/2017
                                                              -7
drive system and associated supporting equipment to be mounted on the island 114, whilst
providing unobstructed access to the wave pool via the shallower second pool edge.
[0054] The pool bottom 112 typically defines a deep channel 112.1, terminating in a slope
112.2 that angled at about 45' to about half the water depth.           The bottom then rises
progressively towards the second outer edge 113, to define a beach 112.3, which can
facilitate with the breaking of the wave, whilst a gutter 113.1 may be provided along the
outer edge to absorb any residual wave energy.
[0055] This particular arrangement helps provide a safe learning environment with repeatable
wave conditions and long ride lengths. In this regard, the length of a smooth, unbroken wave
crest is defined as a usable "wall" width. A wide steep wall provides surfers sufficient
vertical and lateral space to perform manoeuvres. As waves commence breaking when the
water depth is less than 1.13 times the wave height, the waves is prevented from breaking by
keeping the water depth greater than 1.13 times the maximum wave height in the channel
112.1 and at the start of the sloped region 112.2, whilst the sloped region 112.2 can lower the
water depth to less than 1.13 times the wave height at the start of the beach 112.2, forcing
waves to break on the beach.
[0056] Thus, the deep water in the channel 112.1, under the hull 132, allows the hull 132 to
generate large, smooth, unbroken waves. The deep water in the channel 112.1, which has a
water depth greater than 1.13 times the maximum wave height, prevents wave breaking until
it reaches the beach 112.3, and provides a wide wall for manoeuvres.           The deep water
between the hull 132 and beach 112.2 also resists water disturbance, decreasing the time for
the waves to dissipate. By lowering the water depth at the beach 112.2 to less than 1.13
times the wave height at the beach, the waves are forced to break on the beach. In this regard,
the slope 112.2 at the start of the beach 112.3 mimics the bottom shape of the ocean and
assists in formation of a round "barrel" shaped wave for expert surfers. The easing slope
further up the beach 112.3 allows smaller waves to break as intermediate to beginner waves,
with smaller waves generated by moving the hull at slower speeds through the pool. The
shallow beach 112.3 also helps dissipate the broken wave, whilst the edge gutter 113.1
captures the last of the broken wave, preventing it from rebounding back across the pool.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 6071666 _.docx-27/11/2017
                                                              -8
[0057] In one example, two spaced parallel rails 121 are supported by a number of inverted
"J" shaped supports 122 that are embedded within the pool bottom 112 and island 114, with
the supports being spaced around the first pool edge 111, to thereby support the rails 121
above the water' s surface. The rails and supports 121, 122 are typically made of steel beams,
or other similar components, which can be welded and/or fastened together using bolts,
rivets, or the like. In one example, the supports 122 act to define a barrier, separating the
pool users from the hull. This can be further facilitated through the use of foam padding on
the supports, and a mesh or net extending between adjacent supports 122, to prevent surfers
passing between the supports, and preventing injury upon impact with a support.
[0058] Whilst any suitable cable drive arrangement may be used, in a preferred example the
cable 142 is driven by first and second bull wheels 141, with these advantageously being
positioned coincident with the curved end sections of the pool, so that the carriage 130 passes
around the bull wheels 141 when traversing the curved section, and with the cable extending
linearly between the bull wheels along the linear sections of the pool, as shown in Figure 1A.
[0059] An example of the drive system, and in particular the bull wheels, will now be
described in more detail with reference to Figures 2A to 2C. For the purpose of illustration,
similar reference numerals to those shown in Figures 1A and 1B, albeit increased by 100, are
used to denote similar features.
[0060] As shown in this example, each bull wheel 241 is formed from a generally annular
frame 241.1 having outer, inner and centre rings 241.11, 241.12, 241.13, interconnected by a
series of circumferentially spaced radial struts 241.14. The outer ring 241.11 defines an outer
rim that engages the cable 242, whilst the centre ring includes a number of support wheels
241.15 that travel on a raised annular platform 214.1 provided on the centre island 214,
thereby support the weight of the bull wheel 214 in use. In this example, twenty support
wheels are shown spaced around the centre ring, but it will be appreciated that this is not
essential and any suitable number of support wheels required to support the weight of the bull
wheel, could be used.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 6071666 _.docx-27/11/2017
                                                                   -9
[0061] The inner ring 241.12 engages a number of pairs of guide wheels 241.21, supported
by three sets of gantries 241.2 circumferentially spaced around the bull wheel. The guide
wheels 241.21 engage opposing surfaces of the inner ring 241.12 to thereby constrain lateral
movement of the bull wheel, thereby maintaining alignment between the support wheels
241.15 and the platform 214.1. Although eight pairs of guide wheels arranged in three spacd
sets are shown, this is for illustration only and in practice any suitable number of guide
wheels could be used.
[0062] Additionally, twenty four drive wheels 241.31, arranged in four sets are provided,
supported by respective drive wheel gantries 241.3, which engage an inner surface of the
inner ring 241.12. The drive wheels are typically driven by respective motors (not shown),
thereby rotating the bull wheel. Again, it will be appreciated that any number of drive wheels
could be provided, depending on the requirements of the system, for example depending on
the number of hulls to be moved through the water, the maximum desired hull speed, or the
like.
[0063] As further shown the outer and inner rails 221.1, 222.2 are held in place by the
supports 222, which include outer and inner uprights 222.1, 222.3, interconnected by a lateral
beam 222.2, so that the cable 242 is aligned with (although offset vertically from) a mid
point between the rails.
 [0064] An example of a carriage will now be described with more detail with references to
Figures 3A to 3G. For the purpose of illustration, similar reference numerals to those shown
in Figures 1A and 1B, albeit increased by 200, are used to denote similar features.
 [0065] In this example, the carriage 330 includes a frame 331 that supports wheels 334,
which engage the rails 321, and the hull 332.
[0066] In the current example, the frame 331 includes a primary frame 331.1 and a secondary
frame 331.2. The primary frame 331.1 includes upper and lower beds 331.11, 331.12, each of
which has a generally rectangular shape and is formed from steel beams or similar, supported
in a spaced arrangement by a number of uprights and diagonal struts 331.13. The frames are
typically made from SHS                               (square hollow section) beams, "I" beams, or the like,

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 6071666 _.docx-27/11/2017
                                                              - 10
interconnected by welding, bolting, or the like, although other suitable arrangements could be
used. The primary frame 331.1 further includes triangular-shaped end portions 331.16 again
having upper and lower beds.
[0067] The wheels 334 are arranged in wheel sets, with each set including longitudinally
spaced pairs of upper and lower upright wheels 334.3, 334.4 configured to engage upper and
lower faces of the rail 321 and inner lateral wheels 334.5 configured to engage an inner face
of each rail 321.                  In use, this example, the wheels are mounted to arm end pieces 334.2,
provided at opposing ends of respective wheel arms 334.1, which are in turn pivotally
mounted to an apex of each triangular end piece 331.16, so that the wheel arms extend
laterally outwardly to support the wheels 334 in contact with the rails 321. The arm end
piece 334.2 that includes an upright beam 334.21, and three vertically spaced horizontal
wheel supports 334.22, 334.23, 334.24 that support the longitudinally spaced pairs of upper,
lower and lateral wheels 334.3, 334.4, 334.5, respectively.                 This arrangement allows the
wheel arms to pivot, so that as the carriage 330 passes round the curved section of rail at the
pool ends, the wheels follow the path of the rail, as shown in Figures 3E and 3F.
[0068] The carriage typically includes side wall engaging wheels 336 which can be mounted
directly on an inner edge of the hull to engage the first side wall and prevent impact between
the hull and the side wall.
[0069] The hull 332 is typically mounted to the primary frame 331.1 via respective hull pivot
arms. This includes two pairs of first end pivot arms 333.1, 333.2, which are pivotally
interconnected, and pair of second end pivot arms 333.3, which are supported by respective
brackets 331.15 mounted on a lower edge of the frame 331.
[0070] The first end pivot arms 333.1, 333.2 pivotally interconnected to allow a separation
between the hull 332 and frame 331 to be adjusted, which in turn allows a pitch and height of
the hull 332 to be adjusted. This is achieved using actuators 333.4, 333.5, typically linear
actuators such as pistons, electric worm gear linear drives, or the like, that connect the hull
332 and frame 331 at opposing ends.

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 6071666 _.docx-27/11/2017
                                                              - 11
[0071] The hull includes a surface curved about a lateral axis mid-way along the carriage to
thereby define incident and trailing surfaces 332.1, 332.2. Although a curved shape is used,
this is not essential, and alternatively V-shaped or sinusoidal profiles could be used. The hull
preferably has a constant beam (width) so that in use, the hull surface pushes vertically down
on the water surface, as opposed to a hull with a changing beam that also pushes laterally
(sideways) on the water. The result is the hull efficiently generates large smooth waves with
minimal energy required and avoids undesirable broken water wash around the hull, reducing
the wave generating efficiency and reducing the use of the generated waves for surfing as
surfers ride the unbroken face of the wave. The hull can also have a length equal to half a
wavelength of the surfing wave, which optimises the magnitude of the wave, whilst
minimising the energy required to generate the wave.
[0072] Additionally, adjusting the pitch of the hull allows an angle of incidence of the hull at
the water level to be adjusted between different angles, such as greater than 10, less than 450,
between 50 and 250, between 10' and 20' and about 16'. The incident angle and depth of the
hull can be used to control the size and shape of the resulting wave.
[0073] In this example, the carriage 330 further includes a cable tensioning system 335. The
cable tensioning system includes first and second cable pulleys 335.1, 335.7 which are
orientated in a plane of the bull wheels. A first end of the cable passed around the first cable
pulley and is tensioned using a biasing member whilst a second end of a cable passes around
the second cable pulley 335.7, to a second end anchor. The biasing member ensures that
tension is maintained in the cable, whilst providing the first and second cable pulleys 335.1,
335.7 in a plane of the bull wheel facilitates engagement between the cable pulleys and cable,
and the cable and bull wheels, without the cable pulleys and bull wheels coming into direct
contact, which could in turn lead to damage.
[0074] Whilst the biasing member could be attached directly to the cable end, more typically
the tensioning system includes a first end anchor, a biasing pulley 335.5, a return pulley
335.4 and the biasing member 335.6, in the form of a spring, pneumatic piston, or the like,
which is coupled to the biasing pulley 335.5. In this arrangement, biasing force is applied via
the biasing pulley 335.5 to tension the cable 342 using mechanical advantage to increase the

H:\stp\Interwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\STP\ 6071666 _.docx-27/11/2017
                                                              - 12
degree of force that can be applied. In a preferred embodiment, pairs of parallel spaced
biasing and return pulleys are used, with the cable extending round the biasing and return
pulleys in turn, to thereby obtain further mechanical advantage, and hence increase the
degree of tension in the cable.
[0075] Whilst the biasing arrangement could be provided at any location, in one preferred
example this is supported by the primary frame 331.1, with intermediate pulleys 335.2, 335.3
and the cable pulleys 335.1, 335.7 being provided on the secondary frame 331.2. In this
arrangement, the intermediate pulleys 335.2, 335.3 are used to divert the cable 342 between
the first cable pulley 335.1 and the return pulleys 335.4, so that the tensioning system is
provided offset from and substantially below the cable. The secondary frame 331.2 can then
be pivotally mounted above a centre line of the primary frame 311.1 via pivotal mountings
331.14, allowing for lateral deflection of the cable pulleys 335.1, 335.7 when the carriage
passes 330 around the bull wheels. This operates to reduce forces on the bull wheels and
carriage, helping reduce damage.
[0076] Whilst a tensioning arrangement is shown, it will be appreciated that this is only
required on a single carriage, and if multiple different carriages are provided, the other
carriages do not need to include tensioning, instead allowing these to be attached using a
bracket or other mechanism, similar to those used on chair lifts, or the like. This allows other
carriages to be easily added and removed as required, allowing different numbers of waves to
be generated, depending on the intended use. In this instance, the tensioning mechanism on a
single carriage operates to continually tension the cable, ensuring the required tension is
maintained as forces on the system vary, for example during stopping and starting.
[0077] Accordingly, the above described arrangement provides a cable drive system that can
be used to drive carriages 330 along the rails 321 whilst the hull 332 is partially submerged in
the water, thereby generating a surfing wave. The system uses bull wheels 241 mounted on
an island 114 within the pool, with the bull wheels being positioned coincident with curved
pool ends, so that the cable naturally follows the pool shape.         This has the benefit of
removing the drive mechanism from the carriages, and locating this on the island, to avoid

                                                              - 13
this interfering with access to the surfing pool. A tensioning system is mounted on board
each carriage, thereby avoiding the need to tension the bull wheels.
[0078] In one example, the hull is adjustably mounted to the carriage, allowing a depth and
pitch of the hull to be adjusted, which in combination with changes in hull speed, can be used
to produce waves having different attributes, including different wave sizes and shapes.
Configuration of the wave can be performed based on a number of factors, such as position
of the hull within the wave pool, an identity of a user, a user profile and a defined wave
profile.
[0079] For example, a defined wave profile can use a combination of speed, depth and pitch
settings in order to generate a desired shape of wave. The wave shape could remain constant
along the linear sections, or could be adjusted as the hull moves along the linear section to
dynamically adjust the shape of the wave. In a further example, this can be performed based
on a user defined profile so that detection of a particular user allows a predetermined wave
form to be produced. Particularly in competition, this allows individuals to compete either by
using set defined wave forms which are equal for all competitors, or by allowing competitors
to define their own wave form.
[0080] In one example, configuration of the wave is achieved using a controller an example
of which is shown in Figure 4.
[0081] In this example, the controller 400 includes at least one microprocessor 410, a
memory 411, an optional input/output device 412, such as a keyboard and/or display, and an
external interface 413, interconnected via a bus 414 as shown. In this example the external
interface 413 can be utilised for connecting the controller 400 to peripheral devices, such as
one or more sensors, and to the actuators 335.4, 335.5 and drives for the bull wheels.
Although a single external interface 413 is shown, this is for the purpose of example only,
and in practice multiple interfaces using various methods (eg. Ethernet, serial, USB, wireless
or the like) may be provided.
[0082] In use, the microprocessor 410 executes instructions in the form of applications
software stored in the memory 411 to allow the required processes to be performed. The

application software may include one or more software modules, and may be executed in a
suitable execution environment, such as an operating system environment, or the like.
[0083] Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the controller 400 may be formed from any
suitable processing system, such as a suitably programmed client device, PC, or the like.
However, it will also be understood that the processing system could be any electronic
processing device such as a microprocessor, microchip processor, logic gate configuration,
firmware optionally associated with implementing logic              such as   an FPGA (Field
Programmable Gate Array), or any other electronic device, system or arrangement.
[0084] In use, the controller 400 is typically adapted to access a wave profile, that defines a
combination of hull pitch, depth and speed, which can be used to generate a particular size
and shape of wave.
 [0085] Different profiles could be used to generate different waves, for example, allowing
smaller waves to be created for teaching purposes, whilst larger waves are generated for use
in competition. It will be appreciated that as different facilities can be constructed according
to defined specifications, this allows waves to be produced which are substantially consistent
across different venues, allowing surfers in different venues to directly compete against each
other in competition.
[0086] Additionally, surfers could define their own wave preferences, with the controller 400
operating to detect the identity of a surfer, for example using an identifier such as an RFID
tag, biometric data, such as facial recognition, or the like, using the identifier to retrieve a
pre-defined user profile and hence generate a user selected wave.
