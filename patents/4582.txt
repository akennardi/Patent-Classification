   Background of the Invention
   [002] Schizophrenia is a clinical syndrome associated with psychotic symptoms such as
   delusions and hallucinations, as well as a decline in function in such areas as work,
   social relation or self care.
 5 [003] Diagnosis of schizophrenia may be determined using standard textbooks of the
   art, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fourth edition
   (DSM-IV) published by the American Psychiatric Association. Symptoms of
   schizophrenia are typically measured using rating scales such as the Positive and
   Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).
20 [004] Symptoms of schizophrenia are treated with antipsychotic medications, which
   function primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors.
   [005] Antipsychotics may be divided into typical (e.g. chlorpromazine, haloperidol.
   perphenazine) vs. atypical (e.g. amisulpride, aripiprazole, asenapine, bioanserin,
   bifeprunox, cariprazine, clotiapine, clozapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, mosaproamine,
25 olanzapine, paliperidone, perospirone, quetiapine, remoxipride, risperidone, sertindole,
   sulpiride, ziprasidone, zotepine) based upon receptor binding, preclinical effects and
   side effect profile. Clinically effective doses of antipsychotic medication typically produce
   >60% occupancy of dopamine D2 receptors. Atypical antipsychotics may be partial or
   full D2 antagonists and may also have activity at additional catecholamine and serotonin
                                                   1

   receptor types, including 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and adrenergic alphal and
   alpha2 receptors. Atypical antipsychotics may also affect other receptor types, such as
   such as muscarinic cholinergic receptors.
   [006] Major depression is a clinical syndrome that includes a persistent sad mood or
 5 loss of interest in activities, which persists for at least two weeks in the absence of
   treatment. Symptoms of major depression are typically measured using rating scales
   such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) or the Beck Depression
   Inventory (BDI). In addition to including symptoms relevant to depressed mood, the
   HAM-D also contains symptoms sensitive to psychosis, including items for guilt,
 o depersonalization/ derealization and paranoia. Major depression may also be associated
   with symptoms of anxiety, which may be measured with rating scales such as the
   Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Depressive disorders are divided in major
   depression (MDD) and bipolar depression (BPD), which may be diagnosed using criteria
   set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition, published by the American
 5 Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV), which provides as well additional description of
   mental disorders. Major depression may also occur with and without melancholic
   features. In addition, depressive symptoms may occur in the context of anxiety disorders
   such as generalized anxiety disorder, dissociative disorders, personality disorders or
   adjustment disorders with depressed mood (DSM-IV).
 o [007] Current treatments for major depression consist primarily of older antidepressants,
   such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (e.g.
   imipramine, amitryptiline, desipramine, clomipramine) that were first developed in the
   1960's, and newer agents such as tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), e.g. amoxapine,
   setiptiline, maprotiline, mianserin, mirtazapine), serotonin (SSRI) and
25 serotonin/norephinephrine (SNRI) reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine,
   paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, duloxetine, venlafaxine, dapoxetine, indalpine,
   valzodone). These agents work by modulating brain levels of monoamines, in particular
   norepinephrine and serotonin, and/or by blocking 5-HT2A receptors. MAOIs and TCAs
   are considered "broader spectrum" agents than SSRIs/SNRIs that were developed
30 subsequently MAOI, TCAs, TeCAs, SSRIs, and SNRIs may collectively be considered
   traditional antidepressants.
                                                    2

   [008] Antipsychotics may also be effective in treatment of depression. Potentially
   beneficial antipsychotic medications include but are not limited to risperidone,
   olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, clozapine, iloperidone, sertindole, asenapine,
   lurasidone, cariprazine.
 5 [009] Other antipsychotics and antidepressants in development include Valdoxan
   (agomelatine, AGO1 78) (Servier, Novartis), Lu AA21004 (Lundbeck, Takeda), F2695,
   levomilnacipran (Forest, Pierre Fabre),SEP- 227162 (Sepracor), LuAA24530 (Lundbeck,
   Takeda). SEP-225289 (Sepracor), Epivanserine (Sanofi-Aventis), SR463 9 (Sanofi
   Aventis).LY12624803, HY10275 (Lilly, Hypnion), TI -301/LY156735 (Tikvah
 0 Therapeutics), Lonasen (bioanserin, Dainippon), LU-31-130 (Lundbeck), SLV313
   (Solvay).Edivoxetine (LY2216684, Lilly), OPC-34712 (Otsuka/Lundbeck), Vyvanse
   (lisdexamfetamine, Shire), BCI-224 (sacomeline, BrainCells), BCI-540 (clouracetam,
   BrainCells), BMS-82036 (BMS/AMRI).
   [0010] However, current treatment approaches have severe limitations. Only 60-65% of
 5 patients respond to the initial regimen and among those responding, less than half either
   reach remission or become symptom-free. Individuals not responding to a first course of
   antidepressant treatment are often switched to a different drug, with results that are
   generally modest and incremental.
   [0011] 5-HT2A receptors are a type of receptor for the neurotransmitter serotonin. 5
 0 HT2A antagonists are compounds that inhibit effects of agonists such as serotonin on 5
   HT2A receptors. Inverse agonists are compounds that, in addition, reduce activity below
   basal levels. 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can be non-selective for 5-HT2A vs. other
   serotonin receptors (e.g. 5-HT2C), or selective for 5-HT2A receptors. Selective 5-HT2A
   antagonists can be developed and characterized using standard assay procedures,
25 such as those described in US patent 7,713,995 issued on May 11, 2010, which is
   herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
   [0012] Agents that act as non-selective serotonin receptor antagonists include ritanserin.
   ketanserin, seganserin, and ICI -169369. Agents that act as selective 5-HT2A
   antagonists or inverse agonists include volinanserin (MDL100.907, also known as
30 M100907), pruvanserin (EMD281014), eplivanserin, CYR-101 and pimavanserin (ACP
   103). Selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists and inverse agonists are presently under
                                                 3

   development for treatment of both depression and psychosis and are viewed as
   potential antidepressant/ antipsychotic agents.
   [0013] Additional 5-HT2A receptor antagonists or inverse agonists are described in US
   patent 7,875,632 which was issued on January 25, 2011; US patent 7.868.176 issued
 5 on January 11, 2011; US patent 7.863,296 issued on January 4, 2011; US patent
   7,820,695 issued October 26, 2010; and/or US patent 7,713,995 issued May 11, 2010
   which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
   [0014] Treatment-refractory depression refers to a form of depression that responds
   poorly to currently available treatments (e g ,
 o http://www.nimh.nih.gov/trials/practical/stard/index.shtml June 2011) and which may
   have different underlying etiopathological mechanisms compared with other forms of
   depression. Combinations of antidepressants have not been shown to be superior to
   monotherapy for refractory depression and typically increase risk of side effects and are
   not recommended.
 5 [0015] Risk for suicide is significantly increased in depressive disorders, but may
   respond differentially to medication versus depressive symptoms as a whole. When
   suicide occurs, it is often accompanied by feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate
   guilt, as well as recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation and guilt is an accepted
   proxy for suicide. While the risk of suicide increases in subjects with a depressive
 o disorder, medications used to date to typically treat depressive disorders paradoxically
   increase suicidal tendencies.
   [0016] A major limitation in use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications is the
   liability to produce behavioral side effects, especially anxiety, agitation, and akathisia.
   These can be differentiated from symptoms of the illness by consideration of both time
25 course and specific patterns of symptoms.
   [0017] In addition to akathisia, antipsychotics also produce extrapyramidal symptoms
   such as stiffness, tremor or dyskinesia. Akathisia, however, is differentiated from
   extrapyramidal symptoms and shows differential treatment response. At present, there
   are no approved treatments for antipsychotic-induced akathisia.
30 [018] Use of antidepressants is also limited by liability to produce anxiety, agitation, and
                                                  4

   akathisia.
   [0019] Limitations of antidepressants are summarized in a "black box" warning required
   by the FDA, as follows: The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks,
   insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor
 5 restlessness), hypomania, and mania have been reported in adult and pediatric patients
   being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other
   indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the
   emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the
   emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such
 0 symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality" (Trivedi et al., J Clin
   Psychiatry. 72.765-774. 2011).
   [0020] As with antipsychotic-induced akathisia, there are at present no known
   treatments for antidepressant induced anxiety, agitation, or akathisia.
   [0021] Anxiety and akathisia may be studied in animal models, such as the rat defection
 5 or restlessness models, as described, for example, in Schdev & Brune, Animal models
   of acute drug-induced akathisia - a review. Neurosci Biobehav Rev 24:269-277. 2000).
   [0022] Antipsychotics and antidepressants, including 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, may
   also be used therapeutically in the treatment of bipolar disorder (manic depressive
   psychosis), Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, dementia, anxiety disorders, pain
 0 and developmental disorders including autism.
   [0023] N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are a type of receptor for the brain
   neurotransmitter glutamate. NMDAR participate in a range of brain functions including
   sensory processing, cognition, and emotion regulation.
   [0024] NMDAR are comprised of multiple subunits termed GIuN1, GIuN2 and GIuN3
25 (formerly NR1, NR2, NR3). Multiple forms of GIuN1, GIuN2 and GIuN3 exist. In
   particular, GIuN2 subunits are divided into GIuN2A-D subforms, which are also termed
   NR2A-D subunits. NMDAR may consist of various combinations of GIuN1, GIuN2 and
   GIuN3 subunits in various amounts. Agonists and antagonists may affect all NMDAR
   equivalently, or may be selective for NMDAR containing specific subunit types.
30 [0025] NMDAR contain binding sites for both the neurotransmitter glutamate and for the
                                                   5

   endogenous modulatory amino acids glycine and D-serine.
   [0026] The glutamate binding site also selectively binds the synthetic glutamate
   derivative N-methyl-D-aspartate with high affinity. This site is alternately referred to as
   the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA recognition site of the NMDAR.
 5 [0027] The glycine/D-serine binding site has been referred to as the glycine modulatory
   site, the allosteric modulatory site or the glycine-B receptor.
   [0028] NMDAR form an ion channel that is blocked by several drugs of abuse, such as
   phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine or dizocilpine (MK-801). These compounds bind to a site
   that has been termed the PCP receptor. Agents that block the NMDAR-associated ion
 o channel are collectively termed noncompetitive NMDAR antagonists, or NMDAR
   channel blockers. Blockade of NMDAR by channel blockers leads to a clinical psychotic
   state that closely resembles schizophrenia.
   [0029] Other compounds that block NMDA receptors via the channel site include
   AZD6765 (AstraZeneca) and Glyx-13 (Naurex). NRX-1059 (Naurex)
 5 [0030] Other NMDAR antagonists are described in U.S. Patent appl. #20110306586
   published Dec 15. 2011, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
   [0031] Low affinity NMDAR antagonists, such as memantine, may be distinguished from
   high affinity antagonists such as PCP, ketamine or dizocilpine. In general, low affinity
   NMDAR antagonists do not induce schizophrenia-like psychosis or PCP-like behavioral
20 effects in rodents.
    [0032] NMDAR may also be inhibited by antagonists that bind to the glutamate
   recognition sites, the glycine recognition site, or the channel binding site.
   [0033] Selfotel (CGS19755) is an example of an antagonist that binds to the glutamate
   recognition site. Several such compounds were developed for CNS indications such as
25 stroke or epilepsy. When used at doses sufficient to significantly inhibit NMDAR, these
   compounds, like channel blockers, lead to clinical psychotomimetic symptoms.
   [0034] Additional compounds that functions as antagonists of the glutamate recognition
   site include aptiganel (Cerestat, CNS-1 102) and related compounds as described in
   Reddy et al., J Med Chem 37:260-7. 1994.
                                                  6

   [0035] Additional compounds that function as antagonists of the glutamate recognition
   site include alpha.-amino-carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid functionalities separated
   by a variety of spacer units. An unembellished example is 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric
   acid (AP5) (Watkins, J. C; Evans, R. H., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1981 , 21 ,
 5 165), which contains a saturated carbon chain. More complex examples, which contain
   elements enhancing structural rigidity and therefore potency, include CPP, cis-4
   (phosphonomethyl)-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid (CGS-19755) (Lehman, J. et al., J.
   Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988, 246, 65), and (E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5- phosphono-3
   pentenoic acid (CGP-37849) (Schmutz, M. et al., Abs. Soc. Neurosci. 1988, 14. 864).

   incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
   [0036] NMDAR may also be inhibited by antagonists that bind to the glycine recognition
   site.
   [0037] D-cycloserine is a compound that acts as a partial glycine-site antagonist. D
 5 cycloserine doses may be divided into low doses (0-250 mg), moderate ( 250-500 mg)
   or high (t500 mg). At low dose, D-cycloserine may function as a net NMDAR agonist. At
   high doses, D-cycloserine may function as a net NMDAR antagonist. Plasma
   concentrations associated with moderate or high dose administration are >25
   microgram/ml.
 o [0038] Felbamate is another example of a compound that may act via the glycine
   binding site. When administered to humans, felbamate produces psychotic effects that
   limit its clinical utility (e.g. Besag FM, Expert Opin Drug Saf 3:1-8, 2004).
   [0039] Gavestinel (GV-150,526) is another example of a glycine binding site antagonist.
   Other compounds are described in DiFabrio et al., J Med Chem 40:841-50, 1997. which
25 is hereby incorporated by reference.

   [0044] Along with identified NMDAR antagonists, additional can be identified using well
   validated electrophysiological assays such as modulation of NMDA-receptor mediated
   responses to NMDA glutamate-site agonists, or radioreceptor assays, such as
25 modulation of binding to the NMDA PCP- receptor channel binding site. Glycine site
   agonists and antagonists can also be distinguished based upon both electrophysiology
   and receptor binding from compounds such as phencyclidine (PCP) or ketamine that
   bind to the channel site. Partial agonists are defined as compounds that have reduced
   efficacy for inducing conformational change in receptors (typically 40-80%) relative to full
30 agonists, and which may induce agonist effects at low dose but antagonist effects at
   high dose.

   [0045] The NMDAR antagonist ketamine is currently approved as an anesthetic agent. It
   has also been reported to show beneficial effects in treatment resistant depression in
   small scale clinical trials. However, its utility is limited by psychotomimetic effects. The
   low affinity NMDAR antagonist memantine is approved for use in dementia. Otherwise,
 5 NMDAR antagonists have no established clinical utility.
   [0046] In general, NMDAR antagonists are considered contraindicated for use in
   schizophrenia or depression. For example, the NMDAR antagonist D- cycloserine is
   contraindicated by FDA for use in depression, severe anxiety or psychosis.
   [0047] Here we show unexpectedly that NMDAR antagonists unexpectedly reduce
 0 akathisia and anxiety associated with antidepressant and/or antipsychotic treatment.
   [0048] Here we show unexpectedly that antidepressants prevent psychotic symptoms

 5
   Example
   [00104] Example: Effect of NMDAR antagonists on akathisia induced by 5-HT2A
   antagonists
   [00105] Background: Drug induced akathisia is a common side effects of both
.0 antipsychotic and antidepressant medication and may be seen even with newer atypical
   antipsychotics (Iqbal et al., CNS Spectrums, 12:1-13, 2007). This syndrome has also
   been described as anxiety/jitteriness syndrome (Sinclair et al., Br J Psychiatry, 194:483
   90, 2009), which is also seen following both SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants.
   [00106] Although no exact animal models exist at present, rodent activity measures
25 which asses partial restlessness have been proposed to have face validity (Sachdev
   and Brune. Neurosci Biobehav Rd 24:269-277, 2000), justifying their use. Agonists at
   the 5-HT2A receptor, such as (+/-)-1-(2,5- dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane
   (DOI) have well described anxiolytic properties that may be detected in rodent assays
   such as the four- plate test or the elevated plus maze (Nic Dhonnchadha et al
30 Behavioural brain research. 147:175-84, 2003). Effects of 5-HT2A ligands may be
                                                18

   mediated in part via the GABA system (Masse et al., Behav Brain Res 177:214-26.
   2007), increasing the relevance of this mechanisms for akathisia
   [00107] The present investigation tests the hypothesis that NMDA receptor antagonists
   may reverse the akathasia-induced effects of agents that work in whole or in part
 5 through 5-HT2A blockade, including selective 5-HT2A antagonists/inverse agonists,
   anti-depressants, and atypical antipsychotics. For this study, the primary NMDA receptor
   antagonist used was D-cycloserine (DCS).
   [00108] Methods: All studies were performed at PsychoGenics, Inc., headquartered at
   765 Old Saw Mill River Road, Tarrytown, NY using an elevated plus maze (EPM)
 0 apparatus to assess behavioral effects of medication.
   [00109] Preparation: Male C57BI/6J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
   Maine) were used for this study. Mice were received at 6-weeks of age. Upon receipt,
   mice were assigned unique identification numbers (tail marked) and were group housed
   with 4 mice/cage in OPTI mouse ventilated cages. All animals remained housed in
 5 groups of four during the remainder of the study. All mice were acclimated to the colony
   room for at least 1 week rior to testing and were subsequently tested at an average of 7
   weeks of age
   [00110] During the period of acclimation, mice were examined on a regular basis,
   handled, and weighed to assure adequate health and suitability. Animals were
 o maintained on a 12/12 light/dark cycle; testing was performed during the light phase.
   The room temperature was maintained between 20 and 230C with a relative humidity
   maintained between 30% and 70%. Chow and water were provided ad libitum for the
   duration of the study. In each test, animals were randomly assigned across treatment
   groups. All animals were euthanized after the completion of the study.
25 [00111] Apparatus: The elevated plus maze test assessed anxiety. The maze (Kinder
   Scientific; Poway, CA) consists of two closed arms (14.5 cm h x 5 cm w x 35 cm I) and
   two open arms (6 cm w x 35 cm I) forming a cross, with a square center platform (6 x 6
   cm). All visible surfaces are made of black acrylic. Each arm of the maze was placed on
   a support column 56 cm above the floor. Antistatic black vinyl curtains (7' high) surround
30 the EPM to make a 5' w x 51 enclosure. Animals were allowed to acclimate to the
                                                19

   experimental room at least 1 hr before the test. Mice were placed in the center of the
   elevated plus maze facing the closed arm for a 5-min run. All animals were tested once.
   The time spent, distance traveled, and entries in each arm were automatically recorded
   by the computer. The EPM was thoroughly cleaned after each test.
 5 [00112] Medications: Medications were administered by ip injection. All medications
   were dissolved in appropriate vehicle. Doses are expressed in milligrams per kilogram
   (mpk).
   [00113] Statistical analysis. The primary dependent measure for this study consisted
   of % of time spent within the open arms, which is considered a measure of anti-anxiety
 0 effects. Between-condition comparisons were performed using post-hoc LSD with one
   tailed significance of p< 05.
   [00114] Results: Specific effects of NMDA receptor antagonists on anxiety/akathisia
   related symptoms were assessed using the measure % time in open arms, which
   measures willingness to enter an exposed vs. enclosed section of the EPM. Because it
 5 represents a ratio between activity in open and closed arms, it is relatively insensitive to
   changes in overall activity levels. Potential non-specific effects were assessed using the
   total distance travelled, which is a measure of overall activation. Locomotor hyperactivity
   induced by NMDA antagonists is considered a rodent model of psychosis. 5-HT2A
   antagonists are known to reverse effects of high-affinity NMDAR channel blockers on
 o rodent activity, reflecting their potential use as anti-psychotics. However, no studies
   have previously investigated the ability of competitive NMDAR antagonsits acting at
   either the glycine or glutamate sites to reverse potential akathisia-related anxiogenic
   effects of high affinity 5-HT2A antagonists, or other compounds such as anti
   depressants or atypical antipsychotics potentially associated with antagonism at 5-HT2A
25 receptors.

   [00121] DOI (2 mpk) significantly increased % time spent in open arms saline at doses
   of both 1 mpk (p <.05) and 2 mg (p< .05) DCS had no significant effect when added to
   DOI alone at doses of either 30 mpk or 300 mpk, suggesting absence of non-specific
   behavioral effects in this assay system. DCS (300 mpk) significantly reversed effects of
 5 MDL100709 (p< .05), whereas effects of DCS (30 mpk) were non-significant.
   Furthermore, % time spent in open arms was numerically greater for combined DCS
   (300 mpk) and both ketanserin and E D28101 than with either agent alone. When
   analyses were performed within experiment, a highly significant effect of D-cycloserine
   (300 mpk) vs. DOI (2 mpk) and MDL100,907 (0.3 mpk) alone was observed (p< .01 )
 0 (Figure 1 ).
   [00122] In the presence of DOI (2 mpk), both the 5-HT2A antagonists/inverse
   antagonists MDL100907 (p=.001) and ketanserin (p< .001) and EMD281014 (p< .05)
   significantly reduced % time spent in open arms, suggesting a significant liability for
   akathisia.
 5 [00123] The competitive glutamate site antagonist D-CPPene produced trend level
   reversal of effects of MDL100.907 (p< .1 ) on % time spent in open arms. Other NMDA
   receptor antagonists, including CGS19755 and CP101606 produced numerical
   improvement. No significant effect was observed for the channel site antagonist PCP,
   although the tendency was for exacerbation of effect. Furthermore, % time spent in open
 0 arms in the presence of combined D- cyc!oserine/DOI/ DL100907 was significantly
   greater than in the presence of combined PCP/DOI MDL100907 (p<.05).
   [00124] In addition to selective 5-HT2A antagonists/inverse agonists, the atypical
   antipsychotics quetiapine (p< .001 ) and lurasidone (p< .05) also significantly reduced %
   time in open arms, suggesting a liability to induce akathisia. For both quetiapine (p< 05)
25 and lurasidone (p< .05) effects were significantly reversed by DCS 300 mpk.
   [00125] Finally, three antidepressants - duloxetine, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine were
   tested in the presence of D-cycloserine (300 mpk) and DOI (2 mpk). All 3 showed
   significantly reduced %open arm entries vs. DOI alone, consistent with ability to induce
   akathisia clinically.

   [00127] As opposed to % time in open arms. DOI (2 mpk) significantly reduced total
   distance travelled. MDL 00907 significantly increased DT vs. DOI (2 mpk) alone
   (p< .05), and this effect was enhanced (rather than reversed) by D- cycloserine (300
   mpk) (p<.001). Other 5-HT2A and NMDAR antagonists had inconsistent effects alone
 5 and in combination with pattern different for that observed for the % time spent in open
   arm measure, reflecting specificity of the anti-akathisia effects. As a group, duloxetine,
   venlafaxine and mirtazapine added to DOI (2 mpk) and D-cycloserine (300 mpk)
   significantly enhanced DT compared to DOI (2 mpk) and D-cycloserine (300 mpk) alone
   (p<.05).
 o [00128] Summary:
   [00129] These findings demonstrate an unexpected ability of D-cycloserine, at high
   doses, to reverse reductions in %time spent in the open arm of the elevated plus maze
   induced by 5-HT2A antagonists such as MDL100709, ketanserin or atypical
   antipsychotics Pro-therapeutic effects were seen not only for D- cycloserine, but also for
 5 other NMDA receptor antagonists such as D-CPPene, CGS19755 or CP 101606. In
   contrast, the traditional channel blocker PCP worsened performance relative to DCS,
   suggesting that agents working at the glutamate or glycine binding sites, or lower affinity
   channel blockers, such as GlyX-13, may be superior to higher affinity non-competitive
   antagonists such as PCP or MK-01 . Furthermore, although 5-HT2A antagonists are
 o known to reverse hyperactivity induced by NMDA channel blockers such as ketamine,
   MK- 801, or PCP, the % open arm measure (which compares distance travelled in open
   vs. closed arms) corrects for overall changes in activity levels.
   [00129] Although the present animal models leave open the degree to which the
   phenomenon observed in rodents is isomorphic with drug-induced akathisia and/or
25 jitteriness/anxiety syndrome in humans, this issue is immaterial to the claimed invention,
   which nevertheless shows highly potent and unexpected reversal of anxiogenic
   properties of 5-HT2A antagonistic and atypical antipsychotic compounds by D
   cycloserine and other NMDA receptor antagonists. These findings thus suggest a
   unique and unexpected benefit from the addition of NMDA receptor antagonists to 5
30 HT2A antagonists including typical/atypical antagonists and antidepressants, and
   suggests that undesirable anxiogenic side effects of these compounds can be minimized
                                                25
