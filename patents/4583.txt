    Technical Field of the Invention
10
    The present invention relates to a produce box.
   Background of the Invention
15 Produce, such as fruit, is typically cooled after harvesting to maintain the quality of the
   harvested products throughout the supply chain.                            By maintaining a low produce
   temperature, deterioration in produce quality is reduced. This is particularly the case in
    situations where the produce needs to be transported for a long period.
20  The initial hours after harvesting are extremely important with respect to reducing product
   temperature. This is especially the case where products have a high respiration rate, as this
    significantly reduces deterioration of the products. Respiration is the process by which
   plants, for example, take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide. Many producers have a
    stringent postharvest regime to maintain the produce at the highest possible standard. One
25  such technique is post harvest pre-cooling.                     Pre-cooling is generally carried out in cool
   rooms using forced-air or static air cooling techniques.
   Forced air pre-cooling reduces produce temperature by passing air over or through
   packaging of freestanding containers or palletised containers. In a typical forced air pre
30  cooling process, the following steps are performed:

   I: \tId\nterwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16135957_l.doc-7 12/2017
                                                                  -2
                     a.            two rows of pallets are positioned with a divide between them;
                    b.             a heavy duty tarpaulin is pulled across the top and down front of the divide;
                     c.            a fan at the opposite end of the divide draws air from the cool room,
                                   through the palletised containers, down the divide and discharges back into
 5                                 the cool room.
    Static cooling is carried out by placing palletised products in cartons directly in cool rooms
    and relying on natural air currents in the cool room, as well as conduction through the
    cartons, to reduce the produce temperature. Static air cooling is significantly slower than
10  forced air cooling.
   Much research has been carried out trying to understand the factors affecting cooling
    operations and cooling times. Research has previously been undertaken in the following
    areas with a view to improving cooling operations and cooling times:
15
                     a.            the heat transfer characteristics of produce, such as fruit and vegetables;
                    b.             air flow rates and volumes; and
                     c.             vent patterns.
20  Container design has a significant effect on the cooling rate of products for both types of
    cooling methods. However, optimisation of box vent design and stacking strength may not
   have previously been systematically investigated. Rather, it was generally understood in
   the art that produce boxes should be constructed having:
25                   a.            6% to 8% open vent area; and
                    b.             well distributed vents located away from the comers.
   An example of a box 1 with such a design is shown in Figures la to 3c. It was commonly
    thought that vents located near the corners of the box significantly reduce the stacking
30  strength.

   I: \tId\nterwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16135957_l.doc-7 12/2017
                                                                     -3
    There are many box designs available on the market for transportation of fresh produce,
    some with vents and others without, depending on the application requirements. Vented
   boxes are generally over engineered to compensate for strength loss as a result of including
    a plurality of vents.                          The vents have traditionally been placed by designers in similar
 5 positions regardless                           of box manufacturer,    as this was thought to be an optimal
    configuration.
    Traditional positioning of vents on a vented produce box includes:
10                   a.            on box scores (half on top face, half on side and similar for bottom/side);
                    b.             a short distance from the comer; and
                     c.            equally spaced across the centre of sides.
    These designs have been available for several decades with little to no change.
15
    Boxes have previously been designed by focusing on understanding fundamental
   principles of heat transfer and cooling of produce. Several research groups have purpose
   built equipment for experimenting with variables and understanding heat transfer.
    However, this equipment has not been used to design more efficient boxes.                              A major
20  hurdle to further progress in box design is lack of cooling information when designs are
    changed. Hence, designs tend to be conservative and obvious with intuition being used as
    the measure of cooling performance.
    It is generally desirable to find a design for a box which has an optimal ventilation system
25  whist reducing the impact on stacking strength.
    It is generally desirable to overcome or ameliorate one or more of the above mentioned
    difficulties, or at least provide a useful alternative.

    34a, the second part 56b is larger than the first part 56a. Further, for each one of the major
30  score vents 34a located in the top scores 36a of the lid 18, the second part is generally "U"
    shaped.

                                                             - 10
   As particularly shown in Figures 5g and 5h, pairs of minor score vents 46a located in the
   top scores 36a of the lid 18 are at least partially defined by the overlapping flaps 54b, 54d
    coupled thereto. Each minor score vent of the pairs of minor score vents 46a is formed in
 5 two semicircular parts 58a, 58b. A first part 58a being located on a respective one of the
    side wall sections 20b, 20d and a second part 58b being located on a respective one of the
    flaps 54b, 54d. For each one of the minor score vents 46a, the second part 58b is larger
   than the first part 58a. Further, the second parts are generally "U" shaped.
10  The major score vents 34a, 34b are larger than the minor score vents 46a, 46b.
    The series of side wall sections 14a, 14b, 14c, 14d of the base 12 preferably includes four
    side wall sections and a coupling flap 38, the coupling flap being coupled between first and
    fourth a wall sections 14a, 14d of the series of wall sections by a fastener, such as an
15  adhesive. Similarly, the series of side wall sections of the lid 18 preferably includes four
    side wall sections and a coupling flap 40, the coupling flap 40 being coupled between first
    and fourth wall sections 22a, 22d of the series of wall sections by a fastener, such as an
    adhesive.
20  The face vents 24a, 24b of the base 12 are preferably circular in shape. Whereas the face
    vents 32a, 32b of the lid 18 are preferably elongate circles or ovals. Consequently, the box
    10 can be overfilled with produce, resulting in a partial vertical separation of the lid 18 and
    the base 12, and corresponding face vents of the lid 18 and the base 12 will still overlap.
25  The face vents 24a, 24b, 32a, 32b, the major score vents 28a, 28b, 34a, 34b, and the pairs
    of minor score vents 42a, 42b, 46a, 46b of the box 10 interconnect with corresponding
    vents of neighbouring boxes in a pallet allowing air to flow vertically and horizontally
    through a pallet of the boxes 10. The boxes 10 can be arranged in the pallet with abutting
    long sides, and/or abutting short ends. In either one of these configurations, the face vents
30  24a, 24b, 32a, 32b of the boxes are interconnected. The boxes 10 can also be arranged in
    the pallet with abutting short and long ends. In this arrangement, at least one face vent

   24a, 24b, 32a, 32b of the two abutting boxes are interconnected.
    The major score vents 28a, 28b, 34a, 34b and the pairs of minor score vents 42a, 42b, 46a,
   46b of the lid 18 and the base 12 are optimised for static cooling applications where natural
 5  convection currents provide cooling. The major and the minor score vents 28a, 28b, 34a,
    34b, 42a, 42b, 46a, 46b of the lid 18 the base 12 provide channels where air can freely
    flow through a column of stacked boxes and increase cooling rates. The major score vents
   28a, 28b, 34a, 34b allow for vertical air flow between palletised boxes allowing warm air
   to leave through a top layer of the pallet and cool air to enter a bottom layer of the pallet.
10
   Experimenting with different vent patterns was carried out. The process involved iterating
   towards a pattern which gives the least stacking strength loss without upgrading to stronger
   paper grades. Comparison data for the box 10 against the box shown in Figures 1 to 3c are
    shown in Table 1 below.
15
    Some box designs have interlocking vents for improved air flow when palletised. The
    interlocking vents of the box 10 prevent decreasing cooling performance when palletised.
    The lid 18 is slightly wider and longer than the base 12, hence allowing the base 12 to slide
20  into the lid 18 for assembly.
    The vents have been optimised for air cross flow and fast cooling in forced-air cooling
    applications. Cooling was optimised through experiments for a single box 10. This vent
   pattern has low impact on the stacking strength of the box 10 by locating the face vents
25  close to the corners of the box (ordinarily not done in box design) and having one large
   vent in the centre of the top and bottom scores on the long sides of the box. Stacking
    strength loss has been confirmed through box compression testing.
    The size and number of vents on the sides, top and bottom of the box 10, which translates
30  into percentage open vent area of the box, was designed to minimise the impact of the
   vents on stacking strength of the box. The percentage open vent area is less than typical

    industry practice would employ, however the paper strength does not require upgrading to
    compensate for strength loss associated with inserting holes in the sides, top and bottom of
    a box 10. That is, the box 10 performs to an acceptable level when vents are introduced
    compared to one where no vents are present.

   Additional benefits can be claimed due to improvement of temperature distribution within
   palletised boxes. A standard eight boxes per layer palletisation pattern can be upgraded to
   nine boxes per layer. The addition of one box in the central chimney of an eight boxes per
    layer palletisation pattern will increase palletisation efficiency.
10
    The box 10 is preferably a regular slotted container (RCS) type box.
   Many modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the
    scope of the present invention
