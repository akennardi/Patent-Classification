          COMPUTER SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CALCULATING MARGIN
     FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    The present invention relates to margin calculations associated with
  5 computerized market places. In particular it relates to a computer
     system and method for calculating optimal margin requirements in
     clearing systems.
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
io Computerized market places have in the last few years undergone
     major changes and a lot of money has been invested in research and
    development in order to improve the systems. However even though
    the current systems in use are very sophisticated there exist needs to
    even further improve computerized systems associated with
is computerized market places. The computer systems associated with
    computerized market places are for example the central exchange
    system where the actual matching of orders takes place, clearing and
    settlement systems for handling post trade activities and trading
    systems that are the systems that traders uses in order to send in
20  orders to the central exchange system.
    In order to trade different financial instruments such as stocks, options,
    futures, forwards and so forth the members connected to the market
    place must typically be associated with at least one clearing account in
25  a clearing house that keeps collateral. The reason for this is that the
    clearinghouse works as an intermediary between the seller and the
    buyer and in order to avoid that any one of the parties of a trade
    defaults so that an agreed trade can not be executed the clearinghouse
    needs collateral stored in an account. Usually this collateral is stored in

                                        2
   a margin account and can be divided into initial margin and variation
   margin. The initial margin shall cover heavy market movements of the
   positions and the variation margin is the positions' accumulated profit
   and loss, which is typically subject to a daily mark to market. The initial
 s margin can be calculated using different positions in different financial
   instruments and by netting positions.
   A problem that the clearing houses are facing is the issue of making
   sure that there is enough initial margin in order to cover heavy market
io movements for a desired number of lead days but also that the margin
   requirement is not over conservative since this will restrain the market.
   Commercial available margin models such as SPAN, OMS II and TIMS
   calculate initial margin per contract. Correlations between these
15 contracts are handled differently between these models but in general
   all are ill suited for markets that exhibit very strong correlation.
   Furthermore calculating initial margin per contract is not optimal for
   certain instruments such as FX forwards and interest swaps since the
   total risk can be closed out by a combination of several different
20 contracts. Calculating initial margin per contract will therefore give over
   conservative margin requirements for these types of portfolios.
   Hence there is a need for an improved method and system for providing
   margin requirements.

   Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a solution for an
   improved clearing house.

   It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that
   is able to handle multi currency products within the same margin
   system run.

   is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for instrument
   positions in an account.
   It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that
10 is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for an account
   associated with FX forwards.
   It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that
   is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for an account
is associated with interest rate swaps.
   It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that
   is able to calculate an optimal margin requirement for an account
   associated with multiple instrument types.
20
   It is -a further object of the present invention to provide a solution that
   is able to netting contracts in a new way.
   At least one of the above objects is obtained by the present invention
   as set out in the appended claims.
25
   According to a first aspect of the invention this is achieved by a
   computer system for calculating margin requirements, the computer
   system comprising
       -   a memory comprising one or more accounts, the accounts
30         comprising one or more positions comprising contracts,
       -   a processor associated with the memory,

                                     4
   wherein the computer system is configured such that the processor
   divides the contracts in the memory into cash flows.
    Letting the computer system break up the individual contracts into cash
 5 flows has the advantage that margin amounts can be lowered without
    being less conservative when managing the risk of e.g. a clearing
    house.
   In one embodiment the computer system can be configured to netting
io the different cash flows of a contract against other cash flows of other
   contracts. This has the advantage that a more optimal margin
    requirement can be achieved.
    Furthermore the computer system further can be configured to treat
15 each cash flow separately. This has the advantage that a more flexible
   system can be obtained.
   In another embodiment the computer system can further be configured
   to net currency exposures across future value dates for the cash flows
20 of the contracts. This has the advantage that margin can be calculated
   on contracts and/or positions having a risk exposure.
   In one embodiment the computer system is configured to handle multi
   currency products within the same margin system run.
25
   The computer system can be a computer system configured such that it
   can be used for a clearing house computer system.
   In a further embodiment the contracts can be divided up into their
30 relevant currencies.

                                       5
   In accordance with second aspect of the invention, the above object is
   obtained by a computerized method for calculating margin
   requirements implemented on a computer system, the computer
   system comprising a memory comprising contracts and a processor
 5 associated with the memory, the method comprising the steps of:
       -  identifying the contracts in the memory,
       -  breaking up each individual contract into cash flows.
   By letting the computerized method breaking up the individual contracts
   into cash flows has the advantage that margin amounts can be lowered
io without being less conservative when managing the risk of e.g. a
   clearing house.
   In one embodiment the computerized method can comprise the steps
   of:
15     -  netting each cash flow of a contract against other cash flows of
          other contracts.
   By concentrating the calculations on sub parts of the contracts the quite
   cumbersome set up of a correlation structure in the existing margin
20 models can be avoided. This will facilitate the understanding, and
   acceptance, of the model both externally and internally for e.g. a
   clearing house.
   The computerised method for calculating margin requirements can
25 comprise the steps of:
       -  list future payment flow in a table,
       -  calculate net present valued payments,
       -  apply a scanning range parameter to each net present valued
          payments, and
30     - calculate margin requirements.

                                       6
   In a third aspect of the invention, the above object is obtained by a
   computer program product according to any of the previous described
   embodiments, the computer program product being stored on a data
   carrier.

   These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and
   elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.

   Below will the present invention be disclosed together with a number of
   examples.
30 FX forwards are different than stock forwards since they will always
   result in cash flows in two directions. This is because one currency is

                                         8
   always exchanged for another currency. There are two main
   requirements on a margin model for FX forwards, firstly; the margin
   model must give enough margins i.e. the margin requirement shall
   contain the portfolio's accumulated profit and loss plus additional
 5 margin to cover heavy market movements for the desired number of
   lead days. Secondly the margin model must consider the portfolio as a
   whole. This implies that the model shall net between several positions
   that combined closes the future payments in one currency.
io Background and formulas
   FX Outright Forward
   A FX Outright Forward is an agreement to, at the value date, exchange
   an amount of the fixed currency for an amount of the variable currency
   to a contracted exchange rate. The name convention is Fixed
is Currency/Variable Currency. The variable currencies are USD, EUR and
    NOK in the examples below.
    EUR/USD
   GBP/EUR

    rCURF - is the risk free interest rate for time t in the fixed currency.

                                        9
   rcURV - is the risk free interest rate for time t in the variable currency.
    FR = SR e rCURv
   Spot FX
 5 A Spot FX is a FX Outright Forward with value date t = T + 2. Here T
   stands for the trading date of the Spot FX contract.
   FX Swap
   A FX swap can always be broken up into two FX forward contracts. The
   forwards contracts can further be broken up as described later in this
10 document.
   PnL Bought Contracts
   For bought Spot FX contracts and bought FX Outright Forward contracts
   the profit and loss (expressed in the variable currency of the FX pair) on
15 day t is calculated according to Equation 2.
   Definitions
   PnL - is the profit and loss of the position.
   CR - is the contracted exchange rate.
20 Fix(t) - is the fixing exchange rate on day t for the relevant FX contract.
   Q - is the quantity (expressed in the fixed currency).
   PnL=Q-(Fix(t)-CR)                                                      (2)
   Example
25 Consider a bought Spot FX trade.
   Currency pair: EUR/SEK
   Date, t: 2009-01-08
   Quantity, Q: 1 000 000 (EUR)

                                        10
    Contracted exchange rate, CR: 11,0 (SEK per EUR)
    Fixing exchange rate, Fix(t): 11,1 (SEK per EUR)
    PnL =Q(Fix(t)- CR)    =  1 000 000 - (11,1 - 11,0) = 10 000 SEK.
 5 PnL Sold Contracts
    For sold Spot FX contracts and sold FX Outright Forward contracts the
    profit and loss, PnL, (expressed in the variable currency of the FX pair)
    on day t is calculated according to Equation 3.
10 PnL=Q-(CR-Fix(t))                                                      (3)
    Present Value
   The present value in a given currency of a future payment in the same
   currency is calculated according to Equation 4.

    Margin Calculations
 io According to a prior art margin method, such as the OMS II method,
    the margin requirement is calculated per position. Further, with the
    prior art margin methods it is currently only technically possible to
    define a market with one currency. Hence, with the prior art margin
    method OMS II, one FX market would have to be defined per variable
15 currency. All relevant currencies could later be defined as underlying
    instruments in each FX market as described by the example below.
    Example: EUR/SEK
    The Spot FX currency pair EUR/SEK would be defined as a spot contract
20  of EUR in the SEK FX market.
    OMS II would only be able to handle correlation within one currency.
    Hence, OMS II will give over conservative margin requirements for
    portfolios that have netted their future payments by buying and selling
25 several positions with different variable currencies (for example bought
    USD/JPY, bought EUR/USD and sold EUR/JPY).,
    The present invention solves this problem. The computer implemented
    margin calculation method (NOMX CFM) of the present invention

                                        12
   preferably calculates the initial margin per currency. This procedure is
   divided into the steps described below.
   Variation Margin
   A variation margin will be calculated per position and this will be equal
 5 to that position's PnL calculated according to Equation 2 and Equation
   3. If desired, it will be possible to perform net present value calculations
   of the PnLs when calculating the variation margin.
   The total variation margin for one account will be the sum of the PnLs
io for all positions in that account. The total variation margin will be given
   per currency.
   Initial Margin
   The initial margin is calculated in four steps.
   Step A - Cash Flow Table
15 List all future cash flows in a table were the columns represent the
   currency and the rows represent the value date. This table is called the
   Cash Flow Table (refer to Table 1). Positive and negative payments on
   the same value date and in the same currency will be netted in this
   step.
20

                                       13
                            Table 1: The Cash Flow Table.
            Date\Currency       USD        SEK        ...   EUR
               2008-12-17          200        -800      ...    -90

                 (T + 30)
   It should be noted that the closing fixing rates will be used when the FX
 5 contracts are fit into the Cash Flow Table. The market value of the
   future payments in the Cash Flow Table will therefore be equal to zero.
   Step B - Net Present Valued Payments
   A new row is created in the Cash Flow Table. Each column in this row
   contains the net present value, NPV, of the future cash flows in that
10 currency. If no interest rate shifts are considered the present values will
   be calculated using Equation 4. For most currencies the present value
   calculations will only be performed to T + 2. This is because the closing
   fixing rates will be spot rates and hence most of the times have value
   date T + 2. The number of days that the present value calculations are
15 performed to will be configurable in the system

         Payments
    For FX Outright Forwards there is a risk related to shifts in the interest
 5 rate curves. This risk is accounted for in NOMX CFM by simulating
   different shifts in the interest rate curves. NOMX CFM is flexible and
   each exchange may choose their own way to stress the yield curves.
   This text present three different methods to stress the yield curve. In
   the preferred embodiment of the present invention (NOMX CFM) the
to interest rate shifts will be performed by the "Rolling Value Method".
   Historical Simulations
   In this method a number of actual yield curve shifts between an
   appropriate numbers of days are stored in a database (let us say 500
   days for the discussion). One way of doing this is to calculate the
is percentage shift for each day in the interest rate curves and store that
   number. When the NPV are to be calculated the interest rate curve of
   today is shifted in the 500 possible different ways and Equation (4) is
   used to calculate a NPV per currency. The interest rate curve that
   produces the lowest NPV would then be used and that would also be the
20 NPV to use as the margin figure.
   Pros:

                                        15
     The advantage is that the correlation pattern of the past 500 days is
     automatically included in the calculations,
     Principal Component Analysis
     In this method the movements of the interest rate curves are analyzed
  5 and the largest independent movements are identified. For most
     markets this is
        " A parallel shift of the curve.
        " A change in the slope of the curve (pivoting).
        * A change in the curvature (bending the curve in the ends).
 10  Since these movement generally explain most of the movement of an
     interest rate curve these factors can be used to calculate margins with a
     reasonable amount of confidence. The different movements are
     independent of each other which mean that one can calculate margins
     by having parameters define each movement. When the NPV are to be
 is calculated the interest rate curves of today are shifted according to
    their principal components and Equation (4) is used to calculate a NPV
     per currency. The interest rate curve that produces the lowest NPV
    would then be used and that would also be the NPV to use as the
     margin figure.
20   Pros:
    The yield curves will always look reasonable (no spikes or saw tooth
    shapes). It will be possible to introduce correlation between yield curves
    in different currencies with this method.
    Rolling Value Method
25  In this method the swap forward curve is shifted in a rolling fashion
    starting with the cash flow furthest away.
    Definitions

                                          16
   CC,,, is the value of all future cash flows in currency i later than date j
   discounted back to date j.
   ri,jj+i is the risk free interest rate in currency i for the time period from
   date j to date j+1.
 5 Ari       is the interest rate shift risk parameter. It shall represent the
   risk of shifts in rijj+,.
   tj is the time to date j given in the defined discount base.

   Pros:
   The rolling value method is robust and it will find the worst possible
15 interest rate curves for the portfolio. The yield curves will show periods
   with increased numbers and periods with decreased number depending
   on the complete portfolios exposure. It will be possible to stress the less
   liquid and/or more volatile parts of the yield curves with a higher risk
   parameter compared to the interest rate curves' more liquid and/or less
20 volatile parts. It will be straight forward to introduce correlation
   between different interest rate curves in the same currency.
   Step C - Spot Exchange Rates Stressing
   A scanning range parameter is applied to all net present valued
   payments. The scanning range parameter should be expressed in
25 percentage and it shall cover market movements of the currency
   compared to the account's base currency for the desired number of lead
   days.

                                        17
     The scanning range parameter is applied on the spot fixing exchange
     rate of the given currency compared to the base currency of the
     account in conjunction with converting the net present value in that
     currency to the base currency of the account. The scanning range
  5 parameter shall be applied according to Equation (8) - Equation (9).
     Definitions
     SRP is the scanning range parameter.
     Fix(t)i is the fixing spot exchange rate of currency i compared to the
 10  base currency of the account,

    Since the market value for the future payments in the Cash Flow Table
    is equal to zero the initial margin i.e. the margin added by the risk
    parameters is equal to the sum of all converted net present cash flows.

   FX Settlement Margin
   The variation margin contains the PnL of all FX contracts accumulated
   as a netted variation margin amount from all positions, no matter of
 5 their value date. This might not be suitable for future styled customers
   since part of their pledged collateral might be used for settlement at the
   value date.
   It will therefore be possible to incorporate a FX settlement margin to
10 NOMX CFM. The FX settlement margin is preferably defined per
   currency and it is equal to the total losses in that currency for all
   positions with value date less than T + a configurable amount of days.
   If FX settlement margin is used then it may be pledged preferably as
   cash in the relevant currencies.
is Margin Presentation and Collateral Handling
   The following margin information is preferably presented to the
   customers.
       " PnL per position (currency pair), calculated according to Equation 2
20         and Equation 3.
       " Variation margin per currency. This will be the net present value of
           the combined PnL:s in that currency. These net present valued
           calculations are preferably performed with the unadjusted interest
           rate curves.
25     * Total margin requirement. This will be the total margin
           requirement (initial and variation margin). In this calculation the
           interest rate curves will have been adjusted with the configured
           method.

                                       19
   The margin requirement may be covered with any collateral approved
    by the market place, such as cash or any type securities may be used.
 s It should be noted that for participants that are configured to use FX
    settlement margin the margin presentation and collateral handling may
    be different.
    Computer implemented Price Server
    General
10  One fundamental prerequisite for absorbing counterparty risk in a
    clearing house is the ability to price all positions of the counterparts to
   the clearing house. In very general terms the price server is a market
    maker computer application that collects information over a computer
    network from various price sources, such as from other computerized
15 exchanges, banks and from        other information server systems.
    Information regarding derivatives, equities, interest rate, deals and so
   forth may be collected, and with these building blocks the price server
    is able to construct best effort pricing of other less liquid (or even non
   traded) instruments.
20
   According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the price
   handling will be needed in order to be able to calculate accurate
   variation margin as well as initial margin.
   Exchange Rates and Interest Rate Curves
25 A price carrier method will be applied to compute accurate exchange
   rates. The computerized exchange will in real time or on an hourly basis
   (at minimum) provide the computerized price server with at least the
   following information through a gateway over the computer network.

                                          20
       * The spot exchange rates for all currencies towards the USD.
       " The interest rates per currency in predefined times, tcupA,2   =
          rCURA,1, tCURA,2 = rCURA,2 etc.
 5 The computerized price server is configured to handle the above
   information in the following way,
       " The price server will take the spot exchange rates for each
          currency towards the USD and use Equation (5) to calculate the
10        spot exchange rates for all possible currency pairs.
       " The price server will take the given interest rates and interpolate
          a linear interest rate curve per currency. The price server will
          then use Equation (1) to calculate the theoretical forward
          exchange rates for each possible currency pair and time.
15
   These spot exchange rates, linear interpolated interest rate curves and
   theoretical calculated forward exchange rates may be forwarded and
   used when calculating variation margin and initial margin.
20 It should be noted that it will also be possible for the clearing operation
   personnel to manually enter the spot exchange rates and interest rate
   curves through the Graphical user interface (GUI) to the clearing
   system.
   Margin Calculation Examples
25 An Example NOMX CFM VS OMS II
   Portfolio
   Consider a portfolio according to Table 3. All contracts are Spot FX
   contracts and hence have value date T + 2.

   rates all positions have market value equal to zero. The margin
   requirement calculated by OMS II and NOMX CFM will therefore only

    Interest Swaps
   The following example is aimed to describe a second embodiment
to wherein the present invention may be used, namely to calculate
    margins for interest rate swaps. NOMX CFM (short for NASDAQ OMX
    Cash Flow Margin) is a margin model designed by NOMX.
    Preferably this method is implemented in a computer system such as a
   computer or server computer comprising a central processor, for
15 executing the instructions that are associated with the method steps
   described in the following example.
   According to a preferred embodiment NOMX CFM method calculates
    margin in the following steps.
   Cash Flow Table
20 In the first step each instrument is broken up into its underlying cash
   flows and these are inserted into a cash flow table. The columns in this
   table represent each cash flow's currency and the rows represent each

                                         25
     cash flow's value date. Positive and negative cash flows on the same
     value date, and in the same currency and with the same interest rate
     risk will be netted in this step.

  5
    Net Present Value Calculations
    In the second step a net present value, NPV, of the future cash flows is
    calculated per currency. The yield curves are stressed when this
    calculation is performed. This text presents a rolling value method, a
io historical simulation approach and a principal component approach to
    the yield curve stressing. Each clearing house may however define and
    use their own method to stress the yield curves.

        (NPV)                 Flows)                  Flows)
 5 Stressing of Spot Exchange Rates
   In the third step each net present valued cash flow is converted into a
    margin base currency. The spot exchange rates are stressed in this
   conversion. The window method will be applied to account for
   correlation between different exchange rates.
10
   It should be noted that if the NPV of the future cash flows are calculated
   with the unstressed yield curves and converted with the unstressed
   spot exchange rates, then the portfolio's market value is obtained in the
   margin base currency. However, when the NPV are calculated with the
is stressed yield curves and converted with the stressed spot exchange
   rates the margin requirement is obtained in the margin base currency.
   Now an example on how the NOMX CFM method can be applied on IRS
   Definitions

    In order to be able to price and calculate margins on interest rate
    swaps RIVA must be able to construct yield curves. The NOMX CFM
    adaptations to RIVA include an OMNET computer transaction in order to
    send pairs of dates, ti, and interest rates, ri, into RIVA. From this
  5 information RIVA will be able to linear interpolate an interest rate curve
     r(t).
    A preferred way is that the RIVA computer system collects the relevant
    swap zero rates from a third party vendor such as Reuters or
    Bloomberg, via computer communication means, and uses a linear
io interpolation of a swap zero curve, rz(t). RIVA can from rz(t) construct a
    swap forward curve rf(t). The formula used to construct rf(t) will of
    course look different depending on the type of interest rates and the
    discount base. In this text it is assumed that the swap zero rates are
    simple interest rates and that the discount base is actual/360.

     Cash Flows of a Generic Swap
    An interest rate swap is an agreement to exchange future cash flows in
    one or two currencies. An example of the future cash flows of a SEK
  5 fixed-for-floating rate swap is shown in Figure 3.
     Figure 3: The generated cash flows of a SEK fixed-for-floating rate
    swap.
     Equation (15) - (18) can be used in order to insert a generic swap
    contract, defined by
10   [N, Q, to, tend, Ati, At 2 , ri, r 2, type1 , type 2, Ar 1 , Ar 2 , CUR 1 , CUR 2 , Bool,
    FX], into the cash flow table.
    It should be noted that the notional amount for CUR 2 is given by N - FX.
    Hence, when Equation (15) - (18) are used on the second leg of the
    swap contract N should be changed to N - FX.

  Net Present Value Calculation
5 In the next step of NOMX CFM method a new row is added to the cash
  flow table. This row contains the NPV of the future cash flows per
  currency. It should be noted that if the NPV calculations are performed
  with each currencies unstressed swap zero curve the market value of
  the future cash flows is obtained per currency.

                                                       33
     Adding a margining aspect to the NPV calculations requires stressing of
     the yield curves. The Historical Simulation and the Principal
     Components approach to the yield curve stressing can be applied in this
     context as well. However, the preferred method for stressing the yield
  5  curves will be the Rolling Value method. This text presents how the
     Rolling Value method can be applied on interest rate swaps.
     Rolling Value Method
     In this method the swap forward curve is shifted in a rolling fashion
     starting with the cash flow furthest away. The NPV of one currency's
 10  future cash flows is given by equation (19).
     NPV =           P(t,) p(t1 ,t 2 ) .. P(t_ 2,t,_) *pt,_,t) C,
     = p(t1)-(C1 + p(t15t2)- [C2 + p(t2,10-1[...[Cn_, + p(t-_I,
                                                                  t.,,) C,   (19)
     p(ti) is the discount function from today to ti and it is given by the
     swap zero rate rz(ti) . p(ti,ti1 ) is the discount function from ti+1 to ti
     and it is given by the swap forward rate re(ti,t. +1 ).
     p(t,)1
                01          At
is                          360                                              (20)

    A fixed cash flow is always exposed to a shift in the forward curve
    rf(t 1 ,t.i+ 1 ). However, the complete floating cash flow is not exposed to a
    shift in the forward curve since the same forward curve is used to
20  determine the size of the floating cash flow. A floating cash flow can
    therefore always be divided into one part that is exposed to shifts in the
    forward curve and one part that is unaffected by shifts in the forward
    curve.

    Let us introduce a term that represents "all previously discounted cash
    flows".
     CC; = C, + p(t, ti,)CCi                                               (22)
  5 CC; can always be divided into one part that is exposed to shifts in the
    forward curve, CC;**, and another part is unaffected by shifts in the
    forward curve, CC;non.
     CC, = CC,**x + CC,"o"                                                 (23)
    In the rolling value method the forward curve is stressed with a risk
i   parameter, rp, depending on the sign of CC;exP.
    r, (t,_,, ti) = rj (t, 1 , t1) + rp -sign(CC*XP)                       (24)
    This means that the last cash flow is discounted back to the one before
    dependent on sign of its exposed part. For the next step the discounted
    cash flow and the cash flow at that point is added together and
15 dependent on sign of this cash flow's exposed part then discounted
    back to the cash flow before that. When the last cash flow is reached,
    on time ti, the discounting must be performed with p(ti) in order to
    obtain the present value. At this stage the complete CCi will be exposed
    to a shift in the zero rate, rz(ti), and hence rz(ti) should be stressed
20  depending on sign of CCi.
    r (t,) = r, (t,) + rp -sign(CC,)                                       (25)
    When the rolling value method has calculated the NPV of the future
    cash flows it has at the same time produced the stressed swap forward

                                              35
      rates rf(ti, ti+ 1 ) as well as the stressed swap zero rate rz(ti). Equation
      (13) can now be used to obtain the complete stressed swap zero curve.
      Hence, the rolling value method produces the stressed yield curves in
      conjunction with performing the NPV calculations as opposed to the
  5 other methods that first construct a number of different yield curves
     and then performs the NPV calculations in order to select the worst
     curves.
     Spot Exchange Rate Stressing
     The stressing of the swap yield curves gives a NPV of the future cash
 10  flows per currency. In the last step of NOMX CFM method the net
     present valued cash flows are converted into the margin base currency.
     The spot exchange rates are stressed in this conversion. The window
     method will be applied to account for correlation between different
     exchange rates.
15   Margin Examples
     This section contains examples of how method according to an
     embodiment (NOMX CFM method) of the present invention would
     calculate margins for two different swap portfolios.
     Sold 2Y Fixed-for-Floating
20 Consider a portfolio that consists of one sold contract of a two year SEK
    fixed-for-floating rate swap.

    simple, simple, 0, 0, SEK, SEK, YES, 1].
    This implies that every third month a 1,41 % fixed rate is received in
25  exchange for the 3 month STIBOR rate. Suppose that the contract is
    entered on 2009-05-05 and that the swap zero rates, rz(ti), on this day
    is as given in Table 12. Equation (13) can be used to produce the SEK
    swap forward curve rt(ti,ti+1).

                        05
   The rates in Table 12 should be interpreted as follows.
 5    .  rz(2010-05-05) = 0,99 % implies that the one year swap zero
         rate from 2009-05-05 equals 0,99 0/.
      -  r(2011-02-05, 2011-05-05) = 2,23 % implies that the 3 month
         swap forward rate ranging between 2011-02-05 and 2011-05-05
         equals 2,23 %.

  Net Present Value Calculation
  The floating cash flow on day ti can be divided in one part that is
  exposed to and another part that is not exposed to shifts in r(ti,ti+).

The cash flow table can therefore be divided into a non-exposed and an
exposed part.

   The rolling value method starts with the cash flows furthest away i.e. on
    2011-05-05. These cash flows are discounted back to the time of the
    next cash flow i.e. to 2011-02-05 using the forward rate between 2011
    02-05 and 2011-05-05, r(2011-02-05, 2011-05-05). The forward rate
 5 is stressed with a risk parameter depending on the sign of the exposed
    part of the cash flow from 2011-05-05. In this example it is supposed
   that the risk parameter is set to 20 basis points.
     Cl010-05 i.e. the exposed cash flow on 2011-05-05 is equal
                                                                                          to SEK

   noted that the complete               CC 2 0oos- 0   is exposed to shifts in rz(2009-08

   shifted downward.

     Summary
     The swap forward curve was stressed upward between 2009-08-05 and
  5  2011-05-08 since CCie> 0 between these dates. On 2009-08-05 the
     floating leg did however become exposed to a shift in the swap zero
     rate and this made CCl' change sign. The swap zero rate, rz(2009-08
     08), was therefore stressed downward.
     If the NPV of the future cash flow is calculated with the unstressed
 10  curves the market value of the swap portfolio is obtained. Table 16 lists
    the swap portfolio's market value together with the calculated margin.

    Summary
    The swap forward curve was stressed downward between 2011-08-05
    and 2014-05-05 when there were only cash flows from the five year
    swap contract in the cash flow table. Between 2009-08-05 and 2011
 5  05-05 the cash flows from the two year swap contract were also
    exposed to shifts in the swap forward curve and the positive sign of the
    fixed leg cash flows of the two year swap made the sign of CCic change
    on 2011-05-05. The forward curve was therefore stressed upward
    between 2010-02-05 and 2011-05-05. However, since the fixed leg of
'o the five year swap contract had a higher traded yield then the fixed leg
    of the two year swap contract, CC ]gradually decreased and on 2009
    11-05 the sign of CCJ* was changed and the forward curve as well as
   the zero curve were stressed downward.

   swap curves upwards and downward.

   In Fig. 10 some procedural steps of a computerized method for
20 calculating margin requirements implemented on a computer system
   are illustrated. The computer system can comprise a memory
   comprising contracts and a processor associated with the memory. In
   accordance with the method contracts in the memory are first identified

                                     47
   in a step 101. The identified individual contracts are then broken into its
   respective cash flows in a step 103. The cash flows of one contract
   resulting from step 103 can then be netted against cash flows from
   other contracts in a step 105. The margin requirements can then be
 5 calculated based on the netted cash flows.
   In the above description the term "comprising" does not exclude other
   elements or steps and "a" or "an" does not exclude a plurality.
