 POWER CONVERSION SYSTEM, CONVERTER DEVICE, INVERTER DEVICE,
          AND POWER CONVERSION SYSTEM MANUFACTURING METHOD
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]        The present invention relates to a power
conversion system that uses created energy and stored
energy, a converter apparatus,         an inverter device, and a
method for manufacturing a power conversion system.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]        To lower carbon dioxide emissions and effectively
use energy, efforts have been made to reduce environmental
loads.      Such efforts include the concept of creating energy
 (energy creation) at the supplier side in addition to energy
conservation,      which reduces  energy consumption.     Specific
examples include the use of renewable energy like in
photovoltaics and cogeneration systems used in combination
with fuel batteries.
[0003]        Fig.  13 shows a case    in which a house is provided
with a solar battery panel 11.          In this case, a connection
box 90 relays DC power from the solar battery panel 11.             The
relayed DC power is       supplied to a photovoltaic inverter 91.
The photovoltaic inverter 91 converts DC power into AC power
for use by a household       load  (power load).    The AC power is
supplied to a house distribution board 30.           Some of the AC
power is used by a household load 50,          and some of the AC
power is supplied through a power meter 60 to a commercial
system 70,     which is commercial power.
[0004]        In addition to energy creation, there is a concept
for storing energy       (energy storage),    for example, using a
storage battery, so that the energy may be used when
                                     1
3577532v1

necessary.
         Fig.   14 shows an example in which created energy and
stored energy are used.       In   this   case,   solar battery    panels
11,    a storage battery 12,     and a fuel battery 13 are used.
The solar battery panels       11,   the storage battery 12,        and the
fuel battery 13      respectively use photovoltaic inverters 91
to    93 to supply AC power.      Each of the photovoltaic
inverters 91 to 93 includes a converter that adjusts DC
voltage and a system interconnection inverter that converts
DC power into AC power.
 [0005]       As  described above, when household distributed
power generation devices are interconnected with the system,
systems need to be smoothly interconnected while the safety
of each device is ensured.         Thus,    a verification system has
been set by a certain institution            (JET: Japanese Electrical
Safety and Environment      Technology Laboratories) .          Since the
photovoltaic inverters each incorporate an inverter
interconnected with the system, each photovoltaic inverter
needs to obtain JET verification.
 [0006]       Additionally, when the solar battery and the fuel
battery are used as power generation units, a proposed
structure includes two converters that correspond to the
solar battery and the fuel battery and an inverter that is
shared by the solar battery and the fuel battery                (e.g.,
refer     to patent document   1).     Thus,  a photovoltaic     DC/DC
converter and a fuel battery DC/DC converter generate DC
power.      The  inverter converts the DC power into AC power and
supplies the converted AC power to the system.

SUMMARY OF THE     INVENTION
Problems that are to be Solved by the Invention
[0008]       As  shown in Fig. 14,   when a photovoltaic inverter
is installed for each of the created energy and the stored
energy, the installation cost of the photovoltaic inverters
increases.      Additionally, energy is   combined after  the
created energy and the stored energy are converted into AC
from DC.     Thus, energy loss occurs in the inverters, which
are interconnected with the system.        This hinders effective
use of energy.      Further, each photovoltaic inverter is large
in size.     Thus, it is difficult to ensure space for setting
multiple units in each household, indoors        or outdoors.
Additionally, each photovoltaic inverter incorporates an
inverter interconnected with the system.        Thus, each
photovoltaic inverter needs to obtain the JET verification.
[0009]       Moreover, in the technique described in patent
document    1, the JET verification needs to be obtained for
the entire configuration.      This decreases the degree of
freedom for realizing the device configuration desired by
the user, adding functions, and eliminating functions.
         To solve the above problem, it is an object of the
present invention to provide a power conversion system that
effectively and efficiently uses created energy and stored
energy, a converter apparatus,       an inverter device, and a
method for manufacturing the power conversion system.

power of the bus line to perform DC output.
         Preferably, in the above configuration, when detecting

operation of the one that is unable to communicate.

EMBODIMENTS OF THE      INVENTION
[0022]        First Embodiment
         A first embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 1.
         As shown in Fig. 1, a power conversion system 20
connected to distributed power supplies 10 is used to
effectively use created energy and stored energy.        The power
conversion system 20      is manufactured by connecting a
created/stored energy conversion unit 21       and a system
interconnection inverter unit 22 with a bus line and
connecting a bus voltage control unit 23.        The system
interconnection inverter unit 22      obtains verification for
connection to a commercial system.       In the present
embodiment, it is assumed that solar battery panels 11,        a
storage battery 12,      a fuel battery 13, an EV 14,  and a PHV
15 are used as the distributed power supplies 10.
[0023]        Each solar battery panel  11 is a power generation
device that converts solar energy into DC voltage and
functions as an energy creation means.       The solar battery
panel 11 mainly includes a solar battery panel formed by
connecting a plurality of solar battery cells.
                                   7
3577532v1

[0024]       The storage battery 12 stores power by charging
and may be used as a battery.      The storage battery 12 is an
energy storage means that is repeatedly usable.
         The fuel battery 13  is a power generation device that
supplies a fuel gas     including hydrogen, for example, a
natural gas, and an oxidant gas including oxygen, for
example, air, to obtain DC power through a chemical reaction
between hydrogen and oxygen.      The fuel battery 13 functions
as an energy creation means.
[0025]       The EV 14 is  an electric vehicle that is driven by
an electric motor.     The EV 14 functions as an energy
creation means.
         The PHV 15 is a plug-in hybrid car that   includes a
gasoline engine and may be charged when power is directly
supplied from a household power supply using a plug
 (plugging tool).    The PHV 15 functions   as an energy creation
means and an energy storage means by charging the vehicle
and also supplying power stored in the vehicle to the house.
In this case, the PHV 15     includes an inverter that controls
supply of AC power from the vehicle.
[0026]       The distributed power supplies 10 are connected to
the power conversion system 20.      The power conversion system
20   includes a converter apparatus and the created/stored
energy conversion unit 21,     which functions as a DC
conversion unit.     The created/stored energy conversion unit
21   includes conversion devices 211 to 215 in correspondence
with the distributed power supplies 10.       The conversion
devices 211 to 215 are connected to the system
interconnection inverter unit 22,      which functions as an
inverter device, by the bus line.
[0027]       The conversion device 211 for the solar battery
panels 11    is formed by a DC/DC converter and executes a
process for converting outputs      (DC) of the solar battery
                                  8
3577532v1

panels 11      into voltage of the bus line    (e.g., DC350 V).   The
conversion device 211 performs an MPPT         (maximum power point
tracking) operation in accordance with generated power,
which is affected by an insolation state of sunlight.
[0028]         The conversion device 212 for the storage battery
12 is     formed by a DC/DC converter.     The conversion device
212 converts an output        (DC) of the storage battery 12 into
voltage of the bus line and supplies the output to the bus
line.      The conversion device 212 also supplies power to the
storage battery 12 from the bus line.
[0029]         The conversion device 213 for the fuel battery 13
is formed by a DC/DC converter.         The conversion device 213
converts an output       (DC) of the fuel battery 13 into voltage
of the bus line and supplies the output to the bus line.
         The conversion device 214 for the EV 14      is formed by a
DC/DC converter.       The conversion device 214 converts an
output      (DC) of the EV 14   into voltage of the bus line and
supplies the output to the bus line.
[0030]         The conversion device 215 for the PHV 15    is formed
by a DC/DC converter.        The conversion device 215 converts an
output      (AC) of the PHV 15   into DC and supplies the output to
the bus line.       The conversion device 215 also converts DC
power supplied from the bus line into AC and supplies the
power to the PHV 15.
[0031]         Additionally, the conversion devices 212 to 215
perform a charging-discharging operation in which charging
is performed when the voltage of the bus line is increased
and discharging is performed when the voltage of the bus
line is decreased.       This regulates the bus line to a
constant voltage.
[0032]         The system interconnection inverter unit 22     is a
device verified by JET and includes an inverter 221.          The
inverter 221 uses a pulse duty ratio to convert DC power
                                     9
3577532v1

into AC power having a voltage and a frequency that are
applicable to an interconnection with the commercial system
70   (e.g.,     AC202 V).
[0033]         The inverter 221 supplies AC power to the
commercial       system 70  through a house distribution board 30.
The power amount of the AC power is measured by a power
meter located between the house distribution board 30 and
the commercial       system 70.   The house distribution board 30
is connected to the household load and supplies AC power to
the household load.
[0034]         The power conversion system 20    includes a bus
voltage control unit 23 that controls the voltage of the bus
line.       The bus voltage control unit 23 measures the voltage
of the bus line.        The bus voltage control unit 23 controls
operation of each of the conversion devices 211 to 215 by
notifying the conversion devices 211 to 215 of an
instruction to stabilize the voltage of the bus line at a
predetermined value.         Additionally,  when communication
cannot be performed, the bus voltage control unit 23 stops
the operation of the conversion devices 211 to 215 and the
system interconnection inverter unit 22 that cannot
establish communication.
[0035]         The first embodiment has the advantages described
below.
           (1) In the first embodiment, the multiple conversion
devices 211 to 215 are connected to the single system
interconnection inverter unit 22.          This allows the inverter
to efficiently convert generated or stored DC power into AC.
Additionally, the conversion devices 211 to 215 share the
system interconnection inverter unit 22.          This reduces the
space for setting the inverter and limits power loss.
Further, the created/stored energy conversion unit 21 and
the system interconnection inverter unit 22 have separate
                                     10
3577532v1

structures.      Thus,  the JET verification needed for the
system connection is       limited to the system interconnection
inverter unit 22.       This increases the degree of freedom for
combining the distributed power supplies 10 and efficiently
actualizes     a creation-storage cooperative operation that
uses created energy and stored energy.
[0036]        (2) In the first embodiment, when communication
cannot be performed, the bus voltage control unit 23 stops
the operation of the conversion devices 211 to 215 and the
system interconnection inverter unit 22 that cannot
establish the communication.        This copes with a situation in
which an abnormality occurs in a device.         For example, an
occurrence of overvoltage or overcurrent in the bus line may
be limited.      This prevents breakage and breakdown of the
mounted components.
[0037]       Second Embodiment
         A second embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 2.        In the first embodiment, power is
supplied to the commercial system 70        from the distributed
power supplies 10.       In the second embodiment, the system
interconnection inverter unit 22        supplies and obtains power
to and from the commercial system 70.         Same configurations
will not be repeatedly described in detail.
[0038]       As  shown in Fig. 2, the system interconnection
inverter unit 22      includes a bidirectional inverter 222.
         When a distributed power supply 10     for storing energy
has insufficient energy storage, the distributed power
supply 10 obtains and stores power from the commercial
system 70.
[0039]       More specifically, the bus voltage control unit 23
detects an energy storage state of an energy storage device
included in the distributed power supply 10.         In the second
embodiment, the energy storage states of the storage battery
                                    11
3577532v1

12 and the PHV 15 are detected.        When the energy storage
state does not reach a predetermined storage reference,        the
bus voltage control unit 23 instructs the bidirectional
inverter 222 to supply power from the commercial system 70.
In this case, the bidirectional inverter 222 converts
commercial AC power into DC power and supplies the power to
the bus line.       The energy storage is performed on the
storage battery 12 and the PHV 15 having the energy storage
state that does not reach the predetermined storage
reference.       When the energy storage state reaches the
predetermined storage reference, the bus voltage control
unit 23 stops the power supply from the commercial        system
70.
[0040]        The second embodiment has the advantage described
below.
          (3) In the second embodiment, the system
interconnection inverter unit 22       includes the bidirectional
inverter 222.      This allows for the power supply to the energy
storage means       (e.g., storage battery 12 and PHV 15)  from the
commercial      system 70 when necessary.   In one example,
midnight low cost power may be used during the daytime.          In
another example, surplus power generated from sunlight may
be stored in the storage battery.        This actualizes an
appropriate creation-storage cooperative operation by
performing the energy storage taking into consideration a
situation when power needs to be supplied from the energy
storage devices.
[0041]        Third Embodiment
         A third embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 3.        In the third embodiment, the bus
voltage control unit 23 controls the voltage of the bus
line.      In the third embodiment, the power conversion system
20   includes an inverter and converters each of which
                                    12
3577532v1

includes an independent control unit.         Same configurations
will not be repeatedly described in detail.
[0042]        As shown in Fig. 3, the bidirectional inverter 222
of the system interconnection inverter unit 22          includes a
control unit 231 that detects the voltage of the bus line
and performs inverter control.         The conversion device 211
includes control units 232 that perform power conversion in
accordance with the power generation state of the solar
battery panels      11. The conversion devices 212 to 215 each
include a control unit 232 that measures the voltage of the
bus line and performs power supply or power storage to
obtain     a predetermined voltage.     For example,   when the
voltage of the bus line is       low, power is   supplied from the
distributed power supplies 10 to increase the voltage of the
bus line.      When the voltage of the bus line is high, power
is supplied to the distributed power supplies 10 to decrease
the voltage of the bus line.
[0043]        The third embodiment has the advantage described
below.
          (4) In the third embodiment, the bidirectional
inverter 222 and the conversion devices 211 to 215
respectively include the control units 231,          232.  This
allows each device to independently control the voltage of
the bus line without using a bus voltage control unit that
controls the combination of the devices.          In this case, a
distributed power supply 10 may be added by connecting a
conversion device including the control unit 232 to the
system interconnection inverter unit 22.          This ensures the
degree of freedom for expanding the system.
[0044]        Fourth Embodiment
         A fourth embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 4.       In the third embodiment, the power
conversion system 20      includes the inverter and the
                                    13
3577532v1

converters        respectively including the independent control
units 231,        232.   In the fourth embodiment, the power
conversion system 20           includes an inverter and converters
that    include control units in which a master-slave
relationship is         set.    Same configurations will not be
repeatedly described in detail.
[0045]         As   shown in Fig. 4, in the system interconnection
inverter unit 22,         the bidirectional inverter 222 includes a
master control unit 233.            Each of the conversion devices 211
to 215 includes a slave control unit 234.              The master
control unit 233 communicates with each slave control unit
234.
[0046]          The master control unit 233 detects the voltage of
the bus     line    and performs     inverter control.   Additionally,
the master control unit 233 instructs the slave control unit
234 of each of the conversion devices 211 to 215 to perform
operation control.           For example, when the voltage of the bus
line is low, the master control unit 233 instructs to supply
power from a distributed power supply 10            that is an energy
storage means so that the voltage of the bus line is
increased.         When the voltage of the bus line is high, the
master control unit 233 instructs to supply power to the
distributed power supply 10 that is            an energy storage means
so that the voltage of the bus line is decreased.              The slave
control units 234 controls the operation of the conversion
devices 211 to 215 based on the instruction from the master
control unit 233.
[0047]          The fourth embodiment has the advantage described
below.
          (5) In the fourth embodiment, the power conversion
system 20        includes the system interconnection inverter unit
22   including the master control unit 233,           and the conversion
devices 211 to 215 corresponding to the distributed power
                                           14
3577532v1

supplies 10 include the slave control units 234.         Thus, the
master control unit 233 cooperates with the multiple slave
control units 234 to control the power conversion system 20.
In this case, distributed power supplies 10 are added by
connecting conversion devices including the slave control
units 234 to the system interconnection inverter unit 22.
This ensures the degree of freedom for expanding the system.
[0048]       Fifth Embodiment
         A fifth embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 5.       In the first to fourth embodiments,
the created/stored energy conversion unit 21        is configured
to integrate the conversion devices 211 to 215.         In the
fifth embodiment, the created/stored energy conversion unit
21   includes the conversion devices 211 to 215 that are
separately connected to the system interconnection inverter
unit 22.     Same configurations will not be repeatedly
described in detail.
[0049]       As  shown in Fig. 5, the system interconnection
inverter unit 22      includes terminal blocks 225 that include a
plurality of DC input connection terminals and function as
connection interfaces to the conversion devices 211 to 215.
Each terminal block 225 is       connected to the bidirectional
inverter 222.      When power is   not supplied from the
commercial     system 70,  a unidirectional inverter 221 may be
used instead of the bidirectional inverter 222.
[0050]       The conversion devices 211 to 215, which are
connected to the distributed power supplies 10,        are
separately connected to the corresponding terminal blocks
225.     In this case, the inverter and the conversion devices
may be controlled through the bus voltage control process of
the first to fourth embodiments.        The inverter and the
conversion devices are separately operated through the bus
voltage control process to maintain a constant voltage of
                                    15
3577532v1

the bus line.
[0051]        The fifth embodiment has the advantage described
below.
          (6) In the fifth embodiment, the system
interconnection inverter unit 22      includes the terminal
blocks 225 corresponding to the conversion devices 211 to
215.     This allows the conversion devices 211 to 215 to be
arranged in accordance with the state        (installed number) of
the distributed power supplies 10 located in each household
and connected to the system interconnection inverter unit
22.    This facilitates customization during the installation
and addition and elimination after the installation.
[0052]        Sixth Embodiment
         A sixth embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig.      6. In the fifth embodiment, the system
interconnection inverter unit 22      includes the multiple
terminal blocks     225.  In the sixth embodiment, the bus line
is configured to combine DC inputs and outputs to and from
the system interconnection inverter unit 22 into one system.
Same configurations will not be repeatedly described in
detail.
[0053]        As shown in Fig. 6, a DC connection unit 24,     which
serves as a DC connection unit, is       located between the
created/stored energy conversion unit 21        and the system
interconnection inverter unit 22.       The DC connection unit 24
includes a terminal block 241 for connecting the system
interconnection inverter unit 22      and a plurality of terminal
blocks 242 connected to the terminal block 241.
[0054]        Each terminal block 242 is   connected to one of the
conversion devices 211 to 215, which are connected to the
distributed power supplies 10.       Also, in this case, the
inverter and the conversion devices may be controlled
through the bus voltage control process of the first to
                                  16
3577532v1

fourth embodiments.
[0055]        The sixth embodiment has the advantage described
below.
          (7) In the sixth embodiment, the DC connection unit 24
is located between the system interconnection inverter unit
22   and the conversion devices 211 to 215.      Thus, even when
the system interconnection inverter unit 22 has few input
terminals,      the multiple conversion devices 211 to 215 may be
connected and the distributed power supplies 10 are
effectively used.
[0056]        Seventh Embodiment
         A seventh embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 7.       In the sixth embodiment, the
created/stored energy conversion unit 21       and the system
interconnection inverter unit 22       are connected by the DC
connection unit 24.       In the seventh embodiment, the
created/stored energy conversion unit 21       includes a terminal
block that combines DC outputs into one system.        Same
configurations will not be repeatedly described in detail.
[0057]        As  shown in Fig. 7, the created/stored energy
conversion unit 21 includes a terminal block 217 that is
connected to the conversion devices 211 to 215.        The system
interconnection inverter unit 22       includes a terminal block
225 that is      connected to the terminal block 217.   Also, in
this case,      the inverter and the conversion devices may be
controlled through the bus voltage control process of the
first to fourth embodiments.
[0058]        The seventh embodiment has   the advantage described
below.
          (8) In the seventh embodiment, the created/stored
energy conversion unit 21       includes the terminal block 217
connected to the multiple conversion devices 211 to 215.
Thus, when the system interconnection inverter unit 22        is
                                   17
3577532v1

connected to the created/stored energy conversion unit 21,
the multiple conversion devices may be connected and the
distributed power supplies 10 are effectively used.
[0059]       Eighth Embodiment
         An eighth embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 8.      In the seventh embodiment, the
created/stored energy conversion unit 21      includes the
terminal block 217 that combines DC outputs into one system.
In the eighth embodiment, the created/stored energy
conversion unit 21 combines a plurality of common
distributed power supplies into one system.       Same
configurations will not be repeatedly described in detail.
[0060]       As  shown in Fig. 8, a created/stored energy
conversion unit 21a for solar battery panels       includes
conversion devices 211 for each solar battery panel 11.        The
created/stored energy conversion unit 21a combines multiple
inputs of common distributed power into one system and
supplies the combined common distributed power from the
terminal block.      In the same manner, created/stored energy
conversion units 21b to 21e are arranged for the storage
battery 12,     the fuel battery 13,  the EV 14, and the PHV 15,
respectively.      The created/stored energy conversion units
21b to 21e include the conversion devices 212 to 215
corresponding to the respective distributed power supplies
10.    The system interconnection inverter unit 22     includes a
plurality of terminal blocks 225.       The terminal blocks 225
are respectively connected to the created/stored energy
conversion units 21a to 21e.      Also, in this case, the
inverter and the conversion devices may be controlled
through the bus voltage control process of the first to
fourth embodiments.
[0061]       The eighth embodiment has the advantage described
below.
                                  18
3577532v1

          (9) In the eighth embodiment, the created/stored
energy conversion unit 21a includes the multiple conversion
devices 211 respectively connected to a plurality of common
distributed power supplies 10.         This allows the
created/stored energy conversion unit 21a to connect the
multiple common distributed power supplies to the system
interconnection inverter unit 22.
[0062]        Ninth Embodiment
         A ninth embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig.      9.  In the eighth embodiment, the system
interconnection inverter unit 22        is  connected to the
commercial      system 70 by the house distribution board 30.      In
the ninth embodiment, a self-contained distribution board 32
is arranged in addition to the house distribution board 30.
Same configurations will not be repeatedly described in
detail.
[0063]        As  shown in Fig. 9, the system interconnection
inverter unit 22      includes two system terminals, namely, Ti,
T2.    The terminals Ti,    T2 each include a switch portion Qi
or a switch portion Q2 that is        connected to the inverter
221.     The output of the terminal Ti     is  connected to the
commercial      system 70 by the house distribution board 30.
The terminal T2 functions as a self-contained output
terminal and is      connected to the self-contained distribution
board 32 by a power switch unit 31.          The power switch unit
31 is     also connected to the house distribution board 30.
When detecting a power outage of the commercial system 70,
the power switch unit 31       switches the system output to the
self-contained output.       When detecting a recovery of the
commercial      system 70, the power switch unit 31    switches the
self-contained output to the system output.
[0064]        The ninth embodiment has the advantage described
below.
                                   19
3577532v1

          (10)    In the ninth embodiment, the system
interconnection inverter unit 22           includes two system
outputs.       One system of the system interconnection inverter
unit 22     is    connected to the self-contained distribution
board 32 by the power switch unit 31.            This allows for power
supply to the household load from the distributed power
supplies 10 during a power outage of the commercial system
70.
[0065]         Tenth Embodiment
         A tenth embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 10.          In the ninth embodiment, the self
contained distribution board 32           is arranged in addition to
the house distribution board 30.            In the tenth embodiment,
the system interconnection inverter unit is formed by a DC
output portion.         Same configurations will not be repeatedly
in detail.
[0066]         As   shown in Fig. 10,    the bus line includes a
terminal T3 connected by a switch portion Q3,               and DC output
is  performed.        Additionally,   when a step-down      converter is
connected to the switch portion Q3, voltage of the step-down
converter may be supplied from the terminal T3.
[0067]         The tenth embodiment has the advantage described
below.
          (11)    In the tenth embodiment, the bus line includes
the terminal T3 connected by the switch portion Q3.                Thus,
DC power of the bus line may be supplied to an external
device and used by a DC device.
[0068]         Eleventh Embodiment
         An eleventh embodiment will now be described with
reference to Fig. 11.          In the tenth embodiment, the system
interconnection inverter unit 22           includes the DC output
portion.       In   the eleventh embodiment,    a plurality     of power
conversion systems 20         is  linked.   Same configurations will
                                       20
3577532v1

not be repeatedly described in detail.
[0069]         As  shown in Fig. 11,    the terminals T3 of the
system interconnection inverter units 22           of the power
conversion systems 20         are connected to each other.      In this
case, each power conversion system 20          includes a control
unit that provides a signal indicating state            information of
the power conversion system 20.           The signal may be output,
for example, through power line communication using the bus
line.      The signal    output may be performed, for example,
through power line communication using the bus line.              The
control unit of each system interconnection inverter unit 22
controls the voltage of the bus line based on the state
information obtained from another power conversion system
20.    When the distributed power supplies 10 for storing
energy have been fully charged into one system, the energy
storage means        (e.g., storage battery 12 and PHV 15)
connected to another power conversion system 20            are charged.
Additionally, when the stored energy of the distributed
power supplies 10 is         insufficient, power is obtained from
the energy storage means         (e.g., storage battery 12     and PHV
15)   connected to another power conversion system 20.
[0070]         The eleventh embodiment has     the advantage
described below.
          (12)  In the eleventh embodiment, the multiple power
conversion systems 20         are connected together by the
terminals      T3.   Thus,  the power conversion    systems 20
cooperate with one another using DC.           Such cooperation
ensures redundancy of created energy and stored energy.
[0071]         The first to eleventh embodiments may be modified
as follows.
          In each embodiment, the created/stored energy
conversion unit 21 and the system interconnection inverter
unit 22      communicate with each other through wire
                                      21
3577532v1

communication using a communication line or power line
communication.     However, the communication means is not
limited to wire communication and may be wireless
communication.
[0072]       In each embodiment, the power conversion system 20
is connected to the commercial       system 70 by the house
distribution board 30.     The power conversion system 20
supplies and obtains power to and from the commercial system
70.    The power conversion system 20 may correspond to demand
response.     In demand response, a power consumption pattern
is changed to limit power used by a consumer based on the
power price and the system reliability.
[0073]       More specifically, the system interconnection
inverter unit 22    stores information related to a power
consumption amount.     The system interconnection inverter
unit 22    controls use of the distribution power supplies to
reduce the electricity price based on the power consumption
amount and the electricity price system.        For example, if
the electricity price rises when the consumption amount of
power supplied from the commercial       system 70  increases, the
household load uses energy that is created and stored by the
distributed power supplies.     When the electricity price is
low, priority is    given to energy storage in the distributed
power supplies 10 with power from the commercial system 70.
[0074]       In each embodiment, the created/stored energy
conversion unit 21 and the system interconnection inverter
unit 22    are connected directly or by the DC connection unit
24.    A power interruption means may be located between the
created/stored energy conversion unit 21       and the system
interconnection inverter unit 22.        The configuration of the
eighth embodiment including a power interruption means will
now be described.
[0075]       As shown in Fig. 12,   breakers 25 are located
                                  22
