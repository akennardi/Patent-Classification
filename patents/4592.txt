BACKGROUND
Field of the Disclosure
[0002] The present disclosure relates to insulated modular containers modified for high-yield
plant production.
Description of Related Art
[0003] The need for fresh food is growing as the population increases and changes in the climate
impact growing seasons. The current food supply model is economically and environmentally
unsustainable because of traditional farming methods and shipping. Operations are usually
located in agricultural areas, which still require transportation to distribute their produce. These
types of operations require large upfront costs and rely on larger acreage, and have high
operational costs from seed to sale. For example, sending fresh food an average of 1500 miles is
extremely complicated and adds major expense to a customer's supply chain.
[0004] Urban/local agriculture is not the solution as it has the problem of commercial viability.
First, there is limited growing space to meet a high demand. Second, high start-up costs of
greenhouses and rooftop greenhouses make local crop production impossible for most
businesses. For example, structures must be evaluated by structural engineers and often require
additional bracing to support the weight. Operational costs of commercial agriculture also
require additional labor and infrastructural costs. Third, urban gardens must survey and address
contaminated soil which is further costly and time consuming. Offsite operations require

                                                     2
additional labor and supplies to reach the same volume, and re-packaging and shipping is an
added operating cost.
[0005] Hydroponics systems are not the general solution either as most systems are meant to be
installed in agricultural settings, are not easily transportable, and require years of education and
training.
[0006] It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved system for plant production.
In particular, it would be desirable to provide a system for high-yield plant production which
substantially overcomes or at least ameliorates one or more of the above disadvantages.

DESCRIPTION
[0037] The preferred embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a system and method
for modifying a modular container for high-yield plant production in any of a variety of
environments. In one embodiment, a hydroponic system can expand to fit any space, and be

                                                  7
subsequently started and operated by an individual with minimal training. Another embodiment
allows the user to monitor and modify the environment and feeding conditions in order to
provide optimal growth conditions for the specific type of plant being grown.
[0038] Figure 1 shows a perspective view of the outside of illustrative container 102 according
to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In another embodiment, container 102 can also
include a water reclamation system (not shown). Container 102 can be a recycled shipping
container with standard transnational grade intermodal perishable food-grade insulation foam
sandwiched between the steel walls of container 102. Container 102 is also sealed in order to
create a solid modular frame for expansion, as well as a controlled growing environment for
plants.
[0039] In some embodiments, container 102 can be modified to include a solar array 104 to
harness solar energy and store it in a converter or batteries for later use. One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize that other energy efficient solutions, such as insulation paint or planting
additional crops on top of and around container 102, can also be incorporated into container 102
to make it even more energy efficient. Other renewable energy technologies, such as forms of
solar and wind power, could also be added to increase functionality. All of these components
can be relocated within the unit, outside the unit, on top of the unit, or next to the unit, to
increase space, efficiency, and/or ease of access.
[0040] Figures 2-3 show perspective views of a growing system inside the container in Figure 1
according to some embodiments of the disclosure. In some embodiments, growing system 200
can include germination station 202, climate control system 204, LED lighting system 206,
vertical racks 304, and an irrigation system 1800. Germination station 202 includes preparation
section 210 and nutrient section 212. Referring to Figure 10, germination station 202 is shown
in more detail. Preparation section 210 is configured to hold trays 1002 while they are loaded
with a medium 1008 that is optimal for seed germination, such as rockwool cubes. In other
embodiments of the disclosure, medium 1008 includes an organic substance such as peat, pine
bark, sawdust, and rice hulls. In yet other embodiments of the disclosure, medium 1008 includes
a petroleum-based substance such as polymeric foams or plastic beads. In other embodiments,
medium 1008 includes inorganic substances that are mineral-based, such as sand, gravel and
perlite. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that almost any material that supports a
root system, other than soil, can be considered a suitable material for medium 1008.

                                                 8
[0041] Once the seeds have been placed in medium 1008, tray 1002 is placed in nutrient section
212 until the seeds have germinated. Figure 10 shows trays 1004 and 1006 placed in nutrient
section 212. Tray 1004 includes seeds that have germinated into plants while tray 1006 includes
seeds that have just been placed into medium 1008 and have not yet germinated. Nutrient
section 212 provides an optimal environment for seed germination by providing light and
water/nutrients via irrigation tubes 1010. In some embodiments, germination station 202 utilizes
the same type of irrigation system and lighting system that will be discussed later for plants held
in vertical racks 304.
[0042] Figure 4 shows a front elevational view of the illustrative racks shown in Figure 3.
Vertical racks 304 can include grow channel 402, grow medium 404, and plants 406. When the
seeds have germinated into plants 406, they are taken out of nutrient section 212, placed into
grow channel 402 and packed in with grow medium 404. In some embodiments, grow medium
404 is ZIPGROWTM medium (Bright Agrotech LLC, Laramie, Wyoming), which is a reusable
synthetic mesh/sponge that slides into grow channel 402 as two halves that come together as
they are pulled into grow channel 402. Grow medium 404 is configured to hold the root system
of the plants in place.
[0043] Vertical racks 304 can be placed in any configuration within container 102 and are
configured to hold grow channels 402 in place. Grow channel 402 is removably mounted into
vertical rack 304 so that grow channel 402 can be easily removed, replanted, harvested and
otherwise worked on without screwing/unscrewing, clipping/unclipping or otherwise changing
any parts. In some embodiments, grow channels 402 can be ZIPGROWTM grow channels
(Bright Agrotech LLC, Laramie, Wyoming), which utilize vertical hydroponic/aquaponic PVC
constructed channels. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other grow
channels could be used. Each grow channel 402 includes an exterior part and an interior part.
The exterior part can hang from ceiling 302 of container 102 for example, by using a pin. The
interior part is similarly hung from ceiling 302 of container 102, and can be mounted on an L
shaped bracket that is coupled to ceiling 302. The bottom of both the interior and exterior
channels sit in a return channel (not shown) mounted on the floor of container 102. In an
exemplary configuration, grow channels 402 are hung vertically in racks 304, side by side, in
four rows. In this exemplary configuration, two rows are on the left side and two rows are on the
right side, with the open plant growth channels facing in toward each other where the LED
lighting system 206 is located. The vertical configuration of racks 304 is important as it is more

                                                     9
space efficient than horizontal racks. For example, in some embodiments of the disclosure, 12
20 plants can be placed in one vertical rack spanning from the floor to the ceiling, and these
plants would only need five lights and a single irrigation tube. Furthermore, the vertical
configuration of racks 304 eliminates standing water and maintains a high flow rate in order to
prevent most problems that are currently associated with commercial hydroponics, such as algae
growth, bacteria growth, and irrigation clogging.
[0044] The combined configuration of racks 304 and plants 404 is also important. In
embodiments of the disclosure, plants 404 are placed in vertical racks 304 so that plants 404
grow radially outward from the axes of racks 304. This configuration provides several
advantages over the traditional tray or shelf grow model where plants are simply placed within a
horizontal tray or on a horizontal shelf. For example, the traditional tray/shelf configuration
causes large areas of uncontrolled standing water. Not only is this not ideal, but it also allows for
massive evaporation and requires additional equipment to control humidity. The traditional
tray/shelf configuration also typically utilizes a low flow rate. However, a low flow rate
encourages algae/bacteria growth and also requires the use of additional equipment to aerate the
solution in order to increase its oxygen content. A low oxygen content level would otherwise
stunt plant growth. In contrast, the configuration described in embodiments of the disclosure
allow for a single point of standing water (nutrient reservoir 1802) that is controlled, filtered and
sterilized. By minimizing the exposed water, the configuration can eliminate evaporation and
the need for large humidity control equipment. The configuration allows for a high flow rate of
solution, which minimizes any algae or bacteria growth and creates a high level of oxygen for
increased plant growth.
[0045] Furthermore, in the traditional tray/shelf system, the root system is constantly exposed to
flowing water, which can cause roots to rot while also preventing airflow through the root
structure. The traditional tray/shelf system also has limited space and is not flexible to
accommodate various sizes of plants, so smaller plants do not necessarily utilize all of the space
allocated to them or might get crowded out by larger plants. In contrast, the configuration in
embodiments of the disclosure where plants grow radially outward from vertical racks forces
plants to fight multiple stimuli (e.g., air, gravity, light) to create compact, strong stems with a
robust and compact root structure. Furthermore, the flexible plant spacing allows for a
maximum number of plants per rack, no matter how large or small the plant.

                                                   10
[0046] The LED lighting system 206 is configured to provide artificial light in a controlled
manner for the growth of the plants. In the some embodiments, LED lighting system 206 can
utilize five foot long PHILIPS (Amsterdam, Netherlands) LED light bars of Deep Red/Blue 150
110 V grow lights. In one configuration, the light bars are mounted horizontally in a back-to
back configuration in two rows, one on each side in between the rows of grow channels 402 that
face each other, as shown in Figure 3. In some embodiments, each section of the LED light bars
can be mounted with four back-to-back sets vertically and hung on wires 208. Each section of
wire 208 can then be mounted onto rotating motor 208 on ceiling 302 to pull LED lighting
system 206 up and out of the way (like a window shade) for access to the grow channels 402 for
removal and work. LED lighting system 206 is further configured to be controlled separately so
that lighting in each section of the growing station can be turned on or off, dimmed, or lifted up
or down. Figure 11 shows a front elevational view of the illustrative growing system shown in
Figure 2. Specifically, Figure 11 shows the exemplary back-to-back sets of LED lighting system
206, hung on wires 208, in between sections of vertical racks 304. The configuration of LED
lighting system 206 maximizes space efficiency by using less equipment while simultaneously
maximizing the plants' exposure to lights at the right wavelength and spectrum. By maximizing
space efficiency, growing system 200 can achieve high plant yields while maintaining relatively
low costs and a size that can still fit a modular shipping container. Figure 11 also shows plants
406 growing radially outward from the grow channels (not shown), which are being held by
racks 304.
[0047] In other embodiments of the disclosure, and as shown in Figures 14-15, LED lighting
system 206 can utilize light curtain system 1400 comprising eight foot long PHILIPS
(Amsterdam, Netherlands) Interlighting Strips 1402. Strips 1402 preferably comprise LED
diodes inside a waterproof coating. In an embodiment of the disclosure, conversion box 1404 is
coupled to ceiling 302 of container 102, and strips 1402 are coupled to conversion box 1404 so
that they hang downward toward the floor of container 102. Strips 1402 can be joined together,
or they can hang with predetermined spacing between each other in order to disperse light
through plants 406. There are multiple advantages to using the configuration of light curtain
system 1400 which cannot be utilized in other lighting systems. For example, light curtain
system 1400 can be used in multiple orientations and can be easily modified for different stages
in plant growth and/or for different types of plants being grown in a particular space. This
flexibility allows for a more efficient work and grow space, and increases the variety of crops
that can be grown. For example, such a configuration eliminates the need for wires, pulleys, or

                                                  11
bulking infrastructure that is otherwise necessary for a lighting system. In some embodiments of
the disclosure, each strip 1402 hangs freely, can be pushed aside like a bead curtain, and can be
easily removed and/or replaced with a simple watertight twist-lock so that an electrician is not
needed. In some embodiments of the disclosure, strips 1402 can be upgraded/replaced/changed
with new strips with better diodes or diodes that that allow for different spectrums of light based
on the crop being grown. Another advantage of light curtain system 1400 is that conversion box
1404 allows for central conversion of AC to DC power. There is electrical waste each time
current is converted from AC to DC, so a single point of conversion increases efficiency of the
system. Furthermore, a single point of conversion at conversion box 1404 can allow for
increased control of each section so that the lights can be turned up or down to accommodate the
stage or type of growth of plants in a particular section.
[0048] In some embodiments, irrigation system 1800 is used to deliver a water/nutrient solution
to the plants. Figure 12 shows a perspective view and Figure 18 shows a schematic view of the
illustrative irrigation system 1800. Irrigation system 1800 can include nutrient reservoir 1802,
nutrient doser (not shown), first set of tubing 1202, second set of tubing 1204, a pump (not
shown), drip emitters (not shown), and return gutters 1804. In some embodiments, nutrient
reservoir 1802 can be a 330 gallon tank with a reverse osmosis filter. Nutrient reservoir 1802
can be coupled to a nutrient doser (not shown), which controls the flow of nutrients into nutrient
reservoir 1802 in order to maintain specific nutrient levels prescribed by the user.
[0049] The nutrient doser (not shown) is programmable to provide different levels and types of
nutrients depending on the type of plant being grown for optimal growth. The nutrient doser (not
shown) can control all types of nutrients, such as, for example, phosphates, nitrates, trace
minerals. The nutrient doser (not shown) can also be configured to control and maintain
characteristics of the water/nutrient solution such as pH and acidity based on prescribed levels
by the user. In some embodiments of the disclosure, the nutrient doser (not shown) is configured
to use a simple one-part nutrient solution, while giving more advanced users the option to
experiment with additives and trace minerals based on desired characteristics of plant growth
and taste.
[0050] Irrigation system 1800 can also include a first set and second set of tubing 1202 and
1204 for delivery of water/nutrient solution to grow channels 402 in racks 304. First set of
tubing 1202 can be one-half inch tubing coupled to ceiling 302 of container 102, and can carry

                                                  12
water/nutrient solution from nutrient reservoir 1802 to each section of grow channels 402.
Second set of tubing 1204 can be one-quarter inch tubing that carries water/nutrient solution
from each section of grow channels 402 to each individual grow channel 402 in rack 304. The
sizes of the tubing are exemplary only and can be modified and adjusted by one of ordinary skill
in the art. Furthermore, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that one set of tubing, or
more than two sets of tubing, could be used as well. A pump (not shown) can be utilized at the
point of origin at nutrient reservoir 1802 to regulate the rate of water/nutrient flow through first
set of tubing 1202. Drip emitters (not shown) may also be affixed to the ends of the second set
of tubing 1204 to control the water/nutrient flow at the point of release into each grow channel
402.
[0051] In some embodiments, return gutters 1804 are utilized to catch unused water/nutrient
solution that flows through grow channel 402 and return it to nutrient reservoir 1802. Return
gutters 1804 can be coupled to the floor of the container 102 and can be positioned beneath
and/or integrated with the terminating section of grow channel 402. In some embodiments, the
collected unused water/nutrient solution flows downhill through return gutters 1804 and back
into nutrient reservoir 1802. Alternatively, a collection point/return tank can accumulate the
unused nutrient solution and utilize a pump to transport the solution back to the reservoir.
[0052] In order to control the internal environment of container 102, the hydroponic system can
include climate control system 204 (Fig. 2) that can measure and control humidity, carbon
dioxide levels, temperature, and other related environmental factors.
[0053] In some embodiments, the hydroponic system also can include a ventilation system
having a main fan and a plurality of intermittent fans. Figures 5 and 13 show perspective views
of a ventilation system according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The
ventilation system can include main fans 502, intermittent fans 1302, and air vents 504. External
air is taken in by main fans 502 at one end of container 102, is pushed through container 102 via
intermittent fans 1302, and then exhausted from container 102 at the opposite end. Intake air is
preferable run through several High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) charcoal filters at main
fans 502 and exhaust air is preferably run through micro screen charcoal filters. In some
embodiments, ventilation system utilizes additional air vents 504 coupled to ceiling 302 of
container 102 to create a dual airflow system. Current greenhouse solutions, such as direct fans,
indirect fans, and mass ventilation/exhaust systems were tested, but all were inferior to the dual

                                                   13
airflow system in the present disclosure. The dual airflow system is generated from the vertical
air flow from vents 504 and horizontal air flow from main fans 502 and intermittent fans 1302.
In other embodiments of the disclosure, additional fans and/or vents are positioned in or on the
floor of container 102 to blow air vertically from the ground up between rows of racks 304.
Providing air flow in more than one direction is preferable in order to further create actual
conditions that plants would encounter outdoors. Furthermore, the chaotic and random air flow
patterns that are generated stimulate the plants and force them to grow stronger and denser stems
and leaves. The dual airflow system is not possible with traditional horizontal rack systems
because the racks would block the vertical flow of air and each rack would need its own
fan/airflow source. In contrast, in embodiments of the disclosure, the vertical configuration of
the racks along with the added vertical flow of air allows for air flow through the plant stems
and maintains a constant flow throughout dense vegetation. Furthermore, the added vertical air
flow, on top of the existing horizontal air flow, directly cools lighting while also providing an
ideal level of stress to the plants, creating stronger cell walls in the plants. Stronger cell walls
allow for a stronger root structure, which can support the growth of larger plants.
[0054] In another embodiment of the disclosure shown in Figure 19, the ventilation system can
also include tube 1902, which spans along the floor of container 102 in any direction. In one
embodiment of the disclosure, tube 1902 is positioned between, and is parallel to, gutters 1804.
Tube 1902 includes end 1904, which is configured to receive a fan unit (not shown), as well as
perforations (not shown) along the length of tube 1902. When the fan unit (not shown) is turned
on, air is circulated along the length of tube 1902, and is released upward through the
perforations (not shown) along tube 1902 as an alternative or additional vertical air source. One
of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that air can flow vertically from either the ceiling to
the floor, or from the floor to the ceiling, of container 102. One of ordinary skill in the art would
also recognize that air flow in the horizontal and vertical directions is just an example and the
embodiment is not limited to only two directions, nor is it limited to those two particular
directions.
[0055] In some embodiments, the components in container 102 can be coupled to monitoring
system 600. Figure 6 shows an illustrative system diagram of monitoring system 600 and Figure
7 shows a front elevational view of monitoring system 600. Monitoring system 600 can include
control center 602, CPU interface 604, and wireless interface 606 to allow user 608 to access the
system remotely. Control center 602 preferably monitors and controls all of the components

                                                  14
based on specifications set by user 608. For example, control center 602 can monitor climate
control system 204 and change humidity, carbon dioxide levels, temperature, and other factors
in order to remain within user-specified measurements. In another example, control center 602 is
coupled to LED lighting system 206 to control lighting based on various factors, such as time of
day. In yet another example, control center 602 is coupled to irrigation system 1800 to ensure
that the proper nutrient concentration for a specific crop is being maintained in nutrient reservoir
1802. Control center 602 can also monitor and control the amount of solution being dripped
onto specific sections of grow channels 402, or specific grow channels 402 themselves. In yet
another example, control center 602 can be coupled to the ventilation system to ensure the
proper airflow is being maintained for various sections of plants. The above are just illustrative
examples of components that can be monitored and controlled in order to ensure maintenance of
optimal growing conditions specified by the user.
[0056] CPU interface 604 allows user 608 to have direct access to control center 602, and
wireless interface 606 allows user 608 to have remote access to control center 602. Either
connection allows user 608 to modify any pre-set levels, override pre-set levels, or simply
monitor activity in container 102. Wireless interface 606 allows for control center 602 to
provide remote alerts to user 608, giving user 608 the ability to change or override any preset
characteristics. Referring to Figure 8, an example of data 800 available to user 608 is shown. For
example, available data 800 includes summary data 802 and input protocol data 804. Summary
data 802 can provide user 608 with data on environmental conditions and plant growth. Input
protocol data 804 is more flexible, and allows user 608 to input data to change environmental
conditions or component performance.
[0057] Figures 16-17 show examples of the types of data that can be remotely monitored and
controlled via monitoring system 600. For example, Figure 16A illustrates various vent cycle
characteristics 1601 that can be remotely set and modified with respect to the vents in an
embodiment of the disclosure. Figure 16B shows examples of various systems that can be
remotely monitored and controlled. As shown in Figure 16B, when a system is selected, an
exemplary set of icons 1602, 1604, 1606, pertaining to the selected system are displayed. For
example, if the tank pump system is selected, an embodiment of monitoring system 1600 might
display relationship icon 1602, cycle icon 1604, and alarm icon 1606. Relationship icon 1602
describes the relationship that has been set up to determine what conditions must occur for a
corresponding action to be triggered. Cycle icon 1604 allows the user to specify the number or

                                                   15
frequency of cycles to run a particular system. Alarm icon 1606 allows the user to specify the
scenarios for which monitoring system 600 should alert the user for a particular system. Figures
17A-F illustrate screenshots of various other types of remote monitoring that can be utilized by
the user. Figure 17A shows a screen shot of exemplary air and water data that can be reported to
the user. Such data can include air temperature 1702, air flow 1704, carbon dioxide levels 1706,
water temperature 1708, pH level 1710, and nutrient conductivity 1712. 17B shows a live video
feed 1714 of sweet basil plants. Monitoring system 600 can also provide video feeds of other
zones of crops being grown in container 102 in order to allow a user to monitor different zones
of different crops or different zones of the same crop. Figure 17C shows an example of alarm
function 1716 in monitoring system 600. In this example, the user has configured alarm function
1716 to notify the user when the air temperature has exceeded 82 degrees F or has dropped
below 64 degrees F. Figure 17D illustrates additional systems 1718 that can be remotely
monitored and controlled, Figure 17E shows systems 1720 that can be monitored by cycles, and
17F shows an example of the controls 1722 for setting cycles for a particular system.
[0058] In another embodiment, the wireless connection in wireless interface 606 allows for an
additional party, such as off-site harvest expert or hydroponics expert 610, to communicate with
user 608 and review all of the data and conditions that are available to user 608.
[0059] One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the monitoring system could
monitor, control, and change any additional components that affect the environment or feeding
conditions. In order to maintain conditions or provide alerts, control center 602 can include
algorithms relating to environmental conditions prescribed by the user. In one embodiment,
control center 602 utilizes a series of if-then relationships to maintain optimal conditions. For
example, if humidity within container 102 falls below a set limit, for example, 60%, then control
center 602 activates the humidifier until the humidity level stabilizes. In another example, if the
temperature within container 102 rises above a set limit, for example, 85 degrees F or falls
below a set limit, for example, 66 degrees F, then control center 602 activates climate control
system 204 until the temperature stabilizes. Monitoring system 600 can also be configured to
capture visual records of plant growth, and record and report all data points for conditions that
the monitoring system controls. The system may also be configured to issue alerts based on the
if-then relationships described above to alert the user of system failures, changes in conditions,
or other variations from levels prescribed by the user. All of these variables can be changed
based on the crop desired and the optimal environmental and feeding conditions for that crop.

                                                  16
[0060] In one embodiment, assembly of the hydroponic unit starts with obtaining a new or used
insulated shipping container 102 that implements vents on each door and preferably has vents on
each wall. In one example, there is an average of one vent per ten feet. An electrical panel, such
as a 200 amp, 240 volt panel, can be coupled to one of the walls of container 102 for power. A
Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) unit or other climate control unit 204 and
main fan 502 can also be coupled to one of the walls of container 102. Intermittent fans 1302
can be installed every ten to twenty feet to allow for proper air circulation.
[0061] Racks 304 for the growing system can then be installed within container 102, followed
by grow channels 402. Grow channels 402 and racks 304 can be configured vertically in order to
increase plant yield and improve usability. However, the grow channels 402 and racks 402 can
be moved, changed and/or reconfigured to increase the efficiency of the interior space. Once
these systems are assembled, they are connected to the nutrient reservoirs 1802, dosers (not
shown), and other components of the irrigation system. The LED lighting system 206 is then set
up at a proper distance from the growing system to allow for optimum conditions for plant
production. Climate control system 204 and monitoring system 600 can then be installed within
container 102 to ensure that all of the necessary components are being controlled and monitored.
Cameras can also be installed and connected to the CPU to ensure that a live feed or time-lapse
pictures can be provided to a remote user.
[0062] Figure 9 shows an illustrative flow diagram of the process 900 for growing plants in an
embodiment of the invention. In step 902, seeds are placed into germination medium 1008 and
provided with nutrients for a specified duration of time until they have germinated into plants. In
step 904, the plants are removed from germination medium 1008. In steps 906-908, the plants
are packed into the grow medium 404 and placed in grow channels 402. In step 910, grow
channels 402 are coupled into vertical racks 304 so that the plants grow radially outward from
the axes of vertical racks 304. In step 912, the user programs control center 602 with specific
environmental conditions to be monitoring and maintained. In steps 914-920, control center 602
drives exemplary environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, lighting,
nutrients/water, and airflow so that they are all within levels prescribed by the user. Once the
plants have either spent a specified duration of time in racks 304 or grown to a specified size,
they are then removed from racks 304 and grow channels 402 in step 922.

                                                   17
[0063] The hydroponic system can be configured to produce all plants other than crops that are
grown for their edible roots, i.e., root crops. For example, the hydroponic system can produce:
all types of lettuce; all types of herbs such as basil, oregano, mint, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and
chive; all types of leafy greens such as kale, chard, spinach and arugula; all vine crops such as
strawberries, tomatoes, and peppers; cucumbers; and mushrooms. One of ordinary skill in the art
would recognize that these are just examples of non-root crops, and the disclosure is not meant
to be limited to these exemplary crops only. The hydroponic system can also be configured to
utilize fish tanks in order to raise various forms of seafood, such as fish, shrimp and lobsters.
[0064] The disclosed system can provide a high efficiency output as plants can be harvested and
new plants can begin the cycle all in the same space at the same time. In one example, the
compact design of the hydroponic system provides approximately 65x output of traditional
farming in a 40x8 container that is easily implemented into different environments. In another
example of an embodiment, one acre of the disclosed hydroponic system provides an annual
yield of approximately 1,960,200 heads of lettuce while one acre of traditional agricultural
farming provides an annual yield of approximately 30,000 heads of lettuce. In another example,
one acre of the disclosed hydroponic system provides an annual yield of approximately 354,925
pounds of basil while one acre of traditional agricultural farming provides an annual yield of
approximately 32,500 pounds of basil. In yet another example, 320 square feet of the disclosed
hydroponic system provides an annual yield of approximately 24,000 heads of lettuce while 320
square feet of traditional greenhouse farming produces an annual yield of approximately 6,800
heads of lettuce. Not only does the disclosed hydroponic system in the previous examples
provide a much higher annual yield of crops, but it is also able to do so with fewer resources.
For example, one acre of the disclosed hydroponic system utilizes approximately 163,350
gallons of water annually while one acre of traditional agricultural farming utilizes
approximately 488,772 gallons of water annually.
[0065] Although the above description describes embodiments of the invention, it should be
understood that the techniques and concepts are applicable to growing systems in general. Thus
the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or
essential characteristics thereof.
[0066] While the above describes a particular order of operations performed by a given
embodiment of the invention, it should be understood that such order is exemplary, as

                                                  18
alternative embodiments may perform the operations in a different order, combine certain
operations, overlap certain operations, or the like. References in the specification to a given
embodiment indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure,
or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature,
structure, or characteristic.
[0067] While the present invention has been described in the context of a method or process, the
present invention also relates to apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus
may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general-purpose
computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.
Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium including,
without limitation, any type of disk including optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical
disks, read-only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), magnetic or optical cards, or
any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.
