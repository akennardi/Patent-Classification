                         ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
An electric vehicle charging station network server which manages a plurality of
charging stations receives subscriber notification message preferences for a
subscriber (e.g., electric vehicle operator) which indicate one or more events of
interest that the subscriber wishes to receive notification messages for. A set of one
or more contact points associated with the subscriber is also received. The server
authorizes the subscriber to use one of the plurality of charging stations. The server
receives data associated with the subscriber from that one of the charging stations
which indicates that a charging session has been established for an electric vehicle
associated with the subscriber. The server detects an event of interest for the
subscriber and transmits a notification message for that event to at least one of the
set of contact points associated with the subscriber.

 Transmitting Notification Messages for an Electric Vehicle Charging Network
BACKGROUND
Related Application
[0001]     Incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, is PCT/US2010/024496
(published as W02010/096502), filed on 17 February 2010.
Field
[0001a]          Embodiments of the invention relate to the field of charging electric
vehicles, and more specifically to transmitting notification messages for an electric
vehicle charging network.
Background
[0002] Charging stations are typically used to provide charging points for electric
vehicles (e.g., electric battery powered vehicles, gasoline/electric battery powered
vehicle hybrid, etc.). Since vehicles with electric batteries must periodically
recharge their electric battery(ies) (or other electricity storage devices such as
supercapacitors), charging stations provide convenient access for that charging. For
example, charging stations may be located in designated charging locations (e.g.,
similar to locations of gas stations), parking spaces (e.g., public parking spaces
and/or private parking space), etc.
[0003] A typical charging station includes a power receptacle to receive an
electrical plug (coupled with the battery). The charging station may include a door,
which may be lockable, to cover and protect the power receptacle and prevent
unauthorized access to the power receptacle. For example, prospective customers
typically request service from the charging station (e.g., by waving a radio
frequency identification (RFID) device near a RFID receiver on the charging
station). If the customer is authorized, the door will unlock allowing the customer
to plug in their charging cord into the receptacle. The door locks when shut (with
the cord inside) which prevents an unauthorized removal of the charging cord. The
door may be unlocked by the same customer (e.g., by waving the same RFID device
near the RFID receiver on the charging station) in order to remove the charging
cord.

[0004] Electric vehicles can be recharged from a local electricity grid. These
vehicles can also be a source of electric power to be transferred to the local
electricity grid. The transfer of electricity stored in electric vehicles to the local
electric grid is referred to as vehicle-to-grid (V2G). V2G is particularly attractive

  for electric vehicles which have their own charging devices, such as battery electric
  vehicles with regenerative braking and plug-in hybrid vehicles. V2G may help meet
  demand for electricity when demand is at its highest.

  embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art
  to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other
  embodiments whether or not explicitly described.
  [0015]    In the following description and claims, the terms "coupled" and
  "connected," along with their derivatives, may be used. It should be understood that
  these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. Rather, in particular
  embodiments, "connected" may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in
  direct physical or electrical contact with each other. "Coupled" may mean that two
  or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. However, "coupled"
  may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other,
  but yet still co-operate or interact with each other.
  [0016]    The techniques shown in the figures can be implemented using code and
  data stored and executed on one or more computing devices (e.g., charging stations,
  charging station network servers, etc.). As used herein, a charging station is a piece
  of equipment, including hardware and software, to charge electric vehicles. Such
  computing devices store and communicate (internally and with other computing
  devices over a network) code and data using machine-readable media, such as
  machine storage media (e.g., magnetic disks; optical disks; random access memory;
  read only memory; flash memory devices; phase-change memory) and machine
  communication media (e.g., electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of
  propagated signals - such as carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.). In
  addition, such computing devices typically include a set of one or more processors
  coupled to one or more other components, such as a storage device, one or more
  input/output devices (e.g., a keyboard, a touchscreen, and/or a display), and a
  network connection. The coupling of the set of processors and other components is
  typically through one or more busses and bridges (also termed as bus controllers).

WO 2010/096502                                                           PCT/US2010/024496
  The storage device and signals carrying the network traffic respectively represent
  one or more machine storage media and machine communication media. Thus, the
  storage device of a given device typically stores code and/or data for execution on
  the set of one or more processors of that device. Of course, one or more parts of an
  embodiment of the invention may be implemented using different combinations of
  software, firmware, and/or hardware.
  [0017]     The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the
  drawings, which are provided as illustrative examples of the invention so as to
  enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Notably, the figures and
  examples below are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention to a single
  embodiment, but other embodiments are possible by way of interchange of some or
  all of the described or illustrated elements.
  [0018]     Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary charging system according to one
  embodiment of the invention. The charging system illustrated in Figure 1 includes
  the electric vehicle charging station 120 (hereinafter referred to as the "charging
  station 120"), which is coupled with the power grid 130 over the power line 135.
  The power grid 130 may be owned and/or operated by local utility companies or
  owned and/or operated by private persons/companies. The charging station 120 is
  also coupled with the data control unit 170 over the WPAN (Wireless Personal Area
  Network) line 175 (e.g., Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.) or other LAN (Local Area
  Network) links (e.g., Ethernet, PLC, WiFi, etc.). The data control unit 170 is
  coupled with the electric vehicle charging station network server 180 (hereinafter
  "server" 180) over the WAN (Wide Access Network) connection 185 (e.g., Cellular
  (e.g., CDMA, GPRS, etc.) WiFi Internet connection, Plain Old Telephone Service,
  leased line, etc.). The data control unit 170 relays messages between the charging
  station 120 and the server 180. According to one embodiment of the invention, the
  data control unit 170 is part of another charging station as will be described in more
  detail with reference to Figure 2.
  [0019]     The charging station 120 controls the application of electricity from the
  power grid 130 to the power receptacle 115. The power receptacle 115 may be any
  number of types of receptacles such as receptacles conforming to the NEMA
  (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) standards 5-1 5, 5-20, and 14-50 or
                                               4

WO 2010/096502                                                           PCT/US2010/024496
  other standards (e.g., BS 1363, CEE7, etc.) and may be operating at different
  voltages (e.g., 120V, 240V, 230V, etc.). According to one embodiment of the
  invention, a lockable door covers the power receptacle 115 and is locked in a closed
  position (without a cord being plugged in while the charging station 120 is not in
  use) and locked in a charging position (while a cord is plugged into the power
  receptacle during a charging session). While the door is locked in the charging
  position, the charging cord plugged into the power receptacle 115 cannot be
  removed. Only authorized vehicle operators (those authorized to use the charging
  station 120) and authorized administrative personnel can unlock the door to access
  the power receptacle 115. Thus, access to the power receptacle 115 is limited to
  authorized vehicle operators and administrative personnel (e.g., utility workers,
  operators of the charging system network, etc.). Thus, the locking door protects the
  power receptacle 115 while the charging station 120 is not in use and also prevents
  charging cords from being unplugged by unauthorized persons during charging.
  [0020]     Operators of vehicles may use the charging station 120 to charge their
  electric vehicles. For example, the electricity storage devices (e.g., batteries,
  supercapacitors, etc.) of electric vehicles (e.g., electric powered vehicles,
  gasoline/electric powered vehicle hybrids, etc.) may be charged through use of the
  charging station 120. In one embodiment of the invention, the operators of electric
  vehicles provide their own charging cord to charge their electric vehicle. For
  example, the electric vehicle operator 145 plugs the electrical connector 160 of the
  charging cord 140 into on-board charging circuitry of the electric vehicle 110
  (which is coupled with the electricity storage device of the vehicle 110) and plugs
  the electrical connector 165 of the charging cord 140 into the power receptacle 115.
  [0021]     The electric vehicle operator 145 may use the communication device 150
  to initiate and request a charging session for the electric vehicle 110. The
  communication device 150 may be a WLAN or WPAN device (e.g., one or two-way
  radio-frequency identification (RFID) device, mobile computing device (e.g.,
  laptops, palmtop, smartphone, multimedia mobile phone, cellular phone, etc.)),
  ZigBee device, etc. The communication device 150 communicates unique operator
  specific information (e.g., operator identification information, etc.) to the charging
  station 120 (either directly or indirectly through the server 180). In some
                                               5

WO 2010/096502                                                          PCT/US2010/024496
  embodiments of the invention, electric vehicle operator 145 may use the
  communication device 150 to monitor the charging status of the electric vehicle
  110. In one embodiment of the invention, the communication device 150 may be
  coupled with the electric vehicle 110.
  [0022]    Based on the information communicated by the communication device
  150, a determination is made whether the operator 145 is authorized to use the
  charging station 120 and thus may access the power receptacle 115. In one
  embodiment of the invention, the charging station 120 locally determines whether
  the operator 145 is authorized (e.g., by checking whether the operator 145 is
  represented on a list of authorized users stored in the charging station 120). In
  another embodiment of the invention, the charging station 120 may transmit an
  authorization request that includes the information read from the communication
  device 150 to the server 180 (through the data control unit 170) for authorization. In
  another embodiment of the invention, the server 180 receives the charging session
  request from the operator 145 directly and determines whether the operator 145 is
  authorized. In any of these embodiments, if the operator 145 is authorized, the
  charging station 120 energizes the power receptacle 115. Additionally, if there is a
  locked door covering the power receptacle 115, the charging station 120 unlocks
  that door to allow the operator 145 to plug in the charging cord 140.
  [0023]    It should be understood that the operator 145 may request a charging
  session from the charging station 120 differently in some embodiments of the
  invention. For example, the operator 145 may interact with a payment station
  coupled with the charging station 120, which may then send appropriate instructions
  to the charging station 120 regarding the charging of the vehicle 110 (e.g.,
  instructions to unlock the door covering the power receptacle 115, energize the
  power receptacle 115, etc.). The payment station may function similarly to a
  payment station for a parking space. In addition, the payment station coupled with
  the charging station may be used both for parking payment and charging payment.
  [0024]    According to one embodiment of the invention, a charging session is
  established after an operator has been authenticated and authorized to initiate a
  charging session (e.g., may use the charging station 120 at the particular time of the
  day), after a charging cord has been plugged into the power receptacle 115, and after
                                              6

WO 2010/096502                                                           PCT/US2010/024496
  the door to the power receptacle 115 has been closed and locked. For example, a
  charging session is established with the vehicle 110 after the operator 145 has been
  authorized, after the charging cord 140 has been plugged into the power receptacle
  115, and after the door covering the power receptacle 115 has been closed and
  locked.
  [0025]     The server 180 provides services for multiple charging stations. The
  server 180 stores vehicle operator information (e.g., operator account information,
  operator contact information (e.g., operator name, street address, email address,
  telephone number, etc.)) and typically is responsible for accounting (e.g., amount of
  electricity purchased by individual vehicle operators, etc.). In one embodiment of
  the invention, the server 180 includes a subscriber portal (available through the
  Internet) which allows subscribers (owners and operators of electric vehicles) to
  register for service (which may include providing information regarding their
  electric vehicles, providing payment information, providing contact information,
  etc.) and perform other functions (e.g., pay for charging sessions, determine
  availability of charging stations, check the charging status of their electric
  vehicle(s), etc.). In addition, the server 180 may include a host portal (available
  through the Internet) which allows owners or administrators of the charging station
  to configure their charging stations and perform other functions (e.g., determine
  average usage of charging stations, etc.). Charging stations may also be configured
  using other means (e.g., through Telnet, user interface, etc.) in some embodiments
  of the invention.
  [0026]     While Figure 1 illustrates a single charging station 120, it should be
  understood that many charging stations may be networked to the server 180
  (through one or more data control units) and/or to each other. Figure 2 illustrates an
  exemplary network of charging stations according to one embodiment of the
  invention. The charging station network 200 includes the server 180 and the
  charging stations 120, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230, and 235. The server 180 is
  providing services for each of the charging stations 120, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230,
  and 235. The charging stations 120, 210, 215, and 220 are part of the radio group
  270. The charging stations 230 and 235 are part of the radio group 280. The
  charging station 225 is the only charging station in the radio group 275. As used
                                               7

WO 2010/096502                                                          PCT/US2010/024496
  herein, a radio group is a collection of one or more charging stations that
  collectively has a single connection to a server. Each radio group includes one or
  more data control units (DCUs) which connect the charging stations with the server.
  Typically, DCUs are implemented along with a charging station. However, a data
  control unit may be implemented separately from any charging station.
  [0027]    Each DCU acts as a gateway to the server 180 for those charging stations
  that are coupled with that DCU. It should be understood that charging stations need
  not have a direct link to a DCU (e.g., a charging station may be directly linked to
  another charging station which itself has a direct link to a DCU). For example,
  DCU 170 (of the radio group 270 and implemented in the charging station 220) is
  coupled with the server 180 through the WAN link 292 and is coupled with each of
  the charging stations 120, 210, and 215. The charging stations 120 and 215 are
  directly coupled with the DCU 170 via the WPAN links 282 and 286 respectively.
  The charging station 210 is indirectly coupled with the DCU 170 via the WPAN
  link 284 to the charging station 215 which is itself directly coupled with the DCU
  170 via the WPAN link 286. Thus, the charging stations 120, 210, and 215 transmit
  messages to, and receive messages from, the server 180 via the DCU 170. The
  DCU 225 (of the radio group 275 and part of the charging station 225) is coupled
  with the server 180 through the WAN link 296. The DCU 260 (of the radio group
  280) is coupled with the server 180 through the WAN link 294 and is coupled with
  the charging station 230 via the WPAN link 288.
  [0028]    Radio groups represent the network topology of a collection of charging
  stations. Typically, these charging stations are located relatively close (e.g., on the
  same street, in the same parking garage, in the same block, etc.). In addition to
  radio groups, administrator defined collection of charging stations may also be
  defined. For example, the charging stations 215 and 235 are part of the logical
  group 285. Logical groups are a collection of one or more charging stations that an
  administrator defines. Typically, the charging stations included in a logical group
  share some set of common features. As illustrated in Figure 2, logical groups may
  include charging stations from different radio groups.

WO 2010/096502                                                          PCT/US2010/024496
  [0029]     It should be understood that the network architecture illustrated in Figure 2
  is exemplary, and other architectures may be used in embodiments of the invention
  (e.g., each charging station may have a direct connection with the server 180).
  [0030]     Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the charging station 120
  according to one embodiment of the invention. The charging station 120 includes
  the charging station controller 305, the electricity control device 310, the electricity
  measuring device 320, the RFID reader 330, the user interface 335, the display unit
  340, and one or more transceivers 350 (e.g., wired transceiver(s) (e.g., Ethernet,
  power line communication (PLC), etc.) and/or wireless transceiver(s) (e.g., 802.15.4
  (e.g., ZigBee, etc.), Bluetooth, WiFi, Infrared, GPRS/GSM, CDMA, etc.)). It
  should be understood that Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary architecture of a
  charging station, and other, different architectures may be used in embodiments of
  the invention described herein. For example, some implementations of charging
  stations may not include a user interface, an RFID reader, or a connection to a
  network.
  [0031]     The RFID reader 330 reads RFID tags from RFID enabled devices (e.g.,
  smartcards, key fobs, etc., embedded with RFID tag(s)) of operators that want to use
  the charging station 120. For example, the operator 145 may wave/swipe the
  communication device 150 (if an RFID enabled device) near the RFID reader 330 to
  initiate a charging session from the charging station 120.
  [0032]     The RFID reader 330 passes the information read to the charging station
  controller 305. The charging station controller 305 is programmed to include
  instructions that establish charging sessions with the vehicles. According to one
  embodiment of the invention, a charging session is established after an operator has
  been authenticated and authorized to initiate a charging session (e.g., may use the
  charging station 120 at the particular time of the day), after a charging cord has been
  plugged into the power receptacle 115, and after the door covering the power
  receptacle 115 has been closed and locked. The operator 145 is authenticated and
  authorized based on the information the RFID reader 330 receives. While in one
  embodiment of the invention the charging station 120 locally stores authentication
  information (e.g., in the configuration/operator data store 370), in other
  embodiments of the invention the charging station controller 305 transmits an
                                              9

WO 2010/096502                                                            PCT/US2010/024496
  authorization request with a remote device (e.g., the server 180) via one of the
  transceivers 350. For example, the charging station controller causes an
  authorization request to be transmitted to the data control unit 170 over a WPAN
  transceiver (e.g., Bluetooth, ZigBee) or a LAN transceiver. The data control unit
  170 relays the authorization request to the server 180.
  [0033]     In some embodiments of the invention, in addition to or in lieu of vehicle
  operators initiating charging sessions with RFID enabled devices, vehicle operators
  may use the user interface 335 to initiate charging sessions. For example, vehicle
  operators may enter in account and/or payment information through the user
  interface 335. For example, the user interface 335 may allow the operator 145 to
  enter in their username/pas sword (or other information) and/or payment
  information. In other embodiments of the invention, vehicle operators may request
  charging sessions through devices remote to the charging station 120 (e.g., payment
  stations coupled with the charging stations).
  [0034]     After authorizing the operator 145, the charging station controller 305
  causes the power receptacle 115 to be energized and the door covering the power
  receptacle 115 (if a locked door is covering the power receptacle 115) to unlock.
  For example, the charging station controller 305 causes the electricity control device
  310 to complete the connection of the power line 135 to the power grid 130. The
  electricity control device 310 is a solid-state device that is controlled by the
  charging station controller 305 or any other device suitable for controlling the flow
  of electricity. In addition, the charging station controller 305 causes the door
  covering the power receptacle 115 to unlock allowing the operator 145 to plug in
  their charging cord to the power receptacle 115.
  [0035]     In one embodiment of the invention, the charging station 120 includes one
  or more sensors that may be used to detect when a charging cord has been plugged
  into the power receptacle 115. The sensors may be a pair of infrared emitting
  diodes (IRED) and a phototransistor or a photodiode. An IRED emits light and a
  phototransistor or photodiode detects the light and converts the light into current.
  When the power receptacle 115 receives a plug, that plug breaks the light causing
  the phototransistor to stop converting light into current. In this way, the charging
  station 120 may determine if a plug has been inserted into the power receptacle 115.

  It should be understood that other sensor technologies may be used to detect
  whether a plug has been received at the power receptacle 115 (e.g., a micro switch
  pushbutton, mechanical power receptacle cover that must be rotated, etc.). In
  addition, in some embodiments of the invention, the charging station 120 also
  includes sensors to detect whether the door covering the power receptacle 115 is
  closed and locked.
  [0036]     The electricity measuring device 320 measures the amount of electricity
  that is flowing on the power line 135 through the power receptacle 115. While in
  one embodiment of the invention the electricity measuring device 320 measures
  flow of current, in an alternative embodiment of the invention the electricity
  measuring device 320 measures power draw. The electricity measuring device 320
  may be an induction coil or other devices suitable for measuring electricity. The
  charging station controller 305 is programmed with instructions to monitor the
  electricity measuring device 320 and to calculate the amount of electricity being
  used over a given time period.
  [0037]     The display unit 340 is used to display messages to the operator 145 (e.g.,
  charging status, confirmation messages, error messages, notification messages, etc.).
  The display unit 340 may also display parking information if the charging station
  120 is also acting as a parking meter (e.g., amount of time remaining in minutes,
  parking violation, etc.).
  [0038]     The configuration/operator data store 370 stores configuration information
  which may be set by administrators, owners, or manufacturers of the charging
  station 120.
  [0039]     Figure 4 illustrates exemplary portals of the server 180 according to one
  embodiment of the invention. The subscriber portal 410 includes the subscriber
  registration module 415, the charging station locator module 420, the charge status
  module 425, and the subscriber accounting module 430. The subscriber registration
  module 415 allows potential customers (e.g., electric vehicle operators) to sign up
  for charging services. For example, the subscriber registration module 415 collects
  contact point information from subscribers (e.g., name, address, email address,
  telephone number, etc.), type of electric vehicle(s) and/or type of electricity storage
  device, and service plan information. The subscribers may select between different
                                              11

WO 2010/096502                                                         PCT/US2010/024496
  types and levels of services in different embodiments of the invention. For
  example, the subscribers may choose between different subscription plans (e.g., pay
  per charging session, nighttime charging, grid-friendly charging (subscribers can
  only charge during off-peak times (e.g., early morning, late night, or other times
  when the grid is experiencing low demand), anytime charging (access to the
  charging stations twenty-four hours a day), etc.).
  [0040]    In some embodiments of the invention, the subscriber registration module
  415 also allows subscribers to provide notification message preferences for
  receiving notification messages upon certain events occurring.    For example, each
  subscriber may provide a notification message preference to receive notification
  messages for each event that interests them (those events the subscriber wishes to
  receive notification messages on). The events of interest may include one or more
  suspension or termination of a charging session events, one or more charge status
  events, one or more update events, one or more parking events, and/or one or more
  alarm events. For example, each subscriber may provide a notification message
  preference for an event in interest (whether they want to receive a notification
  message for that event) for the following events: fully charged vehicle, charging has
  been interrupted (e.g., the charging cord has been removed from the vehicle or has
  been severed, the station has encountered a power loss, etc.), the utility operating
  the power grid has caused their charging of the vehicle to be suspended (e.g., the
  load on the grid exceeded a Demand Response threshold), the subscriber forgot to
  plug in their charging cord into their vehicle, and other events which will be
  described in greater detail later herein. The subscribers may choose to receive one
  or any combination of the above events that interest them.. In addition, the
  subscribers may be able to choose the format of the notification messages (e.g.,
  receive through email, through text message, etc.). In addition, the subscribers may
  provide one or more contact points specific for notification messages (e.g., email
  address(es), text message address(es) (e.g., phone number(s)), etc.). It should also
  be understood that one or more events may have default notification message
  preference values.
  [0041]    The charging station locator module 420 allows subscribers to locate
  charging stations (available and/or unavailable charging stations). The charging
                                             12

WO 2010/096502                                                           PCT/US2010/024496
  station locator module 420 may provide an interactive map for the subscribers to
  locate charging stations. The charging station locator module 420 may also provide
  an estimated time when the charging station will become available for use.
  Subscribers may also use the charging station locator module 420 to create a list of
  favorite charging station(s) for the server 180 to monitor their availability and notify
  the user (e.g., through email or text message) when those charging station(s) are
  available and/or unavailable. In addition, in some embodiments of the invention,
  the subscribers may use the charging station locator module 420 to reserve charging
  stations for future use.
  [0042]     The charge status module 425 allows subscribers to determine the charging
  status of their electric vehicles (that are currently being charged). According to one
  embodiment of the invention, the charge status module 425 presents charge status
  information to the subscriber (e.g., amount of power currently being transferred,
  total amount of power transferred, amount of energy transferred, total amount of
  energy transferred, the amount of time the charging session has lasted, an estimate
  of the time left to charge their vehicle, etc.).
  [0043]     The subscriber accounting module 430 allows subscribers to review
  accounting information (e.g., the number of sessions remaining in their subscription,
  payment and/or invoice information, the amount of energy transferred to the power
  grid, etc.), and/or generate report(s) (e.g., illustrating power consumed from the
  power grid, illustrating power transferred to the power grid, illustrating an estimate
  of the amount of gasoline saved through use of their electric vehicle(s), illustrating
  an estimate of the amount of greenhouse gases they have saved from outputting
  through use of their electric vehicle(s), illustrating the amount of money saved in
  gasoline costs through use of their electric vehicle(s), etc.). In addition, the
  subscriber accounting module 430 may allow subscribers to review a history of the
  charging station(s) that they most often use.
  [0044]     The host portal 435 allows owners and/or administrators of one or more
  charging stations to configure their charging station(s) and perform other functions.
  As used herein, a host is an owner and/or administrator of one or more charging
  stations. It should also be understood that a host may include operator(s) and/or
  administrator(s) of the charging station network (e.g., the charging station network
                                               13

WO 2010/096502                                                          PCT/US2010/024496
  200). The host portal 435 includes the host registration module 440, the charging
  station configurator module 445, the host accounting module 450, and the charging
  station status module 455.
  [0045]     The host registration module 440 allows hosts to register their charging
  station(s) for service and allows hosts to set preferences. For example, the host
  registration module 440 allows hosts to provide contact information (e.g., name,
  company, address, email address(es), telephone number(s), etc.). As another
  example, the host preferences module 440 allows hosts to provide notification
  message preferences for receiving notification messages upon certain events
  occurring. For example, each host may provide a notification message preference to
  receive notification messages for each event that interests them (those events the
  host wishes to receive notification messages on). The events of interest may include
  one or more suspension or termination of a charging session events, one or more
  update events, and/or one or more alarm events. For example, each host may
  provide a notification message preference for any of the following events that
  interest them: a charging station has failed to respond to a periodic heartbeat from
  the server 180, a charging station has unexpectedly rebooted, a charging station has
  detected a problem, a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) has tripped in a
  charging station, etc. and/or other events which will be described in greater detail
  later herein. Each host may choose to receive one or any combination of the above
  events that interest them, and may specify different notification message preferences
  for different charging stations. In addition, each host may be able to choose the
  format of the notification messages (e.g., receive them through email, through text
  message, etc.). In addition, the hosts may provide one or more contact points
  specific for notification messages (e.g., email address(es), text message address(es)
  (e.g., phone number(s)), etc.). It should also be understood that one or more events
  may have default notification message preference values.
  [0046]     The charging station configurator module 445 allows hosts to configure
  their charging stations (e.g., set charging station parameters on their charging
  station, set access parameters, etc.). The host accounting module 450 allows hosts
  to review accounting information (e.g., power consumed by each of their charging
  station(s), total power consumed by all of their charging station(s), power
                                              14

WO 2010/096502                                                            PCT/US2010/024496
  transferred to the power grid by each of their charging station(s), total power
  transferred to the power grid by all of their charging station(s), account balances,
  payments and invoices, etc.).
  [0047]    The charging station status module 455 allows hosts to view the charging
  status of each of their charging station(s) (e.g., current status (charging, available,
  out-of-service), reports on occupancy rates of their charging station(s), reports on
  energy usage for each of their charging station(s), etc.).
  [0048]    The utility portal 460 allows utilities (employees of the utilities) to monitor
  and manage the impact on their grid of electric vehicle charging. The load
  monitoring module 465 allows utilities to monitor the load for individual charging
  stations and/or aggregate load of all charging stations drawing power from their
  grid. The load monitoring module 465 may also provide the amount of load which
  may be shed-able (e.g., the amount of load being drawn by subscribers which have
  registered for grid-friendly charging, etc.). The utilities may use the information
  from the load monitoring module 465 to determine whether to shed load (e.g., for
  only those subscribers which have registered for grid-friendly charging or for all
  charging sessions). Upon determining to shed load of some charging stations, the
  server 180 may send a command to shut down service to those charging stations.
  In addition, the load monitoring module 465 may provide a history of use for the
  charging stations including the average load drawn at a time for each charging
  station and/or all charging stations.
  [0049]    While the subscriber portal 410, the host portal 435, and the utility portal
  460 have been described with specific modules, it should be understood that they
  may have additional modules, less modules, and/or the functionality of some
  modules may be combined.
  [0050]    The server 180 is also programmed to transmit notification messages to
  subscribers and hosts based on data received from the charging stations (e.g.,
  charging data, alarm data, etc.), data received from the utilities (e.g., Demand
  Response data, etc.), data gathered by the server 180 (e.g., network condition data,
  etc.), and in some embodiments of the invention, data received from the electric
  vehicles. Typically these notification messages take the form of electronic
                                              15

WO 2010/096502                                                             PCT/US2010/024496
  messages (e.g., email messages, text messages, or other forms of electronic
  communication).
  [0051]     The server 180 may be programmed to transmit notification messages to
  subscribers, hosts, or other persons, in different situations in different embodiments
  of the invention. For example, in some embodiments of the invention the server 180
  is programmed to transmit notification messages to subscribers (or to other
  person(s) as designated by the subscribers) and/or hosts upon events that cause
  charging sessions to be terminated or suspended in the following situations:
  responsive to their charging session being administratively terminated by the
  owner(s) and/or administrator(s) of the charging station, responsive to the charging
  station detecting an over-current situation and suspending the charging session,
  responsive to the charging station stopping the flow of electricity to their vehicle
  (e.g., by de-energizing the power receptacle), responsive to their charging session
  expiring and being suspended, responsive to receiving a Demand Response message
  from a Utility to suspend charging to decrease load on the power grid, etc.
  [0052]     As another example, in some embodiments of the invention the server 180
  is programmed to transmit notification messages to subscribers (or to other
  person(s) as designated by the subscribers), and/or hosts upon the following charge
  status events: fully charged vehicle, X percent charge, vehicle is not currently
  charging (e.g., operator established a charging session but has failed to plug their
  charging cord into their vehicle or the connection is otherwise faulty), vehicle has
  resumed charging (e.g., after being suspended to decrease the load on the power
  grid), a vehicle is currently transferring electricity to the grid, a vehicle is currently
  drawing electricity from the grid, etc.
  [0053]     The determination that the electricity storage device(s) of an electric
  vehicle is fully charged may be performed in different ways in different
  embodiments of the invention. Typically the storage capability of a particular
  electricity storage device for a given electric vehicle is known based on the type of
  electric vehicle information collected by the subscriber registration module 415.
  From that information, the maximum amount of time needed to charge that
  electricity storage device may be determined. In one embodiment of the invention,
  the electricity storage device of a given electric vehicle is fully charged when at
                                               16

WO 2010/096502                                                             PCT/US2010/024496
  least the total amount of electricity transferred to the electricity storage device meets
  or exceeds the storage capability amount of that electricity storage device. In
  another embodiment of the invention, the electricity storage device of a given
  electric vehicle is fully charged at least when the maximum amount of time needed
  to charge that electricity storage device has been meet or exceeded. In another
  embodiment of the invention, if the "trickle charge" amount of electricity is known
  for an electricity storage device, that electricity storage device is fully charged when
  that trickle charge amount is detected. For the embodiments described above, the
  determination is typically based on data received from the charging stations.
  [0054]     In another embodiment of the invention, the determination of a fully
  charged vehicle is made based on information collected from the electric vehicles.
  For example, some electric vehicles have the capability of transmitting status
  information (e.g., via PLC, WPAN, etc.) of their electricity storage devices (e.g.,
  percent full, amount of energy needed until a full charge, full charge, etc.). This
  data may be transmitted directly or indirectly to the server 180 and/or the charging
  station 120. The server 180 and/or the charging station 120 may use the data to
  transmit charge status notification messages. For example, the server 180 and/or the
  charging station 120 may use this information in combination with the amount of
  electricity being transferred to the electricity storage device to determine a fully
  charged electricity storage device. Alternatively or additionally, the server 180
  and/or charging station 120 may transmit fully charged vehicle notification
  messages responsive to receiving a fully charged message from the electric vehicle.
  [0055]     In one embodiment of the invention, the server 180 is programmed to
  determine that a subscriber has established a charging session with a charging
  station but has failed to plug their charging cord into their vehicle by examining the
  charging data received from that charging station. For example, if the charging data
  indicates that the charging session has been established for a threshold amount of
  seconds and the electricity transferred is below a certain threshold, the server 180
  may notify the subscriber that charging has not occurred. In addition, the server 180
  may transmit a command to the charging station instructing it to suspend the session
  and prevent electricity from flowing through the power receptacle.

WO 2010/096502                                                          PCT/US2010/024496
  [0056]     In one embodiment of the invention, the server 180 is programmed to
  transmit notification messages to those subscribers (or to other person(s) as
  designated by the subscribers) which have established a charging session but have
  failed to plug their charging cord into their vehicle (or otherwise have a bad
  connection to their vehicle).    For example, a vehicle operator has been authorized
  to use a charging station, a charging cord has been inserted into a power receptacle
  of the charging station, the door covering the power receptacle (if one exists) is
  closed and locked, but the vehicle operator has forgotten to plug the charging cord
  into their vehicle.
  [0057]     In one embodiment of the invention, the server 180 determines that a
  subscriber has established a charging session with a charging station but has failed
  to plug their charging cord into their vehicle by examining the charging data
  received from that charging station. For example, if the charging data indicates that
  the charging session has been established for a threshold amount of seconds and the
  electricity transferred is below a certain threshold, the server 180 may notify the
  subscriber that charging has not occurred. In addition, the server 180 may transmit
  a command to the charging station instructing it to suspend the session and prevent
  electricity from flowing through the power receptacle.
  [0058]     As another example, in some embodiments of the invention the server 180
  is programmed to transmit notification messages responsive to an alarm generated
  by a charging station or triggered by the server 180. These notification messages
  may be sent to the appropriate operators, administrators, and/or owners of the
  charging stations experiencing an alarm event and/or to the subscribers using a
  charging station that is experiencing an alarm event. Example alarm events include
  the following: a charging station has failed to respond to a periodic heartbeat from
  the server 180, a charging station has unexpectedly rebooted, a charging station has
  detected a problem (hardware and/or software), a GFCI in the charging station has
  tripped, a software and/or firmware update/upgrade on a charging station has
  completed and/or failed, the software and/or firmware on a charging station has
  reverted to an old version, etc.
  [0059]     As another example, in some embodiments of the invention the server 180
  is programmed to transmit update notification messages to the subscribers
                                               18

WO 2010/096502                                                          PCT/US2010/024496
  responsive to certain update events. Example update events include the following: a
  favorite charging station or often used charging station is available and/or
  unavailable, a new charging station has been installed in a close location, a
  subscriber has run out of (or is close to running out of) charging sessions, a
  subscriber has failed or completed a credit card authorization check (e.g., credit card
  has expired), the door covering the power receptacle where their charging cord is
  attached has been opened by an unauthorized user, etc.
  [0060]    As yet another example, in some embodiments of the invention the server
  180 is programmed to transmit notification messages to subscribers responsive to
  parking events including the following: exceeded parking time (or close to
  exceeding the parking time), parking reservation confirmation, unused parking
  reservation (e.g., a subscriber has reserved a parking spot but did not use the spot
  and/or did not charge at a corresponding charging station), parking reservation time
  extension confirmation, etc.
  [0061]    While embodiments have been described with reference to the server
  transmitting notification messages, in alternative embodiments of the invention the
  charging stations may include logic to determine whether to transmit notification
  messages to subscribers and/or hosts. For example, the charging station controller
  305 may be programmed to determine whether to transmit notification messages to
  subscribers using the charging station or to the host associated with the charging
  station. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the charging station 120 may
  include the notification message preferences of the operator 145 and the
  administrator(s) and/or owner(s) of the charging station 120. In addition, in some
  embodiments, the charging stations may transmit the notification messages to
  subscribers and/or hosts.
  [0062]    Figure 5 is a flow diagram illustrating exemplary operations for
  transmitting notification messages to subscribers according to one embodiment of
  the invention. The operations of Figure 5 will be described with reference to the
  exemplary embodiments of Figures 1 and 4. However, it should be understood that
  the operations of Figure 5 can be performed by embodiments of the invention other
  than those discussed with reference to Figures 1 and 4, and the embodiments
                                              19

WO 2010/096502                                                          PCT/US2010/024496
  discussed with reference to Figures 1 and 4 can perform operations different than
  those discussed with reference to Figure 5.
  [0063]     According to one embodiment of the invention the operations of Figure 5
  are performed by servers (e.g., the server 180). At block 510, the server 180
  receives notification message preferences for a subscriber (e.g., the operator 145)
  which indicate one or more events of interest which the subscriber wishes to receive
  notification messages on. While in one embodiment of the invention the server 180
  receives these notification message preferences from the subscriber using the
  subscriber registration module 415, in other embodiments of the invention the server
  180 receives these notification message preferences differently (e.g., via email, via
  text message, from a charging station, etc.). Flow moves from block 510 to block
  520.
  [0064]     At block 520, the server 180 receives a set of one or more contact points
  (e.g., email address(es), text message address(es), etc.) associated with the
  subscriber. While in one embodiment of the invention the server 180 receives the
  set of contact points from the subscriber using the subscriber registration module
  415, in other embodiments of the invention the server 180 receives the set of contact
  points differently (e.g., via email, via text message, from a charging station, etc.).
  Flow moves from block 520 to block 530.
  [0065]     At block 530, the server 180 authorizes the subscriber to use a charging
  station. For example, the server 180 authorizes the operator 145 to use the charging
  station 120. In some embodiments, the authorization is performed in response to the
  server 180 receiving an authorization request from the charging station 120, while in
  other embodiments, the authorization is performed in response to the server 180
  receiving an authorization request from the subscriber (e.g., the operator 145)
  directly. Flow moves from block 530 to block 540.
  [0066]     At block 540, the server 180 receives data associated with the subscriber
  that indicates a charging session has been established for an electric vehicle (e.g.,
  electric vehicle 110) associated with the subscriber. The data received may be
  transmitted by the charging station 120. The data includes information identifying
  the subscriber (e.g., an RFID tag uniquely associated with the subscriber) and
                                               20

  and/or administrator(s) of the charging station network 200) which indicates one or
  more events of interest which the host wishes to receive notification messages for.
  While in one embodiment of the invention the server 180 receives these notification
  message preferences from the host using the host registration module 440, in other
  embodiments of the invention the server 180 receives these preferences differently
  (e.g., via email, via text message, etc.). Flow moves from block 610 to block 620.
  [0071]     At block 620, the server 180 receives a set of one or more contact points
  (e.g., email address(es), text message address(es), etc.) associated with the host.
  While in one embodiment of the invention the server 180 receives the set of contact
  points from the host using the host registration module 440, in other embodiments
  of the invention the server 180 receives the set of contact points differently (e.g., via
  email, via text message, etc.). Flow moves from block 620 to block 630.
  [0072]     At block 630, the server 180 detects an event of interest for the host. The
  server 180 may detect an event of interest for the host based on data received from
  those charging station(s) the host owns or operates (e.g., data related to vehicle
  charging at their charging station(s), data related to alarms detected and/or generated
  at their charging station(s), etc.), data received from the utility(ies) operating the
  power grid(s) for their charging station(s) (e.g., Demand Response data, etc.), data
