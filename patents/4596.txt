  ABSTRACT
  The present invention is a process for preparing an aqueous solution of a hydrophobically
  modified alkylene oxide poly(urethane-urea-allophanate) thickener by contacting isocyanate
  reactive groups with a stoichiometric excess of a diisocyanate, followed by reaction with
5 water. The thickener surprisingly shows a maintenance or improvement in hiding in paint
  formulations while maintaining other critical rheological properties.

    HEUR Thickener and Process for its Preparation
    The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application number
    2014246691, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
    Hydrophobically modified urethane thickeners (HEURs) are water soluble polymers
  5 containing hydrophobic groups, and are classified as associative thickeners because the
    hydrophobic groups associate with one another in water. In a latex paint formulation, the
    hydrophobic groups adsorb to latex particle surfaces, thereby creating loops and bridges
    between particles, to form a transient network of bridged latex particles that gives rise to
    viscosity increase and desirable rheological characteristics over a wide range of shear rates.
 .0 HEURs generally provide excellent flow/leveling and gloss properties while maintaining
    acceptable sag resistance.
    HEURs are typically prepared by a bulk melt polymerization process or an organic solvent
    based process. In the bulk melt polymerization process, a polyalkyleneglycol, such as PEG
    8000 polyethylene glycol is reacted with a molar equivalent excess of diisocyanate in the
 .5 presence of a metal catalyst to provide a targeted molecular weight of the polymerized
    polymer. A capping agent, which is typically a monofunctional alcohol or amine, is then
    added to quench any remaining isocyanate functionality, and the molten polymer is then
    dissolved in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent to produce the final product.
    Alternatively, the polyglycol, diisocyanate, and capping alcohol can be added to the reactor
  0 upfront in an appropriate ratio to form the HEUR polymer. In either case, hydroxyl
    equivalents are higher compared to isocyanate equivalents to completely consume all
    isocyanate groups prior to dissolving the HEUR polymer in water or a water/solvent mixture.
    Although HEURs impart desirable rheological properties to coating formulations, it is well
    known that their use in such formulations adversely impacts hiding, tint strength, and opacity
25  of the consequently coated substrate. Therefore, multiple coatings are often required to
    achieve the desired hiding of the color and appearance of the original surface.
    It is known that improvement in the spacing of pigment particles (e.g., TiO 2 ) in the coatings
    formulation improves opacity and hiding efficiency; nevertheless, the transient network of
    bridged latex particles in HEURs crowds the pigment particles into interstitial spaces, thereby
30  decreasing the spacing between pigment particles, and resulting in a concomitant loss in
    opacity, tint strength, and hiding.
                                                    1

    It would therefore be an advance in the art of HEUR thickened coatings compositions to
    discover a HEUR that imparts improved opacity, tint strength, and hiding to a coating
    composition.
    Summary of the Invention
  5 In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a process for preparing an aqueous solution
    of a hydrophobically modified alkylene oxide poly(urethane-urea-allophanate) thickener
    comprising the steps of: a) contacting under reactive conditions 1) a water-soluble
    polyalkylene glycol; 2) a hydrophobic capping agent or a hydrophobic difunctional agent or a
    combination thereof; and 3) a 2 to 50 percent stoichiometric excess of a diisocyanate with
 .0 respect to the sum of the moles of isocyanate reactive groups of the polyalkylene glycol and
    the capping agent or the hydrophobic difunctional agent or a combination thereof, to form a
    polyurethane prepolymer with isocyanate functionality; then b) contacting the prepolymer
    with water under conditions sufficient to convert the prepolymer to an aqueous solution of a
    hydrophobically modified alkylene oxide poly(urethane-urea-allophanate). The thickener
 .5 prepared by the process of the invention addresses a need in the art of paint formulations, by
    providing improved rheological properties to the formulation without suffering a loss in
    opacity.

                                                      II
    wherein -(OA)- are C 2-C 4 oxyalkylene groups, preferably oxyethylene groups; R4 is
    preferably a C4 -C 30 linear, branched, or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic

    Formula II are also suitable hydrophobic difunctional agents. These reagents would be used
    to provide hydrophobic groups located within and pendant to the polymer chain.
    Other suitable hydrophobic difunctional agents include a class of diols advantageously
 .5 prepared by the reaction of a secondary amine and a diglycidyl ether, for example, the
    reaction product of bis(2-ethylhexyl)amine and 1,4-butane diol diglycidyl ether.
    Still other suitable hydrophobic difunctional agents include the reaction product of a

    propanediol, and 3-(dicyclohexylamino)-1,2-propanediol.
    In one preferred process of the present invention, the polyalkylene glycol and the
    hydrophobic capping agent or the hydrophobic difunctional agent or mixtures thereof are
25  mixed and heated together, preferably at a temperature in the range of 50 'C to 110 'C,
    optionally in the presence of a small amount of an antioxidant such as butylated
    hydroxytoluene (BHT). A stochiometric excess of the diisocyanate, preferably from 5 to
    35 percent stoichiometric excess with respect to the isocyanate reactive groups, is then added
    along with a urethane promoting catalyst, preferably bismuth octoate. Preferably, the mole
                                                      5

   equivalent ratio of the polyalkylene glycol to the capping agent is from 2:1 to 10:1, more
   preferably from 3:1 to 8:1; and most preferably from 3.5:1 to 6.5:1.
   The diisocyanate, the polyalkylene glycol, and the hydrophobic capping or difunctional agent
   need not be contacted together under reaction conditions at the same time so long as
 5 isocyanate groups are present before the water addition step. For example, it is possible to
   first contact the polyalkylene glycol and the diisocyanate under reaction conditions as
   described hereinabove to form a first prepolymer intermediate, then contacting the
   hydrophobic capping agent or the hydrophobic difunctional agent or mixtures thereof with
   the first prepolymer intermediate under reaction conditions to form a second prepolymer
.0 intermediate, which is then contacted with water at elevated temperature to form the aqueous
   solution of the thickener. When the hydrophobic capping agent or the hydrophobic
   difunctional agent comprise a tertiary amine, an acid such as acetic acid, polyacrylic acid,
   lactic acid, or gluconic acid is advantageously added to the solution to adjust pH and decrease
   the solution viscosity.
.5 It has been discovered that HEUR based polymers produced as described herein are not
   merely urethane polymers with terminal and/or pendant hydrophobic groups required for
   associative thickening but further include combinations of allophanate branch points in the
   polymer backbone and urea linkages. The HEUR based polymers may further include
   primary amine end groups or biuret branch points in the polymer backbone or a combination
'0 thereof.

 5 Intermediate 1 - Preparation of Hydrophobic Capping Agent
   Diamylamine (372.4 g), butyl glycidyl ether (346.2 g) and water (27 g) were heated to reflux
   (105-115 'C) under N 2 in a round bottom flask equipped with a condenser and mechanical
   stirrer. After 5 h, the mixture was cooled to 30 'C. The aminoalcohol capping agent was
   isolated after water and residual butyl glycidyl ether were removed in vacuo (14 Torr) over a
10 temperature range of 300 C to 150' C.

   CARBOWAX TM 8000 Polyethylene Glycol (PEG, a Trademark of the Dow Chemical
   Company or its Affiliates, Mw = 8200; 130.09 g, 31.7 mmol equiv OH) was heated to 110 'C
   in vacuo in a batch melt reactor for 2 h. After cooling the reactor contents to 85 'C, butylated
15 hydroxyl toluene (BHT, 0.067 g) and Intermediate 1 (2.14 g, 7.5 mmol equiv OH) were
   added to the reactor and allowed to mix for 5 min. Hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI,
   3.62 g, 43.1 mmol equiv NCO) was then added to the reactor and mixing was continued for
   5 min. Bismuth octoate solution (28%, 0.33 g) was then added to the reactor and the
   temperature of the mixture was maintained at 85 'C with stirring for 10 min. The resulting

   The results show that experimental rheology modifiers that have a PEO:Intermediate 1 in the
 5 range of 4 to 6 give especially high S/mil values. Although HEURs in general are known to
   have an adverse impact on hiding in paint formulations, the rheology modifiers of the present
   invention do not substantially diminish hiding and, in some cases, surprisingly show an
   improvement in hiding while retaining other critical rheological properties such as KU and
   ICI efficiency, flow/leveling, and sag resistance.
10 Kubelka-Munk S/mil Test Method
   Two draw-downs were prepared on Black Release Charts (Leneta Form RC-BC) for each
   paint using a 1.5-mil Bird draw down bar and the charts allowed to dry overnight. Using a
   template, 3.25"x 4" rectangles were cut out with an X-ACTO knife on each chart. The Y
   reflectance was measured using a BYK Gardner 45 Reflectomer in each of the scribed areas
15 five times measuring on a diagonal starting at the top of the rectangle and the average Y
                                                    13

   reflectance recorded. A thick film draw down was prepared for each paint on Black Vinyl
