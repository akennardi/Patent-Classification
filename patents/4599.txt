TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       The present invention relates to a device for harvesting bananas. Optionally, the
device can be used for harvesting the stem of a banana plant. The invention also relates to a
method of harvesting bananas, and optionally a method of harvesting banana plant stems
using the device.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]       Harvesting bananas is a labour-intensive task. It generally requires a team of 6 to 8
people, to work together using a tractor and a trailer to move along the rows of banana plants.
Whilst one person manoeuvers the tractor and trailer, another person cuts down the banana
bunches and then the plant. This work requires the use of a large cutting knife that has shown
in time to be very dangerous. Ideally, the banana bunch is loaded onto the shoulders of a
person who takes the harvested bunch and loads it onto the trailer. A bunch of bananas can
weigh up to 90 kg, so it requires a reasonable amount of strength to carry the harvested bunch
to the trailer. There are also workplace health and safety concerns associated with manually
moving such heavy banana bunches. In addition, bananas bruise easily, so it is not simply a
matter of tossing a harvested bunch onto a trailer. Although the bunches can be very heavy, to
avoid bruising the fruit, it is necessary to position each bunch within padding in the trailer
doing this carefully, thus placing the worker under a great deal of strain. The padding protects
the fruit so that it arrives at the marketplace in the best possible condition.
[0003]       A banana plant will only produce one bunch of bananas. Therefore once a plant has
fruited and the fruit has been harvested, the stem is usually chopped down. In commercial
orchards, the stems are 'chopped and dropped', meaning that the stem is chopped down, but
left where it falls to rot down and provide nutrients to the new banana plants. Traditionally,
the banana plant is chopped down after the harvested bunch has been safely positioned on the
trailer, or the workers make another pass with a tractor or similar vehicle along the rows of
banana plants after harvest to chop down the old plants.

                                               la
[0004]     Traditional methods of harvesting bananas therefore require significant human
resources, in terms of the number of workers required and also the strength of those workers.
In addition, a second pass of the orchard to remove old banana plants adds to the time and
costs associated with harvesting bananas. The traditional harvesting methods thus mean that
labour requirements vary throughout the harvesting season, making it difficult to plan the
labour-force
                                  [Text continues on page 2.]

in advance, thereby adding to costs.
[0005]       The type of vehicle that is normally used to move workers and the banana bunch
trailer along the rows of banana plants is a tractor or similar. Such vehicles are slow and lack
manoeuvrability. The lack of speed and manoeuvrability places limitations on the rate of banana
harvesting, and thus adds to the time and therefore costs associated with banana harvesting.
They also pose a danger to the workers because visibility within the plantation is poor due to the
banana leaves. Additionally such vehicles are extremely noisy.
[0006]       As noted above, another important aspect to harvesting bananas relates to
occupational health and safety (OHS). As bananas bruise easily, it is necessary to handle them
with care both during and after harvesting. However, given the significant weight of a bunch of
bananas (up to 90 kg), harvesting the bunch requires care and strength as does positioning the
harvested bunch on another person's shoulder to enable the bunch to be carried carefully to a
trailer for positioning amongst padding. Even slight damage to bananas during harvesting results
in bruising, which leads to a lower sale price. In the packing plant, damage to the bananas is
avoided by using air pneumatic rams to lift the bunches. Whilst it is relatively easy to install
pneumatic lifting equipment in a packing plant, it is not easy to replicate similar lifting
equipment in the plantation.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0007]       The present invention is directed to a banana harvester, which may at least partially
overcome at least one of the abovementioned disadvantages or provide the consumer with a
useful or commercial choice.
[0008]       With the foregoing in view, in a first embodiment, the invention provides a banana
harvester comprising:
         a)       a cutting head comprising:
                  (i)     a gripping assembly for gripping a stem of a banana plant adjacent to a
                          position where the stem is to be cut; and
                  (ii)    a cutting assembly for cutting through the stem; and
         b)       a movable support mounting the cutting head for movement between banana
                 plants and having control means in communication with the cutting head for
                  manoeuvring and operating the cutting head.
[0009]       In a second embodiment, the invention provides a method of harvesting bananas, the
method comprising the steps of:

        a)       positioning a banana harvester adjacent to a banana stem having a bunch of
                 bananas to be harvested, the banana harvester comprising:
                 (i)      a cutting head comprising a gripping assembly for gripping a stem of a
                          banana plant adjacent to a position where the stem is to be cut, and a
                          cutting assembly for cutting through the stem; and
                 (ii)     a movable support mounting the cutting head for movement between
                          banana plants and having control means in communication with the
                          cutting head for manoeuvring and operating the cutting head;
        b)       manoeuvring the cutting head so that it is adjacent to the banana stem;
        c)       operating the control means such that the gripping assembly grips the stem of the
                 banana plant adjacent to a position where the stem is to be cut; and
        d)       operating the control means such that the cutting assembly cuts through the stem.
[0010]        Typically, the cutting head is mounted to the movable support by at least one
member. Preferably, the at least one member is a boom. In a particularly preferred embodiment,
the cutting head is mounted on an arm, wherein the arm is connected to the movable support via
a boom. Typically, the arm is connected to the boom using a hinge pin, allowing relative
movement of the arm with respect to the boom. Features such as a hydraulic arm cylinder and a
hydraulic boom cylinder can also be present to assist with the relative movement of the arm and
the boom with respect to each other and with respect to the movable support.
[0011]        The gripping assembly for gripping a stem of a banana plant adjacent to a position
where the plant is to be cut preferably comprises at least two laterally opposed members which
are shaped to enable the combination of laterally opposed members to grip the stem of a banana
plant. It is therefore preferably that the laterally opposed members have an arcuate shape
complementary to the arcuate shape of a banana plant stem.
[0012]        In a particularly preferred embodiment, the gripping assembly comprises two sets
each comprising two laterally opposed members, with sufficient separation between each set to
enable the gripping assembly to span a portion of the banana stem, thus providing stability to the
grip.
[0013]        The cutting assembly is positioned on the cutting head and comprises at least one
blade for cutting through the banana stem at a position adjacent to the gripping assembly. In a
preferred embodiment, the cutting assembly comprises two blades that are laterally opposed.
When activated, the two blades operate in a scissor-like fashion to cut through the banana stem.

[0014]        It is preferable for the cutting head to be manoeuvrable through a wide range of
angles, to enable the laterally opposed members of the gripping assembly to be positioned about
a banana stem which is to be cut, irrespective of the angle of growth of the stem. Preferably the
cutting head is capable of two separate movements: one movement allowing left to right
movement through 90-180 degrees about one axis, the second movement allowing the cutting
head to rotate 180-360 degrees about another axis. Preferably, the cutting head is capable of left
to right movement through at least 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170 or 180 degrees
about one axis. Preferably, the cutting head is also capable of rotation through at least 180, 190,
200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350 or 360 degrees
about another axis. Movement of the cutting head about two axes in this manner provides for
flexibility in being able to cut a banana stem and harvest the bananas growing therefrom,
irrespective of the angle of growth of the banana stem. Movement of the cutting head in the
manner described also provides improved visibility for the operator of the harvester.
[0015]        Typically, during operation of the harvester, the cutting head is positioned in
alignment with a banana stem at a position on the stem where the cut is to be made. Preferably,
the stem is to be cut below the point at which a bunch of bananas is growing. An operator in the
cabin of the harvester manipulates the controls such that the laterally opposed members of the
gripping assembly are tightened about the stem and once the stem has been gripped, the at least
one blade of the cutting assembly is activated, thus cutting the banana plant and effectively
removing the top portion of the plant including the banana bunch.
[0016]        Whilst the top portion of the plant is still held within the laterally opposed members
of the gripping assembly, the operator can manoeuvre the boom and arm such that the plant is
positioned above a trailer, and a second operator removes the banana bunch such that the bunch
can be packed onto the trailer. The boom and arm with the top portion of the plant still held
within the laterally opposed members of the gripping assembly is manoeuvred to a position
where the laterally opposed members can be released, thereby releasing the top portion of the
banana plant. Typically, the top portion of the plant is released at the base of the stem which has
just been cut and allowed to decompose.
[0017]        The lower portion of the stem, being the portion of the stem below the cut made to
harvest the banana bunch can then be cut in the same manner. That is, following harvesting of
the banana bunch, the cutting head can be positioned in alignment with the banana stem at a
lower position on the stem. The lower position can be anywhere between the top of the stem
where the first cut was made and ground level. An operator in the cabin of the harvester

manipulates the controls such that the laterally opposed members of the gripping assembly are
tightened about the stem and once the stem has been gripped, the at least one blade of the cutting
assembly is activated, thus cutting the banana plant and effectively removing the stem of the
plant.
[0018]       The stem can then be released and allowed to decompose. Alternatively, the stem
can be transferred to a container, such as a trailer, for transport to a location where the stem can
be further processed. Such further processing can include harvesting of the banana stem fibre for
uses such as, but not limited to, paper or cardboard production.
[0019]       Typically, the movable support comprises an engine, a set of front wheels and a set
of rear wheels with a platform between the two sets of wheels. The platform can be any platform
suitable for mounting the cutting head to. In one embodiment, the movable support can
comprise a chassis manoeuvring platform. The movable support can further comprise a trailer,
such as a banana trailer commonly used in the banana harvesting industry. In one embodiment
of the invention, the movable support can comprise a chassis manoeuvring platform and a
banana trailer, wherein the banana trailer can be readily rolled on top of the chassis manoeuvring
platform for loading banana bunches, and then readily rolled off the chassis manoeuvring
platform once the trailer has been loaded with the banana bunches.
[0020]       In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the movable support can comprise a
tractor. In a further alternative embodiment, the movable support can comprise a four-wheel
motorbike or quad bike. The movable support can thus comprise any suitable vehicle to which
the cutting head can be mounted.
[0021]       The movable support typically further comprises a cabin for housing an operator of
the harvester. The cabin can be mounted at any suitable position on the movable support.
Preferably, the cabin is mounted towards the front of the movable support for ease of steering
control. Even more preferably, the cabin is mounted on a turntable allowing the cabin to rotate
on the movable support, thus providing the operator with the ability to have a 360 degree view.
Rotation of the cabin also allows for flexibility in the operation of the cutting head.
[0022]       The control means for manoeuvring and operating the cutting head are typically
positioned within the cabin for ease of operation by the operator. Preferably, steering means for
directing the movable support are also positioned within the cabin, as are direction controls for
selecting forward or reverse motion of the movable support. Preferably, for ease of operation,
the cutting head is manoeuvred using button activation means. In a particularly preferred

embodiment, two push-buttons are used for operation of the cutting head. Operation of a first
push-button opens the gripping assembly and the cutting assembly so that they are ready to be
positioned about the stem of a banana plant. Operation of a second push-button activates the
gripping assembly to grip the banana stem and then activates the cutting assembly to cut the
banana stem. In this particularly preferred embodiment, the operation of the cutting head is
simplified to requiring only two push-buttons.
[0023]       Preferably, the wheels comprise wheel weights to assist with stability of the harvester
during harvesting of heavy banana bunches. Optionally, the harvester can be adapted such that a
trailer can be connected to either the front or rear of the movable support. Other optional
features for the harvester include an emergency stop switch, a stabiliser bar and an electronic
hydraulic brake system.
[0024]       The emergency stop switch can be any suitable switch that is readily activated such
as a lever or button. Preferably. for ease of use, the emergency stop switch is a push-button.
[0025]       The stabiliser bar is to assist in stabilising the harvester whilst the harvester is
stationary. For example, during harvesting of a banana bunch, the weight of the bunch whilst the
banana plant is gripped by the gripping assembly of the cutting head may cause the harvester to
be unstable. The stabiliser bar assists in preventing such instability. Preferably, the stabiliser bar
is connected to the front of the movable support and is activated by a pressure relief valve.
When the movable support is stationary, the stabiliser bar is activated and has at least one point
of contact with the ground. In preferred embodiments, when the stabiliser bar is activated, it has
at least two points of contact with the ground. Once the movable support is put in motion (either
forward or reverse), the pressure relief valve acts to lift the stabiliser bar so that the bar is no
longer in contact with the ground, and the movable support can move freely.
[0026]       Similarly, the electronic hydraulic brake system is activated when the movable
support is stationary and is released when the movable support is put in motion (either forward
or reverse). The combination of stabiliser bar and electronic hydraulic brake system is
particularly effective for stability of the harvester and thus safety.
[0027]       Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination with any
one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the invention.
[0028]       The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as
an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0038]       Similar features are numbered similarly throughout the Figures.
[0039]       Referring firstly to Figure 1, there is shown a banana harvester 10 according to one
embodiment of the current invention. The harvester 10 has a movable support 12 comprising an
engine 14, two front wheels 16, two rear wheels 18 and a platform 20 (not visible). The
harvester 10 also has a cabin 22 from which an operator can control forward and reverse motion
and steering of the harvester 10. The cabin 22 is mounted on the movable support 12 via a

turntable 24. The cabin 22 also contains controls for manoeuvring and operating the cutting
head (not visible).
[0040]       The front of the harvester 10 is equipped with a stabiliser bar 26. Movement of the
stabiliser bar 26 is controlled by a stabiliser cylinder 28. In Figure 1, the stabiliser bar 26 is
shown in a stabilising position in contact with the ground. When the harvester 10 is in motion,
the stabiliser cylinder 28 acts to lift the stabiliser bar 26 so that it is no longer in contact with the
ground, allowing the harvester 10 to move freely.
[0041]       The harvester 10 further comprises a boom 30, boom cylinder 32, arm 34 and arm
cylinder 36. The boom cylinder 32 and arm cylinder 36 act in combination to manoeuvre the
boom 30 and arm 34 for positioning of the cutting head (not visible).
[0042]       The cutting head (not visible) of the harvester 10 is connected to the arm 34 via a
cutting head positioning mechanism 37 and a cutting head rotation mechanism 38. The cutting
head positioning mechanism 37 allows left to right movement of the cutting head through at least
180 degrees, whilst the cutting head rotation mechanism 38 allows the cutting head to rotate
through at least 360 degrees. Manoeuvring of the cutting head relative to the arm 34 is assisted
by a cutting head mechanism cylinder 40.
[0043]       Further details of the banana harvester 10 are shown in Figure 2. Specifically, in
Figure 2, there is shown a harvester 10 having a cabin 22 mounted on a turntable 24. The cabin
22 contains controls for manoeuvring and operating the cutting head 42.
[0044]       The harvester 10 further comprises a boom 30, boom cylinder 32, arm 34 and arm
cylinder 36.
[0045]       The cutting head 42 of the harvester 10 is connected to the arm 34 via a cutting head
positioning mechanism 37 which controls left to right movement of the cutting head about one
axis, and a cutting head rotation mechanism 38, which controls movement through at least 360
degrees of the cutting head about another axis. Manoeuvring of the cutting head 42 relative to
the arm 34 is assisted by a cutting head mechanism cylinder 40.
[0046]       A cutting head 42 of a banana harvester 10 according to an embodiment of the
current invention is shown in Figure 3. The cutting head 42 is connected to the arm 34 of a
harvester 10 via a cutting head positioning mechanism 37 which controls left to right movement
of the cutting head about one axis, and a cutting head rotation mechanism 38, which controls
movement through at least 360 degrees of the cutting head about another axis. Specifically, the

cutting head rotation mechanism 38 provides for rotational movement of the cutting head 42
relative to the arm 34. A cutting head mechanism cylinder 40 also provides for movement of the
cutting head relative to the arm 34.
[0047]       The cutting head 42 comprises a gripping assembly 44, the gripping assembly 44
comprising two sets of two laterally opposed members 46 (only one of each set is visible). The
cutting head 42 further comprises a cutting assembly 48 comprising two blades 50 (only one is
visible) that are laterally opposed.
[0048]       A cutting head 42 is shown in more detail in Figure 4. The cutting head 42
comprises two sets of two laterally opposed members 46 for gripping the stem of a banana plant
and two blades 50 for cutting the stem of a banana plant. In Figure 4, the laterally opposed
members 46 and the blades 50 are in 'open' positions, as they would be when ready to be
positioned about a stem of a banana plant.
[0049]       The cutting head 42 shown in Figure 5 comprises two sets of two laterally opposed
members 46 for gripping the stem of a banana plant and two blades 50 for cutting the stem of a
banana plant. The laterally opposed members 46 are in 'closed' positions as they would be when
gripping a stem of a banana plant. The blades 50 are still in an 'open' position.
[0050]       In Figure 6, the laterally opposed members 46 are in 'closed' positions as they would
be when gripping a stem of a banana plant. The blades 50 are also in a 'closed' position as they
would be when gripping a stem of a banana plant following cutting of the stem.
[0051]       Figure 7 shows a cutting head 42 of a banana harvester 10 positioned to cut a banana
stem 52, showing the position of the cutting head 42 relative to a bunch of bananas 54 (within a
bag). In this Figure, it can be seen that the cutting head 42 is positioned on the banana stem 52
such that the laterally opposed members 46 grip the banana stem 52 below the point of
attachment of the bunch of bananas 54 and therefore the blades 50 will cut the banana stem
below the gripped portion of the stem. Consequently, the portion of the banana plant comprising
the bunch of bananas 54 will be detached by the harvester 10.
[0052]       Figure 7 also illustrates the angle of the cutting head 42 relative to the cutting head
positioning mechanism 37 and the cutting head rotation mechanism 38, indicative of the type of
rotation that the cutting head 42 can be manoeuvred through. Specifically, the cutting head
positioning mechanism 37 allows the cutting head 42 to move through at least 180 from left to
right, whilst the cutting head rotation mechanism 38 allows the cutting head 42 to rotate at least
360 degrees. For example, rotation of the cutting head rotation mechanism through 180 degrees,

would result in the laterally opposed members 46 gripping the banana stem 52 at a position
below the blades 50. Whilst this would not achieve the desired effect of removing the top
portion of the banana plant whilst still retaining that top portion within the grip of the banana
harvester 10, it is illustrative of the flexibility of the cutting head 42 in being able to remove
banana stems growing at any angle.
[0053]       The cutting head 42 of a banana harvester 10 after a banana stem 52 has been cut is
shown in Figure 8. The laterally opposed members 46 are still gripping the banana stem 52 and
the blades 50 have cut through the stem 52, effectively removing the top portion of the banana
plant.
[0054]       From Figure 8, it can be seen that although the blades 50 have cut through the stem
52, the laterally opposed members 46 retain the banana stem 52 in their grip, enabling the
removed portion of the banana plant (in the grip of the laterally opposed members 46) to be
moved to a convenient position for harvesting of the bunch of bananas (not visible) and then
discarded.
[0055]       The present invention thus provides a banana harvester that enables banana
harvesting to proceed rapidly and safely.
