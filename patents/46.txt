       SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONVERSION BETWEEN INTERNET
                   AND NON-INTERNET BASED TRANSACTIONS
ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
        A method is provided for completing an authenticated commercial transaction
over an internet protocol (IP) network (40) for an account holder (60) engaged in the
transaction via a non-IP based telecommunications platform (30). The method
includes: receiving a first message from the account holder (60) via the non-IP
based telecommunications platform (30), the first message triggering authentication
of the account holder (60) and being in a first communication format; establishing
account information for a payment instrument being used in the transaction based
upon content in the first message; generating a second message using a second
communication format different from the first format, the second message including
the established account information; submitting the second message via the IP
network (40) to a network entity (110, 200) such that an authentication document is
generated (120), the authentication document (120) containing an input field (122);
generating a third message using the first format, the third message being submitted
to the account holder (60) via the non-IP based telecommunications platform (30)
such that the account holder (60) is prompted to enter a security code; receiving a
fourth message containing the entered security code from the account holder (60)
via the non-IP based telecommunications platform (30), the fourth message being in
the first format; and, accessing the authentication document (120) via the IP network
(40) to fill-in the input field (122) of the authentication document (120) with the
security code contained in the fourth message.

           SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONVERSION BETWEEN INTERNET
                       AND NON-INTERNET BASED TRANSACTIONS
     [0001]     This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.
    60/647,883, filed January 28, 2005.
    BACKGROUND
    [0002]      The present inventive subject matter relates to the art of transaction
    conversion. It finds particular application in conjunction with conversions between
    Internet based transactions and non-Internet based transactions, and will be
    described with particular reference thereto. However, one of ordinary skill in the art
    will appreciate that it is also amenable to other like applications.
    [0003]      Internet commerce, or e-commerce as it is otherwise known, relates to the
    buying and selling of products and services between consumers and merchants over
    the Internet or other like transactional exchanges of information over similar
    telecommunication networks. The convenience of shopping over the Internet has
    sparked considerable interest in e-commerce on behalf of both consumers and
    merchants. Internet sales, or like transactions, have been typically carried out using
    standard credit cards such as Visa@, MasterCard@, Discover@, American Express@,
    or the like, or standard debit cards, i.e., check cards or automated teller machine
    (ATM) cards which directly access funds from an associated deposit account or other
    bank account.
    [0004]      While widely used for more traditional face-to-face transactions, use of
   these standard cards in connection with e-commerce presents certain difficulties,
    including difficulties concerning authentication or positive identification of the
   cardholder. For example, maintaining consumer confidence in security has become
   difficult with increased reports of fraud. The resulting apprehension is also fueled by
   consumer uncertainty of the reputation or integrity of a merchant with whom the
   consumer is dealing. Questionable security of the consumer's card information or
   other personal information typically submitted along with a traditional e-commerce
   transaction (e.g., address, card number, phone number, etc.) serves to increase

WO 2006/081525                                                           PCT/US2006/003137
     apprehension even more. Additionally, cardholders, merchants and financial
     institutions are all concerned about safeguarding against fraudulent or otherwise
     unauthorized transactions.
     [0005]      Accordingly, various credit card or payment networks have implemented
     initiatives or programs aimed at safeguarding against fraud. Payment networks (e.g.,
     Visa@ and MasterCard@) have implemented various initiatives (e.g., Visa 3-D
     Secure@, a.k.a. Verified by Visa@ (VbV), and MasterCard SecureCode®) to allow for
     the authentication of a cardholder prior to authorizing a transaction. The benefits to
     all the parties involved in the transaction have been acknowledged. However, the
     programs mainly focus on e-commerce conducted over the Internet.
     [0006]      For example, these Internet authentication initiatives work by having a
     merchant implement a piece of software on their server that will connect a cardholder
    to their bank for authentication. The cardholder authenticates with the bank by
    connecting to a server over the Internet that stores authentication credentials for that
    cardholder, whether it be a password, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), biometric, or
    some other credential. The bank then sends authentication data (based on success
    or failure) back to the merchant to package into an authorization message. Often,
    this is all carried out over the world-wide-web, e.g., using HTML (Hypertext Markup
    Language).
    [0007]       However, there is also a desire to authenticate cardholders in other "card
    not-present" transactions, i.e., in other than Internet transactions. Particular
    applications include, e.g., mobile top-up or purchase of air time minutes for prepaid
    mobile telephones of other mobile devices made with a card, proximity payments
    using IR (Infrared) or other communications technology to send payment details to an
    unmanned POS (Point of Sale) device, telephone orders, etc. These types of
    transactions can originate from many applications such as through an IVR
    (Interactive Voice Response) system, using SMS (Short Message Service)
    messaging, using STK (SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Toolkit), or IR financial
    messaging. Typically, these other "card-not-present" types of transactions do not
    enjoy the benefit of cardholder signatures to protect against fraudulent card use.
    Additionally, they also do not enjoy the benefit of the aforementioned authentication
    programs, insomuch as those programs are focused on Internet based transactions.
    [0008]       While authentication is desirable in other card-not-present situations, it can
    be burdensome to develop separate diverse programs for each potential type of
                                               -2-

WO 2006/081525                                                          PCT/US2006/003137
     transaction. It would be advantageous therefore to be able to employ the
     aforementioned authentication initiatives for these other types of non-Internet based
     transactions. The challenge is determining how to best utilize the system elements,
     methods and/or protocols already in place for the foregoing programs to achieve
     authentication of the cardholder, being that the cardholder is often not actually on the
     Internet in these situations.
     [0009]      Accordingly, a new and improved apparatus and/or method for converting
    transactions between Internet based transactions and non-Internet based transaction
    is disclosed that overcomes the above-referenced problems and others.
    BRIEF DESCRIPTION
    [0010]       In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, a method is provided for
    completing an authenticated commercial transaction over an internet protocol (IP)
    network for an account holder engaged in the transaction via a non-IP based
    telecommunications platform. The method includes: receiving a first message from
    the account holder via the non-IP based telecommunications platform, the first
    message triggering authentication of the account holder and being in a first
    communication format; establishing account information for a payment instrument
    being used in the transaction based upon content in the first message; generating a
    second message using a second communication format different from the first
    format, the second message including the established account information;
    submitting the second message via the IP network to a network entity such that an
    authentication document is generated, the authentication document containing an
    input field; generating a third message using the first format, the third message being
    submitted to the account holder via the non-IP based telecommunications platform
    such that the account holder is prompted to enter a security code; receiving a fourth
    message containing the entered security code from the account holder via the non-IP
    based telecommunications platform, the fourth message being in the first format;
   and, accessing the authentication document via the IP network to fill-in the input field
   of the authentication document with the security code contained in the fourth
    message.
    [0011]      In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, -a transaction
   conversion system is provided for bridging commercial transactions between a first
   network and a plurality of diverse second networks that employ communication
                                              -3-

     protocols that are different from a communication protocol employed by the first
     network. The system includes: an interface operatively connected to the plurality of
    diverse second networks, the interface provisioned to selectively exchange
     messages between the transaction conversion system and account holders
    participating in commercial transactions via the second networks; a network robot
    operatively connected to the first network, the network robot provisioned to access at
    least one of documents or network entities via the first network to selectively obtain
    data therefrom and to selectively enter data therein; and, an application container
    provisioned to direct operation of the robot and control data flow between the robot
    and the interface in connection with an associated task being performed by the
    system.
    [0012]      Numerous advantages and benefits of the inventive subject matter
    disclosed herein will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon
    reading and understanding the present specification.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
     [0018]    A system and/or method is proposed to bridge non-Internet based
    transactions to the Internet to take advantage of authentication programs prescribed
    by various payment networks for Internet transaction. In this manner, the
    infrastructure, systems, methods and/or protocols already in place and/or
    implemented for Internet based transactions can be leveraged to accommodate non
    Internet based transactions. Suitably, the system and/or methods are channel
    agnostic, protocol agnostic and device agnostic. That is to say, the non-Internet
    based side of the transaction may be carried out from a variety of different types of
    end user devices, employing a variety of different communications protocols over a
    variety of different communication platforms or transmission channels.
    [0019]     With reference to FIGURE 1, there is illustrated a transaction conversion
    system 10 that supports conversion of transactions between Internet based
   transactions and non-Internet based transactions. Suitably, the system 10 includes
    an interface 12, a plurality of application containers 14 and a network robot 20.
    Suitably, the system 10 and/or its respective components (e.g., the interface 12, the
   application containers 14, the network robot 20, etc) are implemented as one or more
   optionally customizable software programs, applications or other appropriate
   collection of instructions running on and/or being executed by a server, computer or
   other appropriate hardware to perform and/or administer the tasks, processes and/or
   functions associated with the system 10 and/or its components as they are described
   herein. Optionally, only a single server implements, administers and/or supports the
   system 10, however, it is to be appreciated that alternately one or more servers may
   act separately or in combination to function as web servers, application servers,
   database servers, etc., such that collectively they operate in conjunction with one
   another to implement, administer and/or support the system 10. In short, the system
   10 and/or its components are optionally implemented via any suitable configuration of
   hardware, software, firmware or combination thereof.
   [0020]      As shown, the interface 12, e.g., is operatively connected to a plurality of
   diverse types of interactive communications platforms 30 by which the system 10
   interacts with the non-Internet based side of the transactions. For example, the
   platforms optionally include, without limitation:
           (i)     an interactive voice response (IVR) system 32, which may be
           any conventional IVR system;
                                             -5-

WO 2006/081525                                                            PCT/US2006/003137
              (ii)      a wireless network 34 that serves a mobile station (MS) (such
              as a mobile telephone, a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA),
              etc.), suitably, the MS engages in the transaction, e.g., via a wireless
              application protocol (WAP), a subscriber identity module application
             toolkit (SIM Toolkit or STK), or a short message service (SMS);
             and/or,
             (iii)      a point of sale (POS) system 36.
     [0021]         Suitably, each container 14 includes a particular program or provisioning
     that regulates the operation of the robot 20 for a particular task associated with the
     container 14, and controls data flow between the robot 20 and the interface 12. For
     example, the network robot 20 is a virtual robot (a.k.a. a "bot"), software agent, or
     other like program. As illustrated, the network robot 20 is operatively connected the
     Internet 40 or another like network. Suitably, the robot 20 is programmed or
    otherwise provisioned to access over the Internet 40 designated documents
                                                                                         (e.g.,
    such as a webpage 50 supplied by a server 52) and/or designated network entities
    (e.g., such as a server or computer at a designated IP address and port) and
    selectively to obtain information or data therefrom and/or to provide or enter input
    thereto.
    [0022]         In one suitable embodiment, the plurality of containers 14 include at least
    one container designated for cardholder/account holder authenticated transaction
    processing. With added reference now to FIGURE 2, suitably, a customer and/or
    cardholder or account holder 60 initiates a non-Internet based transaction via one of
   the interactive communications platforms 30 using a payment device 62. The
   payment device may be a MS, a landline telephone, a POS terminal or card reader
   or other like device capable of utilizing any one or more of the foregoing platforms 30.
   [0023]        For example, the cardholder/account holder 60 optionally initiates a
   telephone order transaction by calling a particular merchant to purchase goods
   and/or services over the telephone. The selection of goods and/or services is suitably
   conducted in any customary manner, e.g., via an operator or customer service
  professional or via an IVR system (such as the IVR system 32), and a purchase
  amount is established. Optionally, the IVR system 32 is operated or managed by the
  merchant or some third party. If not already connected thereto, the cardholder is then
  transferred to'the IVR system 32 to complete the transaction. For example, using
  dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) digits, voice recognition or the like, the cardholder
                                                -6-

WO 2006/081525                                                        PCT/US2006/003137
    enters and/or the IVR system 32 otherwise obtains the relevant account information
    for the payment instrument or card that is to be used for payment. This information
    optionally includes the name on the card, the card number or primary account
    number (PAN) and/or the expiration date. Similarly, a cardholder may also shop
    and/or selectively make payments via any of the other interactive payment platforms
    30 using a payment device appropriate for the respective platform. For example, a
    POS terminal may optionally be used to initiate the transaction. The POS terminal
    may use a card reader, infrared (IR), Bluetooth or other communications technology
    to obtain the relevant information: (i) from a payment device provisioned with the
    account information (e.g., an appropriately equipped MS, PDA, etc.); and/or (ii)
    directly from the payment instrument itself (e.g., a credit card, debit card, or other
    payment instrument).
    [0024]      Suitably, a payment message containing the relevant card data is sent via
    the communications platform used to the transaction conversion system 10.
    Optionally, the platform formats the payment message into an appropriate form, e.g.,
    hypertext mark-up language (HTML), extensible mark-up language (XML), standard
    generalized mark-up language (SGML) or another suitable format that is readable or
    otherwise recognized by the transaction conversion system 10. Alternately, the
    platform transmits the message to the transaction conversion system 10 in a native
    format which is then translated by the interface 12 into the appropriate form. This
    transmission is optionally sent over a dedicated line and/or using a secure channel,
    e.g., secure sockets layer (SSL), Internet Protocol security (IPsec), or the like.
    [0025]      In an alternate embodiment, the card information is not entered by the
    customer 60 or otherwise submitted from the payment device 62, and hence, not
    contained in the payment message. Rather, the card information is maintained in a
    customer information system (CIS) database (DB) 70 (see FIGURE 1) accessible by
    the system 10. The card information in the CIS DB 60 is cross referenced to
    particular cardholders via a mobile subscriber identity number (MSIDN) or telephone
    number of one or more payment devices, e.g., which belong to the cardholders.
    Accordingly, when a cardholder is using a payment device (be it a MS or landline
    telephone) to initiate a transaction, the payment message is populated with the
    MSIDN or telephone number for that device. For example, this information is
    automatically obtained via caller ID or a similar function, or alternately, may be
    entered or otherwise submitted manually, e.g., if the customer is not using their own
                                              -7-

WO 2006/081525                                                          PCT/US2006/003137
     device. In response to the received MSIDN or telephone number, the transaction
     conversion system 10 extracts the corresponding card information from the CIS DB
     70.
     [0026]      Having established the relevant card and/or account data, the information
     (e.g., including the PAN) is ultimately submitted over the Internet 40 to a
     conventional payment network 100 (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc.) for
     authentication of the cardholder/account holder in accordance with a standard
     Internet based transaction. In response, the payment network 100, for example via
     an authentication server 110 (similar to the server 52 shown in FIGURE 1) opens a
     pop-up window containing an authentication webpage 120 (similar to the webpage 50
    shown in FIGURE 1). Suitably, the webpage 120 includes an input field 122 for
    inputting an otherwise secret personal identification number (PIN), password or the
    like, and an optional security message 124. The security message 124 is an
    otherwise secret message set by the cardholder (or otherwise determined) to identify
    that in fact the requesting webpage 120 originates from the payment network 100.
    [0027]       Suitably, the location of the webpage 120 is identified by a uniform
    resource locator (URL), Internet address or other like location identifier, and it is
    optionally formatted in HTML, XML, SGML or another suitable format. The location
    identifier is provided to the robot 20 to thereby direct the robot 20 to the webpage
    120. The robot 20 captures and/or parses the webpage 120 thereby identifying the
    input field 122 and the optional security message 124 (if present). For example, the
    container regulating this operation optionally specifies one or more particular items of
    information and/or input fields to be located in the webpage 120. Accordingly, the
    robot 20 searches or otherwise mines the accessed webpage 120 for the specified
    items/fields and returns the same. Suitably, the items/fields of interest in the
    webpage 120 are marked by appropriate tags, and these tags are specified in the
    container as identifying the item/field of interest. Accordingly, the robot 20 scans or
    parses the accessed webpage 120 searching for the tags. When a tag specified in
   the container is encountered in the webpage 120, the robot 20 captures the
   associated tagged data, information or field from the webpage 120 and returns the
   same. In this manner, the data and/or input fields of interest are obtained by the
    robot 20.
    [0028]      In response to identifying the items and/or input fields of interest, the
   transaction conversion system 10 generates an authentication message that is
                                              -8-

WO 2006/081525                                                         PCT/US2006/003137
     transmitted via the operative communications platform back to the payment device
     62 being used by the cardholder 60. For example, the authentication message
     includes the optional security message 124 (if present) and a request or prompt for
     input into the input field 122. Suitably, the system 10 formats the authentication
     message in a format readable and/or otherwise recognizable by the communications
     platform being employed, and in turn, the authentication message is translated by the
     platform into a form appropriate for the payment device being employed.
     [0029]      For example, the authentication message generated by the system 10 is
     formatted in HTML, XML, SGML or another suitable format, and transmitted to the
     IVR system 32. The IVR system 32, in turn, converts the authentication message into
     a voice message, e.g., using a conventional text-to-speech converter. Accordingly,
     the optional security message 124 (if present) is played or audiblized over the
     payment device (e.g., a telephone) to the cardholder 60, followed by a prompt to
     enter their PIN or password or other security credential, e.g., via DTMF digits or via
    voice if the IVR system 32 includes a voice recognition feature. Of course, if another
     platform is being utilized, the other platform would perform a similar conversion as
     appropriate for the given case. For example, in the case of the wireless platform 34
     and/or payment device 62 supporting SMS, the authentication message may
     ultimately be converted to an SMS message that is delivered to the payment device
     62 in a corresponding fashion. Alternately, the platform merely transmits the
    authentication message in a native format readable and/or otherwise recognizable by
    the payment device 62, the interface 12 of the transaction conversion system 10
     having already translated it into the appropriate form.
     [0030]     As desired, in response to receipt of the authentication message, the
    cardholder 60 confirms that any delivered security message is accurate, and
    assuming it is correct (i.e., that it matches the one arranged with the payment
    network 100), they enter or otherwise submit their security credentials (e.g., a PIN, a
    password, a biometric identifier, etc.) using the payment device 62, e.g., via a reply
    SMS message, DTMF digits, voice, etc., as the case may be for the payment device
    and/or platform being utilized. The PIN or password or other security credential is
    then transmitted via the platform to the transaction conversion system 10,
    undergoing translation and/or conversion along the way as appropriate, i.e., the
    opposite or reverse of the authentication message. Suitably, in response to the
    system 10 receiving the input security credentials, the robot 20 is directed to
                                               -9-

WO 2006/081525                                                           PCT/US2006/003137
     populate the webpage 120 with the security credentials (e.g., by entering or
     otherwise inserting the input security credentials into the corresponding identified
     input field 122) and post the webpage 120 back to the server 110, thereby prompting
     the payment network to perform authentication based on the input security
     credentials and generate an authentication result. Suitably, the authentication result
     is ultimately returned to the system 10, e.g., again via a webpage posted by the
     server 110 and accessed by the robot 20.
     [0031]      Optionally, to maintain security of the cardholder's security credentials or
     other data during various portions of transmission from one node to the next, the
    system 10 is equipped with a modified hardware security module (MHSM) 150 that
    supports a standard public-key or asymmetric encryption technique. Unlike a
    conventional HSM, the MHSM 150 is provisioned with its own public-private key pair
    and is equipped or otherwise provisioned to initiate or engage in secure Internet
    sessions whereby a public session key is obtained by the MHSM 150 and used to re
    encrypt data.
    [0032]       For example, the PIN or other security credentials transmitted to the
    system 10 via one of the platforms 30 is optionally encrypted with the MHSM's public
    key. Suitably, the MHSM's public key is forwarded to the payment device 62 (or a
    suitable node within the communications platform being used) along with the prompt
    or request for PIN entry. It is therefore available to the public key receiving device or
    node which uses the same to encrypt the PIN being transmitted to the system 10.
    Having been received by the system 10, the PIN encrypted with the MHSM's public
    key is routed to the MHSM 150. Suitably, the MHSM 150 originates an SSL or other
    secure session over the Internet 40 with the server 110. During the SSL handshake
   or session setup, the MHSM 150 obtains a public session key from the server 110.
   The MHSM 150 decrypts the PIN with its private key (i.e., the MHSM private key
   corresponding to the MHSM public key), and re-encrypts the PIN using the public
   session key obtained from the server 110. The re-encrypted PIN is then transmitted
   over the Internet 40 to the server 110 which is provisioned with the corresponding
   private session key that is used to decrypt the PIN. As can be appreciated in light of
   the forgoing example, the un-encrypted PIN is only observable within the MHSM 150,
   which, like a conventional HSM, is safeguarded against unauthorized intrusion. Of
   course, other sensitive data and/or information (i.e., other than just the PIN) may
   likewise be protected. Of course, optionally, the PIN delivered to the MHSM 150 may
                                              - 10-

WO 2006/081525                                                         PCT/US2006/003137
    not be encrypted, in which case the MHSM 150 does not decrypt the PIN, rather it
   just encrypts the PIN in accordance with the secure connection set up between itself
    and the server 110.
    [0033]     By generating an SSL session or other similar secure session from within
    MHSM 150, the protection of any sensitive data, such as, PINs, card numbers, etc.,
    can be enhanced. Moreover, by the establishing end-to-end encryption using the
    MHSM 150, the sensitive information is not compromised even to the systems
    administrator of the platform that the service is running on. As with a conventional
    HSM, the MHSM 150 protects against any memory, hardware and software based
   attacks attempting to gain access to the sensitive information.
    [0034]     Suitably, the MHSM 150 is otherwise a conventional HSM with a software
   module placed within the HSM's secure memory area. This software module
   operates within the MHSM 150 to achieve the following functions: (i) receive an
   encrypted piece of sensitive data; (ii) decrypt the sensitive data using the appropriate
   private key; (iii) store the decrypted sensitive data within the FIPS (Federal
   Information Processing Standards) regulated memory of the MHSM 150; (iv) initiate
   a new SSL session with a target server (e.g., server 110); (v) establish intermediate
   session encryption keys based on the SSL interaction between the software module
   and the target server, the intermediate session keys being stored within the FIPS
   regulated memory of the MHSM 150; and, (vi) encrypt the data from step (iii) with the
   session encryption keys and communicate the encrypted data to the target server.
   [0035]      With reference to FIGURE 3, suitably, the merchant in the particular
   exemplary transaction maintains a server 200 operatively connected to the Internet
   40 so as to conduct Internet based transaction or electronic commerce (i.e., e
   commerce). For example, the merchant server 200 includes a plug-in 210 that
   interacts with the payment network 100 in the usual manner for authenticating
   cardholders conducting Internet based transactions and/or authorizing the
   transactions. Suitably, having obtained the aforementioned authentication result or
   determination (e.g., from the server 110), the system 10 forwards the same over the
   Internet 40 to the merchant server 200 in an authentication result message,
   optionally, along with the other relevant transaction details, e.g., payment amount,
   account or card information, etc. The merchant server 200 via plug-in 210 may then
   submit this information to the payment network 100 for authorization in the customary
   manner in which the payment network 100 authorizes Internet based transactions.
                                            - 11 -

WO 2006/081525                                                           PCT/US2006/003137
     Alternately, the system 10 formats and submits the relevant information directly to
     the payment network 100 for authorization.
     [0036]      Optionally, the authentication processing is also carried out via the
     merchant server 200. For example, having established and/or obtained the relevant
     card data, transaction information and/or the PIN, this information may be submitted
     by the system 10 over the Internet 40 to the merchant server 200. More specifically,
    the robot 20 optionally retrieves one or more webpages provided by the server 200
    and populates the relevant input fields with the appropriate data. In this manner, the
    merchant server 200 obtains the transaction data and/or payment information from a
    non-Internet based transaction, and may use the plug-in 210 to access the payment
    network 100 and process the non-Internet based transaction in the same manner as
    if it were an Internet based transaction.
    [0037]      With reference to FIGURE 4, in another suitable embodiment, the plurality
    of containers 14 includes at least one container designed for automatic bill
    presentment and optional payment. For example, the cardholder 60 is optionally a
    customer that subscribes to a service or otherwise obtains goods from a vendor (i.e.,
   a periodic biller 300) that provides periodic electronic bills via server 310. Optionally,
   the cardholder/customer 60 registers with the system 10 for access to the automatic
   bill presentment feature. During registration, the cardholder/customer provides the
   appropriate customer account information for the account maintained by the periodic
   biller 300. This may include, e.g., login information (account number, password, etc.)
   used to access the customer account via server 310. Suitably, this information may
   also be maintained in the CIS DB 70.
   [0038]       Suitably, the automatic bill presentment container contains a uniform
   resource locator (URL), Internet address or other like location identifier. The location
   identifier is provided to the robot 20 to thereby direct the robot 20 to a webpage 320
  having a customer's electronic bill presented thereon. Optionally, the URL directs the
  robot 20 to a login page provided by the server 310. Using the login information
  obtained during the registration process, the robot 20 fills-in the appropriate input
  fields and posts the page back to the server 310, prompting the server 310 to provide
  the webpage 320. Optionally, the container also includes a schedule that determines
  when the robot 20 fetches the electronic bills. The schedule (along with the login
  page URL and/or other location identifier) may be pre-arranged with various different
  vendors and/or customers, e.g., depending on their particular billing cycles and the
                                             - 12 -

WO 2006/081525                                                            PCT/US2006/003137
     vendors' locations on the Internet 40. The billing cycle and/or location information is
     optionally obtained from the customer during the registration process, or may be
     obtained from the vendors.
     [0039]      For example, the electronic bill is optionally formatted in hypertext mark-up
     language (HTML), extensible mark-up language (XML), standard generalized mark
     up language (SGML) or another suitable format. The container also specifies one or
     more particular items of information to be obtained from the webpage 320.
    Accordingly, the robot 20 searches or otherwise mines the accessed webpage for the
     specified items and returns the data, e.g., their respective values. Suitably, the items
    of interest in the electronic bill are marked by appropriate tags. These tags are
    specified in the container. Accordingly, the robot 20 scans the accessed webpage
    searching for the tags. When a specified tag is encountered, the robot 20 captures
    the associated tagged data, information or value and returns the same. In this
    manner, the data of interest is obtained from the customer's electronic bill. The data
    of interest may include, for example, an amount due, a due date, etc. To complete
    presentment of the bill to the customer, the bill is formatted as appropriate for the
    customer's receiving platform, and the bill including the obtained data is sent over the
    customer's receiving platform via the interface 12 for delivery to the customer's end
    user device 62. Optionally, at the time of registration, the cardholder/customer 60
    specifies the device 62 and/or particular communications platform 30, to which and/or
    over which, the automatic bill presentment is to be made. As before, suitably, the
    system 10 (e.g., via interface 12) performs any appropriate translation of the
    electronic bill accessed from the webpage 320 and/or formatting of the data obtained
   therefrom into a format or form supported by the communications platform 30 over
   which it is being sent and recognizable/usable by the device 62 to which it is being
   delivered. Inthis manner, an Internet based (i.e., HTML, XML, SGML, etc.) electronic
   bill, is converted and present to a customer in a non-Internet based fashion (e.g., via
   an IVR system, SMS, etc.).
   [0040]      Suitably, the customer/cardholder 60 is also provided the opportunity to
   pay the presented bill. The webpage 320 may include one or more input fields (e.g.,
   for entering payment instructions and/or payment information) that are obtained by
   the robot 20. Accordingly, the bill presented by the system 10 to the device 62 may
   optionally prompt the user 60 to provide the input for the fields or otherwise obtain
  the information from the device 62 automatically. In response to the entered or
                                            - 13-

WO 2006/081525                                                         PCT/US2006/003137
     otherwise obtained information, the robot 20 populates the input fields and posts the
     webpage 320 back to the server 310 thereby executing payment. Again, as before,
     suitably, the system 10 (e.g., via interface 12) performs any appropriate translation of
     the response from the device 62 and/or formatting of the data obtained therefrom into
     a format or form suitable for input into the webpage 320. The periodic biller 300, then
     may forward this information on to the payment network 100 in the usual manner.
     [0041]      Optionally, the webpage 320 may include a single input field simply asking
     if the customer desires to pay the bill. For example, the customer 60 and vendor 300
     may have a prearranged payment method, e.g., the customer 60 may have
     previously provided payment instrument details and/or payment instructions and
     authorized the vendor 300 to collect payment via that instrument and/or in
    accordance with the prearranged instructions. Additionally, the webpage 320 may
    also include an input field asking the customer how much of the bill they wish to pay,
    again optionally using the prearranged method. In this manner, the customer may
    elect to pay all of the bill at once or some portion of it.
     [0042]     Alternately, the customer and vendor may not have agreed upon a
    prearranged payment method. Accordingly, payment may be processed according to
    the previously described cardholder authenticated transaction processing. The
    periodic biller 300 in this case is simply acts as another merchant maintaining a
    server 310 (similar to server 200) operatively connected to the Internet 40 for
    conducting Internet transactions. Optionally, at the time of registration, the
    customer/cardholder 60 provides the system 10 with the card data or payment
    information to be used for one or more particular vendors or periodic billers 300.
    Suitably, this information is maintained in the CIS DB 70. The system optionally uses
    this information to automatically provided payment details to the periodic biller 300
    when an electronic bill is fetched. Suitably, upon completion of a payment, a
    confirmation of the same is retrieved by the system 10 from the periodic biller 300
    and returned to the customer 60.
    [0043]      In a particular exemplary embodiment, the system 10 also includes a
    container for regulating the top-up or purchase of mobile air time minutes from a
    wireless telecommunications service provider for a mobile telephone or other MS.
    Suitably, the payment device 62 is the MS for which the minutes are being
    purchased, and the communications platform 30 being used is the wireless network
    34 serving the MS. For example, via WAP, SIM Toolkit, SMS, etc., supported on the
                                               -14-

WO 2006/081525                                                          PCT/US2006/003137
     MS, the user 60 sends a message over the wireless network 34 to the wireless
    service provider indicating the desire to purchase more air time minutes for the MS.
    This message is in turn routed to the system 10. The system 10 then acts to obtain
    payer authentication and/or payment authorization accordingly. Suitably, the payment
    or card information is maintained in the CIS DB 70 accessible by the system 10. The
    card information in the CIS DB 60 is cross referenced to the MSIDN of the MS for
    which air time minutes are being purchase. Accordingly, when the MS is used to
    initiate the top-up transaction, the top-up initiation message is populated with the
    MSIDN that device. For example, this information is automatically obtained via caller
    ID or a similar function. In response to the received MSIDN, the transaction
    conversion system 10 extracts the corresponding card information from the CIS DB
    70. Using the extracted information, the system 10 then may obtain authentication
   and/or authorization in its normal manner as previously described. Results from the
   authentication and/or authorization are then returned from the system 10 to the
   wireless service provider which may credit air time to the MS accordingly.
   [0044]       Optionally, in accordance with a more generic embodiment, one of the
   application containers 14 is used to conduct relatively simple payments. For
   example, the system 10 receives instructions from an account holder via the
   interface 12 to make a payment. Accordingly, the robot 20 submits corresponding
   account information over the network 40 to a designated location in response to the
   received instructions. Suitably, the system 10 receives confirmation of the payment
   over the network 40 and relays the confirmation to the account holder via the
   interface 12.
