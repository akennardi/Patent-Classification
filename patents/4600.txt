                                                 3
 [0010] FIGS. 1 and 2 show a first embodiment of the adjustable mounting plate assembly 101.
FIG. 1 is a partially exploded view, while FIG. 2 is an exploded view. The same numerals will
be used to identify elements common to FIGS. 1 and 2. Thus, FIG. 1 shows a channel track 102
for engagement with the surface of a desk (not shown). One of ordinary skill will appreciate
that the channel track 102 may be extruded in one piece or it may consist of multiple pieces
joined together by any means known to the art. Further, the channel track 102 may be formed
from a material such as steel or aluminum. Also shown in FIG. 1 are the hubs 103, the endcaps
 104 and the mounting bolt 105 with optional washer. Hubs 103 may receive arms for
supporting computer monitors. Alternatively, hubs 103 may receive a mount for a desktop
lamp. The endcaps 104 are disposed on each end of the channel track 102 to prevent the plate
nuts (described below) from sliding out of the hollow interior portion (described below) of the
channel track 102.
 [0011] The partially-exploded view of FIG. 1 shows the installation of office accessories on the
assembly. As can be seen in FIG. 1, adjustable monitor arms 106 are provided with a shaft 107
to engage in the coupling with the bushing (described below) disposed in the hub 103.      It
should be appreciated that adjustable monitor arms are not the only office accessories that may
be mounted in the hubs 103. Alternatively, mounts for desktop lights (not shown) could be
mounted in the hubs 103.
 [0012] As can be more clearly seen in FIG. 2, the channel track 102 has a generally flat bottom
surface 201, a hollow interior portion 202 with a generally rectangular cross section defined by
the flat bottom surface 201 and two upper members 203 extending from the flat bottom surface
201, and a slot 204 extending the entire length of the channel track, the slot 204 defined by the
ends of the two upper members 203 and allowing for communication into the hollow interior
portion 202. Also visible in FIG. 2 are the two hubs 103, each of the hubs 103 having a coupling
205 with a bushing 206 disposed therein. The coupling 205 and bushing 206 receive an office
accessory as discussed above. Bushing 206 allows for the free rotation of the shaft 107 of
adjustable monitor arm 106 in coupling 205.
 [0013] FIG. 2 also show the two plate nuts 206. The number of plate nuts 206 corresponds to
the number of hubs 103 in the assembly. For example FIG. 2 shows an assembly with two hubs
and two plate nuts. If the assembly instead included three hubs, three plate nuts would be also
have to be included in the assembly. The plate nuts 206 are disposed in the hollow interior

                                                   4
portion 202 of the channel track 102. Each hub 103 is secured to the corresponding plate nut
206 by a bolt 207 which extends through the hub 103, through the slot 204 in the channel track
102 and into engagement with the corresponding plate nut 206. When the plate nuts 206 and
connected hubs 103 are loosely connected, the plate nuts 206 and connected hubs 103 are free to
slide in the slot 204 in the direction of the length of the channel track 102, i.e. in the direction
defined by the axis labelled "X" in FIG. 2. When the plate nuts 206 and connected hubs 103 are
tightly connected, the plate nuts 206 and connected hubs 103 are retained in their position in the
slot 204 without any sliding movement.
[0014] FIG. 2 also illustrates the mechanism of attachment of the channel track 102 to the desk.
The channel track 102 is provided with a through-hole (not shown) in the flat bottom surface
201, said through-hole allowing bolt 105 to engage an additional plate nut 208 disposed in the
hollow interior portion 202 thereby securing the channel track 102 to the desk. Finally, also
shown in FIG. 2 are pads 209 on the bottom surface of channel track 102 to prevent damage to
the surface of the desk when the assembly is engaged with the desk
[0015] FIGS. 3 and 4 show a second embodiment of the adjustable mounting plate assembly
300. FIG. 3 is an assembled view, while FIG. 4 is an exploded view. Many of the elements
shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 are the same as the elements shown in the FIGS. 1 and 2 and the same
numerals will be used to identify elements already shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Thus, FIG. 3 shows
a channel track 102 for engagement with the surface of a desk (not shown). One of ordinary
skill will appreciate that the channel track 102 may be extruded in one piece or it may consist of
multiple pieces joined together by any means known to the art. Further, the channel track 102
may be formed from a material such as steel or aluminum. Also shown in FIG. 3 are the hubs
103, the endcaps 104. As discussed above with reference to FIG. 1, hubs 103 may receive arms
for supporting computer monitors. Alternatively, hubs 103 may receive a mount for a desktop
lamp. The endcaps 104 are disposed on each end of the channel track 102 to prevent the plate
nuts from sliding out of the hollow interior portion of the channel track 102. FIG. 3 also shows
the clamp assembly 301, which will be discussed in greater detail in the discussion of FIG. 4.
[0016] As can be more clearly seen in FIG. 4, the channel track 102 has a generally flat bottom
surface 201, a hollow interior portion 202 with a generally rectangular cross section defined by
the flat bottom surface 201 and two upper members 203 extending from the flat bottom surface
201, and a slot 204 extending the entire length of the channel track, the slot 204 defined by the

                                                    5
ends of the two upper members 203 and allowing for communication into the hollow interior
portion 202. Also visible in FIG. 4 are the two hubs 103, each of the hubs 103 having a coupling
205 with a bushing 206 disposed therein. The coupling 205 and bushing 206 receive an office
accessory as was disclosed in the discussion of FIG. 1.
[0017] FIG. 4 also show the two plate nuts 206. The number of plate nuts 206 corresponds to
the number of hubs 103 in the assembly. For example FIG. 4 shows an assembly with two hubs
and two plate nuts. If the assembly instead included three hubs, three plate nuts would be also
have to be included in the assembly. The plate nuts 206 are disposed in the hollow interior
portion 202 of the channel track 102. Each hub 103 is secured to the corresponding plate nut
206 by a bolt 207 which extends through the hub 103, through the slot 204 in the channel track
102 and into engagement with the corresponding plate nut 206. When the plate nuts 206 and
connected hubs 103 are loosely connected, the plate nuts 206 and connected hubs 103 are free to
slide in the slot 204 in the direction of the length of the channel track 102, i.e. in the direction
defined by the axis labelled "X" in FIG. 2. When the plate nuts 206 and connected hubs 103 are
tightly connected, the plate nuts 206 and connected hubs 103 are retained in their position in the
slot 204 without any sliding movement.
[0018] FIG. 4 also illustrates the alternative embodiment for the mechanism of attachment of
the channel track 102 to the desk, that is clamp assembly 301. The channel track 102 is
provided with an underdesk clamping portion 401, extending perpendicularly from the flat
bottom surface 201. The underdesk clamping portion 401 further comprises a clamp track 402.
Clamp track 402 is defined by track members 402a and 402b. At least one slidable clamp 403
disposed in the clamp track 402. As can be seen in FIG. 4, two slidable clamps 403 are
provided, but more or less could be provided if necessary depending on the requirements for the
installation. Each slidable clamp 403 has an adjustable screw 404 and a clamp pad 405 for
clamping the channel track 102 to the desk. In operation, the adjustable screw 404 is tightened
to bias clamp pad 405 against the underside of the desk surface, thereby clamping the channel
track 102 in place.
[0019] It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that, while the forgoing
disclosure has been set forth in connection with particular embodiments and examples, the
disclosure is not intended to be necessarily so limited, and that numerous other embodiments,
examples, uses, modifications and departures from the embodiments, examples and uses
