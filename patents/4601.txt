3.      BACKGROUND
         3.1.    Overview
[0003]      Circulating cholesterol is carried by plasma lipoproteins-complex particles of lipid
and protein composition that transport lipids in the blood. Four major classes of lipoprotein
particles circulate in plasma and are involved in the fat-transport system: chylomicrons, very
low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein
(HDL). Chylomicrons constitute a short-lived product of intestinal fat absorption. VLDL and,
particularly, LDL are responsible for the delivery of cholesterol from the liver (where it is
synthesized or obtained from dietary sources) to extrahepatic tissues, including the arterial
walls. HDL, by contrast, mediates reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the removal of
cholesterol lipids, in particular from extrahepatic tissues to the liver, where it is stored,
catabolized, eliminated or recycled. HDL also plays a beneficial role in inflammation,
transporting oxidized lipids and interleukin, which may in turn reduce inflammation in blood
vessel walls.
[0004]      Lipoprotein particles have a hydrophobic core comprised of cholesterol (normally in
the form of a cholesteryl ester) and triglycerides. The core is surrounded by a surface coat
comprising phospholipids, unesterified cholesterol and apolipoproteins. Apolipoproteins
mediate lipid transport, and some may interact with enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. At

least ten apolipoproteins have been identified, including: ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoA-IV, ApoA-V,
ApoB, ApoC-I, ApoC-II, ApoC-III, ApoD, ApoE, ApoJ and ApoH. Other proteins such as
LCAT (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase), CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein), PLTP
(phospholipid transfer protein) and PON (paraoxonase) are also found associated with
lipoproteins.
[0005] Cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease and
atherosclerosis are linked overwhelmingly to elevated serum cholesterol levels. For example,
atherosclerosis is a slowly progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol
within the arterial wall. Compelling evidence supports the theory that lipids deposited in
atherosclerotic lesions are derived primarily from plasma LDLs; thus, LDLs have popularly
become known as "bad" cholesterol. In contrast, HDL serum levels correlate inversely with
coronary heart disease. Indeed, high serum levels of HDLs are regarded as a negative risk factor.
It is hypothesized that high levels of plasma HDLs are not only protective against coronary
artery disease, but may actually induce regression of atherosclerotic plaque (see, e.g., Badimon et
al., 1992, Circulation 86 (Suppl. III):86-94; Dansky and Fisher, 1999, Circulation 100:1762-63;

As a consequence, HDLs have popularly become known as "good" cholesterol, (see, e.g., Zhang,
et al., 2003 Circulation 108:661-663).
                                                 -2-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
[0006] The "protective" role of HDL has been confirmed in a number of studies (e.g., Miller et
al., 1977, Lancet 1(8019):965-68; Whayne et al., 1981, Atherosclerosis 39:411-19). In these
studies, the elevated levels of LDL appear to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk,
whereas high HDL levels seem to confer cardiovascular protection. In vivo studies have further
demonstrated the protective role of HDL, showing that HDL infusions into rabbits may hinder
the development of cholesterol induced arterial lesions (Badimon et al., 1989, Lab. Invest.
60:455-61) and/or induce their regression (Badimon et al., 1990, J. Clin. Invest. 85:1234-41).
         3.2.   Reverse Cholesterol Transport, HDL And Apolipoprotein A-I
[0007] The reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway functions to eliminate cholesterol from
most extrahepatic tissues and is crucial to maintaining the structure and function of most cells in
the body. RCT consists mainly of three steps: (a) cholesterol efflux, i.e., the initial removal of
cholesterol from various pools of peripheral cells; (b) cholesterol esterification by the action of
lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), preventing a re-entry of effluxed cholesterol into
cells; and (c) uptake of HDL-cholesterol and cholesteryl esters to liver cells for hydrolysis, then
recycling, storage, excretion in bile or catabolism to bile acids.
[0008] LCAT, the key enzyme in RCT, is produced by the liver and circulates in plasma
associated with the HDL fraction. LCAT converts cell-derived cholesterol to cholesteryl esters,
which are sequestered in HDL destined for removal (see Jonas 2000, Biochim. Biophys. Acta
1529(1-3):245-56). Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and phospholipid transfer protein
(PLTP) contribute to further remodeling of the circulating HDL population. CETP moves
cholesteryl esters made by LCAT to other lipoproteins, particularly ApoB-comprising
lipoproteins, such as VLDL and LDL. PLIP supplies lecithin to HDL. HDL triglycerides are
catabolized by the extracellular hepatic triglyceride lipase, and lipoprotein cholesterol is removed
by the liver via several mechanisms.
[0009] The functional characteristics of HDL particles are mainly determined by their major
apolipoprotein components such as ApoA-I and ApoA-II. Minor amounts of ApoC-I, ApoC-II,
ApoC-III, ApoD, ApoA-IV, ApoE, and ApoJ have also been observed associated with HDL.
HDL exists in a wide variety of different sizes and different mixtures of the above-mentioned
constituents, depending on the status of remodeling during the metabolic RCT cascade or
pathway.
                                                  -3-

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
[0010] Each HDL particle usually comprises at least 1 molecule, and usually two to 4 molecules,
of ApoA-I. HDL particles may also comprise only ApoE (gamma-LpE particles), which are
known to also be responsible for cholesterol efflux, as described by Prof. Gerd Assmann (see,
e.g., von Eckardstein et al., 1994, Curr Opin Lipidol. 5(6):404-16). ApoA-I is synthesized by the
liver and small intestine as preproApolipoprotein A-I, which is secreted as proApolipoprotein A
I (proApoA-I) and rapidly cleaved to generate the plasma form of ApoA-I, a single polypeptide
chain of 243 amino acids (Brewer et al., 1978, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80:623-30).
PreproApoA-I that is injected experimentally directly into the bloodstream is also cleaved into
the plasma form of ApoA-I (Klon et al., 2000, Biophys. J. 79(3):1679-85; Segrest et al., 2000,
Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 11(2):105-15; Segrest et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274 (45):31755-58).
[0011] ApoA-I comprises 6 to 8 different 22-amino acid alpha-helices or functional repeats
spaced by a linker moiety that is frequently proline. The repeat units exist in amphipathic helical
conformation (Segrest et al., 1974, FEBS Lett. 38: 247-53) and confer the main biological
activities of ApoA-I, i.e., lipid binding and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT)
activation.
[0012] ApoA-I forms three types of stable complexes with lipids: small, lipid-poor complexes
referred to as pre-beta-1 HDL; flattened discoidal particles comprising polar lipids (phospholipid
and cholesterol) referred to as pre-beta-2 HDL; and spherical particles, comprising both polar
and nonpolar lipids, referred to as spherical or mature HDL (HDL 3 and HDL 2 ). Most HDL in
the circulating population comprises both ApoA-I and ApoA-II (the "AI/AII-HDL fraction").
However, the fraction of HDL comprising only ApoA-I (the "AI-HDL fraction") appears to be
more effective in RCT. Certain epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that the ApoA-I
HDL fraction is anti-atherogenic (Parra et al., 1992, Arterioscler. Thromb. 12:701-07; Decossin
et al., 1997, Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 27:299-307).
[0013] HDL particles are made of several populations of particles that have different sizes, lipid
composition and apolipoprotein composition. They can be separated according to their
properties, including their hydrated density, apolipoprotein composition and charge
characteristics. For example, the pre-beta-HDL fraction is characterized by a lower surface
charge than mature alpha-HDL. Because of this charge difference, pre-beta-HDL and mature
                                                   -4-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
alpha-HDL have different electrophoretic mobilities in agarose gel (David et al., 1994, J. Biol.
Chem. 269(12):8959-8965).
[0014] The metabolism of pre-beta-HDL and mature alpha-HDL also differs. Pre-beta-HDL has
two metabolic fates: either removal from plasma and catabolism by the kidney or remodeling to
medium-sized HDL that are preferentially degraded by the liver (Lee et al., 2004, J. Lipid Res.
45(4):716-728).
[0015] Although the mechanism for cholesterol transfer from the cell surface (i.e., cholesterol
efflux) is unknown, it is believed that the lipid-poor complex, pre-beta-1 HDL, is the preferred
acceptor for cholesterol transferred from peripheral tissue involved in RCT (see Davidson et al.,
1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:22975-82; Bielicki et al., 1992, J. Lipid Res. 33:1699-1709; Rothblat et
al., 1992, J. Lipid Res. 33:1091-97; and Kawano et al., 1993, Biochemistry 32:5025-28; Kawano
et al., 1997, Biochemistry 36:9816-25). During this process of cholesterol recruitment from the
cell surface, pre-beta-1 HDL is rapidly converted to pre-beta-2 HDL. PLTP may increase the
rate of pre-beta-2 HDL disc formation, but data indicating a role for PLTP in RCT are lacking.
LCAT reacts preferentially with discoidal, small (pre-beta) and spherical (i.e., mature) HDL,
transferring the 2-acyl group of lecithin or other phospholipids to the free hydroxyl residue of
cholesterol to generate cholesteryl esters (retained in the HDL) and lysolecithin. The LCAT
reaction requires ApoA-I as an activator; i.e., ApoA-I is the natural cofactor for LCAT. The
conversion of cholesterol sequestered in the HDL to its ester prevents re-entry of cholesterol into
the cell, the net result being that cholesterol is removed from the cell.
[0016] Cholesteryl esters in the mature HDL particles in the ApoAI-HDL fraction (i.e.,
comprising ApoA-I and no ApoA-II) are removed by the liver and processed into bile more
effectively than those derived from HDL comprising both ApoA-I and ApoA-II (the Al/AII-HDL
fraction). This may be owed, in part, to the more effective binding of ApoAI-HDL to the
hepatocyte membrane. The existence of an HDL receptor has been hypothesized, and a
scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI) has been identified as an HDL receptor (Acton et al.,
1996, Science 271:518-20; Xu et al., 1997, Lipid Res. 38:1289-98). SR--BI is expressed most
abundantly in steroidogenic tissues (e.g., the adrenals), and in the liver (Landschulz et al., 1996,
J. Clin. Invest. 98:984-95; Rigotti et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271:33545-49). For a review of
HDL receptors, see Broutin et al., 1988, Anal. Biol. Chem. 46:16-23.
                                                    -5-

     WO 2012/109162                                                              PCT/US2012/024020
[0017] Initial lipidation by ATP-binding cassette transporter Al appears to be critical for plasma
HDL formation and for the ability of pre-beta-HDL particles to effect cholesterol efflux (Lee and
Parks, 2005, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 16(1):19-25). According to these authors, this initial lipidation
enables pre-beta-HDL to function more efficiently as a cholesterol acceptor and prevents ApoA-I
from rapidly associating with pre-existing plasma HDL particles, resulting in greater availability
of pre-beta-HDL particles for cholesterol efflux.
[0018] CETP may also play a role in RCT. Changes in CETP activity or its acceptors, VLDL
and LDL, play a role in "remodeling" the HDL population. For example, in the absence of
CETP, the HDLs become enlarged particles that are not cleared. (For reviews of RCT and HDLs,
see Fielding and Fielding, 1995, J. Lipid Res. 36:211-28; Barrans et al., 1996, Biochem.
Biophys. Acta 1300:73-85; Hirano et al., 1997, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 17(6):1053
59).
[0019] HDL also plays a role in the reverse transport of other lipids and apolar molecules, and in
detoxification, i.e., the transport of lipids from cells, organs, and tissues to the liver for
catabolism and excretion. Such lipids include sphingomyelin (SM), oxidized lipids, and
lysophophatidylcholine. For example, Robins and Fasulo (1997, J. Clin. Invest. 99:380-84) have
shown that HDLs stimulate the transport of plant sterol by the liver into bile secretions.
[0020] The major component of HDL, ApoA-I, can associate with SM in vitro. When ApoA-I is
reconstituted in vitro with bovine brain SM (BBSM), a maximum rate of reconstitution occurs at
28'C, the temperature approximating the phase transition temperature for BBSM (Swaney, 1983,
J. Biol. Chem. 258(2), 1254-59). At BBSM:ApoA-I ratios of 7.5:1 or less (wt/wt), a single
reconstituted homogeneous HDL particle is formed that comprises three ApoA-I molecules per
particle and that has a BBSM:ApoA-I molar ratio of 360:1. It appears in the electron microscope
as a discoidal complex similar to that obtained by recombination of ApoA-I with
phosphatidylcholine at elevated ratios of phospholipid/protein. At BBSM:ApoA-I ratios of 15:1
(wt/wt), however, larger-diameter discoidal complexes form that have a higher
phospholipid:protein molar ratio (535:1). These complexes are significantly larger, more stable,
and more resistant to denaturation than ApoA-I complexes formed with phosphatidylcholine.
[0021] Sphingomyelin (SM) is elevated in early cholesterol acceptors (pre-beta-HDL and
gamma-migrating ApoE-comprising lipoprotein), suggesting that SM might enhance the ability

of these particles to promote cholesterol efflux (Dass and Jessup, 2000, J. Pharm. Pharmacol.
52:731-61; Huang et al., 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:1834-38; Fielding and Fielding
1995, J. Lipid Res. 36:211-28).
         3.3.    Protective Mechanism of HDL and ApoA-I
[0022] Studies of the protective mechanism(s) of HDL have focused on Apolipoprotein A-I
(ApoA-I), the major component of HDL. High plasma levels of ApoA-I are associated with
absence or reduction of coronary lesions (Maciejko et al., 1983, N. Engl. J. Med. 309:385-89;
Sedlis et al., 1986, Circulation 73:978-84).
[0023] The infusion of ApoA-I or of HDL in experimental animals exerts significant
biochemical changes, as well as reduces the extent and severity of atherosclerotic lesions. After
an initial report by Maciejko and Mao (1982, Arteriosclerosis 2:407a), Badimon et al., (1989,
Lab. Invest. 60:455-61; 1989, J. Clin. Invest. 85:1234-41) found that they could significantly
reduce the extent of atherosclerotic lesions (reduction of 45%) and their cholesterol ester content
(reduction of 58.5%) in cholesterol-fed rabbits, by infusing HDL (d=1.063-1.325 g/ml). They
also found that the infusions of HDL led to a close to a 50% regression of established lesions.
Esper et al. (1987, Arteriosclerosis 7:523a) have shown that infusions of HDL can markedly
change the plasma lipoprotein composition of Watanabe rabbits with inherited
hypercholesterolemia, which develop early arterial lesions. In these rabbits, HDL infusions can
more than double the ratio between the protective HDL and the atherogenic LDL.
[0024] The potential of HDL to prevent arterial disease in animal models has been further
underscored by the observation that ApoA-I can exert a fibrinolytic activity in vitro (Saku et al.,
1985, Thromb. Res. 39:1-8). Ronneberger (1987, Xth Int. Congr. Pharmacol., Sydney, 990)
demonstrated that ApoA-I can increase fibrinolysis in beagle dogs and in Cynomologous
monkeys. A similar activity can be noted in vitro on human plasma. Ronneberger was able to
confirm a reduction of lipid deposition and arterial plaque formation in ApoA-I treated animals.
[0025] In vitro studies indicate that complexes of ApoA-I and lecithin can promote the efflux of
free cholesterol from cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (Stein et al., 1975, Biochem. Biophys.
Acta, 380:106-18). By this mechanism, HDL can also reduce the proliferation of these cells
(Yoshida et al., 1984, Exp. Mol Pathol. 41:258-66).

[0026] Infusion therapy with HDL comprising ApoA-I or ApoA-I mimetic peptides has also
been shown to regulate plasma HDL levels by the ABC 1 transporter, leading to efficacy in the
treatment of cardiovascular disease (see, e.g., Brewer et al., 2004, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.
Biol. 24:1755-1760).
[0027] Two naturally occurring human polymorphism of ApoA-I have been isolated in which an
arginine residue is substituted with cysteine. In Apolipoprotein A-Imilano (ApoA-Im), this
substitution occurs at residue 173, whereas in Apolipoprotein A-Iparis (ApoA-Ip), this substitution
occurs at residue 151 (Franceschini et al., 1980, J. Clin. Invest. 66:892-900; Weisgraber et al.,
1983, J. Biol. Chem. 258:2508-13; Bruckert et al., 1997, Atherosclerosis 128:121-28; Daum et
al., 1999, J. Mol. Med. 77:614-22; Klon et al., 2000, Biophys. J. 79(3):1679-85). Yet a further
naturally occurring human polymorphism of ApoA-I has been isolated, in which a leucine is
substituted with an arginine at position 144. This polymorphism has been termed Apolipoprotein
A-I Zaragoza (ApoA-Iz) and is assocated with severe hypoalphalipoproteinemia and an enhanced
effect of high density lipoprotein (HDL) reverse cholesterol transport (Recalde et al., 2001,
Atherosclerosis 154(3):613-623; Fiddyment et al., 2011, Protein Expr. Purif. 80(1):110-116).
[0028] Reconstituted HDL particles comprising disulfide-linked homodimers of either ApoA-Im
or ApoA-Ip are similar to reconstituted HDL particles comprising wild-type ApoA-I in their
ability to clear dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) emulsions and their ability to promote
cholesterol efflux (Calabresi et al., 1997b, Biochemistry 36:12428-33; Franceschini et al., 1999,
Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 19:1257-62; Daum et al., 1999, J. Mol. Med. 77:614-22). In
both mutations, heterozygous individuals have decreased levels of HDL but paradoxically, are at
a reduced risk for atherosclerosis (Franceschini et al., 1980, J. Clin. Invest. 66:892-900;
Weisgraber et al., 1983, J. Biol. Chem. 258:2508-13; Bruckert et al., 1997, Atherosclerosis
128:121-28). Reconstituted HDL particles comprising either variant are capable of LCAT
activation, although with decreased efficiency when compared with reconstituted HDL particles
comprising wild-type ApoA-I (Calabresi et al., 1997, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.
232:345-49; Daum et al., 1999, J. Mol. Med. 77:614-22).
[0029] The ApoA-Im mutation is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait; eight generations of
carriers within a family have been identified (Gualandri et al., 1984, Am. J. Hum. Genet.
37:1083-97). The status of an ApoA-Im carrier individual is characterized by a remarkable

reduction in HDL-cholesterol level. In spite of this, carrier individuals do not apparently show
any increased risk of arterial disease. Indeed, by examination of genealogical records, it appears
that these subjects may be "protected" from atherosclerosis (Sirtori et al., 2001, Circulation, 103:
1949-1954; Roma et al., 1993, J. Clin. Invest. 91(4):1445-520).
[0030] The mechanism of the possible protective effect of ApoA-Im in carriers of the mutation
seems to be linked to a modification in the structure of the mutant ApoA-Im, with loss of one
alpha-helix and an increased exposure of hydrophobic residues (Franceschini et al., 1985, J. Biol.
Chem. 260:1632-35). The loss of the tight structure of the multiple alpha-helices leads to an
increased flexibility of the molecule, which associates more readily with lipids, compared to
normal ApoA-I. Moreover, lipoprotein complexes are more susceptible to denaturation, thus
suggesting that lipid delivery is also improved in the case of the mutant.
[0031] Bielicki, et al. (1997, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 17 (9):1637-43) has
demonstrated that ApoA-Im has a limited capacity to recruit membrane cholesterol compared
with wild-type ApoA-I. In addition, nascent HDL formed by the association of ApoA-Im with
membrane lipids was predominantly 7.4-nm particles rather than larger 9- and 11-nm complexes
formed by wild-type ApoA-I. These observations indicate that the Arg173 ->Cys1     73 substitution in
the ApoA-I primary sequence interfered with the normal process of cellular cholesterol
recruitment and nascent HDL assembly. The mutation is apparently associated with a decreased
efficiency for cholesterol removal from cells. Its antiatherogenic properties may therefore be
unrelated to RCT.
[0032] The most striking structural change attributed to the Arg173->Cys173 substitution is the
dimerization of ApoA-Im (Bielicki et al., 1997, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 17 (9):1637
43). ApoA-Im can form homodimers with itself and heterodimers with ApoA-II. Studies of
blood fractions comprising a mixture of apolipoproteins indicate that the presence of dimers and
complexes in the circulation may be responsible for an increased elimination half-life of
apolipoproteins. Such an increased elimination half-life has been observed in clinical studies of
carriers of the mutation (Gregg et al., 1988, NATO ARW on Human Apolipoprotein Mutants:
From Gene Structure to Phenotypic Expression, Limone S G). Other studies indicate that ApoA
IMdimers (ApoA-Im / ApoA-Im) act as an inhibiting factor in the interconversion of HDL
particles in vitro (Franceschini et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265:12224-3 1).

         3.4.    Current Treatments for Dyslipidemia and Related Disorders
[0033] Dyslipidemic disorders are diseases associated with elevated serum cholesterol and
triglyceride levels and lowered serum HDL:LDL ratios, and include hyperlipidemia, especially
hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, vascular and perivascular
diseases, and cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Syndromes associated with
atherosclerosis such as transient ischemic attack or intermittent claudication, caused by arterial
insufficiency, are also included. A number of treatments are currently available for lowering the
elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides associated with dyslipidemic disorders. However,
each has its own drawbacks and limitations in terms of efficacy, side-effects and qualifying
patient population.
[0034] Bile-acid-binding resins are a class of drugs that interrupt the recycling of bile acids from
the intestine to the liver; e.g., cholestyramine (Questran Light@, Bristol-Myers Squibb),
colestipol hydrochloride (Colestid@, The Upjohn Company), and colesevelam hydrochloride
(Welchol@, Daiichi-Sankyo Company). When taken orally, these positively-charged resins bind
to the negatively charged bile acids in the intestine. Because the resins cannot be absorbed from
the intestine, they are excreted carrying the bile acids with them. The use of such resins at best,
however, only lowers serum cholesterol levels by about 20%, and is associated with
gastrointestinal side-effects, including constipation and certain vitamin deficiencies. Moreover,
since the resins bind other drugs, other oral medications must be taken at least one hour before or
four to six hours subsequent to ingestion of the resin; thus, complicating heart patient's drug
regimens.
[0035] Statins are cholesterol lowering agents that block cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting
HMGCoA reductase, the key enzyme involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Statins,
e.g., lovastatin (Mevacor@), simvastatin (Zocor@), pravastatin (Pravachol@), fluvastatin
(Lescol@) and atorvastatin (Lipitor@), are sometimes used in combination with bile-acid-binding
resins. Statins significantly reduce serum cholesterol and LDL-serum levels, and slow
progression of coronary atherosclerosis. However, serum HDL cholesterol levels are only
moderately increased. The mechanism of the LDL lowering effect may involve both reduction
of VLDL concentration and induction of cellular expression of LDL-receptor, leading to reduced
production and/or increased catabolism of LDLs. Side effects, including liver and kidney
                                                  -10-

       WO 2012/109162                                                        PCT/US2012/024020
dysfunction are associated with the use of these drugs (The Physicians Desk Reference,      5 6 th Ed.,
2002, Medical Economics).
[0036] Niacin (nicotinic acid) is a water soluble vitamin B-complex used as a dietary supplement
and antihyperlipidemic agent. Niacin diminishes production of VLDL and is effective at
lowering LDL. In some cases, it is used in combination with bile-acid binding resins. Niacin
can increase HDL when used at adequate doses, however, its usefulness is limited by serious side
effects when used at such high doses. Niaspan@ is a form of extended-release niacin that
produces fewer side effects than pure niacin. Niacin/Lovastatin (Nicostatin@) is a formulation
containing both niacin and lovastatin and combines the benefits of each drug.
[0037] Fibrates are a class of lipid-lowering drugs used to treat various forms of hyperlipidemia
(i.e., elevated serum triglycerides) that may also be associated with hypercholesterolemia.
Fibrates appear to reduce the VLDL fraction and modestly increase HDL, however the effect of
these drugs on serum cholesterol is variable. In the United States, fibrates such as clofibrate
(Atromid-S@), fenofibrate (Tricor@) and bezafibrate (Bezalip@) have been approved for use as
antilipidemic drugs, but have not received approval as hypercholesterolemia agents. For
example, clofibrate is an antilipidemic agent that acts (via an unknown mechanism) to lower
serum triglycerides by reducing the VLDL fraction. Although serum cholesterol may be reduced
in certain patient subpopulations, the biochemical response to the drug is variable, and is not
always possible to predict which patients will obtain favorable results. Atromid-S@ has not been
shown to be effective for prevention of coronary heart disease. The chemically and
pharmacologically related drug, gemfibrozil (Lopid@) is a lipid regulating agent that moderately
decreases serum triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol, and moderately increases HDL cholesterol
-the HDL 2 and HDL 3 subfractions as well as both ApoA-I and A-II (i.e., the AI/AMT-HDL
fraction). However, the lipid response is heterogeneous, especially among different patient
populations. Moreover, while prevention of coronary heart disease was observed in male
patients between 40-55 without history or symptoms of existing coronary heart disease, it is not
clear to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other patient populations (e.g., women,
older and younger males). Indeed, no efficacy was observed in patients with established
coronary heart disease. Serious side-effects are associated with the use of fibrates including
toxicity such as malignancy (especially gastrointestinal cancer), gallbladder disease and an
increased incidence in non-coronary mortality.

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
[0038] Oral estrogen replacement therapy may be considered for moderate hypercholesterolemia
in post-menopausal women. However, increases in HDL may be accompanied with an increase
in triglycerides. Estrogen treatment is, of course, limited to a specific patient population
(postmenopausal women) and is associated with serious side effects including induction of
malignant neoplasms, gall bladder disease, thromboembolic disease, hepatic adenoma, elevated
blood pressure, glucose intolerance, and hypercalcemia.
[0039] Other agents useful for the treatment of hyperlipidemia include ezetimibe (Zetia@;
Merck), which blocks or inhibits cholesterol absorption. However, inhibitors of ezetimibe have
been shown to exhibit certain toxicities.
[0040] HDL, as well as recombinant forms of ApoA-I complexed with phospholipids can serve
as sinks/scavengers for apolar or amphipathic molecules, e.g., cholesterol and derivatives
(oxysterols, oxidized sterols, plant sterols, etc.), cholesterol esters, phospholipids and derivatives
(oxidized phospholipids), triglycerides, oxidation products, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (see,
e.g., Casas et al., 1995, J. Surg. Res. Nov 59(5):544-52). HDL can also serve as also a scavenger
for TNF-alpha and other lymphokines. HDL can also serve as a carrier for human serum
paraoxonases, e.g., PON-1,-2,-3. Paraoxonase, an esterase associated with HDL, is important for
protecting cell components against oxidation. Oxidation of LDL, which occurs during oxidative
stress, appears directly linked to development of atherosclerosis (Aviram, 2000, Free Radic. Res.
33 Suppl:S85-97). Paraoxonase appears to play a role in susceptibility to atherosclerosis and
cardiovascular disease (Aviram, 1999, Mol. Med. Today 5(9):381-86). Human serum
paraoxonase (PON-1) is bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Its activity is inversely
related to atherosclerosis. PON-1 hydrolyzes organophosphates and may protect against
atherosclerosis by inhibition of the oxidation of HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
(Aviram, 1999, Mol. Med. Today 5(9):381-86). Experimental studies suggest that this protection
is associated with the ability of PON-1 to hydrolyze specific lipid peroxides in oxidized
lipoproteins. Interventions that preserve or enhance PON- 1 activity may help to delay the onset
of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.
[0041] HDL further has a role as an antithrombotic agent and fibrinogen reducer, and as an agent
in hemorrhagic shock (Cockerill et al., WO 01/13939, published March 1, 2001). HDL, and
ApoA-I in particular, has been show to facilitate an exchange of lipopolysaccharide produced by
                                                   -12-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
sepsis into lipid particles comprising ApoA-I, resulting in the functional neutralization of the
lipopolysaccharide (Wright et al., W09534289, published December 21, 1995; Wright et al.,
U.S. Patent No. 5,928,624 issued July 27, 1999; Wright et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,932,536, issued
Aug. 3, 1999).
[0042] There are a variety of methods available for making lipoprotein complexes in vitro. U.S.
Patent Nos. 6,287,590 and 6,455,088 disclose a method entailing co-lyophilization of
apolipoprotein and lipid solutions in organic solvent (or solvent mixtures) and formation of
charged lipoprotein complexes during hydration of the lyophilized powder. Lipoprotein
complexes can also be formed by a detergent dialysis method; e.g., a mixture of a lipid, a
lipoprotein and a detergent such as cholate is dialyzed and reconstituted to form a complex (see,
e.g., Jonas et al., 1986, Methods Enzymol. 128:553-82). Example 1 of U.S. publication
2004/0067873 discloses a cholate dispersion method, in which a lipid dispersion is combined
with cholate under conditions for forming micelles, and these in turn are incubated with an
apoliprotein solution to form complexes. Ultimately, the cholate, which is toxic, has to be
removed, e.g., by dialysis, ultrafiltration or adsorption absorption onto an affinity bead or resin.
U.S. Patent No. 6,306,433 discloses lipoprotein complex formation by subjecting a fluid mixture
of a protein and lipid to high pressure homogenization. However, proteins that are sensitive to
high shear forces can lose activity when exposed to high pressure homogenization.
[0043] Thus, currently available manufacturing methods result in wastage of starting materials,
such as protein degradation, and/or require purification of the resulting product, such as removal
of a toxic agent, and thus are inefficient and costly. Additionally, preparations of lipoprotein
complexes can be heterogeneous, containing a mixture of complexes varying in size and in
composition. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,876,968. Accordingly, there is a need to develop new
methods for production of lipoprotein complexes that are efficient and yield more homogeneous
complexes, preferably having a high degree of purity. Such processes could allow more
economical production on a large scale while generating a more uniform pharmaceutically
acceptable product with fewer risks of side effects due to contaminants.
[0044] Moreoever, the therapeutic use of ApoA-I, ApoA-Im, ApoA-Ip and other variants, as well
as reconstituted HDL, is presently limited, however, by the large amount of apolipoprotein
required for therapeutic administration and by the cost of protein production, considering the low

suggested by early clinical trials that the dose range is between 1.5-4 g of protein per infusion for
treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The number of infusions required for a full treatment is
unknown. (See, e.g., Eriksson et al., 1999, Circulation 100(6):594-98; Carlson, 1995, Nutr.

[0054] Lipoproteins and lipoprotein complexes are currently being developed for clinical use,
with clinical studies using different lipoprotein-based agents establishing the feasibility of
lipoprotein therapy (Tardif, 2010, Journal of Clinical Lipidology 4:399-404). One study
evaluated autologous delipidated HDL (Waksman et al., 2010, J Am. Coll. Cardiol. 5 5:2727
2735). Another study evaluated ETC-216, a complex of recombinant ApoA-Im and palmitoyl
oleoyl-PC (POPC) (Nissen et al., 2003, JAMA 290:2292-2300). CSL-1 11 is a reconstituted
human ApoA-I purified from plasma complexed with soybean phosphatidylcholine (SBPC)
(Tardif et al., 2007, JAMA 297:1675-1682). Current exploratory drugs have shown efficacy in
reducing the atherosclerotic plaque but the effect was accompanied by secondary effects such as
increase in transaminases or formation of ApoA-I antibodies (Nanjee et al., 1999, Arterioscler.

issued Sept. 25, 2007). For example, the ERASE clinical trial (Tardiff et al., 2007, JAMA
297:1675-1682) utilized two doses of CSL-111: 40 mg/kg and 80mg/kg of ApoA-I. The 80
mg/kg dose group had to be stopped due to liver toxicity (as shown by serious transaminase
elevation). Even in the 40 mg/kg dose group several patient experience transaminase elevation.
[0055] The need therefore exists for safer drugs that are more efficacious in lowering serum
cholesterol, increasing HDL serum levels, preventing and/or treating dyslipidemia and/or
diseases, conditions and/or disorders associated with dyslipidemia. There is a need in the art for
lipoprotein formulations that are not associated with liver toxicity, and preferably induce only
minimal (or no) increase in triglycerides, LDL-triglycerides, or VLDL-triglycerides, as well as
for robust production methods that can be used to reliably make these lipoprotein formulations
on a commercial scale.

4.       SUMMARY
[0056] The present disclosure provides lipoprotein complexes, comprising a protein fraction
(e.g., an apolipoprotein fraction) and a lipid fraction, and populations thereof that are especially
suited to treating and/or preventing dyslipidemia and diseases, disorders and/or conditions
associated with dyslipidemia. It has been discovered that populations of complexes which have
greater purity and/or homogeneity, and/or comprise particular ratios of lipids and proteins, as
described herein, have increased ability to mobilize cholesterol combined with reduced risk of
side effects.
[0057] The lipoprotein complexes comprise a protein fraction (e.g., an apolipoprotein fraction)
and a lipid fraction (e.g., a phospholipid fraction). The protein fraction includes one or more
lipid-binding proteins, such as apolipoproteins, peptides, or apolipoprotein peptide analogs or
mimetics capable of mobilizing cholesterol when present in a lipoprotein complex. Non-limiting
examples of such apolipoproteins and apolipoprotein peptides include preproapoliproteins,
preproApoA I, proApoA-I, ApoA-I, preproApoA-II, proApoA-II, ApoA-II, preproApoA-IV,
proApoA- IV, ApoA-IV, ApoA-V, preproApoE, proApoE, ApoE, preproApoA-Im, proApoA-Im,
ApoA-Im, preproApoA-Ip, proApoA-Ip, ApoA-Ip, preproApoA-Iz, proApoA-Iz, and ApoA-Iz.
The apolipoprotein(s) can be in the form of monomers, dimers, or trimers, or mixtures thereof.
In a specific embodiment, the apolipoprotein fraction consists essentially of ApoA-I, most
preferably of a single isoform. ApoA-I in lipoprotein complexes can have at least 90% or at least
95% sequence identity to a protein corresponding to amino acids 25 to 267 of SEQ ID NO: 1.
Optionally, ApoA-I further comprises an aspartic acid at the position corresponding to the full
length ApoA-I amino acid 25 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (and position 1 of the mature protein).
Preferably, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% or at least 95% of the ApoA-I is
correctly processed, mature protein (i.e., lacking the signal and propeptide sequences) and not
oxidized, deamidated and/or truncated.
[0058] The present disclosure also provides mammalian host cells engineered to express ApoA
I, cell cultures comprising ApoA-I, and methods of producing mature, biologically active ApoA
I. It has been discovered that it is possible to engineer mammalian host cells to express large
quantities of mature ApoA-I, that is substantially free of both immature ApoA-I (proApoA-I) and
truncated forms of ApoA-I generated by protease degradation. These results are surprising.
First, host cell machinery for protein processing could be expected to be overwhelmed by
                                                  -16-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
overexpression of a heterologous protein such as ApoA-I, leading to the production of the
unprocessed, immature protein. Second, ApoA-I secreted into the culture medium is subject to
degradation by proteases and yet, only low levels of truncated ApoA-I are observed in the culture
medium. The mammalian host cells, cell culture and the methods of producing ApoA-I are
particularly suited to the production of mature protein, useful in therapeutic applications, in
commercially relevant quantities.
[0059] As provided herein, a mammalian host cell is engineered to express a protein that
preferably comprises (or consists of) an amino acid sequence having at least 95%, at least 96%,
at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% identity to positions 25 to 267 of SEQ ID
NO:1. The protein preferably has an aspartic acid residue at the position corresponding to
position 25 of SEQ ID NO: 1. The mammalian host cell can optionally further secrete such a
protein. In some instances, the protein expressed and/or secreted by the mammalian host cell can
further comprise an 18-amino acid signal sequence (MKAAVLTLAVLFLTGSQA, SEQ ID
NO:2) and/or a 6-amino acid propeptide sequence (RHFWQQ, SEQ ID NO:3). In some
instances, the host cell is engineered to express a protein comprising an amino acid sequence
having at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% identity to
SEQ ID NO:1.
[0060] The host cell can be from any mammalian cell line, including but not limited to Chinese
hamster ovary (e.g., CHO-KI or CHO-S), VERO, BHK, BHK 570, HeLa, COS-1, COS-7,
MDCK, 293, 3T3, PC 12 and W138, or from an amyeloma cell or cell line (e.g., a murine
myeloma cell or cell line).
[0061] The mammalian host cell can further contain multiple copies of a nucleic acid encoding
an ApoA-I protein, e.g., a protein comprising or consisting of positions 25 to 267 of SEQ ID
NO: 1. For example, the mammalian host cell can contain at least about 5, 6, 7, 8, or more
copies, and up to about 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 copies of the nucleic acid. The nucleic acid can

mammalian host cell, such as, for example, a simian cytomegalovirus promoter or more
specifically, immediate early simian cytomegalovirus promoter.
[0062] The mammalian host cells are preferably capable of producing at least about 0.5, 1, 2, or

to about 500L, 1OOL, 2000L, 5000L, 10,OOOL, 25,OOOL, or 50,000 L or more. In varying
embodiments, the culture volume can range from 1OL to 5OL, from 5OL to 1OOL, from 1OOL to
15OL, from 15OL to 200L, from 200L to 300L, from 300L to 5OOL, from 5OOL to 1OOL, from

L, 25 L, 30 L, 50 L, 100 L, 200L, 300L, 500L, 1000L, 5000L, 10,OOOL, 15,OOOL, 20,OOOL,
25,OOOL, up to 50,OOOL or more.
[0063] The mammalian host cells of the present disclosure can be grown in culture. Thus, the
present disclosure further provides a mammalian cell culture, comprising a plurality of
mammalian host cells as described above or in Section 6.1.2 below. The cell culture can include
one or more of the following features: (a) the culture (which is optionally a large scale batch
culture of at least 10 liters, at least 20 liters, at least 30 liters, at least 50 liters, at least 100 liters,
300L, 500L, 1000L, 5000L, 10,OOOL, 15,OOOL, 20,OOOL, 25,OOOL, up to 50,OOOL or a continuous
culture of at least 10 liters, at least 20 liters, at least 30 liters, at least 50 liters, at least 100 liters,
300L, 500L, 1OOL, 5000L, or up to 10,OOOL) comprises at least about 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0,
3.5, 4.0 g/L or more of mature ApoA-I protein comprising or consisting of an amino sequence
corresponding to amino acids 25 to 267 of SEQ ID NO:1; (b) at least 75%, at least 80%, at least
85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, or at least 99% of the protein in the culture
medium is an ApoA-I protein lacking a signal sequence; (c) at least 75%, at least 80%, at least
85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, or at least 99% of the protein in the culture
medium is a mature ApoA-I protein lacking a signal sequence and a propeptide sequence; and
(d) at least 7 5%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% of the mature ApoA-I is
not truncated, oxidized, or deamidated.
[0064] The present disclosure also provides methods of producing mature, biologically active
ApoA-I. Generally, the methods comprise culturing any of the mammalian host cells described
above or in Section 6.1.2 under conditions in which ApoA-I is expressed and secreted. The
method can further include a step of recovering from the supernatant of a cultured mammalian
host cell, and optionally purifying, the mature, biologically active ApoA-I (such as by the
methods disclosed in Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 below).

[0065] ApoA-I obtained or obtainable by the methods described above can further be complexed
with lipid to form a lipoprotein complex as described herein, and/or incorporated into
pharmaceutical compositions in therapeutically effective amounts. The pharmaceutical
compositions preferably are phosphate buffered solutions that also contain sucrose and/or
mannitol as excipients.
[0066] It has further been discovered that, by purifying ApoA-I using a new combination of
chromatography and filtration steps, large quantities of pure ApoA-I can be produced that
contains levels of host cell proteins, host cell DNA, endotoxins and truncated forms of the
protein that are low enough to confer one or more attributes, including reduced risk of side
effects and low or no toxicity, rendering the protein particularly suitable for therapeutic uses.
Preferably, ApoA-I purified by the methods described herein is produced recombinantly in
mammalian cells and is secreted into the growth medium. Accordingly, the present disclosure
relates to a method of purifying ApoA-I comprising the steps of: (a) contacting an ApoA-I
containing solution with an anion exchange matrix under conditions such that the ApoA-I does
not bind to the matrix; (b) filtering the ApoA-I containing solution obtained in step (a) through a
membrane having a pore size sufficient to remove viruses or viral particles; (c) passing the
filtrate obtained in step (b) through a first reverse phase chromatography column under
conditions such that the ApoA-I binds to the matrix; (d) eluting from the first reverse phase
chromatography matrix a first ApoA-I containing reverse phase eluate using a gradient of
increasing concentrations of an organic solvent; (e) passing the first ApoA-I reverse phase eluate
from step (d) through a second reverse phase chromatography column under conditions such that
the ApoA-I binds to the matrix; and (f) eluting from the second reverse phase chromatography
matrix a second ApoA-I containing reverse phase eluate using a gradient of increasing
concentrations of an organic solvent. The order in which the steps are performed is not critical,
for example, in an exemplary embodiment the step of filtering through a membrane to remove
viruses or viral particles is performed after step (f) above, rather than after step (a).
[0067] Also provided herein is a substantially pure ApoA-I product obtained or obtainable by the
purification methods described herein in which the concentration of ApoA-I is at least 10 g/L.
The substantially pure ApoA-I product produced by the purification methods described herein
preferably comprises less than about 10 pg of host cell DNA per mg of ApoA-I, less than about
100 ng of host cell proteins per mg of ApoA-I, and/or less than 0.1 EU of endotoxin per mg of
                                                   -19-

ApoA-I. The ApoA-I product can be at least 95% pure, at least 96% pure, at least 97% pure, at
least 98% pure or at least 99% pure.
[0068] Furthermore, the substantially pure ApoA-I product can be incorporated into any of the
pharmaceutical compositions and/or lipoprotein complexes described herein that comprise
ApoA-I.
[0069] The lipid fraction typically includes one or more phospholipids which can be neutral,
negatively charged, positively charged, or a combination thereof. The fatty acid chains on
phospholipids are preferably from 12 to 26 or 16 to 26 carbons in length and can vary in degree
of saturation from saturated to mono-unsaturated. Exemplary phospholipids include small alkyl
chain phospholipids, egg phosphatidylcholine, soybean phosphatidylcholine,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine
1-myristoyl-2-palmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-myristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1

aminophenylglycoside, 3-cholesteryl-6'-(glycosylthio)hexyl ether glycolipids, and cholesterol
and its derivatives. Phospholipid fractions including SM and palmitoylsphingomyelin can
optionally include small quantities of any type of lipid, including but not limited to
lysophospholipids, sphingomyelins other than palmitoylsphingomyelin, galactocerebroside,
gangliosides, cerebrosides, glycerides, triglycerides, and cholesterol and its derivatives.

[0070] Most preferably the lipid fraction contains at least one neutral phospholipid and,
optionally, one or more negatively charged phospholipids. In lipoprotein complexes that include
both neutral and negatively charged phospholipids, the neutral and negatively charged
phospholipids can have fatty acid chains with the same or different number of carbons and the
same or different degree of saturation. In some instances, the neutral and negatively charged
phospholipids will have the same acyl tail, for example a C 16:0, or palmitoyl, acyl chain.
[0071] When the lipid component of the complex comprises or consists of neutral and negatively
charged phospholipids, the weight-to-weight (wt:wt) ratio of neutral to negatively charged
phospholipid(s) is preferably in a wt:wt ratio ranging from about 99:1 to about 90:10, more
preferably from about 99:1 to about 95:5, and most preferably from about 98:2 to about 96:4. In
one embodiment, the neutral phospholipid(s) and the negatively charged phospholipid(s) are
present in a weight-to-weight (wt:wt) ratio of neutral phospholipid(s) to negatively charged
phospholipid(s) of about 97:3.
[0072] The neutral phospholipid can be natural or synthetic. Preferably, the phospholipid is a
sphingomyelin ("SM"), such as palmitoyl sphingomyelin, a phytosphingomyelin, a
diphytosphingomyelin, a phosphosphingolipid, or a glycosphingolipid, optionally with saturated
or mono-unsaturated fatty acids with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms. SM can be from
any source. For example, the SM can be obtained from milk, egg, brain, or made synthetically.
In a specific embodiment, the SM is obtained from chicken egg ("egg SM"). In another specific
embodiment, the SM is palmitoylsphingomyelin.
[0073] Any phospholipid that bears at least a partial negative charge at physiological pH can be
used as the negatively charged phospholipid. Non-limiting examples include negatively charged
forms, e.g., salts, of phosphatidylinositol, a phosphatidylserine, a phosphatidylglycerol and a
phosphatidic acid. In a specific embodiment, the negatively charged phospholipid is 1,2
dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3 -[phospho-rac-(l-glycerol)], or DPPG, a phosphatidylglycerol.
Preferred salts include postassium and sodium salts.
[0074] The phospholipids used to manufacture the complexes of the disclosure are preferably at
least 95% pure and are more preferably at least 99% pure, and/or have levels of oxidation levels
under 4 meq 0/kg, more preferably under 3 meq 0/kg (e.g., under 2 meq 0/kg). The major

initial reaction product of oxygen and fatty acids is hydroperoxide. Using an iodometric method,
it is possible to measure oxidation levels by assaying the presence of peroxide in a sample.
[0075] The lipoprotein complexes of the present disclosure preferably have ratios of
apolipoprotein to lipid that result in more complete and homogeneous complex formation, as
shown in the examples below. The lipoprotein complexes are characterized by an apolipoprotein
fraction: lipid fraction molar ratio ranging from 1:80 to 1:120, from 1:100 to 1:115, or from
1:105 to 1:110, where the apolipoprotein is expressed in ApoA-I equivalents. In specific
embodiments, the molar ratio of the apolipoprotein fraction: lipid fraction is 1:80 to 1:90 (e.g.,
1:82, 1:85 or 1:87), from 1:90 to 1:100 (e.g., 1:95 or 1:98), from 1:100 to 1:110 (e.g., 1:105 or
1:108).
[0076] In specific embodiments, particularly those in which egg SM is used as the neutral lipid,
the weight ratio of the apolipoprotein fraction: lipid fraction ranges from about 1:2.7 to about 1:3
(e.g., 1:2.7).
[0077] The lipoprotein complexes of the present disclosure can also be used as carriers to deliver
hydrophobic, lipophilic or apolar active agents. For such applications, the lipid fraction can
further include, or the lipoprotein complex can be loaded with, one or more hydrophobic,
lipophilic or apolar active agents, including but not limited to fatty acids, drugs, nucleic acids,
vitamins, and/or nutrients. Specific examples of active agents are described in Section 6.2.
[0078] The present disclosure also provides populations of the lipoprotein complexes.
Typically:
          -      the populations contain a plurality of lipoprotein complexes, each comprising a
                 protein fraction and a lipid fraction;
         -       the protein fractions contain a lipoprotein or lipoprotein analog as described
                 above, and in Section 6.1 or in Section 6.5.3; most preferably a protein fraction
                 comprises or consists essentially of lipoprotein (e.g., ApoA-I protein) that is
                 obtained or obtainable by the methods described in Section 6.1.2 and/or purified
                 by the methods described in Section 6.1.4;
         -       the lipid fractions contain a lipid as described above, and in Section 6.2 or in
                 Section 6.5.2;

        -       the lipoprotein complexes are preferably produced by the thermal cycling
                methods described in Section 6.5.4.
[0079] Applicants have discovered several features that are thought to contribute individually or
in combination to the potency and the safety profile of lipoprotein complex populations. These
features include:
        -       the homogeneity in the size of the complexes in a population, mostly ranging
                between 4 nm and 15 nm (e.g., between 5 nm and 12 nm, between 6 nm and 15
                nm, or between 8 nm and 10 nm);
        -       the purity of the apolipoprotein used to make the complex (e.g., lack of oxidized,
                deamidated, truncated, and/or immature forms of apolipoprotein and/or lack of
                endotoxin, and/or lack of proteins other than apolipoprotein(s) (such as host cell
                proteins), and/or host cell DNA that are often present in recombinant production);
        -       the purity of the complexes themselves in the population (characterized by the
                lack of contaminants, such as solvents or detergents use to prepare the complexes;
                the lack of oxidized lipids; the lack of deamidated, oxidized or truncated proteins;
                and/or reduced amounts or lack of uncomplexed apolipoprotein and/or lipids).
[0080] Of these features, the homogeneity of the complexes and the prevalence of mature,
unmodified apolipoprotein in complexes, is thought to increase potency. Purity of
apolipoproteins, lipids, and the complexes reduces the risk of side effects such as liver damage
reflected by increases in liver enzymes (e.g., transaminases). Additionally, the inventors have
made it feasible to make populations of lipoprotein complexes by methods that result in the
incorporation of most of the apolipoprotein into complexes, and the reduction in the amount of
uncomplexed apolipoprotein is also beneficial in that it reduces the risk of an immunogenic
response in a subject that could be caused by the administration of a heterologous protein.
[0081] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides populations of lipoprotein complexes that
are characterized by one or more, or even all, of the following features:
        (a)     at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or at least 95% by weight of

complexes having 3 or 4 ApoA-I molecules or ApoA-I equivalents per lipoprotein complex and
optionally a third population comprising lipoprotein complexes having 4 or 3 ApoA-I molecules
or ApoA-I equivalents per lipoproprotein complex, respectively.
[0085] The compositions comprising two or more populations of lipoprotein complexes
preferably have low levels of uncomplexed lipoprotein and/or lipid. Accordingly, preferably no
more than 15%, no more than 12%, than 10%, no more than 9%, no more than 8%, no more than
7%, no more than 6%, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no more than 2%,
or no more than 1% of the lipid in the composition is in uncomplexed form and/or no more than
15%, no more than 12%, no more than 10%, no more than 9%, no more than 8%, no more than
7%, no more than 6%, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no more than 2%,
or no more than 1% of the lipoprotein in the composition is in uncomplexed form.
[0086] The disclosure provides methods for making lipoprotein complexes. The methods are
based, inter alia, on the discovery that subjecting a suspension containing uncomplexed lipids
and lipid-binding proteins or peptides to thermal cycling conditions results in the formation of
lipoprotein complexes with advantageous results relative to other methods, such those in which
lipoprotein complexes are produced by incubating the components at a fixed temperature.
[0087] The present disclosure provides thermal-cycling methods for preparing lipoprotein
complexes, such as those described in Sections 6.5.1 to 6.5.4. The methods typically comprise
subjecting a suspension comprising lipid particles (a "lipid component") and lipid-binding
proteins or peptides (a "protein component") to a plurality of thermal cycles until most of the
protein component is incorporated into lipoprotein complexes. The methods generally entail
cycling the suspension between a temperature in a first, higher, temperature range and a
temperature in a second, lower, temperature range until lipoprotein complexes are formed. The
high and low temperature ranges of the thermocycling process are based on the phase transition
temperatures of the lipid and protein components of the lipoprotein complexes. Alternatively,
where the lipid component does not exhibit a defined or discrete phase transition, as could occur
when using phospholipids having unsaturated fatty acid chains or a mixture of phospholipids, the
                                                 -26-

      WO 2012/109162                                                               PCT/US2012/024020
high and low temperature ranges of the thermocycling differ by at least about 20 0 C, up to about
40 0 C or even more. For example, in some embodiments, the low and high temperature ranges
differ by 20'C-30'C, 20'C-40'C, 20'C-50'C, 30'C-40'C, 30'C-50'C, 250 C-450 C, 350 C-55 0 C.
[0088] For a lipid, the phase transition involves a change from a closely packed, ordered
structure, known as the gel state, to a loosely packed, less-ordered structure, known as the fluid
state. Lipoprotein complexes are typically formed in the art by incubating lipid particles and
apolipoproteins at temperatures near the transition temperature of the particular lipid or mixture
of lipids used. The phase transition temperature of the lipid component (which can be
determined by calorimetry) +/-12'C, more preferably +/- 10 C, represents the "low" temperature
range in the methods of the disclosure. In certain embodiments, the low temperature range is +/
3C, +/-5'C, or +/-8'C of the phase transition temperature of the lipid component. In one
specific embodiment, the low temperature range is from no less than 5'C or no less than 10 C
below to 5'C above the phase transition temperature of the lipid component.
[0089] For a protein, the phase transition temperature involves a change from the tertiary
structure into the secondary structure. The phase transition temperature of the protein
component +/-12'C, more preferably +/- 10 C, represents the "high" temperature range in the
methods of the disclosure. In specific embodiments, the high temperature range is +/-3'C, +/
5'C, or +/-8'C of the phase transition temperature of the protein component. In one specific
embodiment, the low temperature range is from 10 C below to no more than 5'C, no more than
1 00 C, or no more than 15 C above the phase transition temperature of the protein component.
[0090] The lipid component of the starting suspension, i.e., a suspension that has not yet been
subjected to thermal cycling, preferably comprises particles of lipids, e.g., is predominantly
composed of lipids that are not complexed to lipid-binding proteins. The make-up of the lipid
component is generally as described in Section 6.5.2 below.
[0091] The protein component of the starting suspension preferably contains lipid-binding
peptides and/or proteins that are uncomplexed to lipids, or are combined with lipids in
protein/peptide to lipid ratio that is at least 5-fold greater (e.g., at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold or
at least 20-fold greater) than the protein/peptide to lipid ratio in the desired complex. The make
up of the protein component is generally as described in Section 6.1 and in Section 6.5.3 below.
                                                    -27-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
The protein component is preferably made according to the methods described in Section 6.1.2
and/or purified according to the methods described in Section 6.1.3 or 6.1.4.
[0092] In the methods of the disclosure, a suspension containing the protein component and lipid
component is typically thermally cycled between the high temperature range and the low
temperature range, preferably starting at a temperature in the high temperature range, until
lipoprotein complexes are formed. Using suitable quantities of lipid and protein components
(e.g., as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006-0217312 Al, the contents of which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties), substantially complete complexation of the
lipid and protein components can be reached after several cycles. Further details of the protein
and lipid stoichiometry suitable for thermal cycling methods are described in Section 6.5.4.
[0093] The complexes produced by the methods are typically supramolecular assemblies shaped
as micelles, vesicles, spherical or discoidal particles in which the protein component is
physically bound to the lipid component at a specific stoichiometric range and with a
homogenous size distribution. The present methods advantageously result in substantially
complete complexation of the lipids and/or proteins in the starting suspension, resulting in a
composition that is substantially without free lipids and/or free protein, as observed by separation
methods such as chromatography. Thus, the methods of the disclosure can be performed in the
absence of a purification step.
[0094] The lipid component in the starting suspension is typically in particle form. It is
preferred that the particles are predominantly at least 45 nm, at least 50 nm, at least 55 nm or at
least 60 nm in size ranging up to 65 nm, up to 70 nm, up to 75 nm, up to 80 nm in size, up to 100
nm, up to 120 nm, up to 150 nm, up to 200 nm, up to 250 nm, up to 300 nm, up to 500 nm, for
example, in the 45 nm to 100 nm or 45 to 250 nm size range, more preferably in the 50 nm to 90
nm size range, and most preferably in the 55 nm to 75 nm size range. In a preferred embodiment,
the lipid particles are predominantly composed of egg-sphingomyelin and are 55 to 75 nm in
size. In another preferred embodiment, the lipid particles are predominantly composed of one or
more synthetic sphingomyelin (e.g., palmitoylsphingomyelin or phytosphingomyelin) and are
175 nm to 250 nm in size. In yet another preferred embodiment, the lipid particles are
predominantly composed of one or more synthetic lipids (e.g., palmitoyl sphingomyelin or
phytosphingomyelin) and are 250 nm to 1000 nm in size. In yet another preferred embodiment,

      WO 2012/109162                                                            PCT/US2012/024020
the lipid particles are predominantly composed of one or more synthetic lipids (e.g., palmitoyl
sphingomyelin or phytosphingomyelin) and are 1000 nm to 4000 nm in size. The sizes referred
to herein are zeta (Z) average sizes as determined by dynamic light scattering. High pressure
homogenization, for example microfluidization, advantageously produces lipid particles of
suitable sizes. Other methods for forming particles are disclosed in Section 6.5.2 below, and can
be used as an alternative to homogenization. If such methods produce particles outside the
preferred size ranges, the particles can be subject to size filtration to obtain particles of a suitable
size.
[0095] The methods of preparing lipoprotein complexes described herein advantageously
produce complexes that are homogeneous in their size distribution, circumventing the need for
size fractionation. Moreover, the methods of the disclosure result in substantially complete
incorporation (e.g., at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99%) of the
starting protein into lipoprotein particles. Accordingly, the disclosure provides a composition
comprising lipoprotein complexes and in which at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least
98% or at least 99% of the lipid-binding protein in the composition is complexed to lipid, for
example as determined using gel permeation chromatography. In specific embodiments, the
disclosure provides a composition comprising lipoprotein complexes which have 4 nm to 20 nm
zeta average size, e.g., a 4 nm to 20 nm zeta average size, a 4 nm to 15 nm zeta average size, a 4
nm to 12 nm zeta average size, a 5 nm to 15 nm zeta average size, a 5 nm to 12 nm zeta average
size, a 5 nm to 10 nm zeta average size, a 5 nm to 20 nm zeta average size, a 6 nm to 15 nm zeta
average size, or an 8 nm to 12 nm zeta average size, and in which at least 95%, at least 96%, at
least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% of the lipid-binding protein in the composition is
complexed to lipid, for example as determined using gel permeation chromatography.
Subjecting lipid particles to thermal cycling with a lipoprotein according to the methods
described herein typically results in a population of lipoprotein particles of 4 nm to 15 nm in
size, for example a population of lipoprotein particles of 6 nm to 15 nm in size, 5 nm to 12 nm in
size, or 8 nm to 12 nm in size. The size of the lipid particles subjected to thermal cycling can
range from 50 nm to 250 nm. In a preferred embodiment, the lipid particles are predominantly
composed of egg-sphingomyelin and are 55 to 75 nm in size. In another preferred embodiment,
the lipid particles are predominantly composed of one or more synthetic sphingomyelin (e.g.,
phytosphingomyelin) and are 175 nm to 250 nm in size.

[0096] One or more steps in the methods of preparing lipoprotein complexes can be carried out
under an inert gas. Doing so can reduce or prevent oxidation of apolipoproteins and/or lipids,
thereby reducing risk of side effects, such as liver damage. Suitable inert gases include nitrogen,
helium, and argon.
[0097] The lipoprotein complexes obtained or obtainable by the methods described above are
particularly suited to therapeutic uses because no further purification step is needed after the
complexes are formed.
[0098] The present disclosure also provides populations of lipoprotein complexes, and
pharmaceutical compositions comprising lipoprotein complexes or populations thereof, as
described herein, and may optionally include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,
excipients and/or diluents. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are
packaged in unit dosage amounts suitable for administration. For example, in some
embodiments, the compositions comprise unit dosage amounts of dried (for example lyophilized)
lipoprotein complexes packaged in sealed vials. Such compositions are suitable for
reconstitution with water, physiological solution (such as saline) or buffer, and administration via
injection. Such compositions may optionally include one or more anti-caking and/or anti
agglomerating agents to facilitate reconstitution of the charged complexes, or one or more
buffering agents, isotonicity agents (e.g., sucrose and/or mannitol), sugars or salts (e.g., sodium
chloride) designed to adjust the pH, osmolality and/or salinity of the reconstituted suspension.
The populations of lipoprotein complexes and/or pharmaceutical compositions described above
can be manufactured under conditions that minimize oxidation, thereby reducing the risk of side
effects, such as liver damage, caused by oxidized products. For example, pharmaceutical
compositions can be manufactured under an inert gas, such as nitrogen, helium, or argon.
[0099] For commercial applications, it is useful to make large-scale preparations of the
lipoprotein complexes and pharmaceutical compositions. Accordingly, the present disclosure
also provides a preparation of at least IL, 2L, 5L or 1OL and up to 15L, 20L, 30L, 50L, or more
(e.g., a preparation of 5L to 30L, 1OL to 15L, or 30L to 50L) comprising lipoprotein complexes
in an amount sufficient to achieve a concentration of lipid-binding protein of at least about 3
mg/mL, at least about 4 mg/mL, or at least about 5 mg/mL, and up to about 10 mg/mL, about 15
mg/mL, or about 20 mg/mL, preferably ranging from about 8 mg/mL to about 12 mg/mL, most
                                                 -30-

preferably about 8 mg/mL. In a specific embodiment, the preparation has a volume of 15L to
25L and contains about 100 g to about 250 g of ApoA-I. In another specific embodiment, the
preparation has a volume of 30L to 50L and contains about 240 g to about 780 g of ApoA-I.
[0100] The lipoprotein complexes described herein are useful to treat dyslipidemic disorders in
animals, most preferably in humans. Such conditions include, but are not limited to
hyperlipidemia, and especially hypercholesterolemia (including heterozygous and homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia), and cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis (including
treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis) and the myriad clinical manifestations of
atherosclerosis, such as, for example, stroke, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack,
myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, angina pectoris, intermittent claudication,
critical limb ischemia, valve stenosis, and atrial valve sclerosis; restenosis (e.g., preventing or
treating atherosclerotic plaques which develop as a consequence of medical procedures such as
balloon angioplasty); and other disorders, such as endotoxemia, which often results in septic
shock.
[0101] Lipoprotein complexes and compositions as described herein have been found to effect
and/or facilitate cholesterol efflux when administered at doses lower than those used for other
lipoprotein complexes in studies to date. See, e.g., Spieker et al., 2002, Circulation 105:1399
1402 (using a dose of 80 mg/kg); Nissen et al., 2003, JAMA 290:2292-2300 (using doses of 15
mg/ kg or 40 mg/kg); Tardif et al., 2007 JAMA 297:1675-1682 (using doses of 40 mg/kg to 80
mg/kg), using doses that range from 15 mg/kg to 80 mg/kg. Additionally, the lipoprotein
complexes as described herein have been found to have reduced side effects. As shown in the
examples below, it has been discovered that lipoprotein complexes of the disclosure effectively
mobilize cholesterol at doses as low as 2 mg/kg, and, in contrast lipoprotein complexes
previously administered to human patients, do not significantly raise the levels of triglycerides,
VLDL, and liver enzymes such as transaminases (cf, Nanjee et al., 1999, Arterioscler. Vasc.
Throm. Biol. 19:979-89). Moreoever, the reduced side effects are observed even as doses are
increased up to about 15 mg/kg (lack of triglyceride elevation) or even as high as 45 mg/kg (lack
of transaminase increase) in normal subjects with normal liver and/or kidney function. Thus, the
ability of the complexes of the present disclosure to be administered without side effects is
preferably assessed in an indivual with normal liver function, normal kidney function, or both.
                                                 -31-

      WO 2012/109162                                                            PCT/US2012/024020
[0102] Without being bound by theory, the inventors attribute the benefits of the lipoprotein
complexes of the disclosure to a more homogeneous size distribution of complexes and reduced
amounts of damaged protein and/or lipid (e.g., oxidized protein, deamidated protein, and
oxidized lipid) as compared to prior treatments. It is further believed that the negatively charged
phospholipids comprising the lipid fraction will impart the complexes and compositions
described herein with improved therapeutic properties over conventional lipoprotein complexes.
One of the key differences between small discoidal pre-beta HDL particles, which are degraded
in the kidney, and large discoidal and/or spherical HDL, which are recognized by the liver where
their cholesterol is either stored, recycled, metabolized (as bile acids) or eliminated (in the bile),
is the charge of the particles. The small, discoidal pre-beta HDL particles have a lower negative
surface charge than large, discoidal and/or spherical HDL particles that are negatively charged.
It is believed that the higher negative charge is one of the factors that trigger the recognition of
the particles by the liver, and that therefore avoids catabolism of the particles by the kidney.
Furthermore, it has been shown that the kidney does not absorb readily absorb charged particles
(see Hacker et al., 2009, Pharmacology: Principles and Practice, 183). Thus, owing in part to the
presence of the charged phospholipids(s), it is believed that negatively charged lipoprotein
complexes and compositions described herein will stay in the circulation longer than
conventional lipoprotein complexes, or that the charge will affect the half-life of the lipoprotein
in a charge-dependent manner. It is expected that their longer circulation (residence) time,
combined with a reduction in the rate and/or extent to which the complexes aggregate and fuse
with existing HDL as a result of the negative charge, will facilitate cholesterol mobilization (by
giving the complexes more time to accumulate cholesterol) and esterification (by providing more
time for the LCAT to catalyze the esterification reaction). The charge may also increase the rate
of cholesterol capture and/or removal, thereby facilitating removal of cholesterol in larger
quantities. As a consequence, it is expected that the negatively charged lipoprotein complexes
and compositions described herein will provide therapeutic benefit over conventional lipoprotein
therapies, as less complex and/or composition will need to be administered, and less often, with
reduced side effects.
[0103] Accordingly, the methods provided herein generally involve administering to a subject a
therapeutically effective amount of a lipoprotein complex, a population of lipoprotein
complexes, or pharmaceutical composition described herein to treat or prevent a dyslipidemic
                                                  -32-

      WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020
disorder. The lipoprotein complex can be administered at a dose ranging from about 0.25 mg/kg
ApoA-I equivalents to about 45 mg/kg, e.g., a dose of about 0.5 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg or
about 1 mg/kg ApoA-I equivalents up to about 15 mg/kg ApoA-I equivalents per injection. The
dose can further be tailored to the individual being treated by selecting a dose that minimizes the
increase in the level of triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol and/or VLDL-triglyceride. In specific
embodiments, the dose is about 3 mg/kg, about 6 mg/kg, or about 12 mg/kg.
[0104] The methods further comprise administering the lipoprotein complex at an interval
ranging from 5 to 14 days, or from 6 to 12 days, such as an interval of one or two weeks. The
methods can further comprise administering the lipoprotein complex 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
or up to 52 times at any of the intervals described above, and preferably at an interval of one
week. For example, in one embodiment, the lipoprotein complex is administered six times, with
an interval of 1 week between each administration. For chronic conditions, more than 52
administrations can be carried out. Optionally, the methods can be preceeded by an initial
induction phase where the lipoprotein complex is administered more frequently.
[0105] Complexes and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, can be administered
parenterally, e.g., intravenously. Intravenous administration can be done as an infusion over a
period of time ranging from about 1 to about 24 hours, or about 1 to 4 hours, about 0.5 to 2
hours, or about 1 hour.
[0106] The examples below show small increases in triglyceride levels following administration
of doses 30 mg/kg and 45 mg/kg, which is explained by the increase in VLDL and LDL resulting
from the high degree of cholesterol mobilization. Those parameters can be controlled during the
treatment, as they are routinely measured in hospital laboratories with standard lipid panels.
Based on examples below, the dose selection can be achieved to minimize the increase in the
level of triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol and VLDL-triglyceride dependent on the patient
reaction to the medicine, which allows a personalized-type medicine.
[0107] The complexes and/or compositions can be administered alone (as monotherapy) or,
alternatively, they can be adjunctively administered with other therapeutic agents useful for
treating and/or preventing dyslipidemia and/or its associated conditions, diseases and/or
disorders. Non-limiting examples of therapeutic agents with which the negatively charged
lipoprotein complexes and compositions described herein can be adjunctively administered

6.      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0135] The present disclosure provides lipoprotein complexes, populations thereof, along with
methods of making the lipoprotein complexes. The complexes, and populations and
compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) thereof, are useful for, among other things, the
treatment and/or prophylaxis of dyslipidemia and/or diseases, disorders and/or conditions
associated with dyslipidemia. As discussed in the Summary section, the lipoprotein complexes
comprise two major fractions, an apolipoprotein fraction and a phospholipid fraction, preferably
in defined weight or molar ratios, and preferably including a specified amount of a neutral
phospholipid and, optionally, one or more negatively charged phospholipids.
        6.1.    The Protein Fraction
[0136] The present disclosure provides lipoprotein complexes which comprise a protein fraction.
The present disclosure further provides methods of making lipoprotein complexes. The protein
component of the lipoprotein complexes is not critical for success in the present methods.
Virtually any lipid-binding protein, such as an apolipoprotein and/or derivative or analog thereof
that provides therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit can be included in the complexes.
Moreover, any alpha-helical peptide or peptide analog, or any other type of molecule that
"mimics" the activity of an apolipoprotein (such as, for example ApoA-I) in that it can activate
LCAT or form discoidal particles when associated with lipids, can be included in the lipoprotein
complexes, and is encompassed by the term "lipid-binding protein."
                                                -37-

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
                 6.1.1.  Lipid Binding Proteins
[0137] The present disclosure further provides methods of purifying recombinantly produced
protein, e.g., for use in making lipoprotein complexes. The recombinantly produced protein is
most suitably an apolipoprotein. Suitable proteins include apolipoproteins ApoA-I, ApoA-II,
ApoA-IV, ApoA-V and ApoE; preferably in mature form. Lipid-binding proteins also active
polymorphic forms, isoforms, variants and mutants as well as truncated forms of the foregoing
apolipoproteins, the most common of which are Apolipoprotein A-Imilano (ApoA-Im),
Apolipoprotein A-Iparis (ApoA-Ip), and Apolipoprotein A-Izaragoza (ApoA-Iz). Apolipoproteins
mutants containing cysteine residues are also known, and can also be used (see, e.g., U.S.
Publication No. 2003/0181372). The apolipoproteins may be in the form of monomers or
dimers, which may be homodimers or heterodimers. For example, homo- and heterodimers
(where feasible) of ApoA-I (Duverger et al., 1996, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol.
16(12):1424-29), ApoA-Im (Franceschini et al., 1985, J. Biol. Chem. 260:1632-35), ApoA-Ip
(Daum et al., 1999, J. Mol. Med. 77:614-22), ApoA-II (Shelness et al., 1985, J. Biol. Chem.
260(14):8637-46; Shelness et al., 1984, J. Biol. Chem. 259(15):9929-35), ApoA-IV (Duverger et
al., 1991, Euro. J. Biochem. 201(2):373-83), ApoE (McLean et al., 1983, J. Biol. Chem.
258(14):8993-9000), ApoJ and ApoH may be used. The apolipoproteins may include residues
corresponding to elements that facilitate their isolation, such as His tags, or other elements
designed for other purposes, so long as the apolipoprotein retains some biological activity when
included in a complex.
[0138] Such apolipoproteins can be purified from animal sources (and in particular from human
sources) or produced recombinantly as is well-known in the art, see, e.g., Chung et al., 1980, J.
Lipid Res. 21(3):284-91; Cheung et al., 1987, J. Lipid Res. 28(8):913-29. See also U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,059,528, 5,128,318, 6,617,134; U.S. Publication Nos. 20002/0156007, 2004/0067873,
2004/0077541, and 2004/0266660; and PCT Publications Nos. WO/2008/104890 and
WO/2007/023476. Other methods of purification are also possible, for example as described in
Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 below.
[0139] Non-limiting examples of peptides and peptide analogs that correspond to
apolipoproteins, as well as agonists that mimic the activity of ApoA-I, ApoA-Im, ApoA-II,
ApoA-IV, and ApoE, that are suitable for use as apolipoproteins in the complexes and
compositions described herein are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925, 6,037,323 and
                                                 -38-

      WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020

Nos. 2004/0266671, 2004/0254120, 2003/0171277 and 2003/0045460 (to Fogelman), U.S.
Publication No. 2003/0087819 (to Bielicki) and PCT Publication No. WO/2010/093918 (to
Dasseux et al.), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
These peptides and peptide analogues can be composed of L-amino acid or D-amino acids or
mixture of L- and D-amino acids. They may also include one or more non-peptide or amide
linkages, such as one or more well-known peptide/amide isosteres. Such "peptide and/or peptide
mimetic" apolipoproteins can be synthesized or manufactured using any technique for peptide
synthesis known in the art, including, e.g., the techniques described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925,
6,037,323 and 6,046,166.
[0140] The complexes can include a single type of lipid-binding protein, or mixtures of two or
more different lipid-binding proteins, which may be derived from the same or different species.
Although not required, the lipoprotein complexes will preferably comprise lipid-binding proteins
that are derived from, or correspond in amino acid sequence to, the animal species being treated,
in order to avoid inducing an immune response to the therapy. Thus, for treatment of human
patients, lipid-binding proteins of human origin are preferably used in the complexes of the
disclosure. The use of peptide mimetic apolipoproteins may also reduce or avoid an immune
response.
[0141] In certain preferred embodiments, the lipid-binding protein is a protein having an amino
acid sequence with at least 95% sequence identity to a mature human ApoA-I protein, e.g., a
protein having an amino acid sequence corresponding to positions 25 to 267 of SEQ ID NO: 1.
In certain embodiments, the mature human ApoA-I protein has an amino acid sequence with at
least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% sequence identity to positions 25 to 267 of
SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, the mature human ApoA-I protein has an amino acid
sequence having an aspartic acid at position 1 (i.e. the position corresponding to position 25 of
SEQ ID NO: 1). In a specific embodiment, the mature human ApoA-I protein has an amino acid
sequence corresponding to positions 25 to 267 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In a preferred embodiment, the
ApoA-I protein is recombinantly produced in mammalian host cells, most preferably Chinese
Hamster Ovary ("CHO") cells, as described in the following subsection.
                                                 -39-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
                 6.1.2. Recombinant Expression of Apolipoproteins
[0142] The present disclosure provides recombinant expression methods for producing lipid
binding proteins such as ApoA-I, and related nucleic acids, mammalian host cells, cell cultures.
The resulting recombinant lipid binding protein can be purified and/or incorporated into
lipoprotein complexes as described herein.
[0143] Generally, for recombinant production, a polynucleotide sequence encoding a lipid
binding protein or peptide is inserted into an appropriate expression vehicle, i.e., a vector that
contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding
sequence, or in the case of an RNA viral vector, the necessary elements for replication and
translation. The expression vector can be derived from viruses such as adenovirus, adeno
associated virus, herpesvirus, retrovirus or lentivirus. The expression vehicle is then transfected
into a suitable target cell which will express the protein or peptide. Suitable host cells include,
but are not limited to, bacterial species, mammalian or insect host cell systems including
baculovirus systems (see, e.g., Luckow et al., Bio/Technology, 6, 47 (1988)), and established cell
lines such 293, COS-7, C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa, BHK, etc. Depending on the expression system
used, the expressed peptide is then isolated by procedures well-established in the art. Methods
for recombinant protein and peptide production are well known in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et
al., 1989, Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y.; and
Ausubel et al., 1989, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and
Wiley Interscience, N.Y. each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.)
[0144] Where ApoA-I is the lipid binding protein, ApoA-I protein is expressed from a
recombinant nucleotide sequence encoding ApoA-I. In some embodiments, the nucleotide
sequence encoding ApoA-I is human. Non-limiting examples of human ApoA-I nucleotide
sequences are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,876,968; 5,643,757; and 5,990,081, and WO
96/37608; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In
certain embodiments, the nucleotide sequence encodes the amino acid sequence of a mature
ApoA-I protein, preferably operably linked to a signal sequence (e.g., amino acids 1-18 of SEQ
ID NO: 1) for secretion of the ApoA-I from the host cell and/or a proprotein sequence (e.g.,
amino acids 19-25 of SEQ ID NO: 1). Other signal sequences suitable for directed secretion of
ApoA-I can be either heterologous to ApoA-I, e.g., a human albumin signal peptide or a human
IL-2 signal peptide, or homologous to ApoA-I.
                                                 -40-

      WO 2012/109162                                                        PCT/US2012/024020
[0145] Preferably, the nucleotide sequence encodes a mature human ApoA-I polypeptide, for
example a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that is at least 95%, at least 96%, at least
97%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence corresponding to
positions 25 to 267 of SEQ ID NO:1, optionally wherein the amino acid sequence comprises an
aspartic acid at position 25. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleotide sequence encodes a
polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. The nucleotide sequence can also
encode a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that is at least 95%, at least 96%, at least
97%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of human ApoA-I protein
set forth in one of GenBank Accession Nos. NP_000030, AAB59514, P02647, CAA30377,
AAA51746 or AAH05380.1, optionally comprising an aspartic acid at the position
corresponding to the first amino acid of the mature human ApoA-I protein.
[0146] The ApoA-I encoding polynucleotides can be codon optimized for expression in
recombinant host cells. Preferred host cells are mammalian host cells, including, but not limited,
Chinese hamster ovary cells (e.g. CHO-KI; ATCC No. CCL 61; CHO-S (GIBCO Life
Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD, Catalog #11619012)), VERO cells, BHK (ATCC No. CRL
1632), BHK 570 (ATCC No. CRL 10314), HeLa cells, COS-1 (ATCC No. CRL 1650), COS-7
(ATCC No. CRL 1651), MDCK cells, 293 cells (ATCC No. CRL 1573; Graham et al., J. Gen.
Virol. 36:59-72, 1977), 3T3 cells, myeloma cells (especially murine), PC12 cells and W138
cells. In certain embodiments, the mammalian cells, such as CHO-S cells (InvitrogenTM,
Carlsbad CA), are adapted for growth in serum-free medium. Additional suitable cell lines are
known in the art and available from public depositories such as the American Type Culture
Collection, Manassas, Va.
[0147] For recombinant expression of ApoA-I, the polynucleotides encoding ApoA-I are
operably linked to one or more control sequences, e.g., a promoter or terminator, that regulate the
expression of ApoA-I in the host cell of interest. The control sequence(s) can be native or
foreign to the ApoA-I-encoding sequence, and also native or foreign to the host cell in which the
ApoA-I is expressed. Control sequences include, but are not limited to, promoters, ribosome
binding sites, leaders, polyadenylation sequences, propeptide sequences, signal peptide
sequences, and transcription terminators. In some embodiments, the control sequences include a
promoter, ribosome binding site, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control
sequences can also include one or more linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction
                                                -41-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the nucleotide
sequence encoding ApoA-I.
[0148] The promoters driving the recombinant expression of ApoA-I can be constitutive
promoters, regulated promoters, or inducible promoters. Appropriate promoter sequences can be
obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides which are either
endogenous or heterologous to the host cell. Methods for the isolation, identification and
manipulation of promoters of varying strengths are available in or readily adapted from the art.
See e.g., Nevoigt et al. (2006) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 72:5266-5273, the disclosure of which
is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0149] One or more of the control sequences can be derived from viral sources. For example, in
certain aspects, promoters are derived from polyoma or adenovirus major late promoter. In other
aspects, the promoter is derived from Simian Virus 40 (SV40), which can be obtained as a
fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication (Fiers et al., 1978, Nature,
273:113-120), or from cytomegalovirus, e.g., simian cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter.
(See U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,288). Other suitable promoters include those from metallothionein
genes (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,579,821 and 4,601,978).
[0150] Also provided herein are recombinant ApoA-I expression vectors. A recombinant
expression vector can be any vector, e.g., a plasmid or a virus, that can be manipulated by
recombinant DNA techniques to facilitate expression of a heterologous ApoA-I in a recombinant
host cell. The expression vector can be integrated into the chromosome of the recombinant host
cell and comprises one or more heterologous genes operably linked to one or more control
sequences useful for production of ApoA-I. In other embodiments, the expression vector is an
extrachromosomal replicative DNA molecule, e.g., a linear or closed circular plasmid, that is
found either in low copy number (e.g., from about 1 to about 10 copies per genome equivalent)
or in high copy number (e.g., more than about 10 copies per genome equivalent). In various
embodiments, the expression vector includes a selectable marker, such as a gene that confers
antibiotic resistance (e.g., ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance) to
the recombinant host organism that comprises the vector.In particular aspects, the DNA
constructs, vectors and polynucleotides are suitable for expression of ApoA-I in mammalian
cells. Vectors for expression of ApoA-I in mammalian cells can include an origin of replication,
                                                  -42-

      WO 2012/109162                                                             PCT/US2012/024020
a promoter and any necessary ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation site, and
transcriptional terminator sequences that are compatible with the host cell systems. In some
aspects, an origin of replication is heterologous to the host cell, e.g., is of viral origin (e.g., SV40,
Polyoma, Adeno, VSV, BPV). In other aspects, an origin of replication is provided by the host
cell chromosomal replication mechanism.
[0151] Methods, reagents and tools for introducing foreign DNA into mammalian host cells are
known in the art and include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate-mediated transfection
(Wigler et al., 1978, Cell 14:725; Corsaro et al., 1981, Somatic Cell Genetics 7:603; Graham et
al., 1973, Virology 52:456), electroporation (Neumann et al., 1982, EMBO J. 1:841-5), DEAE
dextran mediated transfection (Ausubel et al. (eds.), Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3rd
Edition (John Wiley & Sons 1995)), and liposome-mediated transfection (Hawley-Nelson et al.,
1993, Focus 15:73; Ciccarone et al., 1993, Focus 15:80).
[0152] For high-yield production, stable expression of ApoA-I is preferred. For example,
following the introduction of foreign DNA into the host cells, the host cells may be allowed to
grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. Rather than
using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed
with vector comprising a nucleotide sequence comprising the ApoA-I-coding sequence
controlled by appropriate expression control elements and a selectable marker. The selectable
marker in the vector confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the
vector into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded
into cell lines. A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the
herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al., 1977, Cell 11: 223), hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska & Szybalski, 1962, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48: 2026),
and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et al., 1980, Cell 22: 817) genes can be employed
in tk-, hgprt- or aprt- cells, respectively. Also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis
of selection by using, for example, dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et al.,
1980, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77: 3567; O'Hare et al., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78: 1527);
gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan & Berg, 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA 78: 2072; neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Colberre
Garapin et al., 1981, J. Mol. Biol. 150: 1); and/or hyg, which confers resistance to hygromycin

[0153] Stable, high yield expression can also be achieved using retroviral vectors that integrate
into the host cell genome (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publications No. 2008/0286779 and
2004/0235173). Alternatively, stable, high yield expression of ApoA-I can be achieved by gene
activation methods, which entail activating expression of and amplifying an endogenous ApoA-I
gene in genomic DNA of a mammalian cell of choice, for example as described in WO
1994/012650. Increasing the copy number of an ApoA-I gene (containing an ApoA-I coding
sequence and one or more control elements) can facilitate the high yield expression of ApoA-I.
Preferably, the mammalian host cell in which ApoA-I is expressed has an ApoA-I gene copy
index of at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, or at least 5. In specific embodiments, the mammalian
host cell in which ApoA-I is expressed has an ApoA-I gene copy index of at least 6, at least 7, at
least 8, at least 9, or at least 10.
[0154] In certain embodiments, the mammalian cells are adapted to produce ApoA-I in
quantities of at least 0.5 g/L, at least 1 g/L, at least 1.5 g/L, at least 2 g/L, at least 2.5 g/L, at least
3 g/L, at least 3.5 g/L, and optionally up to 4 g/L, up to 4.5 g/L, up to 5 g/L, up to 5.5 g/L, or up
to 6 g/L. The mammalian host cells are preferably capable of producing at least about 0.5, 1, 2,
or 3 g/L ApoA-I in culture and/or up to about 20 g/L ApoA-I in culture, e.g., up to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 12, or 15 g/L ApoA-I in culture.
[0155] In certain embodiments, the mammalian cells are adapted for growth in serum-free
medium. In these embodiments, the ApoA-I is secreted from the cells. In other embodiments,
the ApoA-I is not secreted from the cells.
[0156] The mammalian host cells provided herein can be used to produce ApoA-I. Generally,
the methods comprise culturing a mammalian host cell as described herein under conditions in
which ApoA-I is expressed. Furthermore, the methods can comprise recovering and, optionally,
purifying mature ApoA-I from the supernatant of the mammalian cell culture.
[0157] The culture conditions, including the culture medium, temperature, pH, can be suited to
the mammalian host cell being cultured and the mode of culture chosen (shake flask, bioreactor,
roller bottle, etc...). Mammalian cells can be grown in large scale batch culture, in continuous or
semi-continuous culture.
[0158] Also provided herein is a mammalian cell culture comprising a plurality of a ApoA-I
producing mammalian host cells described herein. In some embodiments, the mammalian cell

                 6.1.3.  Purification of Apolipoproteins
[0159] The present disclosure relates to methods of obtaining highly purified apolipoprotein, that
is useful in making lipoprotein complexes and compositions thereof as described herein. The
methods can be applied to any apolipoprotein, including but not limited to, ApoA-I, -II, -III or
IV; ApoB48 and ApoB 100; ApoC-I, -II, -III or -IV; ApoD; ApoE, ApoH; ApoJ. More
specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods of obtaining highly purified ApoA-I. In
some embodiments, the ApoA-I is a human protein having a sequence selected from, but not
limited to, the sequences set forth in Genbank Accession Nos. NP_000030, AAB59514, P02647,
CAA30377, AAA51746 and AAH05380.1.              In certain embodiments, the ApoA-I is a human
protein as described above in Section 6.1.2. In other embodiments, the methods of the present
disclosure can be used to purify ApoA-I obtained from non-human animals (see, e.g., U.S.
Publication No. 2004/0077541), for example, cows, horses, sheep, monkeys, baboons, goats,
rabbits, dogs, hedgehogs, badgers, mice, rats, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, duck, chicken, salmon
and eel (Brouillette et al., 2001, Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1531:4-46; Yu et al., 1991, Cell Struct.

[0160] Examples of ApoA-I proteins that can be purified by the methods disclosed herein
include, but are not limited to, the preproapolipoprotein form of ApoA-I, pro- and mature forms
of ApoA-I, and active polymorphic forms, isoforms, variants and mutants as well as truncated
forms, e.g., ApoA-Im, ApoA-Iz, and ApoA-Ip. ApoA-Im is the R173C molecular variant of

ApoA-I (see, e.g., Parolini et al., 2003, J Biol Chem. 278(7):4740-6; Calabresi et al., 1999,
Biochemistry 38:16307-14; and Calabresi et al., 1997, Biochemistry 36:12428-33). ApoA-Ip is
the R15IC molecular variant of ApoA-I (see, e.g., Daum et al., 1999, J Mol Med. 77(8):614-22).
ApoA-Iz is an Li 44R molecular variant of ApoA-I (see Recalde et al., 2001, Atherosclerosis
154(3):613-623; Fiddyment et al., 2011, Protein Expr. Purif. 80(1):110-116). Apolipoprotein A
I mutants containing cysteine residues are also known, and can also be purified by the methods
described herein (see, e.g., U.S. Publication No. 2003/0181372). ApoA-I for use in the methods
described herein can be in the form of monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers. For example,
homo- and heterodimers of pro- and mature ApoA-I that can be prepared include, among others,
ApoA-I (Duverger et al., 1996, Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol. 16(12):1424-29), ApoA-Im
(Franceschini et al., 1985, J Biol Chem. 260:1632-35), and ApoA-Ip (Daum et al., 1999, J Mol
Med. 77:614-22).
[0161] The purification methods described herein can be performed on any scale convenient for
the skilled practitioner.
[0162] In some aspects, ApoA-I protein that can be purified by the methods described herein has
an amino acid sequence that is at least 75% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 85%
identical, at least 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, at least 93%
identical, at least 94% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 96% identical, at least 97%
identical, at least 98% identical, at least 99% identical or at least 100% identical to amino acids
25-267 of SEQ ID NO: 1.
[0163] Apolipoprotein can be from any source, including from blood plasma or from
recombinant expression in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. In particular embodiments, the
apolipoprotein is ApoA-I, e.g., human ApoA-I. In some aspects, the ApoA-I is expressed in the
cytoplasm or periplasm of prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells. In these embodiments, the cells
are disrupted to release ApoA-I into the supernatant prior to purifying the ApoA-I. Cell
disruption methods are well-known in the art. Exemplary methods of disrupting cells include,
but are not limited to, enzymatic methods, sonication, detergent methods, and mechanical
methods. In certain preferred aspects, ApoA-I is expressed in mammalian cells, preferably CHO
cells, and is secreted into the growth medium. In these embodiments, ApoA-I is purified from
the clarified cell-free medium. It will be understood that, although the purification methods are
                                                 -46-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
described in detail herein in connection with human ApoA-I, it is within the skill in the art to
adapt the purification conditions to other apolipoproteins, as well as to non-human ApoA-I,
polymorphic forms, isoforms, variants, mutants and truncated forms of ApoA-I or other
apolipoproteins, depending on specific protein characteristics that are readily ascertainable by the
skilled artisan (e.g., molecular weight, isoelectric point, Stokes radius, hydrophobicity,
multimeric state, etc.).
[0164] Where ApoA-I, is prepared from blood plasma, it can be separated from blood plasma by
any known method, including but not limited to, cold fractionation processes such as those
described by Cohn et al., 1946, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 68:459-475 ("Cohn process") or by Oncley et
al., 1949, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 71:541-550 ("Cohn-Oncley process"). Other methods for isolating
apolipoprotein from blood plasma include variations of the Cohn and Cohn-Oncley processes,
such as the Kistler-Nitschmann process. (See Nitschmann et al., 1954, Helv. Chim. Acta 37:866
873; Kistler et al., 1962, Vox Sang. 7:414-424).
[0165] In these embodiments, apolipoprotein is obtained by precipitation from plasma with cold
alcohol, e.g., ethanol. Other alcohols for use in cold fractionation of plasma include C1-C6
straight or branched chain alcohols, such as methanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec
butanol, isobutanol and tert-butanol. In various embodiments, agents other than alcohols that
reduce protein solubility can be used to precipitate apolipoprotein from plasma. Such agents
include, but are not limited to, ethers, ammonium sulfate, 7-ethoxyacridine-3,9-diamine (rivanol)
and polyethylene glycols. Precipitated proteins can be separated from the supernatant by any
method known in the art, including, but not limited to, sedimentation, centrifugation and
filtration.
[0166] ApoA-I can be recovered from any fraction of blood plasma that contains the protein. In
some embodiments, ApoA-I is recovered from a serum fraction of human plasma from which the
amount of fibrinogen has been reduced by precipitation with about 8%(w/w) ethanol. In other
embodiments, apolipoprotein is recovered from a serum fraction of human plasma from which
the concentrations of other serum proteins (e.g.,    -globulins and y-gamma globulins) have been
reduced by precipitation with about 25% (w/w) ethanol. In still other embodiments,
apolipoprotein is recovered as a precipitate from human serum obtained by increasing the
ethanol concentration to about 38% to about 42% (w/w). In a particular embodiment,
                                                 -47-

       WO 2012/109162                                                        PCT/US2012/024020
apolipoprotein is recovered as a precipitate from human serum obtained by increasing the
ethanol concentration to about 40% (w/w) (Cohn's fraction IV). Precipitated ApoA-I can be
recovered from serum fractions by any method known in the art, including but not limited to
centrifugation and filtration.
[0167] In some embodiments, the temperature of plasma fractions from which apolipoprotein is
recovered is sufficiently low to prevent denaturation of the protein. In these embodiments, the
temperature of the ApoA-I fractions ranges from about -100 C to about 00 C, such as from about
8 0C   to about -2 0 C. In various embodiments, the pH of plasma fractions from which ApoA-I is
recovered is in a range that prevents denaturation of the protein. In these embodiments, the pH
of fractions that contain ApoA-I ranges from about 5 to about 7, such as from about 5.5 to about
6.5.
                 6.1.4.  Improved Lipoprotein Purification Processes
[0168] Applicants have further discovered an improved process of purification, described below
and illustrated in the Examples, that produces lipoproteins that are mature, intact, and
substantially free of contaminants. The purification methods described herein can be performed
on any scale convenient for the skilled practitioner.
[0169] The methods can be applied to any apolipoprotein, including but not limited to, ApoA-I,
II, -III or -IV; ApoB48 and ApoB 100; ApoC-I, -II, -III or -IV; ApoD; ApoE, ApoH; ApoJ.
More specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods of obtaining highly purified ApoA-I.
In some embodiments, the ApoA-I is a human protein having a sequence selected from, but not
limited to, the sequences set forth in Genbank Accession Nos. NP_000030, AAB59514, P02647,
CAA30377, AAA51746 and AAH05380.1. In certain embodiments, the ApoA-I is a human
protein as described above in Section 6.1.2. In other embodiments, the methods of the present
disclosure can be used to purify ApoA-I obtained from non-human animals (see, e.g., U.S.

dogs, hedgehogs, badgers, mice, rats, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, duck, chicken, salmon and eel

include, but are not limited to, the preproapolipoprotein form of ApoA-I, pro- and mature forms
of ApoA-I, and active polymorphic forms, isoforms, variants and mutants as well as truncated
forms, e.g., ApoA-Im , ApoA-Iz, and ApoA-Ip. Apolipoprotein A-I mutants containing cysteine
residues are also known, and can also be purified by the methods described herein (see, e.g., U.S.
Publication 2003/0181372). ApoA-I for use in the methods described herein can be in the form
of monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers. For example, homo- and heterodimers of pro- and
mature ApoA-I that can be prepared include, among others, ApoA-I (Duverger et al., 1996,
Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol. 16(12):1424-29), ApoA-Im (Franceschini et al., 1985, J Biol
Chem. 260:1632-35), and ApoA-Ip (Daum et al., 1999, J Mol Med. 77:614-22).
[0171] In some aspects, ApoA-I protein that can be purified by the methods described herein has
an amino acid sequence that is at least 75% identical, at least 80% identical, at least 85%
identical, at least 90% identical, at least 91% identical, at least 92% identical, at least 93%

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
polymorphic forms, isoforms, variants, mutants and truncated forms of ApoA-I or other
apolipoproteins, depending on specific protein characteristics that are readily ascertainable by the
skilled artisan (e.g., molecular weight, isoelectric point, Stokes radius, hydrophobicity,
multimeric state, etc.).
[0173] Generally, the purification methods comprise the steps of: (a) contacting an ApoA-I
containing solution with an anion exchange matrix under conditions such that the ApoA-I does
not bind to the matrix; (b) filtering the ApoA-I containing solution obtained in step (a) through a
membrane having a pore size sufficient to remove viruses or viral particles; (c) passing the
filtrate obtained in step (b) through a first reverse phase chromatography column under
conditions such that the ApoA-I binds to the matrix; (d) eluting from the first reverse phase
chromatography matrix a first ApoA-I containing reverse phase eluate using a gradient of
increasing concentrations of an organic solvent; (e) passing the first ApoA-I reverse phase eluate
from step (d) through a second reverse phase chromatography column under conditions such that
the ApoA-I binds to the matrix; and (f) eluting from the second reverse phase chromatography
matrix a second ApoA-I containing reverse phase eluate using a gradient of increasing
concentrations of an organic solvent. The order in which the steps are performed is not critical.
As will be apparent to the person of skill in the art, a variety of permutations in the order of the
steps are possible, some of which are described below.
[0174] In certain aspects, the ApoA-I containing solution is conditioned before contacting it with
an anion exchange matrix in step (a). Conditioning is performed to adjust the pH of the protein
solution so that it is in a range where ApoA-I does not bind to the anion exchange matrix in step
(a) (i.e, the protein does not have a net negative charge and step (a) is run in negative mode). In
these aspects, the pH of the ApoA-I containing solution is from about 5 to about 7, preferably
from about 5.0 to about 5.6. In particular aspects, the pH is from about 5.1 to about 5.5. In still
other aspects, the pH is about 5.3. Adjustments in pH can be performed by adding an
appropriate acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid) or base (e.g., sodium hydroxide) until a pH within the
desired range is obtained. In some embodiments, the ApoA-I containing solution is filtered
before the conditioning step to remove cells and cell debris. In other embodiments, when a
conditioning step is absent, the ApoA-I containing solution is optionally filtered before step (a)
to remove cells and cell debris.

     WO 2012/109162                                                             PCT/US2012/024020
[0175] In some embodiments, step (a) of contacting an ApoA-I containing solution with an anion
exchange matrix is performed by passing the protein solution through a chromatography column.
In these embodiments, the column is packed at a bed height of from about 10 cm to about 50 cm,
preferably from about 10 cm to about 30 cm, and more preferably at a bed height of about 20 cm.
In certain aspects, the column is loaded with a protein solution comprising from about 10 g to
about 50 g, such as from about 10 g to about 30 g, such as from about 25 g to about 35 g of
ApoA-I per liter. In particular embodiments, the column is loaded with a protein solution
comprising up to about 32 g of ApoA-I per liter. In other embodiments, step (a) is performed in
batch mode, i.e., by adding an anion exchange matrix to a protein solution in a flask, mixing for
a period of time sufficient for binding contaminants to the matrix, and then separating the matrix
material from the protein solution, e.g., by filtration or centrifugation. In certain embodiments,
the protein solution is filtered to remove particulates in the solution prior to contacting it with the
anion exchange matrix.
[0176] Anion exchange matrices for use in step (a) of the methods described herein can be any
anion exchange matrix known in the art. Suitable anion exchange matrices include, but are not
limited to, Q-Sepharose FF, Q-Spherosil, DEAE-Sepharose FF, Q-Cellulose, DEAE-Cellulose
and Q-Spherodex. In a particular embodiment, the anion exchange matrix is Q-Sepharose FF
(GE Healthcare). In certain aspects, before contacting the protein solution in step (a) with an
anion exchange matrix, the matrix is equilibrated in a buffer having a pH within the preferred
ranges discussed above such that the ApoA-I does not bind to the matrix. Buffers useful for
equilibrating anion exchange matrices prior to step (a) and for performing step (a) are known to
the skilled artisan. In particular embodiments, the buffer is TAMP A (20mM sodium phosphate,
pH 5.3).
[0177] In various embodiments, step (a) is used to purify ApoA-I with respect to proteins other
than ApoA-I (e.g., host cell proteins), host cell DNA and endotoxin, which bind to the anion
exchange matrix and are thereby separated from ApoA-I, which does not bind to matrix under
the pH and salt conditions described above. In some aspects, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least
85%, or at least 90% or more of the amount of ApoA-I in the starting solution is recovered from
the anion exchange step.

[0178] In various embodiments, the purification methods comprise a step (b) in which the
ApoA-I solution from step (a) is filtered using a filter with a pore size that is sufficient to trap
viruses and viral particles. Optionally, the step (b) of filtering through a membrane to remove
viruses or viral particles is performed after step (f) above, rather than after step (a). In certain
aspects, the pH of the eluate from the anion exchange matrix is adjusted before viral filtration
step (b) by the addition of sodium hydroxide or other suitable base. The ApoA-I containing
solution from step (a) is adjusted to a pH of from about 7.8 to about 8.2. In a particular aspect,
the ApoA-I containing solution is adjusted to a pH of about 8.0. The filter used in step (b) can be
any filter with an appropriate pore size for trapping viruses, e.g., with a pore size of from about
15 nm to about 75 nm. In particular embodiments, the pore size of the filter is about 20 nm (e.g.,
Planova 20N, Asahi Kasei Medical). The skilled artisan will appreciate that the flow rate of the
protein solution through the viral filter is determined by the properties of the solution (e.g., its
viscosity, the concentration of particulates, etc.). A typical flow rate for viral filtration is about
12.5 L/h/m2, however, the flow rate can be adjusted higher or lower to maintain a filter pressure
of 1 bar or less. The filtrate from step (b) contains ApoA-I. In certain aspects, recovery of
ApoA-I from the viral filtration step is at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95% or at
least 98% or more of the amount of the ApoA-I in the anion exchange eluate from step (a).
[0179] In particular embodiments, the purification methods described herein comprise a step (c)
after step (b) in which the filtrate from step (b) is passed through a first reverse phase
chromatography column under buffer and salt conditions that allow the Apolipoprotein A-I to
bind to the matrix. In these embodiments, the ApoA-I is purified with respect to host cell DNA,
host cell proteins, endotoxin and truncated forms using a gradient of increasing concentrations of
organic solvent. Reverse phase chromatography can be performed using a wide variant of
matrices known in the art, including but not limited to silica, polystyrene, or crosslinked agarose
based media onto which C4 to C18 hydrophobic ligands are grafted. Commercially available
hydrophobic matrices useful in the methods described herein include, but are not limited to Butyl
Sepharose-FF, Octyl Sepharose-FF, Dianon HP20ss, C18 Hypersil and Source 30 RPC. In
particular embodiments, the matrix used in step (c) is Source 30 RPC (GE Healthcare). In
certain aspects, the reverse phase chromatography column has a bed height of from about 10 cm
to about 50 cm, such as from about 10 cm to about 30 cm. In a particular aspect, the reverse
phase chromatography column has a bed height of about 25 cm.

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
[0180] In some embodiments, the ApoA-I filtrate from the viral filtration step (b) is loaded onto
the reverse phase column at a concentration of about 1 to about 20 g ApoA-I, such as at a
concentration of about 1.5 g to about 5 g of ApoA-I, and more preferably at a concentration of
about 2.5 g to about 3.5 g ApoA-I per liter. In a particular aspect, the ApoA-I filtrate from step
(b) is loaded onto the reverse phase column at a concentration of about 3.4 g of ApoA-I per liter.
Buffer conditions that can be used to equilibrate the reverse phase column before loading ApoA
I and to insure that the protein will bind to the column upon loading will be readily ascertainable
to those of skill in the art. Preferably, the column equilibration buffer is a strong buffer that can
reduce the column pH to about 9.5. In certain embodiments, the equilibration buffer is TAMP D
(20 mM ammonium carbonate). Preferably, after equilibration, ApoA-I containing filtrate from
step (b) (at a pH of about 8.0) is loaded onto the column at a flow rate of about 0.5 cm to about
5.0 cm per minute, such as from about 2.0 cm to about 4.0 cm per minute. In a particular
embodiment, the ApoA-I containing filtrate is loaded onto the column at a flow rate of about 2.8
cm per minute.
[0181] After ApoA-I is bound to the reverse phase matrix in step (c), the protein is eluted in step
(d) by exposure to a gradient of increasing concentrations of organic solvent in buffer, such as
from about 35% to about 50% acetonitrile in TAMP D buffer. In some aspects, a linear gradient
of from about 35% to about 50% acetonitrile over a period of about 60 to about 90 minutes, such
as about 70 minutes or more preferably about 80 minutes can be used to elute the ApoA-I from
the column. In certain aspects, the linear gradient is followed by about 10 minutes of isocratic
elution with 50% acetonitrile. The exact conditions for eluting ApoA-I from the reverse phase
column will be readily ascertainable to the skilled artisan. In various embodiments, about 60%,
such as about 65%, about 70%, about 75% or about 80% or more of ApoA-I in the column load
is present in the column eluate in step (d).
[0182] In certain aspects, the purification methods described herein further comprise after step
(d) a step (e) of passing the Apolipoprotein A-I reverse phase eluate from step (d) through a
second reverse phase chromatography column in order to further remove DNA, host cell proteins
and truncated forms of ApoA-I from the full-length protein. Preferably, the reverse phase eluate
from step (d) is loaded on the second reverse phase column under conditions that allow the
Apolipoprotein A-I to bind to the matrix. The reverse phase matrix for use in step (e) can be the
same type of matrix or a different type of matrix as used in step (d). In particular embodiments,

the reverse phase matrix used in step (e) is a C18 silica matrix, such as a Daisogel SP-3 00-BIO
C18 matrix (300 A, 10 pim; Daiso Co., Ltd.). Buffer conditions that can be used to equilibrate
the C18 column before loading ApoA-I and to insure that the protein will bind to the column
upon loading will be readily ascertainable to those of skill in the art. Preferably, the column
equilibration buffer is a strong buffer that can reduce the column pH to about 9.5. In certain
embodiments, the equilibration buffer is TAMP E (100 mM ammonium carbonate). In various
embodiments, the reverse phase column used in step (e) of the purification methods described
herein has a bed height of from about 10 cm to about 50 cm, such as from about 10 cm to about
30 cm. In particular embodiments, the reverse phase column used in step (e) has a bed height of
about 25 cm.
[0183] In various embodiments, the ApoA-I eluate from step (d) is loaded onto the C18 reverse
phase column at a concentration of about 0.5 g to about 30 g ApoA-I, such as at a concentration
of about 1 g to about 10 g of ApoA-I, and more preferably at a concentration of about 4 g to
about 5 g of ApoA-I per liter. In particular embodiments, the ApoA-I eluate from step (d) is
loaded onto the C18 column at a concentration of about 4.7 g of ApoA-I per liter. Preferably,
after equilibration, ApoA-I containing eluate from step (d) is loaded onto the column at a flow
rate of from about 0.5 cm to about 5.0 cm per minute, such as from about 1.0 cm to about 3.0 cm
per minute. In a particular embodiment, the ApoA-I containing filtrate is loaded onto the column
at a flow rate of about 2.1 cm per minute.
[0184] After ApoA-I is bound to the reverse phase matrix in step (e), the protein is eluted in step
(f) using a gradient of increasing concentrations of organic solvent in buffer, such as from about
40% to about 50% acetonitrile in TAMP E buffer. In some aspects, a linear gradient of from
about 40% to about 50% acetonitrile is used to elute the ApoA-I from the column over a period
of about 40 to about 80 minutes, such as about 50 minutes, about 60 minutes or about 70
minutes. In particular embodiments, a linear gradient of from about 40% to about 50%
acetonitrile in TAMP E buffer over a period of about 60 minutes is used to elute the ApoA-I
from the reverse phase matrix. In certain aspects, the linear gradient is followed by about 15
minutes of isocratic elution with 50% acetonitrile. The exact conditions for eluting ApoA-I from
the reverse phase column will be readily ascertainable to the skilled artisan. In various
embodiments, about 60%, such as about 65%, about 70%, about 75% or about 80% or more of
ApoA-I in the column load is recovered in the column eluate in step (f).

     WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020
[0185] In certain embodiments, the organic solvent is removed from the ApoA-I containing
eluate obtained in step (f) of the methods described herein. Solvent removal can be
accomplished by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, concentrating the
ApoA-I containing eluate obtained in step (f) and diafiltering the concentrate into an aqueous
buffer. In certain embodiments, the eluate from step (f) is concentrated by about 2-fold, by about
2.5-fold, by about 3-fold, by about 3.5-fold, by about 4-fold, by about 4.5-fold or by about 5-fold
as compared to the volume of eluate from the reverse phase column in step (f). In a particular
embodiment, the eluate is concentrated by about 2.5-fold and is then diafiltered against
approximately 10, 15, or 20, preferably 15 volumes of a suitable aqueous buffer. Suitable
aqueous buffers are known in the art. A particularly preferred buffer is TAMP C (3 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 8.0).
[0186] In some embodiments the order of chromatography columns is reversed.
[0187] Optionally, after concentration and buffer exchange, the aqueous ApoA-I solution is
further purified by anion exchange chromatography in negative mode (i.e., under conditions
where the ApoA-I does not bind to the anion exchange matrix) to remove residual DNA and
other negatively charged contaminants such as host cell proteins. (Step (g)). In some
embodiments, the anion exchange step is performed in batch mode. In other embodiments, the
anion exchange step is performed by column chromatography. Suitable anion exchange matrices
for use in batch mode or in column chromatography include, but are not limited to,     Q
Sepharose-FF or any of the anion exchange matrices discussed above for use in step (a). In
particular aspects, the anion exchange step is performed by passing the ApoA-I solution through
an anion exchange membrane, such as a membrane having a large surface-area and a strong
cationic charge, e.g., Sartobind  Q or Mustang Q. Preferably, the anion exchange    step is
performed using a Mustang     Q anion exchange membrane    (Pall Life Sciences). In certain
aspects, the pH of the aqueous ApoA-I solution is reduced to about 5.5, to about 6.0 or to about
6.5 before this anion exchange step using any suitable acid. In particular aspects, the pH of the
aqueous ApoA-I solution is reduced to about 6.0 using dilute phosphoric acid. In preferred
embodiments, the ApoA-I solution is passed through a Mustang      Q cartridge at approximately
12.5 L/m2/h.

[0188] In some embodiments, the anion exchange membrane filtrate is concentrated and
optionally dialfiltered to exchange the solvent to one that is suitable for storage or for further
processing of the ApoA-I, such as complexing with lipids as described below in Section 6.5.1
and/or formulation in pharmaceutical compositions as described below in Section 6.6. Suitable
buffers for storage or further processing of ApoA-I are readily ascertainable to the skilled artisan.
In particular embodiments, the purified ApoA-I is exchanged into TAMP C buffer. Any
ultrafiltration membrane can be used in this step, provided that the membrane has a molecular
weight cutoff that is below the molecular weight of full-length mature ApoA-I such that it allows
the passage of buffer but not protein. In particular embodiments, a polyethersulphone membrane
(e.g., Filtron Omega series) of 10,000 nominal molecular weight cut-off is used. Preferably, the
ApoA-I concentration in the solution after ultrafiltration is at least 10 g/L, at least 12 g/L, at least
15 g/L, at least 20 g/L, at least 25 g/L, at least 30 g/L, at least 35 g/L, at least 40 g/L, at least 45
g/L or at least 50 g/L.
                  6.1.5. Apolipoprotein Products
[0189] The present disclosure also provides substantially pure mature full-length
apolipoproteins. As used herein, the term "substantially pure" refers to a protein that is at least
95% pure. In certain embodiments, the substantially pure protein is at least 96%, at least 97%, at
least 98%, at least 99%, at least 99.5%, at least 99.9% or 100% pure. In certain aspects, the
substantially pure apolipoprotein product produced by the purification methods described herein
is a clear to slightly opalescent colorless solution free of visible particles when visually inspected
using a light source against a white background. In various embodiments, substantially pure
apolipoprotein obtained or obtainable by the methods described in Section 6.1.4 above,
comprises low or undetectable amounts of one or more of host cell DNA, proteins other than the
apolipoprotein (e.g., host cell proteins), endotoxin, residual solvent, as well as low bioburden
(i.e., low number of microbes on or in the sample), as described in further detail below. The
purity of the apolipoprotein product can be determined by any method known in the art,
including, but not limited to, N-terminal Edman sequencing, MALDI-MS, gel electrophoresis,
HPLC, and/or immunoassay.
[0190] In various embodiments, the substantially pure apolipoprotein product obtained by the
methods described herein is full-length mature human ApoA-I having a mass that is about 28.1

about 10% or less, about 5% or less, about 4% or less, about 3% or less, about 2% or less or
about 1% or less by weight of N-terminally extended ApoA-I isoforms (e.g., proApoA-I). As

about 1% or less, about 0. 7 5 % or less, about 0.50% or less, about 0.25 % or less, or about 0.10% or
less by weight of truncated forms of ApoA-I. The amount of truncated or extended ApoA-I can
be determined, for example, by N-terminal Edman sequencing and/or MALDI-MS and/or by
running and scanning an SDS-PAGE gel to determine the ratio of the intensity of the purified
ApoA-I band area to the total intensity of all bands, if present. In various embodiments, the
ApoA-I product comprises about 20% or less, about 10% or less, about 5% or less, about 4% or
less, about 3% or less, about 2% or less, about 1% or less, about 0. 7 5% or less, about 0.5% or

particular ApoA-I oxidized at position Met 1 2 and/or Met 148 .
[0191] In certain embodiments, the substantially pure apolipoprotein produced by the methods
described herein comprises host cell proteins in an amount that is less than about 100 ppm (e.g.,
ng/mg), such as less than about 75 ppm, less than about 50 ppm, less than about 40 ppm, less
than about 30 ppm, less than about 20 ppm, or less than about 10 ppm. In particular
embodiments, the substantially pure apolipoprotein product comprises less than about 20 ppm of
host cell proteins. More preferably, the apolipoprotein product comprises less than about 10 ppm
of host cell proteins. The presence and amount of host cell proteins in an apolipoprotein sample
can be determined by any method known in the art. When apolipoprotein is produced
recombinantly in, e.g., mammalian cells, commercially available ELISA kits (e.g., Kit F015 from
Cygnus Technologies) can be used to detect and quantitate levels of host cell proteins.

sample can be determined by any method known in the art, including real time-PCR or detection
of complexes with single stranded binding protein using an anti-SSB antibody (Glycotype
Biotechnology), preferably by quantitative PCR.

qualitative test for gram-negative bacterial endotoxins. (Cambrex; sensitivity 0.125 EU/mL).
[0194] The substantially pure apolipoprotein product described herein has a low bioburden. The
term "bioburden" refers to the level of aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, yeast and molds in
the product. In various embodiments, the bioburden of the substantially pure apolipoprotein
product purified as described herein is less than about 1 CFU per mL. Bioburden testing can be
performed according to any known method, for example according to the European
Pharmacopoeia Chapter 2.6.12.B, 2.6.1 and USB Chapter 61 harmonized method.

sequence having an aspartic acid at position 1 (i.e., the position corresponding to position 25 of
SEQ ID NO:1).
        6.2.    The Lipid Fraction
[0197] The lipoprotein complexes and compositions of the present disclosure comprise a lipid
fraction. The lipid fraction includes one or more lipids. In various embodiments, one or more
lipids can be saturated and/or unsaturated, and natural or synthetic lipids. The lipid fraction
preferably includes at least one phospholipid.

small alkyl chain phospholipids, egg phosphatidylcholine, soybean phosphatidylcholine,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine
1-myristoyl-2-palmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-myristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1

salt, phosphatidic acid, galactocerebroside, gangliosides, cerebrosides,
dilaurylphosphatidylcholine, (1,3)-D-mannosyl-(1,3)diglyceride, aminophenylglycoside, 3
cholesteryl-6'-(glycosylthio)hexyl ether glycolipids, and cholesterol and its derivatives.
Synthetic lipids, such as synthetic palmitoylsphingomyelin or N-palmitoyl-4
hydroxysphinganine-1-phosphocholine (a form of phytosphingomyelin) can be used to minimize
                                                 -59-

      WO 2012/109162                                                            PCT/US2012/024020
lipid oxidation. Phospholipid fractions including palmitoylsphingomyelin can optionally include
small quantities of any type of lipid, including but not limited to lysophospholipids,
sphingomyelins other than palmitoylsphingomyelin, galactocerebroside, gangliosides,
cerebrosides, glycerides, triglycerides, and cholesterol and its derivatives.
[0199] In preferred embodiments, the lipid fraction includes two types of phospholipids: a
sphingomyelin (SM) and a negatively charged phospholipid. SM is a "neutral" phospholipid in
that it has a net charge of about zero at physiological pH. The identity of the SM used is not
critical for success. Thus, as used herein, the expression "SM" includes sphingomyelins derived
or obtained from natural sources, as well as analogs and derivatives of naturally occurring SMs
that are impervious to hydrolysis by LCAT, as is naturally occurring SM. SM is a phospholipid
very similar in structure to lecithin, but, unlike lecithin, it does not have a glycerol backbone, and
hence does not have ester linkages attaching the acyl chains. Rather, SM has a ceramide
backbone, with amide linkages connecting the acyl chains. SM is not a substrate for LCAT, and
generally cannot be hydrolyzed by it. It can act, however, as an inhibitor of LCAT or can
decrease LCAT activity by diluting the concentration of the substrate phospholipid. Because SM
is not hydrolyzed, it remains in the circulation longer. It is expected that this feature will permit
the negatively charged lipoprotein complexes described herein to have a longer duration of
pharmacological effect (mobilization of cholesterol) and to pick up more lipids, in particular
cholesterol, than apolipoprotein complexes that do not include SM. This effect may result in less
frequent or smaller doses being necessary for treatment than are required for lipoprotein
complexes that do not include SM.
[0200] The SM may be obtained from virtually any source. For example, the SM may be
obtained from milk, egg or brain. SM analogues or derivatives may also be used. Non-limiting
examples of useful SM analogues and derivatives include, but are not limited to,
palmitoylsphingomyelin, N-palmitoyl-4-hydroxysphinganine- 1-phosphocholine (a form of
phytosphingomyelin), palmitoylsphingomyelin, stearoylsphingomyelin, D-erythro-N-16:0
sphingomyelin and its dihydro isomer, D-erythro-N-16:0-dihydro-sphingomyelin.            Synthetic SM
such as synthetic palmitoylsphingomyelin or N-palmitoyl-4-hydroxysphinganine- 1
phosphocholine (phytosphingomyelin) can be used in order to produce more homogeneous
complexes and with fewer contaminants and/or oxidation products than sphingolipids of animal
origin.

[0202] Sphingomyelins isolated from natural sources may be artificially enriched in one
particular saturated or unsaturated acyl chain. For example, milk sphingomyelin (Avanti
Phospholipid, Alabaster, Ala.) is characterized by long saturated acyl chains (i.e., acyl chains
having 20 or more carbon atoms). In contrast, egg sphingomyelin is characterized by short
saturated acyl chains (i.e., acyl chains having fewer than 20 carbon atoms). For example,
whereas only about 20% of milk sphingomyelin comprises C16:0 (16 carbon, saturated) acyl
chains, about 80% of egg sphingomyelin comprises C16:0 acyl chains. Using solvent extraction,
the composition of milk sphingomyelin can be enriched to have an acyl chain composition
comparable to that of egg sphingomyelin, or vice versa.
[0203] The SM may be semi-synthetic such that it has particular acyl chains. For example, milk
sphingomyelin can be first purified from milk, then one particular acyl chain, e.g., the C 16:0 acyl
chain, can be cleaved and replaced by another acyl chain. The SM can also be entirely
synthesized, by e.g., large-scale synthesis. See, e.g., Dong et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,220,043, entitled
Synthesis of D-erythro-sphingomyelins, issued Jun. 15, 1993; Weis, 1999, Chem. Phys. Lipids

[0204] The lengths and saturation levels of the acyl chains comprising a semi-synthetic or a
synthetic SM can be selectively varied. The acyl chains can be saturated or unsaturated, and can
contain from about 6 to about 24 carbon atoms. Each chain may contain the same number of
carbon atoms or, alternatively each chain may contain different numbers of carbon atoms. In
some embodiments, the semi-synthetic or synthetic SM comprises mixed acyl chains such that
one chain is saturated and one chain is unsaturated. In such mixed acyl chain SMs, the chain
lengths can be the same or different. In other embodiments, the acyl chains of the semi-synthetic
or synthetic SM are either both saturated or both unsaturated. Again, the chains may contain the
same or different numbers of carbon atoms. In some embodiments, both acyl chains comprising
the semi-synthetic or synthetic SM are identical. In a specific embodiment, the chains
correspond to the acyl chains of a naturally-occurring fatty acid, such as for example oleic,
palmitic or stearic acid. In another embodiment, SM with saturated or unsaturated functionalized
chains is used. In another specific embodiment, both acyl chains are saturated and contain from
6 to 24 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of acyl chains present in commonly occurring
fatty acids that can be included in semi-synthetic and synthetic SMs are provided in Table 1,

[0205] In preferred embodiments, the SM is palmitoyl SM, such as synthetic palmitoyl SM,
which has C 16:0 acyl chains, or is egg SM, which includes as a principal component palmitoyl
SM.
[0206] In a specific embodiment, functionalized SM, such as a phytosphingomyelin, is used.
[0207] The lipid fraction preferably includes a negatively charged phospholipid. As used herein,
"negatively charged phospholipids" are phospholipids that have a net negative charge at
physiological pH. The negatively charged phospholipid may comprise a single type of
negatively charged phospholipid, or a mixture of two or more different, negatively charged,
phospholipids. In some embodiments, the charged phospholipids are negatively charged
glycerophospholipids. The identity(ies) of the charged phospholipids(s) are not critical for
success. Specific examples of suitable negatively charged phospholipids include, but are not
limited to, a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)], a phosphatidylglycerol, a
phospatidylinositol, a phosphatidylserine, and a phosphatidic acid. In some embodiments, the
negatively charged phospholipid comprises one or more of phosphatidylinositol,
phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and/or phosphatidic acid. In a specific embodiment,
the negatively charged phospholipid consists of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-( 1
glycerol)], or DPPG.
[0208] Like the SM, the negatively charged phospholipids can be obtained from natural sources
or prepared by chemical synthesis. In embodiments employing synthetic negatively charged
phospholipids, the identities of the acyl chains can be selectively varied, as discussed above in
connection with SM. In some embodiments of the negatively charged lipoprotein complexes
described herein, both acyl chains on the negatively charged phospholipids are identical. In some
embodiments, the acyl chains on the SM and the negatively charged phospholipids are all
identical. In a specific embodiment, the negatively charged phospholipid(s), and/or SM all have
C16:0 or C16: 1 acyl chains. In a specific embodiment the fatty acid moiety of the SM is
predominantly C16:1 palmitoyl. In one specific embodiment, the acyl chains of the charged
phospholipid(s) and/or SM correspond to the acyl chain of palmitic acid.
[0209] The phospholipids used are preferably at least 95% pure, and/or have reduced levels of
oxidative agents. Lipids obtained from natural sources preferably have fewer polyunsaturated
fatty acid moieties and/or fatty acid moieties that are not susceptible to oxidation. The level of

oxidation in a sample can be determined using an iodometric method, which provides a peroxide
value, expressed in milli-equivalent number of isolated iodines per kg of sample, abbreviated
meq O/kg. See, e.g., Gray, J.I., Measurement of Lipid Oxidation: A Review, Journal of the
American Oil Chemists Society, Vol. 55, p. 539-545 (1978); Heaton, F.W. and Uri N., Improved
Jodometric Methods for the Determination of Lipid Peroxides, Journal of the Science of food and
Agriculture, vol 9. P, 781-786 (1958). Preferably, the level of oxidation, or peroxide level, is
low, e.g., less than 5 meq O/kg, less than 4 meq O/kg, less than 3 meq O/kg, or less than 2 meq
O/kg.
[0210] Lipid fractions including SM and palmitoylsphingomyelin can optionally include small
quantities of additional lipids. Virtually any type of lipids may be used, including, but not
limited to, lysophospholipids, galactocerebroside, gangliosides, cerebrosides, glycerides,
triglycerides, and cholesterol and its derivatives.
[0211] When included, such optional lipids will typically comprise less than about 15 wt% of the
lipid fraction, although in some instances more optional lipids could be included. In some
embodiments, the optional lipids comprise less than about 10 wt%, less than about 5 wt%, or less
than about 2 wt%. In some embodiments, the lipid fraction does not include optional lipids.
[0212] In a specific embodiment, the phospholipid fraction contains egg SM or palmitoyl SM or
phytosphingomyelin and DPPG in a weight ratio (SM: negatively charged phospholipid) ranging
from 90:10 to 99:1, more preferably ranging from 95:5 to 98:2. In one embodiment, the weight
ratio is 97:3.
[0213] The lipoprotein complexes of the present disclosure can also be used as carriers to deliver
hydrophobic, lipophilic or apolar active agents for a variety of therapeutic or diagnostic
applications. For such applications, the lipid fraction can further include one or more
hydrophobic, lipophilic or apolar active agents, including but not limited to fatty acids, drugs,
nucleic acids, vitamins, and/or nutrients. Suitable hydrophobic , lipophilic or apolar active
agents are not limited by therapeutic category, and can be, for example, analgesics, anti
inflammatory agents, antihelmimthics, anti-arrhythmic agents, anti-bacterial agents, anti-viral
agents, anti-coagulants, anti-depressants, anti-diabetics, anti-epileptics, anti-fungal agents, anti

         6.3.    Lipoprotein Complexes
[0215] The present disclosure provides lipoprotein complexes comprising a protein fraction and
a lipid fraction, the composition of each of which has been described above in Sections 6.1 and
6.2, respectively.
[0216] Generally, the protein fraction includes one or more lipid-binding protein, such as an
apolipoprotein and/or derivative or analog thereof that provides therapeutic and/or prophylactic
benefit. The complexes can include a single type of lipid-binding protein, or mixtures of two or
more different lipid-binding proteins, which can be derived from the same or different species.
Suitable lipid-binding proteins are described above in Section 6.1. Although not required, the
lipoprotein complexes will preferably comprise lipid-binding proteins that are derived from, or
correspond in amino acid sequence to, the animal species being treated, in order to avoid
inducing an immune response to the therapy. Thus, for treatment of human patients, lipid
binding proteins of human origin are preferably used in the complexes of the disclosure. The use
of peptide mimetic apolipoproteins can also reduce or avoid an immune response.
[0217] The use of apolipoprotein that has a high degree of purity (e.g., mature and not truncated,
oxidized, deamidated, contaminated with endotoxin and/or contaminated with other proteins or
with nucleic acids) is thought to enhance the therapeutic potency and/or enhance safety of
lipoprotein complex. Accordingly, the protein fraction can comprise at least 75%, at least 80%,
at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%
mature, full-length ApoA-I, optionally, having no more than 25%, no more than 20%, no more
than 15 %, no more than 10%, no more than 50%, or about 0% oxidized methionine- 112 or
methionine-148, and/or no more than 15%, no more than 10%, no more than 5%, or about 0%

deaminated amino acids. The apolipoprotein can be purified according to any of the methods
described herein. Preferably, the apolipoprotein can be made as described in Section 6.1.4.
[0218] In a specific embodiment, the protein fraction comprises or consists essentially of ApoA
I, for example, substantially pure mature, full-length ApoA-I, as described above in Section
6.1.5.
[0219] The lipid fraction includes one or more lipids, which can be saturated, unsaturated,
natural and synthetic lipids and/or phospholipids. Suitable lipids include, but are not limited to,
small alkyl chain phospholipids, egg phosphatidylcholine, soybean phosphatidylcholine,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine
1-myristoyl-2-palmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-myristoylphosphatidylcholine, 1

phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol,
phosphatidylglycerols, diphosphatidylglycerols such as dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, distearoylphosphatidylglycerol, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol,
dimyristoylphosphatidic acid, dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid,
dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine,
dimyristoylphosphatidylserine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine, brain phosphatidylserine, brain
sphingomyelin, egg sphingomyelin, milk sphingomyelin, phytosphingomyelin,
palmitoylsphingomyelin, dipalmitoylsphingomyelin, distearoylsphingomyelin,
dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol salt, phosphatidic acid, galactocerebroside, gangliosides,
cerebrosides, dilaurylphosphatidylcholine, (1,3)-D-mannosyl-(1,3)diglyceride,
aminophenylglycoside, 3-cholesteryl-6'-(glycosylthio)hexyl ether glycolipids, and cholesterol
and its derivatives. Phospholipid fractions including SM and palmitoylsphingomyelin can
optionally include small quantities of any type of lipid, including but not limited to
lysophospholipids, sphingomyelins other than palmitoylsphingomyelin, galactocerebroside,
gangliosides, cerebrosides, glycerides, triglycerides, and cholesterol and its derivatives.
Synthetic lipids are preferred, such as synthetic palmitoyl sphingomyelin or N-palmitoyl-4
hydroxysphinganine-1-phosphocholine (phytosphingomyelin). Further lipids are described
above in Section 6.2. Preferably, lipoprotein complexes comprise sphingomyelin.

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
[0220] Optionally, the lipoprotein complexes of the present disclosure can be loaded with
hydrophobic, lipophilic or apolar active agents, including but not limited to fatty acids, drugs,
nucleic acids, vitamins, and/or nutrients, for a variety of therapeutic or diagnostic applications.
Suitable agents are described above in Section 6.2.
[0221] The lipoprotein complexes can be made using any of the methods described herein.
Preferably, the complexes are made as described in Sections 6.5.1 to 6.5.4.
[0222] The molar ratio of the lipid fraction to the protein fraction of the negatively charged
lipoprotein complexes described herein can vary, and will depend upon, among other factors, the
identity(ies) of the apolipoprotein comprising the protein fraction, the identities and quantities of
the charged phospholipids comprising the lipid fraction, and the desired size of the charged
lipoprotein complex. Because the biological activity of apolipoproteins such as ApoA-I are
thought to be mediated by the amphipathic helices comprising the apolipoprotein, it is
convenient to express the apolipoprotein fraction of the lipid:apolipoprotein molar ratio using
ApoA-I protein equivalents. It is generally accepted that ApoA-I contains 6-10 amphipathic
helices, depending upon the method used to calculate the helices. Other apolipoproteins can be
expressed in terms of ApoA-I equivalents based upon the number of amphipathic helices they
contain. For example, ApoA-Im, which typically exists as a disulfide-bridged dimer, can be
expressed as 2 ApoA-I equivalents, because each molecule of ApoA-Im contains twice as many
amphipathic helices as a molecule of ApoA-I. Conversely, a peptide apolipoprotein that contains
a single amphipathic helix can be expressed as a 1/10-1/6 ApoA-I equivalent, because each
molecule contains 1/10-1/6 as many amphipathic helices as a molecule of ApoA-I. In general,
the lipid:ApoA-I equivalent molar ratio of the lipoprotein complexes (defined herein as "Ri")
will range from about 105:1 to 110:1. In some embodiments, the Ri is about 108:1. Ratios in
weight can be obtained using a MW of approximately 650-800 for phospholipids.
[0223] In some embodiments, the molar ratio of lipid : ApoA-I equivalents ("RSM") ranges
from about 80:1 to about 110:1, e.g., about 80:1 to about 100:1. In a specific example, the RSM
for lipoprotein complexes can be about 82:1.
[0224] The various apolipoprotein and/or phospholipids molecules comprising the negatively
charged lipoprotein complexes may be labeled with any art-known detectable marker, including

complexes which comprise a protein fraction which is preferably mature, full-length ApoA-I,
and a lipid fraction comprising a neutral phospholipid, sphingomyelin (SM), and negatively
charged phospholipid.
[0226] It has been discovered that composition and relative quantities of SM and negatively
charged phospholipid comprising the lipid fraction of lipoprotein complexes affect the
homogeneity and stability of compositions comprising the complexes. As illustrated in the
Examples section, compositions comprising complexes in which the lipid fraction is composed
of SM and negatively charged phospholipid are more homogeneous, and more stable than similar
compositions in which the lipid fraction includes DPPC in addition to SM.
[0227] Thus, complexes of the present disclosure that contain SM and negatively charged lipid
are preferably formed in the absence of a lecithin in order to improve their homogeneity and
stability. Once homogeneous complexes containing SM and negatively charged lipids are
formed, additional lipids such as lecithin can be incorporated.
[0228] When included, optional lipids will typically comprise less than about 15% of the lipid
fraction, although in some instances more optional lipids could be included. In some
embodiments, the optional lipids comprise than about 10%, less than about 5%, or less than
about 2% wt%. In some embodiments, the lipid fraction of the negatively charged lipoprotein
complexes does not include optional lipids.
[0229] In a specific embodiment, the phospholipid fraction contains eggSM or palmitoyl SM or
phytoSM and DPPG in a weight ratio (SM : negatively charged phospholipid) ranging from
90:10 to 99:1, more preferably ranging from 95:5 to 98:2, e.g., 97:3.
[0230] Some apolipoproteins exchange in vivo from one lipoprotein complex to another (this is
true for apolipoprotein ApoA-I). During the course of such exchange, the apolipoprotein
typically carries with it one or more phospholipid molecules. Owing to this property, it is
expected that the negatively charged lipoprotein complexes described herein will "seed"
negatively charged phospholipids to endogenous HDL, thereby transforming them into alpha
                                                 -69-

     WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
particles that are more resistant to elimination by the kidneys. Thus, it is expected that
administration of the negatively charged lipoprotein complexes and compositions described
herein will increase serum levels of HDL, and/or alter endogenous HDL half-life as well as
endogenous HDL metabolism. It is expected that this will result in alteration of cholesterol
metabolism and reverse lipid transport.
[0231] As illustrated in the Examples section, compositions comprising complexes in which the
weight ratio of ApoA-I : SM and DPPG phospholipid is about 1:2.7 were more homogeneous
and more stable than similar compositions with other weight : weight ratios. Accordingly, the
present disclosure provides lipoprotein compositions in which the protein : lipid weight ratio is
optimized for formation of a homogeneous population of complexes. This weight : weight ratio
ranges from 1:2.6 to 1:3, and is optimally 1:2.7, for complexes of ApoA-I, SM, and DPPG, and
for complexes of components of similar molecular mass. In specific embodiments, the ratio of
ApoA-I protein fraction to lipid fraction typically ranges from about 1:2.7 to about 1:3, with
1:2.7 being preferred. This corresponds to molar ratios of ApoA-I protein to phospholipid
ranging from approximately 1:90 to 1:140. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides
complexes in which the molar ratio protein to lipid is about 1:90 to about 1:120, about 1:100 to
about 1:140, or about 1:95 to about 1:125. Specifically at this optimized ratio, the ApoA-I
protein fraction and the SM and DPPG lipid fraction form substantially homogeneous complexes
with the same size and charge characteristics, as assayed by column chromatography and gel
electrophoresis, respectively, as natural HDL.
[0232] The size of the negatively charged lipoprotein complex can be controlled by varying the
Ri. That is, the smaller the Ri, the smaller the disk. For example, large discoidal disks will
typically have an Ri in the range of about 200:1 to 100:1, whereas small discoidal disks will
typically have an Ri in the range of about 100:1 to 30:1.
[0233] In some specific embodiments, the negatively charged lipoprotein complexes are large
discoidal disks that contain 2-4 ApoA-I equivalents (e.g., 2-4 molecules of ApoA-I, 1-2
molecules of ApoA-Im dimer or 12-40 single helix peptide molecules), 1 molecule of negatively
charged phospholipid and 400 molecules of SM. In other specific embodiments, the negatively
charged lipoprotein complexes are small discoidal disks that contain 2-4 ApoA-I equivalents; 1

10, more preferably 3-6, molecule of negatively charged phospholipid; and 90-225 molecules,
more preferably 100-210 molecules, of SM.
                6.3.1.  Measurement of Complexes and Particle Size
[0234] The composition of lipoprotein complexes, as well as their size and that of lipid particles
used in the preparation of the lipoprotein complexes, can be determined using a variety of
techniques known in the art.
[0235] Protein and lipid concentration of lipoprotein complexes in solution can be measured by
any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, protein and phospholipid assays,
chromatographic methods such as HPLC, gel filtration, GC coupled with various detectors
including mass spectrometry, UV or diode-array, fluorescent, elastic light scattering and others.
The integrity of lipid and proteins can be also determined by the same chromatographic
techniques as well as by peptide mapping, SDS-page gel electrophoresis, N- and C-terminal
sequencing of ApoA-I, and standard assays for determining lipid oxidation.
[0236] The lipoprotein complex as well as lipid particles used in the preparation of the
lipoprotein complexes, can range in size as described herein. Lipid particle size and/or lipid and
protein complex size can be determined using methods known in the art. Exemplary methods
include dynamic light scattering and gel permeation chromatography.
[0237] Dynamic light scattering (DLS), also known as photon correlation spectroscopy,
measures and the shift in wavelength of a light beam hitting a particle moving in solution by
Brownian motion. Specifically, the moving particles scatter light when illuminated by a laser
and the resulting intensity fluctuations in the scattered light can be used to calculate the sphere
size distribution in the solution. See, Zetasizer Nano Series User Manual, MANO317 Issue 2.1
(July 2004). DLS determines the intensity distribution and average of the particles in solution,
based on which particle volume and number distribution and average can be calculated. The DLS
technique can be used to determine the size of lipid particles used to make lipoprotein
complexes, as well as the size of the lipoprotein complexes themselves. A suitable DLS
instrument is the Zetasizer Nano by Malvern Instruments.
[0238] Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) can also be used to determine the size of protein
containing complexes. Gel permeation chromatography separates components in a mixture
                                                  -71-

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
based on molecular size. The size of a lipid-protein complex can be determined by comparing
the elution profile of the complex to that of known standards or reference samples, typically by
comparison to a calibration curve. Reference samples are available commercially and can
include both protein and non-protein standards, such as albumin, ferritin, and vitamin B12 .
Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1998), Section IV, 10.9.1-10.9.2.
[0239] Lipid particles useful in the preparation of the lipoprotein complexes of the disclosure
can be at least 45 nm, at least 50 nm, at least 55 nm, at least 60 nm in size, as measured by DLS
(e.g., using intensity based measured). Furthermore, lipid particle can be up to 65 nm, up to 70
nm, up to 80 nm, up to 90 nm, up to 100 nm, up to 120 nm, up to 150 nm, up to 200 nm, up to
250 nm, up to 300 nm, or up to 500 nm in size, as measured by DLS.
[0240] The lipoprotein complexes of the disclosure can range in size from 4 nm to 15 nm, 6 nm
to 15 nm, 4 nm to 12 nm, 5 to 12 nm, 6 nm to 12 nm, 8 nm to 12 nm, or 8 nm to 10 nm as
measured by the techniques described herein.
         6.4.    Populations of Lipoprotein Complexes
[0241] The present disclosure further provides populations of the lipoprotein complexes
described herein. The populations comprise a plurality of lipoprotein complexes as described
herein, each comprising a protein fraction and a lipid fraction, e.g. as described above in Section
6.3. Applicants have discovered several features that are thought to contribute individually or in
combination to the potency and the safety profile of populations of lipoprotein complexes.
Populations of lipoprotein complexes can incorporate any number of the features, described
herein alone or in combination.
[0242] First, the homogeneity of the lipoprotein complexes in a population, i.e., the prevalence
of one or more discrete lipoprotein complex(es) in the population, as indicated by the one or
more discrete peaks of lipoprotein complexes in a population, and the prevalence in lipoprotein
complexes of mature, unmodified apolipoprotein, are thought to increase potency. Accordingly,
the population of lipoprotein complexes can comprise a protein fraction comprising or consisting
essentially of an apolipoprotein, e.g., ApoA-I, and a lipid fraction, where the population is at
least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at
least 99% homogeneous as measured by the percent of the population in a single peak in gel
permeation chromatography.
                                                 -72-

      WO 2012/109162                                                            PCT/US2012/024020
[0243] In some embodiments, lipoprotein complex size in a population can range between 4 nm
and 15 nm, e.g., between 5 nm and 12 nm, between 6 nm and 15 nm, or between 8 nm and 10
nm.
[0244] The apolipoprotein, e.g., ApoA-I, in the population can be mature, preferably full length
(untruncated) ApoA-I, and the population can contain at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at
least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% by weight mature,
preferably full length (untruncated) ApoA-I. In some embodiments, the population includes no
more than 250%, no more than 20%, no more than 150%, no more than 10%, or no more than 50%
by weight of immature or incompletely processed ApoA-I and/or no more than 20%, no more
than 150%, no more than 10%, or no more than 50%by weight of truncated ApoA-I.
[0245] Second, the purity of apolipoprotein and lipids in the complexes and the relative absence
of contaminants in the lipoprotein complexes, also referred to as the purity of the lipoprotein
complexes, is thought to reduce the risk of side effects such as liver damage, reflected by
increases in liver enzymes (e.g., transaminase). The purity of apolipoprotein can be measured by
the relative lack of oxidation and/or deamidation. Accordingly, in certain embodiments,
populations of lipoprotein complexes can have reduced amounts of oxidized apolipoprotein, such
as no more than 20%, no more than 15%, no more than 10%, no more than 5%, no more than
4%, no more than 30%, no more than 2%, no more than l% oxidized methionine, especially
methionine- 112 or methionine-148, or no more than 150%, no more than 10%, no more than 50%,
no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no more than 2%, or no more than l% oxidized tryptophan.
Populations of lipoprotein complexes can also have a reduced percentage of deamidated amino
acids, for example no more than 15%, no more than 10%, no more than 5%, no more than 4%,
no more than 3%, no more than 2%, or no more than l% deaminated amino acids.
[0246] It is also desirable to control the purity of the lipids in the lipoprotein complex.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no
more than 2% or no more than l% of the lipid in said population is oxidized.
[0247] Another measure of the purity of the complexes and populations thereof is a reduction in,
or absence of, contaminants that result from the methods of producing or purifying the
apolipoprotein or the methods of making the lipoprotein complexes themselves. Accordingly,
where the apolipoprotein is purified from host cells, for example mammalian host cells, the
                                                  -73-

      WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020
populations of lipoprotein complexes are preferably free of host cell DNA or proteins. In
specific embodiments, the population contains no more than 500 nanograms, no more than 200
nanograms, no more than 100 nanograms, no more than 50 nanograms, or no more than 20
nanograms host cell protein per milligram of the lipoprotein, and/or no more than 100 picograms,
no more than 50 picograms, no more than 25 picograms, no more than 10 picograms or no more
than 5 picograms host cell DNA per milligram of the lipoprotein, typically ApoA-I.
[0248] Other contaminants that can occur and are to be avoided are endotoxin, which can be
present, inter alia, in cell cultures and in plasma samples, and solvents and detergents, which can
be present depending on the process used to make and/or purify the lipoprotein complex.
Populations of lipoprotein complexes can contain at most about 1 EU, about 0.5 EU, about 0.3
EU, or about 0.1 EU of endotoxin per milligram lipoprotein, e.g. ApoA-I. Populations of
lipoprotein complexes can also be limited to containing no more than 200 ppm, 250 ppm, 100
ppm or a non-acqueous solvent. In a specific embodiment, the population does not contain any
detergent, e.g., cholate.
[0249] Additionally, using the methods disclosed herein, it is possible to incorporate most of the
apolipoprotein starting material into complexes, limiting the amount of uncomplexed
apolipoprotein present in a population. The reduction in the amount of uncomplexes
apolipoprotein is beneficial in that it reduces the risk of an immunogenic response due to
exposure to a heterologous protein. The population of lipoprotein complexes can be in a
composition in which at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least
98%, at least 99% or 100% of the protein is in the lipoprotein complex, i.e., the complexed form.
Optionally, the population of lipoprotein complexes can be in a composition in which at least
80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% of
the lipid is in the lipoprotein complex.
[0250] Optionally, the population can comprise complexes in which the lipid fraction comprises
no more than 15%, no more than 10%, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no
more than 2%, no more than 1%, or 0% cholesterol by weight of lipid.
[0251] Certain lipid and protein components can form a plurality of different but homogeneous
lipoprotein complexes. Accordingly, the present disclosure also provides compositions
comprising two, three, or four populations of lipoprotein complexes comprising different
                                                  -74-

     WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020
amounts of apolipoprotein molecules (e.g., two, three or four ApoA-I molecules or ApoA-I
equivalents). In an exemplary embodiment, a composition comprises two lipoprotein complex
populations, a first population comprising lipoprotein complexes having 2 ApoA-I molecules or
ApoA-I equivalents per lipoprotein complex, a second population comprising lipoprotein
complexes having 3 or 4 ApoA-I molecules or ApoA-I equivalents per lipoprotein complex and
optionally a third population comprising lipoprotein complexes having 4 or 3 ApoA-I molecules
or ApoA-I equivalents per lipoproprotein complex, respectively.
[0252] The compositions comprising two or more populations of lipoprotein complexes
preferably have low levels of uncomplexed lipoprotein and/or lipid. Accordingly, preferably no
more than 15%, no more than 12%, than 10%, no more than 9%, no more than 8%, no more than
7%, no more than 6%, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no more than 2%,
or no more than 1% of the lipid in the composition is in uncomplexed form and/or no more than
15%, no more than 12%, no more than 10%, no more than 9%, no more than 8%, no more than
7%, no more than 6%, no more than 5%, no more than 4%, no more than 3%, no more than 2%,
or no more than 1% of the lipoprotein in the composition is in uncomplexed form.
[0253] Also provided herein are large-scale preparations of lipoprotein complexes, or
populations thereof, that are particularly useful for commercial applications, such as large scale
manufacturing of lipoprotein complexes for therapeutic purposes. The preparations
contemplated herein comprise a population of lipoprotein complexes, e.g., negatively charged
lipoprotein complexes, as described herein.
[0254] The preparations are provided in volumes, amounts and resulting concentration of
lipoprotein complexes suitable for the manufacturing of compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical
compositions and dosage forms, on a commercial scale. Typical preparation volumes range from
about 5L to about 50L, or more, for example, about 1OL to about 40L, about 15L to about 35L,
about 15L to about 30L, about 20L to about 40L, about 20L to about 30L, about 25L to about
45L, about 25L to about 35L. Preparations can have a volumne of about 5L, about 6L, about 7L,
about 8L, about 9L, about 1OL, about 1 IL, about 12L, about 13L, about 14L, about 15L, about
16L, about 17L, about 18L, about 19L, about 20L, about 25L, about 30L, about 35L, about 40L,
about 45L, or about 50L. In a preferred embodiment, the preparation has a volume of about 20L.

[0255] Preparations further contain lipoprotein complexes, or a population thereof, in amounts
sufficient to achieve a concentration of apolipoprotein ranging from about 5 mg/mL up to about
15 mg/mL, from 5 mg/mL to about 10 mg/mL, from about 10 mg/mL to about 15 mg/mL, or
about 8 mg/mL to about 12 mg/mL of apolipoprotein. Depending on the volume of the
preparation, amounts can range from about 25g up to about 350g, expressed as the amount of
apolipoprotein, e.g., ApoA-I, in the preparation. In a specific embodiment, the preparation
contains about 8 mg/mL of ApoA-I.
[0256] In a specific embodiment, the preparation has a volume of 15L to 25L and contains about
100 g to about 250 g of ApoA-I. In another specific embodiment, the preparation has a volume
of 30L to 50L and contains about 240 g to about 780 g of ApoA-I.
         6.5.   Methods of Making Lipoprotein Complexes
                6.5.1.  Thermal Cycling Based Methods of Making Lipoprotein Complexes
[0257] It has been discovered that methods using thermal cycling of protein and lipid
components as described herein can be used to generate lipoprotein complexes with advantages
over other methodologies. In the thermal cycling methods provided herein, a protein component
and a lipid component, that are subjected to thermal cycling until the majority of the protein
component (e.g., at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90%) is complexed with the
lipid component, forming a lipoprotein complex. As will be appreciated by skilled artisans, the
advantages of the present methods over other methods for production of lipoprotein complexes
include a high complexing efficiency resulting in a substantially homogeneous and pure end
product, without few to no byproducts (e.g., uncomplexed protein) or manufacturing impurities
(e.g., detergents or surfactants, degraded proteins, oxidized components) present in the resulting
product, circumventing the need for costly and wasteful purification steps. Thus, the methods
are efficient and result in little-to-no wastage of starting materials. Furthermore, the processes
are easy to scale up and have a low equipment cost. The ability to conduct these processes
without industrial solvents makes them environmentally friendly also.
[0258] Preferably, to minimize oxidation of the protein and lipid components, one, more than
one or all steps of complex formation (including homogenization of the lipid component) are
carried out under an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, argon or helium) blanket.
                                                  -76-

      WO 2012/109162                                                             PCT/US2012/024020
                 6.5.2.  The Lipid Component
[0259] The thermal cycling methods of the disclosure can utilize a variety of lipids, alone or in
combination, including saturated, unsaturated, natural and synthetic lipids and/or phospholipids,
as described above in Section 6.2.
[0260] The lipids can be prepared for thermal cycling with the protein component using any
method that generates lipid particles, such as multilamellar vesicles ("MLVs"), small unilamellar
vesicles ("SUVs"), large unilamellar vesicles ("LUVs"), micelles, dispersions and the like.
[0261] A range of technologies is known for producing lipid particles. Lipid particles have been
produced using a variety of protocols, forming different types of vesicles. It is preferred that the
particles used in the thermal cycling methods of the disclosure are predominantly in the 45-80
nm size range, most preferably in the 55 nm to 75 nm size range.
[0262] High pressure homogenization, for example microfluidization, advantageously produces
particles of suitable sizes. The homogenization pressure is preferably at least 1,000 bars, at least
1,200 bars, at least 1,400 bars, at least 1,600 bars, at least 1,800 bars, and is most preferably at
least 2,000 bars, for example at least 2,200 bars, at least 2,400 bars, at least 2,600 bars, at least
2,800 bars, at least 3,000 bars, at least 3,200 bars, at least 3,400 bars, at least 3,600 bars, at least
3,800 bars, or at least 4,000 bars. In specific embodiments, the homogenization pressure is in a
range between any pair of the foregoing values, e.g., 1,600 to 3,200 bars; 1,800 to 2,800 bars;
1,900 to 2,500 bars; 2,000 to 2,500 bars; 2,000 to 3,000 bars; 2,400 to 3,800 bars; 2,800 to 3,400
bars; and so on and so forth. One bar equals 100 kPa, 1,000,000 dynes per square centimeter
(baryes), 0.987 atm (atmospheres), 14.5038 psi, 29.53 inHg and 750.06 torr.
[0263] In one suitable homogenization method, an emulsion of the lipids is transferred into the
feed vessel of a Microfluidizer Model 1 OY (Microfluidics Inc, Newton, Mass.). The unit is
immersed in a bath to maintain the process temperature (e.g., 55 0 C, 58 0 C, 62 0 C, etc.) during
homogenization, and is flushed with an inert gas such as argon before use. After priming, the
emulsion is passed through the homogenizer in continuous re-cycle for 5-20 minutes at a
pressure gradient across the interaction head. Homogenization of the lipid component in the
absence of the protein component avoids the destruction of the protein component by high shear
used in homogenization techniques.

      WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020
[0264] Other methods can suitably be used, provided that particles of a suitable size can be
obtained. For example, hydration of lipids by aqueous solution can result in the dispersion of
lipids and spontaneous formation of multimellar vesicles ("MLVs"). An MLV is a particle with
multiple lipid bilayers surrounding the central aqueous core. These types of particles are larger
than small unilamellar vesicles (SUVS) and may be 350-400 nm in diameter. MLVs can be
prepared by solubilizing lipids in chloroform in a round-bottom flask and evaporating the
chloroform until the lipid formed a thin layer on the wall of the flask. The aqueous solution is
added and the lipid layer is allowed to rehydrate. Vesicles formed as the flask is swirled or
vortexed. Deamer et al., 1983, in Liposomes (Ostro, Ed.), Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (citing
Bangham et al., 1965, J. Mol. Biol. 13:238). This method can also be used to generate single
lamellar vesicles. Johnson et al., 1971, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 233:820.
[0265] A small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) is a particle with a single lipid bilayer enclosing an
aqueous core. Depending on the method employed to generate the SUVS, they can range in size
from 25-110 nm in diameter. The first SUVs were prepared by drying a phospholipid
preparation in chloroform under nitrogen, adding the aqueous layer to produce a lipid
concentration in the millimolar range, and sonicating the solution at 45'C to clarity. Deamer et
al., 1983, in Liposomes (Ostro, Ed.), Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York. SUVs prepared in this
fashion yield particles in the range of 25-50 nm in diameter.
[0266] Another method of making SUVs is rapidly injecting an ethanol/lipid solution into the
aqueous solution to be encapsulated. Deamer et al., 1983, in Liposomes (Ostro, Ed.), Marcel
Dekker, Inc. New York (citing Batzri et al., 1973, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 298:1015). SUVs
produced by this method range in size from 30-110 nm in diameter.
[0267] SUVs can also be produced by passing multilamellar vesicles through a French Press four
times at 20,000 psi. The SUVs produced will range in size from 30-50 nm in diameter. Deamer
et al., 1983, in Liposomes (Ostro, Ed.), Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (citing Barenholz et al.,
1979, FEBS Letters 99:210).
[0268] Multilamellar and unilamellar phospholipid vesicles can also be formed by extrusion of
aqueous preparations of phospholipids at high pressure through small-pore membranes (Hope et
al., 1996, Chemistry and Physics of Lipids, 40:89-107)

     WO 2012/109162                                                               PCT/US2012/024020
[0269] Large unilamellar vesicles are similar to SUVs in that they are single lipid bilayers
surrounding the central aqueous core, but LUVs are much larger that SUVs. Depending on their
constituent parts and the method used to prepare them, LUVs can range in size from 50-1000 nm
in diameter. Deamer et al., 1983, in Liposomes (Ostro, Ed.), Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York.
LUVs are usually prepared using one of three methods: detergent dilution, reverse-phase
evaporation, and infusion.
[0270] In the detergent dilution technique, detergent solutions such as cholate, deoxycholate,
octyl glucoside, heptyl glucoside and Triton X- 100 are used to form micelles from the lipid
preparation. The solution is then dialyzed to remove the detergent. Deamer et al., 1983, in
Liposomes (Ostro, Ed.), Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York.
[0271] The reverse-phase evaporation technique solubilizes lipid in aqueous-nonpolar solutions,
forming inverted micelles. The nonpolar solvent is evaporated and the micelles aggregate to form
LUVs. This method generally requires a great deal of lipid.
[0272] The infusion method injects a lipid solubilized in a non-polar solution into the aqueous
solution to be encapsulated. As the nonpolar solution evaporates, lipids collect on the
gas/aqueous interface. The lipid sheets form LUVs and oligolamellar particles as the gas
bubbles through the aqueous solution. Particles are sized by filtration. Deamer et al., 1983, in
Liposomes (Ostro, Ed.), Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (citing Deamer et al., 1976, Biochim.
Biophys. Acta 443:629 and Schieren et al., 1978, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 542:137).
[0273] An aliquot of the resulting lipid preparation can be characterized to confirm that the lipid
particles are suitable for use as the lipid component in the thermocyling methods disclosed
herein. Characterization of the lipid preparation can be performed using any method known in
the art, including, but not limited to, size exclusion filtration, gel filtration, column filtration, gel
permeation chromatography, and non-denaturating gel electrophoresis.
                 6.5.3.  The Protein Component
[0274] The protein component of the lipoprotein complexes is not critical for success in the
present thermal cycling methods. Virtually any lipid-binding protein, such as an apolipoprotein
and/or derivative or analog thereof that provides therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit can be
included in the complexes. Moreover, any alpha-helical peptide or peptide analog, or any other
                                                  -79-

      WO 2012/109162                                                              PCT/US2012/024020
type of molecule that "mimics" the activity of an apolipoprotein (such as, for example ApoA-I)
in that it can activate LCAT or form discoidal particles when associated with lipids, can be
included in the lipoprotein complexes, and is therefore included within the definition of "lipid
binding protein." The lipid-binding proteins that can be used in the thermal cycling methods
include those in described in Section 6.1 above. The lipid-binding proteins can be recombinantly
produced as described in Section 6.1.2 above. The lipid-binding proteins can be purified by any
of the methods described herein, including as described in Section 6.1.3 or Section 6.1.4 above.
[0275] The protein component can be purified from animal sources (and in particular from
human sources), chemically synthesized or produced recombinantly as is well-known in the art,
see, e.g., Chung et al., 1980, J. Lipid Res. 21(3):284-91; Cheung et al., 1987, J. Lipid Res.
28(8):913-29. See also U.S. Patent Nos. 5,059,528, 5,128,318, 6,617,134; U.S. Publication Nos.
20002/0156007, 2004/0067873, 2004/0077541, and 2004/0266660; and PCT Publications Nos.
WO/2008/104890 and WO/2007/023476.
[0276] The protein component can include lipids in protein/peptide to lipid ratio that is at least 5
fold greater (e.g., at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold or at least 20-fold greater) than the
protein/peptide to lipid ratio in the desired complex. For example, to produce a lipoprotein
complex in which the desired protein to lipid ratio is 1:200 on a molar basis, the protein in the
protein component can be combined with a lipid, typically one that will represent only a small
fraction of the lipid in the final complex, e.g., in a ratio of 1:10 to 1:20. Without implying any
mechanism, this "pre-" complexing of the protein to a small amount of lipid is useful when the
desired complex has more than one type of lipid, allowing more homogeneous distribution of a
lipid that is present in small quantities in the lipoprotein complex produced by thermal cycling
(e.g., 10% or less by weight of total lipid, 50% or less by weight of total lipid, 30% or less by
weight of total lipid, 2% or less by weight of total lipid, or 1% or less by weight of total lipid in
the desired lipoprotein complex).
                 6.5.4. Generating Lipoprotein Complexes By Thermal Cycling
[0277] The methods generally entail thermally cycling a suspension comprising lipid particles
and lipid binding proteins between a "high" temperature range and a "low" temperature range
until lipoprotein complexes are formed.
                                                    -80-

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
[0278] The suspension that is thermally cycled is contains a lipid component and a protein
component that are brought together, preferably at a temperature in the high temperature range,
to form a "starting" suspension that is then subject to thermal cycling.
[0279] The optimum ratio of lipids and proteins in the starting suspension is determined by the
desired stoichiometry of the components in the ultimate lipoprotein complexes to be produced.
As will be recognized by skilled artisans, the molar ratio of the lipid fraction to the protein
fraction will depend upon, among other factors, the identity(ies) of the proteins and/or peptides
in the protein component, the identities and quantities of the lipids in the lipid fraction, and the
desired size of the lipoprotein complex. Suitable lipid to protein ratios in the lipoprotein
complexes can be determined using any number of functional assays known in the art, including,
but not limited to, gel electrophoresis mobility assay, size exclusion chromatography, interaction
with HDL receptors, recognition by ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCAl), uptake by the
liver, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. For example, gel electrophoresis mobility
assays can be used to determine the optimum ratio of lipid component to protein component in
the complexes. Where the complexes produced by the methods of the disclosure are charged, as
a result of inclusion of phospholipids in the lipid component, the complexes can be designed to
exhibit an electrophoretic mobility that is similar to natural pre-beta-HDL or alpha-HDL
particles. Thus, in some embodiments, natural pre-beta-HDL or alpha-HDL particles can be
used as standard for determining the mobility of the complexes.
[0280] In a preferred embodiment, the ultimate complex has at least one apolipoprotein or
apoliprotein mimic (most preferably mature human ApoA-I or ApoA-I peptide, respectively), at
least one neutral lipid, and at least one negatively charged lipid, such as those described in PCT
W02006/100567, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.
[0281] Because the biological activity of apolipoproteins such as ApoA-I are thought to be
mediated by the amphipathic helices comprising the apolipoprotein, it is convenient to express
the apolipoprotein fraction of the lipid:apolipoprotein molar ratio using ApoA-I protein
equivalents. It is generally accepted that ApoA-I contains 6-10 amphipathic helices, depending
upon the method used to calculate the helices. Other apolipoproteins can be expressed in terms
of ApoA-I equivalents based upon the number of amphipathic helices they contain. For
example, ApoA-Im, which typically exists as a disulfide bridged dimer, can be expressed as 2
                                                  -81-

      WO 2012/109162                                                        PCT/US2012/024020
ApoA-I equivalents, because each molecule of ApoA-Im contains twice as many amphipathic
helices as a molecule of ApoA-I. Conversely, a peptide apolipoprotein that contains a single
amphipathic helix can be expressed as a 1/10 to 1/6 ApoA-I equivalent, because each molecule
contains 1/10 to 1/6 as many amphipathic helices as a molecule of ApoA-I.
[0282] In general, the lipid:ApoA-I equivalent molar ratio of the lipoprotein complexes (defined
herein as "Ri") will range from about 2:1 to 200:1. In some embodiments, the Ri is about from
50:1 to 150:1, or from 75:1 to 125:1, from 10:1 to 175:1. Ratios in weight can be obtained using
a MW of approximately 650-800 for phospholipids.
[0283] In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of the components is 2-6 (negatively charged
lipid, e.g., DPPG) : 90-120 (neutral lipid, e.g., SM) : 1 (ApoA-I equivalents). In a specific
embodiment, described in Example 1, the complex comprises DPPG, SM and ApoA-I in a lipid
to protein molar ratio of approximately 108:1, with DPPG representing 3% (+/- 1%) of the total
lipid by weight and SM representing 97% (+/-5%) of the lipid by weight.
[0284] The concentration of the lipid and protein components in the starting suspension prior to
the initiation of thermocycling can range from 1 to 30 mg/ml concentration of ApoA-I
equivalents and from 1 to 100 mg/ml concentrations of lipid. In specific embodiments, the
concentration of the protein component is selected from 1 to 30 mg/ml, 2 to 20 mg/ml, from 5 to
20 mg/ml, from 2 to 10 mg/ml, from 5 to 15 mg/ml, from 5 to 20 mg/ml, and from 10 to 20
mg/ml, and the concentration of the lipid component is independently selected from 10 to 100
mg/ml, from 10 to 75 mg/ml, from 25 to 50 mg/ml, from 10 to 75 mg/ml, from 25 to 100 mg/ml,
from 25 to 75 mg/ml, and from 1 to 75 mg/ml.
[0285] The high and low temperature ranges of the thermocycling process are based on the phase
transition temperatures of the lipid and protein components of the lipoprotein complexes.
Alternatively, where the lipid component does not exhibit a defined or discrete phase transition,
as could occur when using phospholipids having unsaturated fatty acid chains or a mixture of
phospholipids, the high and low temperature ranges of the thermocycling differ by at least about
20 0 C, up to about 40 0 C or even more. For example, in some embodiments, the low and high
temperature ranges differ by 20'C-30'C, 20'C-40'C, 20'C-50'C, 30'C-40'C, 30'C-50'C, 25 0 C
45 0 C, 35 0 C-55 0 C.
                                                  -82-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
[0286] For a lipid, the phase transition involves a change from a closely packed, ordered
structure, known as the gel state, to a loosely packed, less-ordered structure, known as the fluid
state. Lipoprotein complexes are typically formed in the art by incubating lipid particles and
apolipoproteins at temperatures near the transition temperature of the particular lipid or mixture
of lipids used. The phase transition temperature of the lipid component (which can be
determined by calorimetry) +/- 5'C-10 C represents the "low" temperature range in the methods
of the disclosure.
[0287] For a protein, the phase transition temperature involves a change from the folded three
dimensional structure into a two-dimensional structure. For a lipid, the phase transition involves
a change from a closely packed, ordered structure, known as the gel state, to a loosely packed,
less-ordered structure, known as the fluid state. Lipoprotein complexes are typically formed in
the art by incubating lipid particles and apolipoproteins at temperatures near the transition
temperature of the particular lipid or mixture of lipids used.
[0288] The phase transition temperature of the lipid component (which can be determined by
calorimetry) +/- 12'C, more preferably +/- 100 C, represents the "low" temperature range in the
methods of the disclosure. In certain embodiments, the low temperature range is +/-3'C, +/-5'C,
or +/-8'C of the phase transition temperature of the lipid component. In one specific
embodiment, the low temperature range is from no less than 5'C or no less than 10 C below to
5'C above the phase transition temperature of the lipid component.
[0289] For a protein, the phase transition temperature involves a change from the tertiary
structure into the secondary structure. The phase transition temperature of the protein
component +/-12'C, more preferably +/- 10 C, represents the "high" temperature range in the
methods of the disclosure. In specific embodiments, the high temperature range is +/-3'C, +/
5'C, or +/-8'C of the phase transition temperature of the protein component. In one specific
embodiment, the low temperature range is from 10 C below to no more than 5'C, no more than
10 0 C, or no more than 15 C above the phase transition temperature of the protein component.
[0290] The starting suspension is subjected to thermal cycling between the high temperature and
the low temperature, preferably starting at the high temperature, until at least 70%, at least 80%,
at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% of the protein
in the starting suspension is incorporated into liprotein complexes. Using suitable stoichiometric
                                                 -83-

      WO 2012/109162                                                            PCT/US2012/024020
quantities of lipid and protein components, substantially complete complexation of the lipid and
protein components can be reached after several cycles. The number of cycles will depend on
the protein and lipid components, the duration of the cycles, but typically 5 or more cycles, 10 or
more cycles, or 15 or more cycles (at both the high and low temperatures) will be required for
substantially complete complexation. The cycles typically range from 2 minutes to 60 minutes.
In specific embodiments, the cycles range from 5 to 30 minutes, from 10 to 20 minutes, from 5
to 20 minutes, from 2 to 45 minutes, or from 5 to 45 minutes at each temperature.
[0291] The complexes produced by the methods are typically supramolecular assemblies shaped
as micelles, vesicles, spherical or discoidal particles in which the protein component is
physically bound to phospholipids at a specific stoichiometric range between the phospholipid
and protein and with a homogeneous size distribution. The present methods advantageously
result in substantially complete complexation of the lipids and/or proteins in the starting
suspension, resulting in a composition that is substantially free lipids and/or free protein, as
observed by separation methods such as chromatography. Thus, the methods of the disclosure
can be performed in the absence of a purification step.
[0292] The methods of the disclosure advantageously produce complexes that are homogenous
in their size distribution, circumventing the need for size fractionation.
[0293] In some embodiments of the disclosure, the lipoprotein complexes will contain more than
one type of lipid, including one or more lipids in relatively small quantities (e.g., less than 10%,
less than 5%, less than 3% or less than 1% of the lipid component). To optimize dispersion,
lipids used in small quantities can be pre-blended with the protein component rather than
incorporated into the lipid particles in the lipid component.
[0294] An aliquot of the resulting lipoprotein complexes can be characterized to confirm that the
complexes possess the desired characteristics, e.g., substantially complete (e.g., >90%, >95%,
>97% or >98%) incorporation of the protein component into the lipid component.
Characterization of the complexes can be performed using any method known in the art,
including, but not limited to, size exclusion filtration, gel filtration, column filtration, gel
permeation chromatography, and non-denaturating gel electrophoresis.
[0295] The homogeneity and/or stability of the lipoprotein complexes or composition described
herein can be measured by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to,
                                                  -84-

      WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020
chromatographic methods such as gel filtration chromatography. For example, in some
embodiments a single peak or a limited number of peaks can be associated with a stable
complex. The stability of the complexes can be determined by monitoring the appearance of new
of peaks over time. The appearance of new peaks is a sign of reorganization among the
complexes due to the instability of the particles.
[0296] Preferably, to minimize oxidation of the protein and lipid components, the thermocycling
is carried out under an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, argon or helium) blanket.
                6.5.5.  Other Methods Of Making Lipoprotein Complexes
[0297] The lipoprotein complexes described herein, including negatively charged lipoprotein
complexes, can be prepared in a variety of forms, including, but not limited to vesicles,
liposomes, proteoliposomes, micelles, and discoidal particles. In addition to the thermal cycling
methods described above, a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art can be used to
prepare the lipoprotein complexes. Various techniques for preparing liposomes or
proteoliposomes may be used. For example, apolipoprotein can be co-sonicated (using an
ultrasonic bath or ultrasonic probe) with the appropriate phospholipids to form complexes.
Alternatively, apolipoprotein, e.g., ApoA-I, can be combined with preformed lipid vesicles
resulting in the spontaneous formation of lipoprotein complexes. The lipoprotein complexes can
also be formed by a detergent dialysis method; e.g., a mixture of apolipoprotein, charged
phospholipid(s), and SM and a detergent such as cholate is dialyzed to remove the detergent and
reconstituted to form negatively charged lipoprotein complexes (see, e.g., Jonas et al., 1986,
Methods in Enzymol. 128:553-82), or by using an extruder device or by homogenization.
[0298] In some embodiments, complexes are prepared by homogenization using high pressure
(e.g., about 32000 p.s.i.) for about 40, about 50, or about 60 minutes. In a specific embodiment,
a complex comprising ApoA-I, SN, and DPPG is prepared as follows. ApoA-I is dissolved in
phosphate buffer and incubated at 50'C with a dispersion of DPPG in phosphate buffer made
using a high shear mixer. The ApoA-I/ DPPG mixture is then combined with a dispersion of
SM, and homogenized at pressures over 30,000 p.s.i. at 30-50 0C until complex formation is
substantially complete, as monitored by dynamic light scattering or gel permeation
chromatography.
                                                  -85-

     WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
[0299] In some embodiments, lipoprotein complexes can be prepared by the cholate dispersion
method described in Example 1 of U.S. publication 2004/0067873, the disclosure of which is
incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, dry lipid is hydrated in NaHCO 3 buffer, then vortexed
and sonicated until all lipid is dispersed. Cholate solution is added, the mixture is incubated for
30 minutes, with periodic vortexing and sonicating, until it turns clear, indicating that the lipid
cholate micelles are formed. ProApoA-I in NaHCO 3 buffer is added, and the solution incubated
for 1 hour at approximately 37 0 C-50'C.
[0300] Cholate can be removed by methods well known in the art. For example cholate can be
removed by dialysis, ultrafiltration or by removal of cholate molecules by adsorption absorption
onto an affinity bead or resin. In one embodiment, the affinity beads, e.g., BIO-BEADS@ (Bio
Rad Laboratories) are added to the preparation of negatively charged lipoprotein complexes and
cholate to adsorb the cholate. In another embodiment, the preparation, e.g., a micellar
preparation of the lipoprotein complexes and cholate, is passed over a column packed with
affinity beads.
[0301] In a specific embodiment, cholate is removed from a preparation of lipoprotein
complexes by loading the preparation onto BIO-BEADS® within a syringe. The syringe is then
sealed with barrier film and incubated with rocking at 4'C overnight. Before use, the cholate is
removed by injecting the solution through BIO-BEADS®, where it is adsorbed by the beads.
[0302] The lipoprotein complexes, such as negatively charged lipoprotein complexes described
herein, are expected to have an increased half-life in the circulation when the complexes have a
similar size and density to HDL, especially to the HDLs in the pre-beta- 1 or pre-beta-2 HDL
populations. Stable preparations having a long shelf life may be made by lyophilization. In
some embodiments, co-lyophilization methods commonly known in the art are used to prepare
ApoA-I-lipid complexes. Briefly, the co-lyophilization steps include either solubilizing a
mixture of ApoA-I and lipid in organic solvent or solvent mixture, or solubilizing ApoA-I and
lipid separately and mixing them together. Desirable characteristics of solvents or solvent
mixtures for co-lyophilization include: (i) a medium relative polarity to be able to dissolve
hydrophobic lipids and amphipathic protein, (ii) class 2 or class 3 solvents according to FDA
solvent guidelines (Federal Register, volume 62, No. 247) to avoid potential toxicity associated
with residual organic solvent, (iii) low boiling point to assure ease of solvent removal during
                                                 -86-

     WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
lyophilization, (iv) high melting point to provide for faster freezing, higher temperatures of
condensation and less wear and tear on the freeze-dryer. In some embodiments, glacial acetic
acid is used. Combinations of methanol, glacial acetic acid, xylene, or cyclohexane can also be
used.
[0303] The ApoA-I-lipid solution is then lyophilized to obtain a homogeneous powder. The
lyophilization conditions can be optimized to obtain fast evaporation of solvent with minimal
amount of residual solvent in the lyophilized apolipoprotein-lipid powder. The selection of
freeze-drying conditions can be determined by the skilled artisan, depending on the nature of
solvent, type and dimensions of the receptacle, holding solution, fill volume, and characteristics
of the freeze-dryer used.
[0304] The lyophilized lipoprotein complexes can be used to prepare bulk supplies for
pharmaceutical reformulation, or to prepare individual aliquots or dosage units that can be
reconstituted to obtain a solution or suspension of lipoprotein complexes. For reconstitution, the
lyophilized powder is rehydrated with an aqueous solution to a suitable volume (e.g., 5 mg
polypeptide/ml, which is convenient for intravenous injection). In some embodiments, the
lyophilized powder is rehydrated with phosphate buffered saline or a physiological saline
solution. The mixture can be agitated or vortexed to facilitate rehydration. The reconstitution
step can be performed at a temperature equal to or greater than the phase transition temperature
of the lipid component of the complexes.
[0305] The ApoA-I-lipid complexes can form spontaneously after hydration of lyophilized
apolipoprotein-lipid powder with an aqueous medium of appropriate pH and osmolality. In some
embodiments, the hydration medium contains stabilizers selected from, but not limited to,
sucrose, trehalose and glycerin. In some embodiments, the solution is heated several times
above the transition temperature of the lipids in order for complexes to form. The ratio of lipid
to protein can be from 1:1 to 200:1 (mole/mole), and is preferably 3:1 to 2:1 lipid:protein (w/w),
more preferably 2.7:1 to 2.1:1 lipid:protein (w/w), e.g., 2.7:1 lipid:protein (w/w). The powder is
hydrated to obtain a final complex concentration of 5-30 mg/ml expressed in protein equivalents.
[0306] In various embodiments, ApoA-I powder can be obtained by freeze-drying the
polypeptide solution in NH 4HCO 3 aqueous solution. A homogeneous solution of ApoA-I and
lipid (e.g., sphingomyelin) is then formed by dissolving the lipid powder and the ApoA-I powder
                                                -87-

      WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
in glacial acetic acid. The solution is then lyophilized, and HDL-like apolipoprotein-lipid
complexes are formed by hydration of the resulting powder in an aqueous medium.
[0307] In some embodiments, ApoA-I-lipid complexes are formed by co-lyophilization of
phospholipid and protein solutions or suspensions. A homogeneous solution of ApoA-I and lipid
(e.g., phospholipids) in an organic solvent or organic solvent mixture is lyophilized, and ApoA-I
lipid complexes are subsequently formed spontaneously by hydration of the lyophilized powder
in an aqueous buffer. Examples of organic solvents and solvent mixtures for use in this method
include, but are not limited to, acetic acid, an acetic acid/xylene mixture, an acetic
acid/cyclohexane mixture, and a methanol/xylene mixture.
[0308] An aliquot of the resulting reconstituted preparations can be characterized to confirm that
the complexes have the desired size distribution; e.g., the size distribution of HDL. An
exemplary method for characterizing the size is gel filtration chromatography. A series of
proteins of known molecular weight and Stokes' diameter, as well as human HDL, can be used
as standards to calibrate the column.
[0309] In other embodiments, recombinant ApoA-I-lipid complexes are made by complexing
ApoA-I with the lipids disclosed in U.S. patent publication no. 2006/0217312 and international
publication no. WO 2006/100567 (PCT/IB2006/000635), the disclosures of which are
incorporated herein by reference.
[0310] U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,925, 6,037,323, 6,046,166 and 6,287,590 (incorporated herein by
reference in their entireties) disclose a simple method for preparing negatively charged
lipoprotein complexes that have characteristics similar to HDL. This method, which involves
co-lyophilization of apolipoprotein and lipid solutions in organic solvent (or solvent mixtures)
and formation of negatively charged lipoprotein complexes during hydration of the lyophilized
powder, has the following advantages: (1) the method requires very few steps; (2) the method
uses inexpensive solvent(s); (3) most or all of the included ingredients are used to form the
designed complexes, thus avoiding waste of starting material that is common to the other
methods; (4) lyophilized complexes are formed that are very stable during storage such that the
resulting complexes may be reconstituted immediately before use; (5) the resulting complexes
usually need not be further purified after formation and before use; (6) toxic compounds,

including detergents such as cholate, are avoided; and (7) the production method can be easily
scaled up and is suitable for GMP manufacture (i.e., in an endotoxin-free environment).
[0311] Other suitable methods are described in US published application no. 2006/0217312 and
international publication WO 2006/100567 (PCT/IB 2006/000635), the disclosure of each of
which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0312] Preferably, to minimize oxidation of the protein and lipid components, one, more than
one or all steps of complex formation are carried out under an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, argon or
helium) blanket.
[0313] Protein and lipid concentration of apolipoprotein-lipid particles in solution can be
measured by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, protein and phospholipid
assays, chromatographic methods such as HPLC, gel filtration, GC coupled with various
detectors including mass spectrometry, UV or diode-array, fluorescent, elastic light scattering
and others. The integrity of lipid and proteins can be also determined by the same
chromatographic techniques as well as by peptide mapping, SDS-page gel electrophoresis, N
and C-terminal sequencing of ApoA-I, and standard assays for determining lipid oxidation.
         6.6.    Pharmaceutical Compositions
[0314] The pharmaceutical compositions contemplated by the disclosure comprise negatively
charged lipoprotein complexes as the active ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
suitable for administration and delivery in vivo. Since peptides may comprise acidic and/or basic
termini and/or side chains, peptide mimetic apolipoproteins can be included in the compositions
in either the form of free acids or bases, or in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
Modified proteins such as amidated, acylated, acetylated or pegylated proteins, may also be used.
Optionally, the pharmaceutical compositions can comprise lipoprotein complexes loaded with
one or more hydrophobic, lipophilic, or apolar active agents, as described above in Sections 6.2
and 6.3.
[0315] Injectable compositions include sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions of the active
ingredient in aqueous or oily vehicles. The compositions can also comprise formulating agents,
such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agent. In some embodiments, the injectable
composition comprises negatively charged lipoprotein complexes in phosphate buffered saline
                                                  -89-

      WO 2012/109162                                                         PCT/US2012/024020
(10 mM sodium phosphate, 80 mg/mL sucrose, pH 8.2). The compositions for injection can be
presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, and can comprise
added preservatives. For infusion, a composition can be supplied in an infusion bag made of
material compatible with negatively charged lipoprotein complexes, such as ethylene vinyl
acetate or any other compatible material known in the art.
[0316] Suitable dosage forms comprise negatively charged lipoprotein complexes at a final
concentration of about 5 mg/mL to about 15 mg/mL of lipoprotein. In a specific embodiment,
the dosage form comprises negatively charged lipoprotein complexes at a final concentration of
about 8 mg/mL to about 10 mg/mL Apolipoprotein A-I, preferably about 8 mg/mL.
[0317] Preferably, to minimize oxidation of the protein and lipid components, the
pharmaceutical compositions are formulated and/or filled under an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, argon
or helium) blanket.
        6.7.     Methods of Treatment
[0318] The lipoprotein complexes, e.g., negatively charged lipoprotein complexes, and
compositions described herein can be used for virtually every purpose lipoprotein complexes
have been shown to be useful. Lipoprotein complexes, such as negatively charged lipoprotein
complexes, are effective at mobilizing cholesterol, even when administered at doses significantly
lower than the amounts of apolipoprotein (20 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg per administration every 2 to
5 days, 1.4 g to 8 g per average sized human) required by currently available treatment regimens.
[0319] Consequently, the complexes and compositions of the present disclosure are particularly
useful to treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases, disorders, and/or associated conditions.
Methods of treating or preventing a cardiovascular disease, disorder, and/or associated condition
in a subject generally comprise administering to the subject a low (<15 mg/ kg) dose or amount
of a lipoprotein complex or pharmaceutical composition described herein according to a regimen
effective to treat or prevent the particular indication.
[0320] Lipoprotein complexes are administered in an amount sufficient or effective to provide a
therapeutic benefit. In the context of treating a cardiovascular disease, disorder, and/or
associated condition, a therapeutic benefit can be inferred if one or more of the following occurs:
an increase in cholesterol mobilization as compared to a baseline, a reduction in atherosclerotic
                                                  -90-

     WO 2012/109162                                                          PCT/US2012/024020
plaque volume, an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction of free cholesterol as
compared to a baseline level, without an increase in mean plasma triglyceride concentration or
an increase above normal range of liver transaminase (or alanine aminotransferase) levels. A
complete cure, while desirable, is not required for therapeutic benefit to exist.
[0321] In some embodiments, the lipoprotein complex is administered at a dose of about 2
mg/kg ApoA-I equivalents to about 12 mg/kg ApoA-I equivalents per injection. In some
embodiments, the lipoprotein complex is administered at a dose of about 3 mg/kg ApoA-I
equivalents. In some embodiments, the lipoprotein complex is administered at a dose of about 6
mg/kg ApoA-I equivalents. In some embodiments, the lipoprotein complex is administered at a
dose of about 12 mg/kg ApoA-I equivalents.
[0322] Subjects to be treated are individuals suffering from a preventing a cardiovascular
disease, disorder, and/or associated condition. Non-limiting examples of such cardiovascular
diseases, disorders and/or associated conditions that can be treated or prevented with the
lipoprotein complexes and compositions described herein include, peripheral vascular disease,
restenosis, atherosclerosis, and the myriad clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, such as, for
example, stroke, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, acute
coronary syndrome, angina pectoris, intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia, valve
stenosis, and atrial valve sclerosis. Subjects can be individuals with a prior incidence of acute
coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction (either with or without ST elevation) or
unstable angina. The subject treated may be any animal, for example, a mammal, particularly a
human.
[0323] In one embodiment, the methods encompass a method of treating or preventing a
cardiovascular disease, comprising administering to a subject a charged lipoprotein complex or
composition described herein in an amount that does not alter a patient's baseline ApoA-I
following administration.
[0324] In other embodiments, the methods encompass a method of treating or preventing a
cardiovascular disease, comprising administering to a subject a lipoprotein complex (e.g., a
charged complex) or composition described herein in an amount that is effective to achieve a
serum level of free or complexed apolipoprotein higher than a baseline (initial) level prior to
                                                 -91-

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
administration by about 5 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL approximately to two hours after administration
and/or by about 5 mg/dL to 20 mg/dL approximately 24 hours after administration.
[0325] In another embodiment, the methods encompass a method of treating or preventing a
cardiovascular disease, comprising administering to a subject a lipoprotein complex (e.g., a
charged complex) or composition described herein in an amount effective to achieve a
circulating plasma concentrations of a HDL-cholesterol fraction for at least one day following
administration that is at least about 10% higher than an initial HDL-cholesterol fraction prior to
administration.
[0326] In another embodiment, the methods encompass a method of treating or preventing a
cardiovascular disease, comprising administering to a subject a lipoprotein complex (e.g., a
charged complex) or composition described herein in an amount effective to achieve a
circulating plasma concentration of a HDL-cholesterol fraction that is between 30 and 300
mg/dL between 5 minutes and 1 day after administration.
[0327] In another embodiment, the methods encompass a method of treating or preventing a
cardiovascular disease, comprising administering to a subject a lipoprotein complex (e.g., a
charged complex) or composition described herein in an amount effective to achieve a
circulating plasma concentration of cholesteryl esters that is between 30 and 300 mg/dL between
5 minutes and 1 day after administration.
[0328] In still another embodiment, the methods encompasses a method at treating or protecting
a cardiovascular disease, comprising administering to a subject a lipoprotein complex (e.g., a
charged complex) or composition described herein in an amount effective to achieve an increase
in fecal cholesterol excretion for at least one day following administration that is at least about
10% above a baseline (initial) level prior to administration.
[0329] The lipoprotein complexes, including negatively charged lipoprotein complexes, or
compositions described herein can be used alone or in combination therapy with other drugs used
to treat or prevent the foregoing conditions. Such therapies include, but are not limited to
simultaneous or sequential administration of the drugs involved. For example, in the treatment
of hypercholesterolemia, such as familial hypercholesterolemia (homozygous or heterozygous)
or atherosclerosis, charged lipoprotein formulations can be administered with any one or more of
the cholesterol lowering therapies currently in use; e.g., bile-acid resins, niacin, statins, inhibitors
                                                 -92-

      WO 2012/109162                                                            PCT/US2012/024020
of cholesterol absorption and/or fibrates. Such a combined regimen may produce particularly
beneficial therapeutic effects since each drug acts on a different target in cholesterol synthesis
and transport; i.e., bile-acid resins affect cholesterol recycling, the chylomicron and LDL
population; niacin primarily affects the VLDL and LDL population; the statins inhibit cholesterol
synthesis, decreasing the LDL population (and perhaps increasing LDL receptor expression);
whereas the lipoprotein complexes, including negatively charged lipoprotein complexes,
described herein affect RCT, increase HDL, and promote cholesterol efflux.
[0330] In another embodiment, the lipoprotein complexes, including negatively charged
lipoprotein complexes, or compositions described herein may be used in conjunction with
fibrates to treat or prevent coronary heart disease; coronary artery disease; cardiovascular
disease, restenosis, vascular or perivascular diseases; atherosclerosis (including treatment and
prevention of atherosclerosis); Exemplary formulations and treatment regimens are described
below.
[0331] The lipoprotein complexes, including negatively charged lipoprotein complexes, or
compositions described herein can be administered in dosages that increase the small HDL
fraction, for example, the pre-beta, pre-gamma and pre-beta-like HDL fraction, the alpha HDL
fraction, the HDL3 and/or the HDL2 fraction. In some embodiments, the dosages are effective
to achieve atherosclerotic plaque reduction as measured by, for example, imaging techniques
such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Parameters to
follow by IVUS include, but are not limited to, change in percent atheroma volume from
baseline and change in total atheroma volume. Parameters to follow by MRI include, but are not
limited to, those for IVUS and lipid composition and calcification of the plaque.
[0332] The plaque regression could be measured using the patient as its own control (time zero
versus time t at the end of the last infusion, or within weeks after the last infusion, or within 3
months, 6 months, or 1 year after the start of therapy.
[0333] Administration can best be achieved by parenteral routes of administration, including
intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), intradermal, subcutaneous (SC), and intraperitoneal (IP)
injections. In certain embodiments, administration is by a perfusor, an infiltrator or a catheter.
In some embodiments, the lipoprotein complexes, e.g., negatively charged lipoprotein
complexes, are administered by injection, by a subcutaneously implantable pump or by a depot
                                                   -93-

     WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
preparation, in amounts that achieve a circulating serum concentration equal to that obtained
through parenteral administration. The complexes could also be absorbed in, for example, a
stent or other device.
[0334] Administration can be achieved through a variety of different treatment regimens. For
example, several intravenous injections can be administered periodically during a single day,
with the cumulative total volume of the injections not reaching the daily toxic dose. The
methods comprise administering the lipoprotein complex at an interval of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12
days. In some embodiments, the lipoprotein complex is administered at an interval of a week.
[0335] The methods can further comprise administering the lipoprotein complex 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, or 12 times at any of the intervals described above. For example, in one embodiment, the
lipoprotein complex is administered six times, with an interval of 1 week between each
administration. In some embodiments, administration could be done as a series of injections and
then stopped for 6 months to 1 year, and then another series started. Maintenance series of
injections could then be administered every year or every 3 to 5 years. The series of injections
could be done over a day (perfusion to maintain a specified plasma level of complexes), several
days (e.g., four injections over a period of eight days) or several weeks (e.g., four injections over
a period of four weeks), and then restarted after six months to a year. For chronic conditions,
administration could be carried out on an ongoing basis. Optionally, the methods can be
preceeded by an induction phase, when the lipoprotein complexes are administered more
frequently.
[0336] In yet another alternative, an escalating dose can be administered, starting with about 1 to
5 doses at a dose between (50-200 mg) per administration, then followed by repeated doses of
between 200 mg and 1 g per administration. Depending on the needs of the patient,
administration can be by slow infusion with a duration of more than one hour, by rapid infusion
of one hour or less, or by a single bolus injection.
[0337] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the various lipoprotein complexes can be determined
using standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell culture or experimental animals for determining
the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically
effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the
therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Lipoprotein complexes, such
                                                 -94-

     WO 2012/109162                                                               PCT/US2012/024020
as negatively charged lipoprotein complexes, that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.
Non-limiting examples of parameters that can be followed include liver function transaminases
(no more than 2X normal baseline levels). This is an indication that too much cholesterol is
brought to the liver and cannot assimilate such an amount. The effect on red blood cells could
also be monitored, as mobilization of cholesterol from red blood cells causes them to become
fragile, or affect their shape.
[0338] Patients can be treated from a few days to several weeks before a medical act (e.g.,
preventive treatment), or during or after a medical act. Administration can be concomitant to or
contemporaneous with another invasive therapy, such as, angioplasty, carotid ablation,
rotoblader or organ transplant (e.g., heart, kidney, liver, etc.).
[0339] In certain embodiments, negatively charged lipoprotein complexes are administered to a
patient whose cholesterol synthesis is controlled by a statin or a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor.
In other embodiments, negatively charged lipoprotein complexes are administered to a patient
undergoing treatment with a binding resin, e.g., a semi-synthetic resin such as cholestyramine, or
with a fiber, e.g., plant fiber, to trap bile salts and cholesterol, to increase bile acid excretion and
lower blood cholesterol concentrations.
         6.8.    Other Uses
[0340] The lipoprotein complexes, e.g., negatively charged lipoprotein complexes, and
compositions described herein can be used in assays in vitro to measure serum HDL, e.g., for
diagnostic purposes. Because ApoA-I, ApoA-II and Apo peptides associate with the HDL
component of serum, negatively charged lipoprotein complexes can be used as "markers" for the
HDL population, and the pre-betal and pre-beta2 HDL populations. Moreover, the negatively
charged lipoprotein complexes can be used as markers for the subpopulation of HDL that are
effective in RCT. To this end, negatively charged lipoprotein complexes can be added to or
mixed with a patient serum sample; after an appropriate incubation time, the HDL component
can be assayed by detecting the incorporated negatively charged lipoprotein complexes. This
can be accomplished using labeled negatively charged lipoprotein complexes (e.g., radiolabels,
fluorescent labels, enzyme labels, dyes, etc.), or by immunoassays using antibodies (or antibody
fragments) specific for negatively charged lipoprotein complexes.
                                                     -95-

[0341] Alternatively, labeled negatively charged lipoprotein complexes can be used in imaging
procedures (e.g., CAT scans, MRI scans) to visualize the circulatory system, or to monitor RCT,
or to visualize accumulation of HDL at fatty streaks, atherosclerotic lesions, and the like, where
the HDL should be active in cholesterol efflux.

        7.1.    Cloning and Expression of Human ApoA-I in Chinese Hamster Ovary
                (CHO) Cells
                7.1.1. Preparation of the ApoA-I Expression Vector
[0344] The preproApoA-I gene sequence was obtained from NCBI (P02647) and flanking
sequences were added for easy cloning and improved expression. The preproApoA-I encoding
DNA with the flanking sequences was synthesized and cloned into Bluescript KS+ vector. The
5' flanking sequence contained an optimized Kozak translation sequence. The preproApoA-I
insert was excised from the Bluescript KS+ vector with Hind III and Bgl II restriction enzymes.
This fragment was gel-purified and ligated into a retroviral expression vector bearing the
following genetic elements: human cytomegalovirus promoter fused to a Moloney Murine
Sarcoma virus 5' LTR, a MoMuLV/SV packaging region, the immediate-early simian
cytomegalovirus promoter, a multicloning site, the 3' LTR from MoMuLV, and a bacterial origin
of replication and beta-lactamase gene. Clones of the resulting construct were sequenced
through the gene and flanking regions. A final clone (clone #17) was selected based on
congruity to the predicted DNA sequence. Retrovector was then prepared for transduction using
293GP cells co-transfected with an expression plasmid for Vesicular Stomatitis Virus envelope
glycoprotein. Supernatant recovered from the co-transfected cells and concentrated was used for
the CHO-S transduction step described below in Section 7.1.2.

subjected to three rounds of transduction (1X, 2X, and 3X) using the retroviral vector described
above in Section 7.1.1. The pooled population was expanded for cryopreservation after each
transduction and a sample of cells was submitted for gene copy analysis. Gene copy index is
shown below in Table 2. The 3X transduced cell line was analyzed for productivity in a 16-day
fed batch test in duplication 125 mL flasks. The results are shown in Table 3.

                  7.1.3. Stability of cell line expressing ApoA-I
[0346] A non-GMP characterization study was conducted on CHO-S-ApoA-I-R (3X) clone, 17,
the master cell bank producing ApoA-I, in order to assess its stability in viability, growth rate,
conservation of the gene inserts, and consistent product secretion during long-term culture.
[0347] The cell line was thawed from the master cell bank and cultured in 125 mL shake flasks
using PF CHO LS medium (HyClone, Logan UT). The cells were continuously cultured by
serial passage from generation 0 to generation 43. At generations 4, 8, 14, 19, 25, 31, 36 and 43
samples of cells were frozen. At the end of the culturing, samples of cells from all generations
were thawed and used to conduct terminal culture runs to compare ApoA-I protein production of
the cell line at different generations in the same experiment. The supernatant from each of the
samples were tested at day 12 using reverse phase HPLC analysis to determine the level of
ApoA-I production. ApoA-I concentration was found to vary from 1259 mg/L to 1400 mg/L for
the various samples (FIG. 2).
[0348] To compare the stability of gene inserts, samples of the CHO cells at generations 0, 4, 14,
25, 36 and 43 were used for DNA isolation. The number of genetic inserts for each sample was
determined using real-time PCR on genomic DNA. As shown in Table 3, the PCR-based
indexes of copy number were not significantly different based on overlapping standard
deviations between generation 0 and generation 43. The production of ApoA-I and the gene
copy index values from the master cell bank cell line were found to be stable over the 43
generations tested.

                 7.2.1.  Scale Up To Innoculum And 200 L Bioreactor Production
[0349] A vial of CHO-S cells stably transfected with the human ApoA-I gene from the master
cell bank were thawed in a 37'C water bath and were added to a single shake flask (250 mL)
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 35 mL of HyQ PF-CHO LS cell culture medium. The
initial cell count, determined using a hemacytometer, was 2.48 x 105 cells/mL and 93.8%
viability. The culture was then placed on an Orbit shaker (90 rpm) within an incubator
maintained at 37'C in a humidified, 5% CO 2 environment. Subculture steps targeted inoculation
densities of approximately 1.6 x 105 cells/mL. The day 4 cell count and percent viability in the
flask was 15.01 x 105 cells/mL with 93.9% viability. The 250 mL flask was subcultured to 1 L
flask. The day 3 average viable cell count from the 1 L flask was 13.56 x 105 cells/mL with
95.3% viability. The 1 L flask was subcultured to a Wave Bioreactor System 20EH with a 10 L
disposable Wave Bag (GE Healthcare Bioscience Bioprocess Corp, Somerset, NJ) at an initial
culture volume and an initial target cell density of 1000 mL and 1.75 x 105 cells/mL,
respectively. The Wave Bioreactor operating settings were 37'C incubation temperature, 15.0
cpm rocker speed, 10.9' rocking angle, and 5.0% CO 2 concentration in the aeration gas with a
gas flow rate of 0.25 L/minute. After 3 days of culture, the viable cell density in the Wave Bag
was 10.73 x10 5 cells/mL, and fresh HyQ PF-CHO LS was added bringing the culture volume to
5000 mL. After an additional three days, the viable cell density was 13.25 x 105 cells/mL and
the volume in the Wave Bag was transferred to the 30 L bioreactor. The operating set-points in
the 30 L bioreactor for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, pressure, and agitation rate were
37'C, pH 7.0, 40% air saturation, 1 psig pressure, and 50 rpm agitation rate, respectively.
[0350] The viable cell density in the 30 L bioreactor was 10.80 x 105 cells/mL on day three of
culture, which was sufficient to inoculate the 200 L bioreactor at an initial target density of 2.40

x 10 5  cells/mL. The entire contents of the 30 L were transferred and the post inoculum weight,
cell density and viability were respectively 134.5 Kg, 2.37 x 105 cells/mL and 90.9%. The
operating set-points in the 200 L bioreactor for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, pressure, and
agitation rate were 37'C, pH 7.0, 40% air saturation, 1 psig pressure, and 35 rpm agitation rate,
respectively. On day 3, the cell density was 15.71    x 10 5 cells/mL, which was sufficient to add 60
L (v/v) of Complete Medium (AGT CD CHO 5X, Invitrogen) and 200 mM L-glutamine (final
concentration 10 mM) solution to the bioreactor. On days 8 and 12, the glucose level fell below
5 g/L which triggered an addition of 3 g/L of glucose (20%) solution. The viable cell density
peaked on day 9 at 33.20 x 105 cells/mL with a viability of 92.5%. The bioreactor was harvested
on day 13 at a cell viability of 78.5%. The cell counts and viability of the culture throughout the
culture period are shown in FIG. 3A and the ApoA-I concentration in the culture medium
throughout the culture period are shown in FIG. 3B.
                  7.2.2. Harvesting, Cell Separation And Storage Of Cells
[0351] Media from the bioreactor was harvested by passing the bioreactor contents through
double Cuno (Rutherford, NJ, USA) 60M02 Maximizer filters followed by a Millipore 0.22 gm
Opticap (Billercia, MA, USA) into a 200 L bag. The clarified media was then stored at 2-8'C
until the dispensing operation. The clarified media was filtered through a Millipore 0.22 gm
filter (Billerica, MA, USA) and dispensed into 2 L sterile PETG bottles (ThermoFisher, Marietta,
OH, USA) and then frozen at -20'C until released for shipment.

[0354] The ApoA-I containing flow-through from the anion-exchange column was pH adjusted
to 8.0 ± 0.2 with IM NaOH. The solution was then filtered through a 0.2 pim Planova 20N filter
(Asahi Kasei Medical) at a flow rate of about 12.5 L/h/m 2 to remove viruses and viral particles.
[0355] A Source 30 reverse phase chromatograpy column with a bed height of 25 cm was
washed with TAMP D buffer (20 mM ammonium carbonate, pH 9.5) until equilibrated, when the
column effluent reached pH 9.5. The ApoA-I containing filtrate from the virus filtration step
was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 2.8 cm/min. ApoA-I in the sample was adsorbed to
the matrix and eluted with a gradient of 35-50% acetonitrile in TAMP D buffer.
[0356] A reverse phase silica C18 column (300A 10pam) packed at a bed height of 25 cm was
washed in TAMP E buffer (100 mM ammonium carbonate, pH 9.5) until equilibrated, when the
column effluent reached pH 9.5. The C18 column was then loaded at 4.7 g ApoA-I/L of matrix.
The ApoA-I adsorbed to the column matrix was eluted in a 40-50% acetonitrile gradient in
TAMP E buffer.
[0357] Acetonitrile was removed from the ApoA-I containing fractions eluted from the C 18
column by pooling and concentrating the fractions approximately 2.5-fold and then diafiltering
the concentration against 15 volumes of TAMP C buffer (3 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8). The
pH of the diafiltered ApoA-I solution was decreasted to about 6.0 using dilute phosphoric acid
and then passed through a Mustang     Q anion exchange membrane (Pall Life       Sciences) to remove
DNA and host cell proteins.    The Mustang Q filtrate was diafiltered against    5 volumes of TAMP
C buffer.
[0358] The diafiltered filtrate was then subjected to a final ultrafiltration using a
polyethersulphone membrane (Filtron Omega series) with a 10,000 dalton molecular weight
cutoff so that the membrane retains the 28,000 dalton ApoA-I. The protein solution contained

[0360] proApoA-I: The protein proApoA-I was supplied by Unit6 de Biotechnologie, Institut
Meurice, Hte Ecole Lucia De Brouckere, 1 Avenue Emile Gryzon, B-1070 Anderlecht, Belgium
in lyophilized individual 100 mL flasks containing approximately 90 mg of protein. The batch
number was 20060202. The protein was kept at approximately 4'C until use. Before
lyophylization, the content of proApoA-I was 3.225 mg/mL with an urea content about 0.011
mg/mL. A solution of proApoA-I was made by dissolving approximately 630 mg of proApoA-I
in 25.6 mL of acetic acid/water 5%. The final concentration of the solution was 25 mg/mL.
[0361] ApoA-I: ApoA-I was prepared as described in Example 1 above.
[0362] Sphingomvelin: Sphingomyelin from egg (Coatsome@ NM-10) was supplied by NOF
Corporation, 1-56, Oohama-Cho, Amagasaki-Shi, 660-0095, Japan. The batch number was
0502ES1. Sphingomyelin was kept at approximately -20'C until use. The purity of
sphingomyelin was 99.10%. A solution of sphingomyelin was made by dissolving 799.4 mg of
purified sphingomyelin in 16 mL of acetic acid/water 5% to yield a final concentration of 50
mg/mL.
[0363] Phosphatidylglycerol: 1,2-dipalmitoyl-SN-glycero-3-phosphatidyl glycerol as sodium salt

        9.2.    Preparation Of Lipoprotein Complexes
[0365] The following lipoprotein complexes were prepared:
    (a) Neutral lipoprotein complexes:
             a. Formula A: proApoA-I and SM in a protein : phospholipid weight ratio of 1:2.5;
             b.  Formula B: proApoA-I and SM in a protein : phospholipid weight ratio of 1:2.7;
             c. Formula C: proApoA-I and SM in a protein : phospholipid weight ratio of 1:3.1;
             d. Formula D: proApoA-I, SM, and DPPC in a 1:2.7 lipoprotein wt: total
                phospholipid wt ratio with a SM: DPPC wt ratio of 50:50;
             e. Formula E: ApoA-I and SM in a protein : phospholipid weight ratio of 1:2.7.
    (b) Negatively charged lipoprotein complexes:
             a. Formula F: proApoA-I, SM, DPPC and DPPG in a 1:2.7 lipoprotein wt: total
                phospholipid wt ratio with a SM:DPPC:DPPG wt:wt ratio of 48:48:4;
             b. Formula G: proApoA-I, SM, DPPC and DPPG in a 1:2.7 lipoprotein wt: total
                phospholipid wt ratio with a SM:DPPC: DPPG wt:wt ratio of 73:23:4;
             c. Formula H: ApoAI, SM, and DPPG in a 1:2.7 lipoprotein wt: total phospholipid
                wt ratio with a SM: DPPG wt:wt ratio of 97:3;
             d. Formula I: ApoAI, SM, and DPPG in a 1:3.0 lipoprotein wt: total phospholipid wt
                ratio with a SM: DPPG wt:wt ratio of 97:3;
             e. Formula J: ApoAI, SM, and DPPG in a 1:3.3 lipoprotein wt: total phospholipid wt
                ratio with a SM: DPPG wt:wt ratio of 97:3;
        9.3.    Rate of Formation and Homogeneity of Lipoprotein Complexes
[0366] Formation of lipoprotein complexes of Formulas A through J was tested by injecting a
sample into a HPLC system to check for the size and distribution of lipoprotein complexes.
Complexes were produced by co-homogenization and sampled at the indicated times.
[0367] FIG. 5 shows exemplary HPLC chromatograms for neutral lipoprotein complexes
according to Formulas A through C comprising different lipoprotein:SM wt:wt ratios, and
Formula D comprising lipoprotein and neutral phospholipids in a 1:2.7 ratio, where the neutral
phospholipid is 50:50 SM:DPPC. The lipoprotein:SM wt:wt ratio of 1:2.7 was optimal.
Formula D, which contained a mix of SM and DPPC, showed poor complex formation.

      WO 2012/109162                                                        PCT/US2012/024020
[0368] Addition of phosphatidyl choline as a second neutral phospholipid resulted in slow and
incomplete complex formation. FIG. 6 shows HPLC chromatograms of lipoprotein complexes
of Formula D at 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes. In contrast, as shown in FIG. 7, Formula B rapidly
formed complexes.
[0369] Addition of a negatively charged phospholipid, DPPG, to SM and DPPC led to even less
complex formation, as shown in the FIG. 8 HPLC chromatograms of lipoprotein complexes of
Formula F at 20, 40, 60, and 120 minutes.
[0370] As shown in FIG. 9, lipoprotein complexes which contain only SM as a phospholipid, in
a protein to lipid weight ratio of 1:2.7 form more pre-B HDL complexes and do so faster than
lipoprotein complexes with the same protein to lipid weight ratio but that contain DPPC and/or
DPPG. Therefore, lipoprotein complexes comprising only SM as a neutral lipid form more
homogeneous lipoprotein complexes at a faster rate than complexes comprising DPPC in
addition to SM, with or without addition of DPPG.
[0371] Finally, negatively charged lipoprotein complexes comprising an apolipoprotein:
phospholipid weight ratio of between 1:2.7 and 1:3, in which the phospholipid fraction contains
SM and DPPG in a 97 to 3 weight ratio showed optimal homogeneity and no free lipid peak, as
compared to complexes comprising an apolipoprotein: phospholipid weight ratio of 1:3.3 and
uncharged lipoprotein complexes. See FIG. 10, showing HPLC chromatograms for Formulae E,
H, I, and J. Lipoprotein complexes according to Formulae B and H were chosen for further
study in animals (Example 6) and, based on the results of the animal studies, lipoprotein
complexes of Formula H were chosen for clinical assessment in human patients (Examples 6 and
8).

        THERMAL CYCLING-BASED METHODS
        10.1.    Overview of Procedure for Making ApoA-I/DPPG/Sphingomyelin
Complexes
[0372] Frozen ApoA-I solution in phosphate buffer (pH 7-9) at a protein concentration of 1 to 30
mg/ml, typically 5 to 20 mg/ml, is prepared by thawing for approximately 24-96 hrs at 2-8'C and
weighed. Sodium monobasic phosphate and sodium dibasic phosphate are added to the ApoA-I
solution to obtain a final peptide concentration of 10 mM in pH 7.4 buffer.

[0373] DPPG solution is prepared by warming phosphate buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH
8.0) to a target of 50'C. DPPG powder (NOF Corporation) is thawed at ambient temperature for
at least 1.5 hrs and then weighed and added to the buffer container. The DPPG is then dispersed
at temperature of 50'C using an ULTRA-TURRAX@ high-performance disperser (IKA@
Works, Inc.). After dispersion, the DPPG suspension and ApoA-I solution are heated to 57'C.
They are combined and heated at 57'C for 30 minutes under nitrogen. This pre-complex
solution is cooled to room temperature.
[0374] Sphingomyelin (SM) powder (NOF Corporation) is thawed at ambient temperature then
weighed into a glass tank. The phosphate phosphate buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0)
is heated to 50'C combined with the SM powder for a SM concentration of 220 mg/ml. The SM
powder is dispersed in suspension using an ULTRA-TURRAX@ and the dispersion is cooled to
4'C and then passed through the homogenizer. The SM particles are monitored by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) to 55 to 70 nm zeta (Z) average size (using an intensity measurement). This
can be achieved, e.g., using a Nano DeBee homogenizer at 32000 +/- 3000 bars, with the
temperature at the inlet at 10-18 0 C and temperature at the outlet preferably at 30-400 C (and not
exceeding 59'C), resulting in a particle with Z-average size of 58 nm.
[0375] For complexation, the ApoA-I/DPPG mixture and the SM dispersion are warmed
separately to 57'C. The warmed SM dispersion is added to the ApoA-I/DPPG mixture with an
initial temperature set point of 57'C. After stirring to combine, the solution is cooled to 37'C
and then carried through a series of thermal cycles (57'C to 37C) in order to form ApoA
I/DPPG/SM complexes. This heat-cool process is continued with a contact time between
temperatures is from 5 minutes and 30 minutes. The heat-cool cycles are repeated until the
majority of the protein component is incorporated into lipoprotein complexes. The size and
distribution of complexes during thermocycling is monitored by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC).
[0376] ApoA-I/ DPPG/SM complexes were made according to the procedure described above
(and illustrated in FIG. 11). The ApoA-I protein had an amino acid sequence corresponding to
positions 25 to 267 of the sequence depicted in FIG. 1. The complexes contain sphingomyelin
(SM), and 1, 2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(l'-rac-glycerol)
(Dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol or DPPG) in a 97:3 weight ratio. The ratio of ApoA-I protein

to-total lipids is 1:2.7 weight/weight (w/w) which is equivalent to a molar ratio of 1:108. The
combined lipid and protein components were cycled between 57'C and 37'C for 5 minutes at
each temperature using a heat exchanger arranged as depicted in FIG. 5, which includes on the
left a Lauda Ecoline Star edition Type 26LE water bath (in which the sample is thermally cycled)
and on the right a shell & tube heat exchanger (model EF-C50-HE), which has an 18-ml hold
volume, connected by a peristaltic pump.
[0377] 180 mg of DPPG was added to 2.82 grams of 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0. The
suspension was dispersed with an ULTRA-TURRAX@ disperser for 10 minutes at 50'C. 22
grams of SM powder were combined with 78 grams of 10mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0. The
suspension was dispersed with an ULTRA-TURRAX@ disperser for 20 to 40 minutes at 50'C.
The SM was homogenized using a NanoBEE set to an average particle size of 60 nm. The
DPPG, SM and protein were brought to 57 0 C. 18 mgs (0.3 ml) of DPPG were added to 214 mg
of ApoA-I protein in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 57 0 C. After 30 minutes at 57 0 C, 559
mg of SM particles (2.54 ml) were added. This solution was then subjected to thermal cyling to
form a complex.
[0378] Gel permeation chromatography showing ApoA-I/DPPG/SM complex formation after
thermocycling for 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 180 minutes and 210 minutes is shown
in FIGS. 13A-13E, respectively. A more compact complex is produced with increasing cycle
time, as shown by the increasing sharpness of the major GPC peak. The peak corresponding to
uncomplexed protein also disappears over time.
         10.2.   Formation of ApoA-I/Sphingomyelin Complexes
[0379] ApoA-I/ SM complexes were made according to the procedure described above, but
without pre-complexing ApoA-I with DPPG. The protein component was 5 ml of ApoA-I at a
concentration of 8.9 mg/ml and the lipid component was 0.5 ml egg sphingomyelin (220 mg/ml)
which had been suspended in 10mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and homogenized to form lipid
particles of 60 nm. The protein and lipid components were mixed at 50'C at a ratio of 1:2.5,
wt:wt. The resulting suspension was subject to thermal cycling for 18 hours (108 cycles and
cycling time of 10 minutes) using a thermal cycling apparatus as depicted in FIG. 5. Gel
permeation chromatography shows that the protein/lipid complex formed is essentially
homogeneous (see GPC chromatogram of FIG. 14).

         10.3.  Formation of ApoA-I/DPPG/N-palmitoyl-4-hydroxysphinganine-1
                phosphocholine (phytosphingomyelin) Complexes
[0380] ApoA-I/ DPPG/phytosphingomyelin complexes were made according to the procedure
described above. The phytosphingomyelin particles were homogenized to a size of about 183
nm (measured by DLS) and added to the 7.8g/L protein:DPPG mixture to achieve a final protein
to lipid (SM and DPPG) ratio of 1:2.7. The suspension containing N-palmitoyl-4
hydroxysphinganine- 1-phosphocholine (phyto-sphingomyelin) and a protein:DPPG component
was thermally cycled for six cycles of 10 minutes at 37 0C and 10 minutes at 57 0 C, over a total of
two hours. Gel permeation chromatography shows that the protein/lipid complex formed is
essentially homogeneous (see GPC chromatogram of FIG. 15).
         10.4.  Formation of ApoA-I/DPPG/ synthetic palmitoyl sphingomyelin
[0381] ApoA-I/DPPG/synthetic palmitoyl sphingomyelin complexes were made as follows. An
8.8 mL solution of synthetic palmitoyl sphingomyelin (220 mg/ml) in 10mM phosphate buffer
pH 7.4 was mixed until a particle size of 3300 nm was reached. ApoA-I (945 mg at 14mg/ml)
was combined with 0.03% DPPG (60mg/ml) by weight and heated at 50'C for 30 minutes. The
synthetic palmitoyl sphingomyelin micelles were combined with the protein/DPPG complex at
an apolipoprotein : phospholipid weight ratio of 1:2.7. The suspension of protein and lipid was
thermally cycled with heat-cool cycles at 37'C and 57'C alternatively every ten minutes for a
total of 240 minutes or until the appropriate distribution of the particle size is attained. The size
and distribution of complexes during thermocycling was monitored by GPC. After complexation
the concentration was brought to 8.0 mg ApoA-I/ml, then sucrose (40mg/ml) and mannitol
(20mg/ml) were added to the complex for isotonicity. The lipoprotein complexes were assayed
by GPC and found to be essentially homogenous (see GPC chromatogram of FIG. 16).
         10.5.  Formation of ApoA-I/DPPG/ phytosphingomyelin
[0382] ApoA-I/DPPG/phytosphingomyelin complexes were made as follows. A 2.0 mL solution
of phytosphingomyelin (220 mg/ml) in 10mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was dispersed in an
ULTRA-TURRAX@ for 40 minutes at 50'C until a particle size of 990 nm was reached. ApoA
I (15.6 mg at a concentration of 7.8 mg/ml) was combined with 0.03 % DPPG (60mg/ml) by
weight and heated at 57'C for 30 minutes. The phytosphingomyelin solution was combined with
the protein/DPPG mixture at an apolipoprotein : phospholipid weight ratio of 1:2.7. The

suspension of protein and lipid was then thermally cycled with heat-cool cycles at 37'C and
57'C alternatively every ten minutes for a total of 240 minutes or until the appropriate
distribution of the particle size was attained. The population of lipoprotein complexes was
measured by GPC and found to be about 92.6% homogeneous (see GPC chromatogram in FIG.
17).
        10.6.   Complex Formation With An ApoA-I Peptide
[0383] Complexes of ApoA-I peptide, DPPG and sphingomyelin were generated as described
above (see Section 10.1), using an ApoA-I peptide (H-Lys-Leu-Lys-Gln-Lys 5 -Leu-Ala-Glu-Leu
           10                                            20          2
Leu -Glu-Asn-Leu-Leu-Glu          -Arg-Phe-Leu-Asp-Leu      -Val-Inp -OH; SEQ ID NO:4) solution.
The phospholipid component consists of egg sphingomyelin (SM), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3
phosphocholine (Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3
[phospho-rac-( 1-glycerol)] (Dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-glycerol, DPPG) in a 48.5:48.5:3 weight
ratio. The ratio of peptide to total phospholipids complex is 1:2.5 (w/w). The drug complex is a
solution of the CER-522 complex in phosphate buffered saline (12 mM sodium phosphate, 130
mM sodium chloride, pH 8.2). The complex was formed by subjecting the starting solution to
thermal cycling between 50'C and 37'C for two hours, flow rate of 1 ml/min.
[0384] Gel permeation chromatography shows that the protein/lipid complex formed is
essentially homogeneous, with a vast majority of the protein having been incorporated into
lipoprotein complexes (see GPC chromatogram of FIG. 18).
        10.7.   Effect of Lipid Particle Size and Number of Thermal Cycles On Complex
                Formation
[0385] The effect of lipid particle size and the number of thermal cycles on particle size was
studies. Preparations of four different starting lipid particle sizes (with zeta averages of 85 nm,
77 nm, 66 nm, and 60 nm) (FIGS. 19A through 19D, respectively) were generated by passing
SM solutions through the NanoBEE in single passes. Each pass was analyzed for its zeta
average. The lipid particle size decreased with each pass and the lipid particles were collected
when the desired size was achieved. The four different lipid particle sizes were tested in the
complex formation method of Section 10.1, for five or seven cycles of 3 minutes at 37'C and 10
minutes at 57'C.
                                                -108-

      WO 2012/109162                                                           PCT/US2012/024020
[0386] When the lipid component is mixed with the protein component, the resulting suspension
is cloudy. The cloudiness is reduced, and the solution becomes more transparent, as complexes
are formed.
[0387] After five cycles, the suspension of complexes produced from 60 nm lipid particles was
the most transparent. GPC chromatograms (FIGS. 20A through 20D) show complete or almost
complete complexation in all samples, as evidenced by the homogeneity of major peak. When
starting with 66 nm lipid particles, there was no uncomplexed protein detectable by GPC in the
resulting suspension of lipoprotein complexes, indicating that all the protein was complexed with
lipid after five cycles, and the resulting complexes were 98% pure. After seven cycles, all four
suspensions became more transparent, showing an even greater extent of complexation. The
suspension made using 60 nm lipid particles appeared the clearest.
[0388] In a separate study, SM particles of 450 nm and 40 nm were complexed with ApoA-I and
DPPG using the method described in Section 10.1. Most, but not all, ApoA-I was incorporated
into lipoprotein complexes using 450 nm SM particles as the lipid component, as shown in the
GPC chromatogram of FIG. 21A (the 9.8 minute peak). A much smaller fraction of ApoA-I was
incorporated into lipoprotein complexes using 40 nm SM particles as the lipid component, as
shown in the GPC chromatogram of FIG. 21B (the 9.551 minute peak).
         10.8.    Effect of Starting Temperature on Complex Formation
[0389] The effect of the initial thermal cycling temperature on complex formation was studied.
ApoA-I/DPPG/SM complexes were generated described in Section 10.1, except that the lipid
component and the protein component were warmed to, and combined at, 37'C instead of 57'C.
A GPC chromatogram of the resulting complex is shown in FIG. 22. Substantially less of the
protein component was incorporated into lipoprotein complexes than when thermal cycling was
initiated at 57 0 C, as evidenced by the relatively large protein peak (eluting 9.455 minutes in FIG.
22).
         10.9.    Commercial Production of Lipoprotein Complexes Using Thermal Cycling
                  Methods
[0390] For large scale commercial manufacturing, the methods of the disclosure can be scaled up
and optionally combined with a formulation step. A commercial embodiment is depicted in FIG.
23. In this embodiment, following the thermocycling steps, the lipoprotein complex is diluted,

mixed with one or more isotonicity agents (e.g., sucrose and/or mannitol), filtered, and aliquoted
into vials. The contents of the vials can be freeze-dried to prolong shelf-life of the resulting
formulation.
[0391] ApoA-I/DPPG/SM complexes described in Section 10.1 were produced on a 20-liter
scale using DaBEE2000. This complexes were diluted with phosphate buffer (pH 7-8) and
mixed with sucrose and mannitol to a final formulation containing phosphate buffer 10mM pH
7.4, 8 mg/ml ApoA-I, 4% (w/w) sucrose and 2% (w/w) mannitol.
         10.10. Comparison of Lipoprotein Complexes Made By Thermal Cycling vs. Co
                Homogenization
[0392] ApoA-I/DPPG/SM complexes made by the thermal cycling methods disclosed herein
were compared to complexes made by co-homogenization of the lipid and protein components.
The purity of the complexes made by thermal cycling was improved to 97% compared to the co
homogenization as measured by gel permeation chromatography. Using SDS-PAGE, the
complex made by thermal cycling has an increased main band purity of 98% with less truncated
protein bands present as compared to co-homogenized complexes.
[0393] Oxidation of the ApoA-I is also reduced by the thermal cycling process as compared to
co-homogenization. RP-HPLC (C 18) shows two oxidation peaks at RT 0.93 and 0.99 in the co
homogenized complexes that are not present in the thermal cycling process. The peptide map
also shows a reduction in the oxidation of methionine of ApoA-I at Met 112 and Met 148 in the
complexes produced by thermal cycling as compared to the complexes produced by co
homogenization.
[0394] A summary of the data is presented in Table 5 below.

         10.11. Use of Inert Gas In Manufacturing Methods
[0395] ApoA-I is a delicate protein that is susceptible to chemical instability (e.g., oxidation).
To enhance the stability of ApoA-I in ApoA-I/SM/DPPC-containing pharmaceutical
compositions, the pharmaceutical compositions were prepared (including the thermal cycling,
filling and finishing steps) under an atmosphere of nitrogen, an inert gas. Below are the
results of studies comparing ApoA-I/SM/DPPC complexes made by co-homogenization and
ApoA-I/SM/DPPC complexes made by thermal cycling under nitrogen.

11.      EXAMPLE 5: IN VITRO CHOLESTEROL EFFLUX STUDIES
[0396] The biological activity of ApoA-I-lipid complexes was studied in Fu5AH rat
hepatoma cells, measuring ABCA 1-mediated cholesterol efflux.

[0397] The Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells have high expression of the scavenger receptor class B
type I (SRB 1), which facilitate the bidirectional flux of cholesterol between the cells and
mature HDL. This model provides a specific assay for HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux
activity. The assay was performed using a method described by Mweva et al., 2006,
"Comparison of different cellular models measuring in vitro the whole human serum
cholesterol efflux capacity," Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 36, 552-559. Fu5AH cells were labeled with
3H-cholesterol  for 24 hours. Acceptor media for efflux were prepared for each test sample
(ApoA-I/DPPG/palmitoyl SM, ApoA-I/DPPG/egg SM, or ApoA-I/DPPG/phytoSM at 30, 20
and 10 pg/ml, diluted with MEM buffered with 25 mM HEPES) and for the control samples
(ApoA-I purified from human plasma (20 pg/mL), HDL 3, 2% human serum, medium alone).
Acceptor medium containing test or control samples was added to the cells for 4 hours and
cholesterol was measured in efflux media and cell monolayers to determine the percent of
cholesterol released from the Fu5AH cells. Biological activity of the test samples was
calculated and is expressed as percent of cholesterol efflux relative to a Reference Standard
of Formula H described above at the same concentration as the lipoprotein complex in the
test sample, which served as a positive experimental control. Results are shown below in
Table 7, and demonstrate that the lipoprotein complexes tested have significant biological
activity as measured in the cholesterol efflux assay.

12.     EXAMPLE 6: PHARMACODYNAMIC STUDY OF SINGLE, LOW DOSE
        ADMINISTRATION OF FORMULA B AND FORMULA H COMPLEXES IN
        RABBITS
[0398] Normal rabbits received a single injection of: (a) a 5 mg/kg dose of a preparation of
Formula B (neutral lipoprotein complexes containing ApoA-I and SM in a 1:2.7
apolipoprotein: phospholipid weight ratio); (b) a 5 mg/kg dose of a preparation of Formula H
(negatively charged lipoprotein complexes containng ApoA-I, SM, and DPPG in a 1:2.7
apolipoprotein: phospholipid weight ratio and a 97:3 SM : DPPG weight ratio); or (c) a

control preparation, containing the diluent for the lipoprotein complex preparations. Four
rabbits were tested with each of Formula B, Formula H and control.
[0399] Plasma levels of VLDL total cholesterol and triglycerides over time are shown in
FIGS. 24 and 25. Plasma VLDL total cholesterol levels increased less and returned to
baseline faster in the animals treated with Formula H (ApoA-I/DPPG/SM complexes) (b),
than the levels in animals treated with Formula B (lipoprotein complexes of ApoA-I and
SM). A similar effect was seen for triglyceride levels. This study showed that the transient
elevation in these levels was of shorter duration with ApoA-I/DPPG/SM complexes
complexes than with neutral lipoprotein complexes. This result is consistent with the results
of a Phase I study of the lipoprotein complexes of Formula H in human subjects (described in
Example 8 below).
13.      EXAMPLE 7: COMPARATIVE PHARMACODYNAMIC STUDIES OF EGG
         SM AND SYNTHETIC PALMITOYL SM
[0400] The pharmacodynamic effect of Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I)/egg SM and ApoA
I/synthetic palmitoylSM lipoprotein complexes intravenously injected into rabbits was
studied. Following injection of the lipoprotein complexes, changes in plasma lipid and
lipoprotein levels were measured.
[0401] Lipoprotein complexes of either ApoA-I/egg SM or ApoA-I/synthetic SM were
administered to rabbits at doses of 5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg by intravenous infusion into the ear
vein, at a rate of 1 mL/min. 4 animals per group were studied. Plasma samples were taken
before dosing, immediately following the end of the infusion, and 30min, 45min, 1h, 2h, 4h,
6h, 8h, 10h and 30h after the initiation of the infusion. Plasma samples were then analyzed
using commercial enzymatic kits for total cholesterol, unesterified cholesterol, phospholipids
and total triglycerides. ApoA1 was assayed in plasma samples using commercial ELISA kits.
The plasma samples were analyzed by GPC to determine total and unesterified cholesterol
profiles. For the 5 mg/kg dose treatments, the results were quantified based on the percent of
the total area under the curve for the chromatogram trace.
[0402] FIG.26A-26D show the plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and
apoA-I over time in rabbits infused with 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of either ApoA-I/egg SM or
ApoA-I/synthetic SM. Rapid and significant cholesterol mobilization was observed within
30 minutes after initiation of infusions at both doses administered: Cholesterol mobilization
peaked at 30 minutes after administration for the 5 mg/kg dose, and a large increase in
                                               -114-

cholesterol mobilization was observed at the 20 mg/kg dose. At each dose tested, both
formulations had similar profiles for plasma triglycerides, plasma phospholipids and plasma
recombinant human apoA-I.
[0403] FIG. 27A-27C show the plasma HDL-total cholesterol levels, plasma LDL-total
cholesterol levels, and plasma VLDL- total cholesterol levels. The increase of HDL-total
cholesterol for ApoA-I/egg SM and ApoA-I/synthetic SM was similar (FIG. 27A). There
was little variation in plasma LDL-C and VLDL-C levels, and the levels were not
substantially altered by injection of lipoprotein complexes of either formulation (FIG. 27B
27C).
[0404] The results of this study show that ApoA-I/egg SM and ApoA-I/synthetic SM
lipoprotein complexes elicit similar responses in vivo.

         HEALTHY DYSLIDEMIC SUBJECTS
         14.1.   Materials and Methods
[0405] A Phase I clinical trial was conducted with lipoprotein complexes of Formula H as a
randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over, single rising-dose study in healthy
volunteers with an LDL/HDL ratio greater than 3.0. The objectives of this Phase I study
were to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a
negatively charged lipoprotein complex when administered as a single dose. Escalating
doses of 0.25, 0.75, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 30.0 and 45.0 mg/kg were studied. Subjects received
by infusion a sterile solution containing lipoprotein complexes of ApoA-I (prepared as
described in Example 1), SM and DPPG (in protein: lipid weight ratio of 1:2.7 and lipid
composition of 97% SM      /3%  DPPG (w/w)) that had been made by co-homogenization of the
protein and lipid components. The sterile solution was a 10 mM phosphate buffered solution
of pH 8.0 containing mannitol and sucrose (4% (w/w) sucrose, 2% (w/w) mannitol) in
addition to the lipoprotein complexes.

        14.3.    Conclusions
[0415] This Phase I study, which administered a preparation of a sterile solution comprising a
negatively charged lipoprotein complex of Formula H in single IV doses of 0.25, 0.75 2.0,
5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 30.0 and 45.0 mg/kg, resulted in the following conclusions.
[0416] The preparation was well-tolerated at all doses in all subjects with an adverse event
profile similar to that observed with placebo. The complex does not appear to affect clinical
chemistry, hematology or coagulation parameters differently from placebo. No adverse
effects on ECGs were observed. No antibodies to ApoA-I were detected following single
dose administration.
[0417] Plasma concentrations of ApoA-I and sphingomyelin increased with dose: ApoA-I
levels returned to baseline by 24 hours post-dose for doses up to 10 mg/kg and by 72 hours
post-dose for doses above 10 mg/kg. Sphingomyelin levels returned to baseline by 24 hours
post-dose for doses up to 5 mg/kg, by 72 hours post-dose for doses from 10 to 30 mg/kg, and
by 7 days post-dose for subjects dosed with 45 mg/kg.
[0418] Cholesterol mobilization increased with increasing doses: Mobilization in the HDL
fraction of free cholesterol was seen with doses as low as 2.0 mg/kg (mean 23% increase
from baseline) and increased with dose. Triglyceride levels were transiently increased above
levels seen with placebo at doses of 15 mg/kg and above.
[0419] In addition, administration of the complex did not significantly raise liver
transaminase levels, and in all cases, the levels remained well within the normal range. This
is in contrast to CSL-1 11, a reconstituted purified human ApoA-I from plasma complexed
with soybean phosphtidylcholine, which has been seen to raise alanine amino-transferase
levels up to more than 100-fold the upper normal limit in some patients, when administered at
a dose of 80 mg/kg of patient weight. Tardif et al., 2007, JAMA 297:1675-1682.
[0420] Thus, the complexes of the disclosure can be administered at doses lower than those
reported for other preparations that mimic HDL and still achieve clinically meaningful
improvements in lipid parameters without detrimental side effects.
15.     EXAMPLE 9: PHASE II CLINICAL STUDY OF APOA-I/SM/DPPG
        COMPLEXES IN THE TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS WITH ACUTE
        CORONARY SYNDROME
[0421] A clinical trial is conducted to further confirm the therapeutic benefit of low doses of
negatively charged lipoprotein complexes of Formula H (ApoA-I, egg-sphingomyelin (egg

SM), and DPPG, in an apolipoprotein : phospholipid weight ratio of 1:2.7, with an egg-SM to
DPPG weight ratio of 97:3) in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The ApoA-I is
prepared by expression in CHO cells as described above in Examples 1, and the complexes
are generated by the thermocycling methods of Example 4.
[0422] Subjects presenting with symptoms of ACS are eligible to be screened for this study.
At the time of baseline catheterization, subjects need to have an adequate intravascular
ultrasound (IVUS) evaluation of one "target" artery for IVUS which is not influenced by
prior or present PCI, and the proximal 4 cm of the target artery should have a diameter
stenosis between 0 and 50% by visual angiographic assessment, a reference diameter >2.5
mm and be free of filling defects suggestive of thrombus. Once the baseline IVUS has been
evaluated by the IVUS Core Laboratory for overall quality, the presence of a suitable target
vessel and the absence of technical factors which can preclude accurate reading of the IVUS
images, the subject is randomized to receive an intravenous infusion, given over one hour, of
placebo or one of three doses of the complexes (3, 6, or 12 mg/kg). Randomized subjects
return at weekly intervals (i.e., every 7 to 11 days) for five additional infusions.
End-of-treatment labs are drawn one week (5 to 9 days) after the last infusion. A follow-up
IVUS is conducted approximately 3 weeks (14 to 35 days) after the last infusion. A follow
up visit occurs approximately 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) after the last infusion to collect samples
for Anti-ApoAl antibody testing and to monitor for major adverse cardiac event (MACE)
endpoints.
[0423] The primary endpoint is the nominal change in total plaque volume in a 30 mm
segment of the target coronary artery assessed by three-dimensional IVUS. Other efficacy
measurements include the percent change in plaque volume and the change in percent
atheroma volume in the target 30 mm segment, the change in total vessel volume in the target
30 mm segment, as well as changes in plaque, lumen and total vessel volumes from baseline
to follow-up in anatomically comparable 5 mm segments centered on the site with the
smallest plaque burden at baseline, and the largest plaque burden at baseline on three
dimensional IVUS. The percent change in plaque volume is calculated as the nominal
change divided by the baseline value, multiplied by 100. Percent atheroma (obstructive)
volume is computed by dividing plaque volume by elastic external membrane (EEM) volume
and then multiplying by 100.
