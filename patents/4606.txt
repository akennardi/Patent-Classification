                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
                                              OVERVIEW
15          The packaging of medical catheters                                is required to be
   sterile        and        fully       biocompatible.                     In      addition,             the
   packaging         has       to    protect        the        catheter          from        any      undue
   bending       or    twisting,          as   these         could      damage         the      physical
   integrity         of      the     catheter,           and      consequently               prevent          a
20 successful          insertion          of  the        catheter          into      a    lumen        in     a
   patient's body.
            In   developing            new   catheters,             a    so-called            first-in
   man      study,        for       example,        requires            that        the       prototype
   catheter        be    packaged         in    fully        biocompatible               and      sterile
25 packaging, which will also afford the catheter mechanical
   protection.              If     the   prototype            does     not      fit      in     existing
   catheter packaging, new packaging has                                  to be developed for
   the     prototype.             This     kind     of     customization,                however,           is
   both       expensive           and     time      consuming,              and       will        not       in

   general        comply with the budgetary constraints or timeline
   of    a    catheter          development            project.                Consequently,              using
   only existing packaging designs                                limits the innovation and
   development            of    novel       catheters            to   prototypes            that      fit       in
 5 the existing packaging.

   sterilizable               and       stiff       material,         such       as        polystyrene,
   polyethylene                   terephthalate                  (PET)          or         polyethylene
   terephthalate                       glycol-modified                     (PETG),              providing
   mechanical              support           and     protection          to     a    catheter         to    be
15 secured          in     the     tray         (the positioning              of    the     catheter        is
   described             in     Fig.         4) .       Catheter          tray      10     comprises          a
   bottom         12    and a        raised        edge     14.     Holes        16 are       perforated
   in a matrix through bottom 12 to provide for securing the
   catheter.               On   a     part       of   bottom 12         is    located        a   ramp     18,
20 which protrudes above bottom 12.                                  Ramp 18 may be utilized
   to     raise        the     distal          end    of   the    catheter          above      bottom       12
   to     a predetermined height.                           Holes     20 are        perforated in a
   matrix          through           an      inclined         surface         21     of     ramp      18    to
   provide             for      securing             the       catheter.                A    matrix         of
25 indentations 22,                    for instance of hemispherical shape,                               are
   provided            in     bottom           12,    interspersed             between         holes      16.
   Indentations                22       reduce        the       contact         area       between        the
   catheter             and      bottom           12    and      reduce         the       contact        area
   between          the     underside             of   catheter        tray       10    and that         upon

   which         it     lies          (such         as       the      sterile           pouch).                 The
   interspersed hemispheres                          also offset the pouch so that it
   does      not      make       contact          with         or   become         entangled             in    the
   twisted ties that loop through the backside.                                               Fig. 2 is a
 5 schematic           cross-section                 30      of     catheter          tray         10,      taken
   along a plane              II-II of the tray.
            Fig.         3       is        a       schematic              illustration                  of       an
   identification               scheme         40    of     holes       16,     in    accordance              with
   an    embodiment of              the invention.                   Identification scheme 40
10 shows         a    section           42      of      bottom         12,       with        the        section
   comprising           holes       16     and      indentations              22.       Identification
   scheme         40   comprises            labeling           the     columns         of     holes         16   by
   consecutive             letters           of     the        alphabet,           and      the        rows      of
   holes        16    by     consecutive               integers.           The      resulting             labels
15 are      unique        identifiers               of     the      holes        and      are       typically
   printed          adjacent        to     their        respective           holes        on     bottom         12.
   Thus      the      address          of      a    selected           hole       16    is      given,          for
   example,          as   D4,     indicating              that      the    hole       can     be      found       in
   column         D   and      row      4.        Alternatively,                 other        schemes           for
20 addressing or identifying the holes may be used.
            A       set      of        packaging               instructions               is        typically
   provided          for packaging               a    specific          catheter          in     a    catheter
   tray         10.           These          packaging              instructions                would          use
   identification                 scheme           40      for       tying         down        a      specific
25 catheter          to    a   specific           hole.          The packaging               instructions
   would       read,       for instance,                "Use      a   length        of    2"     of the        tie
   material between holes D3 and F3."
            The      tie material typically comprises                                  stainless            steel
   wire      coated        with       polytetrafluoroethylene                         (PTFE)         or     other
30 polymer.             The      metal         core        material          is     typically              at    an

            3456145vl

   annealed          temper         to     ensure         that      a    twisted          tie      does      not
   unwrap.            The      tie     material           may     be      provided           in    a   spool,
   from which the required lengths of ties are                                            cut according
   to    the      packaging            instructions.                  Alternatively,                 the     tie
 5 material          is    provided           in    pre-cut          lengths,          from which            the
   required          lengths         are     selected           according           to   the      packaging
   instructions.
             An     alternative              embodiment            comprises            elastic         bands
   instead of,             or in addition to, the coated stainless                                       steel
10 wire ties.              The elastic bands are typically made                                     of latex
   or rubber.
