   SPEEDY MICRONIZATION ALIMENTAL REFINING TECHNOLOGY (SMART)
                                           SYSTEM
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      1. Technical Field
    [0002]       The present disclosure relates to natural ingredient production systems and,
more particularly, to a speedy micronization alimental refining technology (SMART)
system.
[0003]     2. Description of Related Art
    [0004]       It is desirable to make different types of products from plant-based raw
materials. To this end, prior art discloses making powdered nutritional supplements from
plant-based raw materials under an external force, for example, by grinding, stamping, and
the like. However, the powdered nutritional supplements thus produced during the
production process thereof are also subjected to the external force and thereby gather into a
mass. As a result, the products contain particles with large particle diameters. Therefore, the
products, i.e., the powdered nutritional supplements, produced according to the prior art
differ in particle diameters and thus deteriorate user experience - the products have unstable
quality and are unsafe to consume. Unsurprisingly, consumers are reluctant to buy these
products.
    [0005]       Furthermore, the powdered nutritional supplements are produced by the
production process according to the prior art at high ambient temperature and in
uncontrolled humidity to the detriment of inherent nutritional value, not to mention that
                                                I

their original flavor is abated or altered. As a result, the powdered nutritional supplements
are smelly or not tasty to the detriment of user experience.
    [0006]      Therefore,     nowadays     it  is  imperative   for   nutritional  supplement
manufacturers to develop a system that increases nutritional value of nutritional
supplements and improves their flavor.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
    [0007]      It is an objective of the present disclosure to provide a speedy micronization
alimental refining technology system that micronizes raw materials speedily to thereby
increase nutritional value of the raw materials and enhance efficacy of nutritional
supplements made from the raw materials.
    [0008]      Another objective of the present disclosure is to provide a speedy
micronization alimental refining technology system that is capable of augmenting original
flavor of raw materials and reducing utilization of artificial additives, so as to enhance user
experience.
    [0009]      Therefore, the present disclosure provides a speedy micronization alimental
refining technology system, comprising: a body having a receiving space; an input portion
disposed at an end of the body and thereby adapted to be in communication with the
receiving space; an output portion disposed at another end of the body and thereby adapted
to be in communication with the receiving space; a micronization portion disposed in the
receiving space and thereby separated from an inner wall of the receiving space by a
                                                 2

predetermined distance to provide an external force; and a channel disposed between the
inner wall of the receiving space and the micronization portion.
    [0010]      The speedy micronization alimental refining technology system of the
present disclosure is capable of disintegrating newly-fed raw materials and activated
substances (for example, enzymes) speedily into powder and thus micronizing them, so as
to retain nutritional ingredients of the raw materials, activate the activity of the activated
substances, keep original flavor of the raw materials, reduce utilization of artificial
additives, such as sweeteners and flavoring agents, and assure the public of the safety of the
products of the speedy micronization alimental refining technology system.
    [0011]      The micronization portion is capable of moving freely and thereby changing
a distance between it and the inner wall of the receiving space, so as to control changes in
dimensions of raw materials and activated substances.
    [0012]      The speedy micronization alimental refining technology system of the
present disclosure further comprises a control portion disposed at the body to regulate
temperature and humidity in the receiving space.
    [0013]      The output portion and the input portion are disposed at two opposing said
ends of the body, respectively.
    [0014]      The speedy micronization alimental refining technology system of the
present disclosure further comprises a power portion connected to the micronization portion
to provide a power such that the micronization portion operates repeatedly in the receiving
space.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS
    [0015]     FIG. 1 is a schematic view of a speedy micronization alimental refining
technology system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure; and
    [0016]     FIG. 2 is a schematic view of how to use the speedy micronization alimental
refining technology system according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
    [0017]     The present disclosure is illustrated by an embodiment, depicted by
drawings, and described below.
    [0018]     Referring to FIG 1, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, a speedy
micronization alimental refining technology (SMART) system (10) comprises a body (20),
an input portion (30), an output portion (40), a micronization portion (50), a channel (60), a
power portion (70) and a control portion (80).
    [0019]     The body (20) has a receiving space (21).
    [0020]     The input portion (30) is disposed at one end of the body (20) and thereby
adapted to be in communication with the receiving space (21).
    [0021]     The output portion (40) is disposed at an opposing end of the body (20) and
thereby adapted to be in communication with the receiving space (21).
    [0022]     The micronization portion (50) is separated from the inner wall of the
receiving space (21) by a predetermined distance and thereby disposed in the receiving
                                               4

space (21). The micronization portion (50) is capable of moving within the receiving space
(21) and thereby changing a distance between it and the inner wall of the receiving space
(21).
     [0023]     The channel (60) is disposed between the inner wall of the receiving space
(21) and the micronization portion (50).
     [0024]     The power portion (70) is connected to the micronization portion (50) to
provide a power and thus allow the micronization portion (50) to operate and thereby
change a distance between it and the inner wall of the receiving space (21).
     [0025]     The control portion (80) has a control panel (81) disposed on the body (20) to
regulate temperature and humidity in the receiving space (21).
     [0026]     Owing to the integration of the aforesaid elements, the speedy micronization
alimental refining technology system (10) uses the micronization portion (50) to speedily
disintegrate and micronize various substances fed into the receiving space (21), so as to alter
their shapes without abating the flavor and nutritional ingredients of the substances.
     [0027]     Referring to FIG. 2, after a raw material substance (91) and an activated
substance (92) have been transferred from the input portion (30) to the receiving space (21)
and then moved into the channel (60), the micronization portion (50) is driven by the power
portion (70) to undergo reciprocating motion within the receiving space (21) quickly. As a
result, the raw material substance (91) and the activated substance (92) are compressed by
the micronization portion (50) to therefore bombard the inner wall of the channel (60) and
the micronization portion (50) repeatedly; hence, both the raw material substance (91) and
                                               5

the activated substance (92) are speedily disintegrated into particles of appropriate sizes,
whereas the activated substance (92) is stimulated by the external force and thus activated.
Afterward, the raw material substance (91) and the activated substance (92), which are
particulate, are pushed to the output portion (40) and thus taken out. Furthermore, during the
process of utilization, it is important that the raw material substance or activated substance
is not denatured as a result of any adverse effect of an environmental factor, such as
temperature or humidity. To this end, during the operation process, the control portion (80)
plays a role of surveillance such that the temperature and humidity in the receiving space
(21) meets a predetermined condition continuously to therefore prevent the denaturing of
the raw material substances or activated substance or reduction in the activity thereof.
     [0028]      Therefore, the speedy micronization alimental refining technology system of
the present disclosure has advantages as follows:
     [0029]      First, it has a micronization portion for micronizing nutritional supplements
and/or activated substances in raw materials speedily, so as to retain and increase the
activity of the nutritional supplements.
     [0030]      Second, its process of bombardment and disintegration is not only effective
in removing anti-nutritional factors or toxins from the raw material substance and thus
enhancing the nutritional value and safety of the resultant substances but also effective in
eliminating undesirable flavor of the raw material substance in order to reduce the use of
artificial flavoring agents and enhance food safety.
                                                 6

    [0031]    Third, it controls the temperature and humidity in a receiving space precisely
from beginning to end and thus produces substances of stable quality in a stable
environment.
    [0032]    The present disclosure is disclosed above by preferred embodiments. All
simple amendments or changes related to configuration of a regulating portion, aspect of a
nutrient converting portion, and the like and made by persons skilled in the art to the
preferred embodiments without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure shall be
deemed falling within the scope of the appended claims.
