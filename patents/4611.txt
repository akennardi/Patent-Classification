15                                           BACKGROUND
   [00031      Medical fluid delivery systems have been described that can deliver fluid to a target
   location within a patient. In some applications a fluid source houses a fluid that is delivered from
   the fluid source through a delivery device positioned in the patient and into the patient.
   Needleless applications include a delivery device that has an aperture therein, and fluid is
20 allowed to be moved from the fluid source, through the delivery device, out of the aperture, and
   into the patient.
   [0004]      Some applications attempt to generate a transient relatively high fluid pressure at a
   location along the fluid path in an effort to deliver the fluid into the patient at a relatively high
   velocity. U.S. Patent No. 6,964,649, for example, describes a fluid source that is capable of
25 generating a transient high pressure to deliver fluid into tissue. Deficiencies of these and other
   previous attempts are set forth in more detail below.
                                  SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
   [0005]      One aspect of the disclosure is a system for delivering fluid into a patient,
30 comprising: a high pressure fluid source adapted to be positioned external to a patient and
   adapted to maintain a fluid agent under high pressure within a fluid reservoir; a delivery device
   adapted to be positioned within a patient, the delivery device comprising a fluid delivery
   aperture; and a fluid control adapted to be disposed external to the patient and downstream the
   fluid reservoir, the fluid control adapted to allow for fluid to flow under high pressure from the
35 fluid reservoir to the fluid delivery aperture and out of the delivery device.

                                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [00041]      The disclosure herein relates generally to medical devices, and particularly to systems
   and methods of use for delivering a fluid agent to a target location within a patient. In some
 5 embodiments the devices and systems herein are used to deliver a fluid agent out of an aperture
   in a delivery device, through tissue adjacent the aperture (which may be referred to herein as
   "intermediate tissue"), and to target tissue that is more distant from the aperture than the tissue
   adjacent the aperture (which may be referred to herein as "target tissue"). Exposing the target
   tissue to the fluid agent causes a desired change in the target tissue.
10 [00042]      In some embodiments it is desirous to cause minimal damage to the intermediate
   tissue while delivering the fluid agent to the target tissue. Minimal damage to the intermediate
   tissue is generally considered similar or less than is caused by a small gauge needle penetrating
   the intermediate tissue, and substantially less than is caused to the intermediate tissue by the
   delivery of RF ablation energy delivered at the lumen wall for treatment of a tissue peripheral or
15 distant to the lumen wall. If RF energy is delivered the lumen wall will sustain more damage
   than the target tissue because the RF energy source is adjacent to the lumen wall and the energy
   density at the lumen wall is greater than at the target tissue. As described herein the fluid agent
   pierces through, or penetrates through, the intermediate tissue with minimal damage to the
   intermediate tissue. One manner in which the damage is minimized is by delivering a high
                                                     -4-

      WO 2013/112583                                                                 PCT/US2013/022745
     velocity fluid jet out of the aperture. The disclosure herein focuses primarily on creating the high
     velocity fluid jet by creating a relatively high pressure gradient across a relatively small fluid
     aperture. The high velocity fluid delivery also ensures that minimal leaking of the fluid agent
     into the lumen occurs when the fluid agent is delivered out of the aperture.
  5  [00043]      The one or more apertures can be positioned in any lumen within the body, and as
     used herein "lumen" includes spaces in the body other than tubular structures. For example
     without limitation, any portion of the vasculature, the interior of the gastrointestinal tract, the
     esophagus, urethra, and the stomach are "lumens" as used herein.
     [00044]      In some embodiments the intermediate and target tissues are characterized as the
 10  same type of tissue, but the target type of tissue is more distant, relative to the aperture, than the
     intermediate type of tissue. In some embodiments the intermediate and target tissues are
     different types of tissue.
     [00045]      An exemplary situation in which it may be desirable to minimize damage to the
     intermediate tissue is when the fluid is being delivered through the lumen of an arterial wall to
 15  target tissue peripheral to the lumen wall. For example, as descried herein, in some uses the
     fluid is delivered at high velocity through a renal artery lumen and wherein the target tissue is the
     medial layer and/or adventitial layers, in which nerves that innervate the kidneys are disposed.
     In some methods of use it is desirable to deliver a fluid agent to the medial and/or adventitial
     layers to disrupt the neural tissue, while minimizing the damage to the renal artery lumen wall.
20   [00046]      The systems herein include a fluid reservoir adapted to house a fluid agent therein.
    The systems also include a delivery device with at least one aperture adapted to allow for the
    delivery of the fluid agent from the reservoir and out of the aperture and into the patient at high
    velocity. The velocity of the fluid exiting the aperture is related to the pressure gradient of the
    fluid agent across the aperture, among other variables. Some previous approaches have attempted
25  to generate a high transient fluid pressure at a fluid reservoir disposed external to a patient in
    order to generate a high velocity fluid delivery within the patient. In embodiments herein,
    however, the systems and methods of use generate the high velocity fluid delivery into the
    patient by maintaining the fluid in the fluid reservoir at a high pressure. While the fluid agent is
    being maintained under high pressure in the fluid reservoir, a fluid control distal, or downstream
30  to, the fluid reservoir is opened, which delivers the fluid agent under high pressure out of the
    fluid reservoir, towards the aperture, and out of the aperture at a high velocity.
    [00047]      Figure 1 illustrates conceptually an exemplary fluid delivery system 102 that includes
    high pressure fluid source 104 that is adapted to maintain a fluid agent under high pressure, a
    high pressure fluid control, and fluid delivery device 106 capable of communication with high
35  pressure fluid source 104. High pressure fluid source 104 includes at least one fluid reservoir
                                                      -5 -

      WO 2013/112583                                                                PCT/US2013/022745
     adapted to house a fluid agent therein. Delivery device 106 includes at least one fluid delivery
     lumen adapted to receive fluid from the fluid reservoir, and at least one aperture, or port, adapted
     to allow the fluid agent to be delivered into the patient from delivery device 106.
     [00048]     Figure 2 depicts a portion of an exemplary fluid delivery system illustrating fluid
  5  reservoir 230 adapted to house a fluid agent therein, inline fluid control 210, and optional bypass
     fluid control 220. Fluid controls 210 and 220 can be any type of suitable valve. Fluid control
     210 is disposed between delivery device inflow 201 and the fluid reservoir 230. Bypass fluid
     control 220 "T's" off the outflow line and empties to a low pressure exhaust point such as
     ambient pressure. During idle, fluid control 210 is in a closed configuration and fluid control
 10  220 is in an open configuration. In idle, also referred to herein as the primed state, the fluid in
     fluid reservoir 230 is maintained under substantially constant high pressure. When fluid is to be
     delivered from the reservoir 230 under high pressure, fluid control 220 is closed, and fluid
     control 210 is then opened for the requisite period of time to cause the fluid to be delivered under
     high pressure out of the reservoir. Fluid control 210 is then closed and fluid control 220 is
15   opened. In some procedures fluid control 220 may be opened only long enough to relieve
    pressure in the fluid delivery system. This sequence causes the inflow to the delivery device to
    be vented through fluid control 220 and a more rapid pressure decrease on the delivery device.
    As described above the rapid pressure decrease helps minimize the amount of fluid leaked into
    the lumen, if desired. The dotted arrows indicate the directions of flows across the two valves.
20  In some embodiments where relatively small amounts of leakage of the delivered agent into the
    body lumen is allowable, valve 220 may not be required.
     [00049]     An exemplary advantage in using a system shown in figure 2 is that because the high
    pressure source holds therein multiple doses and the valve is operable at high rates, the system
    can be used for multiple fluid deliveries without re-filling.
25   [00050]     In any of the embodiments herein, the fluid source maintained at a substantially
    constant high pressure may be maintained at high pressure by means of, for example without
    limitation, pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical means such as one or more springs.
    [00051]      Figure 3 illustrates an exemplary high pressure fluid source. The fluid source includes
    low pressure fluid reservoir 340, high pressure fluid pump 330, inline fluid control 310, and
30  return valve 320. When idling, bypass fluid control 320 is open and inline fluid control 310 is
    closed. Fluid is then circulated through low pressure 340 reservoir during idle. During an
    injection, fluid control 320 is first closed for a period of time generating high pressure in the
    system to prime the fluid source. Fluid control 310 is then opened for an appropriate duration
    thereby delivering fluid at a rate consistent with the pump flow rate. Fluid control 320 is then
35  opened and fluid control 310 is closed. In both of the described configurations the outflow
                                                       -6-

    WO 2013/112583                                                               PCT/US2013/022745
   resistance associated with the delivery device is much higher than the return path resistance.
   Pressure therefore drops rapidly in the outflow path when the bypass fluid control 320 is opened.
   This quick drop in pressure in the outflow path helps prevent leakage of the fluid agent into the
   lumen in which the medical device is positioned, if in fact this is desired.
 5 [00052]      Fluid controls as described herein can be any type of suitable valve, such as, for
   example without limitation, shuttle valves or poppit valves. In some embodiments the valves are
   actuated by interfacing a control interface with a system controller.
   [00053]      Figure 4 shows an exemplary breadboard fluid control system configured for a pump
   source described in Figure 3 that was used to investigate the characteristic associated with
10 needle-less injections into renal artery tissues. The system is comprised of an outflow 401 for
   interfacing with a delivery catheter, pressure transducer 405 for monitoring the pressure at the
   outflow port 401, inline fluid control 410, bypass fluid control 420; low pressure fluid reservoir
   409, high pressure pump source 408, controller interface 402, and a personal computer used as a
   controller (not shown).
15 [00054]      Figure 5 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a high velocity fluid delivery system
   adapted to deliver a fluid agent under high pressure into a patient. System 500 includes system
   controller 510, delivery device 520, and delivery device control interface 530. The system
   controller may be a completely mechanical system or may comprise an electro-mechanical
   interface. The system controller (non-sterile) can be designed to be reusable, while the delivery
20 catheter control interface and delivery catheter (sterile) can be designed to be discarded after a
   single use. In some embodiments, the features of the system controller, delivery device, and
   control interface are incorporated in a single disposable unit. Delivery device control interface
   530 comprises an optional expandable member control interface, a fluid source, and a fluid
   control block. The expandable member can be in the form of a balloon, self-expanding structure,
25 or any other suitable expandable or deformable member. In some embodiments the fluid source
   is a pump capable of delivering appropriate flows at the desired pressures as described herein, or
   a reservoir maintained at the appropriate operating pressure as described herein. Delivery device
   520 is generally configured for endovascular or endoluminal delivery. Delivery device as used
   herein can be any type of suitable delivery catheter or other suitable medical device that can be
30 positioned within a patient. The delivery device is shown including catheter shaft 521, the
   proximal end of which interfaces with delivery device control interface 530. The distal region of
   delivery device 520 comprises expandable member 523, radio opaque markers 524, a high
   pressure delivery lumen (not shown), and features associated with facilitating rapid exchange on
   a guide wire. Delivery device also includes an aperture near expandable member 523 adapted to
35 deliver fluid into the patient.

    [00055]     Figures 6 and 7 illustrate an exemplary high pressure fluid source, which can be used
   as high pressure fluid source 104 from figure 1. The high pressure fluid source includes power
   source 615, fluid reservoir 613 with fluid 612 therein, outflow control valve 611, and delivery
   device 610. The fluid source also includes optional fluid input 616 and optional fluid fill valve
 5 617, and vents 618 in both power source 615 and fluid reservoir 613 through which air is pushed
   or pulled depending on the use of the system. Power source 615 includes power mechanism 614,
   which in some embodiments can be a spring, compressed gas reservoir as shown, or other
   suitable mechanisms for generating power. Power mechanism 614 is adapted to push piston 620
   distally within fluid reservoir 613 to maintain fluid 612 in fluid reservoir 613 under high pressure
10 while valve 611 is closed. Figure 6 illustrates the system in a primed configuration, ready to
   delivery fluid 612. Fluid 612 is maintained under a pressure high enough to source an aperture
   in delivery device 610 at a pressure sufficient to allow for a high pressure fluid agent injection.
   In use, after the system is primed as shown in figure 6, fluid control 611 is opened and fluid is
   delivered from reservoir 613, through open control 611, and through delivery device 610 and out
15 an aperture in the delivery device (not labeled but described below). Figure 7 illustrates the
   system at the conclusion of a high pressure injection after the front face seal 619 of piston 620
   has seated on the distal surface fluid reservoir 613 thereby cutting off the flow of fluid to
   delivery device 610. Fluid control 611 can then be closed in preparation for subsequent
   injections of fluid. In the embodiment in figures 6 and 7 the reservoir houses fluid for one fluid
20 delivery. The fluid delivery step involves delivering the entire volume of fluid housed in
   reservoir 612 at one time. The reservoir can subsequently be re-filled with fluid, either manually
   or automatically. The front face seal 619 in the embodiment in figures 6 and 7 allows for precise
   control of delivered fluid volume in a system which only requires that valve 611 be opened
   rapidly. This is in contrast to the system of figure 2 in which valve 210 must be both opened and
25 closed to facilitate a controlled volume of delivery. One exemplary advantage of the system in
   figures 6 and 7 is primarily in the reduced complexity and therefore cost of the fluid control
   mechanisms.
   [00056]     Figure 8 is a graph illustrating pressure vs. time and illustrates the pressure of the
   fluid within the fluid reservoir 613 in figures 6 and 7, which is represented by the solid line, and
30 the pressure of the fluid distal to fluid control 611, which is represented as the dashed line. Time
   epoch TI is the time period after which the system has been primed (figure 6), and pressure 822
   indicates the high fluid pressure of fluid 612 within fluid reservoir 613. Time epoch 821
   indicates the period in which the high pressure fluid is in communication with the delivery
   system 610, and pressure 824 is the high fluid pressure during the delivery phase. There is a
35 negative pressure difference between time epoch 821 and time epoch TI. Time epoch T3 is the

     time period following the fluid delivery after seal 619 closes. During time epoch T3 the fluid
     pressure of fluid 612 within reservoir 613 returns to pressure 822.
     [000571     The dashed line in figure 8 represents the fluid pressure at a location distal to fluid
     control 611. During time epoch TI, after the system is primed, this pressure is zero. During
  5 time epoch 821 when the fluid agent is delivered, control 611 is initially opened and fluid 612 is
     released under pressure from fluid reservoir 613. The fluid is forced down the fluid line lumen to
    the aperture. The pressure distal to fluid control 611 in time epoch 821 therefore increases
    abruptly to pressure 824, and after the fluid has been delivered from the aperture, as indicated in
    time epoch T3, the pressure distal to fluid control 611 drops abruptly back to ambient.
 10  [000581     As can been in figure 8, there is a negative pressure change in the fluid in the fluid
    reservoir as the fluid delivery begins. This change can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the
    capacitance of power source 615. It is of note that a positive pressure transient is not created in
    fluid at the fluid source during the fluid delivery step because the fluid is primed to be under
    high pressure. The velocity of the fluid delivered out of the aperture in the delivery device is
15  sufficient to pierce tissue with minimal damage and yet expose the target tissue to a sufficient
    volume of tissue to disrupt the target tissue as needed.
    [000591      As used herein, fluid that is "maintained" under high pressure refers at least to the
    fact that the system is maintained in a primed state under high pressure. When primed under high
    pressure, a fluid control is then opened distal to the fluid reservoir to release the fluid primed and
20  maintained under high pressure. This is different than systems that generate a high pressure
    transient at the fluid source and thereby do not require a control valve downstream the fluid
    reservoir.
    [000601      Figure 9 illustrates an embodiment of a system in which an exemplary high pressure
    fluid source 915 is coupled to elongate delivery device 960. In this embodiment the high
25  pressure source comprises a fluid reservoir adapted to house a volume of fluid sufficient for
    multiple discrete fluid injections and associated control mechanisms capable of controlling the
    volume of an individual injection. As shown primary power source 915 is pneumatically driven,
    but may be, for example, hydraulically or spring driven. Power source 915 comprises relatively
    low pressure fluid source 930 that is used to power pilot valve 940. Pilot valve 940 comprises
30  valve seat 941 adapted to interface with a high pressure piston 945. High pressure piston 945 is
    in turn coupled to low pressure piston 944. The surface areas of pistons 944 and 945 are sized
    such that the pressure generated in the chamber at the valve seat 941 by pilot valve 940 is greater
    than the pressure generated in the high pressure fluid source. Pilot valve volume adjustment is
    facilitated by volume adjustment 943. Low pressure fluid in low pressure fluid source 930 is
35  communicated through adjustable fluid resistor 932 and 3-way valve 931 to the low pressure side
                                                      -9-

      of adjustable pilot valve 940. Exemplary usage in the system is as follows. As the pressure
     generated by the low pressure fluid source 930 on the pilot valve low pressure piston 944 is
      sufficient to generate a pressure greater than that generated in the high pressure fluid, the pilot
     valve is in the off, or closed, position.
  5   [000611      Figure 9 shows valve 940 in an open, or on, configuration. Before the fluid is
     delivered a delivery volume is defined by adjusting volume adjustment 943 some distance away
     from low pressure piston 944 surface. When valve 931 is then momentarily reconfigured for
     flow from "b" to "a" to flow from "b"to "c", the low pressure fluid pressure drops to ambient on
     the low pressure side of pilot valve 940. The pilot valve piston then shifts position until it
 10  encounters the volume adjustment 943 and the valve seat is opened. What is meant by
     momentarily in this context is a time sufficient for the pilot valve piston to shift to the fully open
     position. On re-attaining the default configuration of valve 931 where flow is "b" to "a," low
     pressure fluid begins to leak back into the low pressure side of the pilot valve 940 at a rate
     defined by the value of the adjustable fluid resistor 932. The length of time to close the pilot
15   valve 940 is therefore adjusted by both the length of travel (required volume) defined by
     adjustment of adjuster 943 and on the filling rate defined by fluid resistor 932. The delivered
     volume of fluid is therefore the volume associated with period during which the pilot valve is
     open. In alternative embodiments only one of the two controls 932 and 943 are included. In
     others one will be used as a calibration means and the other as a user control.
20   [000621      The embodiment in figure 9 can be modified to include a sensor such as a pressure
     transducer (such as the pressure transducer shown in the embodiment above in figure 4) or other
     means to infer velocity. The sensor can be added, for example, at valve seat 941. The sensor is
     adapted to provide feedback information indicative of the pressure differential across the
     delivery aperture, or the velocity of the fluid. An exemplary method of use compares the
25   feedback data from the sensor with reference data to determine if the pressure is sufficiently
    high, or if the velocity is sufficiently high. If either parameter is not high enough damage may
     occur to the intermediate tissue, which can be disadvantageous when the intermediate tissue is,
    for example, an arterial wall. Alternatively, if either parameter is not high enough it can be
    determined that the fluid agent was not delivered at a high enough pressure or velocity and
30  therefore did not adequately reach the target tissue (i.e., the target tissue was not adequately
    exposed to the fluid agent). If this is the case the method could include delivering one or more
    jets of fluid, and again determining if either the pressure or velocity were sufficiently high. In
    addition or alternatively to comparing the peak or plateau pressure to reference data, the time of
    the rise in pressure from baseline to peak or plateau can be determined and compared to
35  reference data. When the pressure does not rise from baseline to peak or plateau quickly enough,

     damage to the intermediate tissue may not be minimized. In some embodiments it is determined
     if the rise in pressure occurs over a time longer than 15 msec, and in some embodiments over a
     time longer than 5 msec. If it does take longer than the reference time, feedback can be provided
     that indicates that, for example, the fluid delivery was ineffective or that damage occurred to the
  5  intermediate tissue. Towards this end it is also useful to purge the system with one or two test
     shots prior to deployment of the device adjacent to the target tissue. Doing so insures that air is
     not trapped in the system. Air trapped in the system can compress, and thereby slow the rise
     time of the pressure pulse.
     [000631       Figures 10 and 11 illustrate alternative embodiments of alternate metering outflow
 10  valve variations. Figure 10 illustrates valve 1045 secured to delivery device 1010. In figure 10
     metering adjustment 1043 is linearly displaced an amount "A" such that linear displacement "A"
     equates to the expected delivered volume. Piston 1043 seals against the inner walls of valve
     1045. Fluid resistor 1032 has very high fluid resistance and allows fluid to translate from one
     side of piston 1043 to the other as adjustments are made. A high pressure source 1013 feeds
15   fluid into metering valve 1045 on the upstream side of piston 1043. When control valve 1011 is
    opened a slight pressure differential develops across piston 1043 driving it to the right in the
     figure, closing fluid off at valve 1019. Fluid resistor 1032 is sized such that its resistance is
     sufficient to limit fluid flow from one side to the other at the change in pressure associated with
    the piston displacement during fluid delivery. In alternative embodiments the external resistor
20   1032 can be incorporated into piston 1043 or it can be inherent in the design of the interface
    between piston 1043 and the cylinder wall.
     [00064]      Figure 11 illustrates an embodiment similar to the embodiment shown in figure 10.
    In the device shown in figure 11, when valve 1111 is opened, a small pressure differential is
    generated across piston 1143 by fluid resistor 1132. As in the embodiment of figure 10 the fluid
25  resistor may be incorporated in the piston or the interface of the piston and the cylinder wall.
    When valve 1111 is opened, piston 1143 will travel distance A and seal against the distal end of
    the cylinder, thereby delivering a volume equivalent to distance A times the area of the cylinder.
    When valve 1111 is closed, pressure will equalize across piston 1143 and spring 1119 will return
    the piston 1143 to its primed position.
30  [00065]       Figures 12 and 13 illustrate two variations of the system of figures 6 and 7 which
    incorporate automatic high pressure refilling systems. In figure 12, high pressure delivery
    system 1200 is similar to the system of figures 6 and 7 with the exception that volume control
    mechanism 1201 is incorporated in the high pressure reservoir. High pressure refilling system
    1210 comprises a power source 1211 interfaced with a high pressure fluid source 1212, which in
35  turn is interfaced with high pressure delivery system input valve 1217 and optional filling valve

    1213. High pressure refilling system 1210 is configured such that the pressure within high
    pressure refilling reservoir 1212 is maintained at a pressure somewhat greater than the pressure
    in the high pressure delivery system 1200. In use, volume adjustment mechanism 1201 is
    adjusted to the appropriate volume. Valve 1217 is then opened allowing fluid to pass from the
 5  refill reservoir to the high pressure delivery reservoir. Valve 1217 is then closed and the high
    pressure delivery system is ready to use. Optional valve 1213 may be used to fill the refilling
    reservoir. As depicted in figure 12 the power source 1211 is a low pressure pneumatic drive
   where the drive pressure will be equivalent to the low pressure drive pressure times the ratio of
   the surface areas of the power source piston/high pressure refilling reservoir. In figure 13 the
10  high pressure delivery system input valve 1217 has been replaced by a three way valve 1302, but
    other similar components are similarly labeled.
    1000661      The delivery devices described herein, which are indirectly or directly coupled to the
    substantially constant high pressure fluid source, have at least one aperture therein adapted to
    allow a fluid agent to be delivered from the fluid source and out of the aperture under high
15 velocity.
    100067]      Figures 14 and 15 illustrate two exemplary distal regions of two exemplary delivery
   devices. Figure 14 illustrates a distal region of a deliver device 1400 that includes an over-the
   wire configuration for delivery. The delivery device includes catheter shaft 1401, comprising
   high pressure fluid delivery line 1405, expandable member 1403, a guide wire lumen (not
20 labeled), balloon inflation lumen (not labeled), and radio opaque markers 1404. Expandable
   member 1403 is shown as a rigid 20 mm long and 6 mm diameter cylindrical balloon but can
   have other configurations, and is secured to the outer surface of the distal region of catheter shaft
    1401. High pressure fluid line 1405 has at least one aperture formed therein in its distal region,
   and is secured to expandable member 1403 such that a fluid jet aperture (which is not visible but
25 is included in the device) faces (i.e., opens) radially outward from the long axis of the
   expandable member 1403. The aperture can be anywhere along the length of fluid line 1405, but
   in this embodiment is positioned at the longitudinal center of expandable member 1403.
   100068]       In an exemplary use, the delivery device is primed with fluid so that fluid is disposed
   in the delivery device fluid delivery line. A delivery catheter, examples of which are well
30 known, is advanced to a region of interest within the patient. A guidewire is then fed through the
   delivery catheter to the distal end of the delivery catheter. Alternatively, and more commonly
   the guide wire is delivered to a location adjacent to the target tissue, then the delivery catheter is
   advanced over the guidewire near the target location. Delivery device 1400 is then advanced
   over the guidewire with the guidewire disposed in the guidewire lumen. Once in the desired
35 position, delivery device 1400 is moved distally relative to the delivery catheter. Catheter shaft

      1402 is advanced to position the jet aperture adjacent to the target tissue (and directly adjacent
     and engaging the intermediate tissue). Expandable member 1403 is inflated with fluid advanced
     through the inflation lumen in catheter shaft 1402. A high velocity jet of fluid agent is then
     delivered as described herein.
  5  [00069]      Three radio opaque markers 1404 are also incorporated into the distal region of the
     delivery device. The two markers 1404 on catheter 1402 delineate the axial location of the fluid
    jet aperture, and the most distal marker 1404 provides information on the radial orientation of the
     aperture.
     [000701      In some embodiment the high pressure delivery line, or lumen, is substantially flush
 10  with the outer surface of the balloon (or other expandable member). In these configurations the
     high pressure lumen does not extend further radially than the outer surface of the balloon. This
     configuration provides better engagement between the balloon and the lumen wall in which the
     balloon is disposed and expanded. This provides a better seal between the balloon and the lumen
     wall, which reduces the likelihood of fluid leaking back into the lumen once it is delivered out of
15  the aperture. In some embodiments the high pressure delivery lumen is integrated into the
     balloon structure. This can be accomplished by incorporating one or more lumens into the
     extrusion used to form the balloon. The lumens are maintained during the balloon forming
    process and the resulting balloon structure would therefore include one or more integrated high
    pressure delivery lumens. In some embodiments a channel is formed in the balloon to
20  accommodate the high pressure fluid lumen. For example, a channel with a general "U" cross
    sectional shape is formed in the balloon, and the high pressure lumen is secured within this
    channel. The high pressure lumen is therefore substantially flush with the outer surface of the
    balloon.
     [00071]     Figure 15 shows an alternate embodiment of a distal region of a delivery device
25  similar to that shown in figure 14 and comprising the features of a rapid exchange guide wire
    configuration. Guide wire 1502 is shown entering the catheter shaft on the proximal side of
    balloon 1503 and exiting the shaft on the distal end of delivery catheter 1500. The expandable
    member 1503 in this embodiment is a generally spherical inflatable elastomeric balloon. High
    pressure delivery line 1505 is secured to the surface of the balloon as described above in the
30  embodiment in Figure 14.
    [00072]      In an alternative design similar to those shown in Figures 14 and 15, the balloon is
    radially offset relative to the expandable member shaft such that the high pressure line has a
    substantially straight configuration across the surface of the balloon when the balloon is
    expanded. The embodiment in figures 16A-16C enhances the precision with which interface
35  pressure can be measured and controlled. The embodiment in Figures 16A-16C includes balloon

    1605 is secured to balloon 1603. High pressure line 1605 also includes radio opaque markers
    1604. The embodiment comprises a rapid exchange guide wire interface demonstrated by the
    path of guide wire 1602. Balloon 1603 is carried on catheter shaft 1601 which may incorporate a
 5  braid or other stiffening elements to facilitate larger torque carrying capacity. General features
    of the catheter shaft are not shown. Figure 16B illustrates a cross section of the delivery device
    of Figure 16A configured for delivery and prior to inflation, wherein the delivery device is
    positioned within vessel 1600. In this configuration balloon 1603 is deflated and folded. Figure
    16C represents the balloon in its inflated state where the balloon has a larger diameter then the
10  vessel 1600 in which it is expanded. In such a configuration the pressure required to expand the
    balloon will be minimal, and the pressure monitored during inflation will be indicative of that
    associated with stretching the vessel wall. By recording volume versus pressure the diameter
   pressure curve of Figure 17 can be calculated and a desired pressure range can be determined.
    Such a system can be used to identify the appropriate inflation pressure by monitoring the
15 relative change in modulus as opposed to targeting a particular absolute pressure.
    [00073]     The systems and devices are adapted to be used to deliver a fluid agent to target tissue
   that is more distant to the aperture than tissue directly adjacent the aperture. The systems can be
   used to minimize the damage done to the intermediate tissue, and one manner in which this can
   be accomplished is with fluid delivered at high velocity out of the aperture. An exemplary use is
20 to position the delivery device within a renal artery and deliver a fluid agent out of an aperture at
   high velocity. The fluid passes through the wall (with minimal damage to the intermediate wall
   tissue) to a location where it can interact with neural tissue surrounding the renal artery. The
   interaction of the fluid and nerves disrupts the neural transmission along the nerves, reducing
   hypertension. Methods of reducing hypertension with a fluid agent delivered out of a delivery
25 device under high velocity are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0257622, filed March
   24, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. As described above and
   shown in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0257622, the fluid agent is delivered out of the delivery
   device, pierces through the renal artery lumen wall, and is exposed to target neural tissue more
   distant from the lumen to disrupt neural transmission along the nerves and reduce hypertension.
30 The systems, devices, and methods herein provide sufficient penetration of the fluid through the
   renal artery such that neural tissue is exposed to the fluid, while minimizing the amount of fluid
   that is leaked back into the renal artery, and thus the vasculature. The systems, devices, and
   methods herein also provide fluid penetration through the renal artery such that the injury
   associated with the fluid penetration is minimized at the luminal entry point.

    [00074]     In some systems previously described in the patent literature, the fluid pressure within
   the fluid source is relatively low prior to and after fluid delivery into the patient, but may be
   relatively high during fluid delivery and immediately prior in time to the delivery of the fluid.
   An exemplary disadvantage to these systems is that if the fluid pressure is initially too low, the
 5 fluid may not be delivered far enough into the target tissue. For example, in systems use to
   deliver fluid from the renal artery and into neural tissue surrounding the renal artery to disrupt
   neural transmission along those nerves, the fluid may ultimately be delivered only partially into
   the medial layer, when the desired outcome is that the fluid is delivered completely through the
   medial layer, in which the target nerve tissue is disposed. An additional exemplary disadvantage
10 to these systems is that, because the pressure will drop back down to the relatively low pressure,
   if the pressure drops off too quickly, the fluid might not penetrate all the way through the medial
   layer, which is undesirable for reasons set forth above. By maintaining the fluid pressure within
   the fluid source at a substantially high pressure, the fluid pressure doesn't return to a relatively
   low pressure, but rather is maintained at the substantially constant high pressure. The potential
15 problems of not penetrating deep enough into the medial layer, and thus failing to sufficiently
   disrupt neural transmission along the neural pathway, are therefore eliminated.
   [00075]     By delivering a pressure pulse and thereby a fluid stream with rapid rising and falling
   mean velocity, the fluid, when delivered, will both penetrate through the lumen to surrounding
   tissue with minimal injury to the tissues at the entry point and minimize leakage of the fluid back
20 into the lumen.
   [00076]     Figure 18 illustrates the pressure waveform generated in the system from Figure 4
   when using ajet aperture of 1.5 mil diameter, as measured in the pressure transducer 405. The
   delivery volume was approximately 35 uL delivered over a period of approximately 200 msec.
   The pressure transient, as measured at pressure transducer 405, associated with the increasing
25 pressure 1801 occurred over a period of approximately 5 msec, and the pressure transient
   associated with the release of pressure 1802 occurred over a similar time frame. The pressure
   pulse attains a relatively constant plateau pressure of approximately 900 psi.
   [00077]     In some embodiments the diameter of the one or more fluid jet apertures is between
   about 1 and about 5 mils. In some embodiments the velocity of the fluid jetting from the medical
30 device is between about 50 and about 400 m/sec. In some embodiments the flow rate of the fluid
   from the constant high pressure source is between about 5 and about 40 mL/min. In some
   embodiments the duration of the fluid pulse is between about 50 and 500 msec. In yet other
   embodiments the duration is multiple seconds. In some embodiments the volume of fluid
   delivered per pulse is between about 10 uL and about 500 uL. In yet other embodiments the
35 delivered volume may be multiple mL's. In some embodiments the time of the transition

   between the baseline pressure and the elevated pressure, and the time of the transition between
   the elevated pressure and the baseline pressure (e.g., transitions 1801 and 1802 in Figure 18) is
    less than about 15 msec, and may be less than 5msec, and additionally may be less than 1 msec.
   In general, shorter transition times translate into more efficient penetration and less fluid leaking

    [00078]     As used herein, high pressure refers to pressure above about 750 psi, and includes
   pressures between 750 psi and 5000 psi. The systems are adapted to maintain the fluid in the
   fluid reservoir in the high pressure fluid source under pressures of about 750 psi and about 5000
   psi.

   image) and about .5 mm wide. Darkened area 1903 corresponds to the location of the high
   pressure delivery line 505. Periventricular adipose tissue darkly stained with injectate is visible
   at 1904. Figures 19B and 19C show fluoroscopic images taken during an in vivo porcine study.
20 Balloon 1903 is visible via contrast agent which has been used to inflate the balloon. The
   balloon is shown in the renal artery where it has been delivered via an endovascular approach. In
   this study the injectate contained both a fluoroscopic contrast agent and a blue dye. Figure 19B
   shows the balloon and surrounding tissue just prior to an injection. Figure 19C shows the
   balloon and surrounding tissue just after an injection. The injectate is visible in Figure 19C at
25  1905. Figure 19D is a photograph from the necropsy of the same treatment zone from another
   animal. Darkened area 1906 within the dotted line shows the stained injury zone in contrast and
   beside a non-injured zone 1907 on a renal artery.

     [00081]      Figures 20A-20D illustrate different generalized waveforms 2000 useful in needle
    less injection of fluids into periluminal spaces. Figure 20A represents the type of waveform
  5 depicted in Figure 18 where the region between the rising and falling transitions 2003 is
    relatively flat. Exemplary features include the rapid transitions associated with the onset of the
    pressure pulse and the decay of the pressure pulse. A rapid onset pressure transition 2001 is
    important in creating a well-defined injury of minimal size wherein the injectate is primarily
    delivered through the injury with very little leakage around the injury entry surface. Similarly a
10  very rapid final decay transition 2002 is important in minimizing leakage of fluid around the
    injury entry surface. When it is required that the low pressure leakage be minimized on the
    pressure decay portion of the pulse it is useful to create the jet aperture adjacent to the distal plug
    in the high pressure delivery line. In this fashion entrapped air will be washed out easily during
    priming prior to actual jetting. If this step is not performed, air may be trapped distal to the jet
15  orifice, and compressed during the pressure rise portion of the jet cycle. On pressure decay this
    air will re-expand and force a small volume of injectate out through the jet orifice. This is of
    primary importance when the injectate is comprised of very toxic or ablative materials and
    minimizing injury to non-target tissues is required. Transition times should be at least less than
    15 msec and preferably less than 5 msec as demonstrated in the experiments described herein,
20  and optimally less than 1 msec. Apart from leakage, a sharp rising edge facilitates better
    penetration. Once an entry injury has been created it is often the case that pressure can be
    dropped and injectate will spread on the distal side of a well-defined puncture injury. In such a
    procedure, injury to the tissues at the entry site associated with the injectate can be minimized
    while larger volumes of injectate can be delivered deeper into the tissue without increasing the
25  depth of injury. Figures 20B and 20C illustrate two pressure waveforms useful in producing
    such injuries. In figure 20B, after the peak pressure is attained the pressure is allowed to trail off
    via a ramp to a pressure still sufficient to penetrate through the entry injury. At the end of the
    pulse the pressure is rapidly dropped for the reasons set forth here. Figure 20D is similar to that
    of Figure 20B except that as opposed to ramping down pressure an initial short high pressure
30  peak 2004 is used to create the injury, which is then followed by a lower pressure plateau of
    sufficient pressure and duration to deliver the requisite volume of injectate to an appropriate
    depth via the entry injury. In some situations it may be useful to spread that injectate more
    evenly through the depth of tissue, in which the pulse of Figure 20C could be desirable.
    Alternatively the volume of injectate may be additionally regulated by delivering multiple pulses
                                                      - 17-

   described herein and/or various delivery velocities.
   [00082]      With reference to the treatment of hypertension by renal nerve ablation (examples of
   which are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2011/0257622), the volume of
 5 injectate delivered may be increased via multiple injections in a single location or multiple
   injections in multiple sites, or a large volume delivered to one site and allowed to spread. When
   delivering injectate at one site via multiple injections, the spreading of the injectate may be
   monitored by fluoroscopy when a contrast agent is comprised in the injectate. The number of
   injections may be controlled by watching how the injectate spreads under fluoroscopy, and
10 stopping the procedure when the desired spread has occurred. When injecting at multiple sites a
   device such as that of Figure 15 may be relocated for each injection or alternatively a device
   similar to that of Figure 14 may incorporate multiple parallel injection systems, wherein each
   line is coupled to a single fluid source or individual fluid sources. Devices described in U.S. Pat.
   App. Pub. No. 2011/0257622 can also be modified to be used with any of the system
15 components described herein and according to any of the methods herein.
   [00083]      Figure 17 illustrates a typical pressure diameter profile associated with an artery. An
   appropriate pressure at the interface between the jet aperture of the medical device and the
   luminal wall is important when minimal injury at the luminal surface of the vessel and control of
   the depth of injectate delivery is desired. The greater the interface pressure, the smaller the
20 luminal injury and the greater control of penetration depth. However, if the interface pressure is
   increased too much the vessel may be injured. A balance must therefore be reached between
   interface pressure vessel distension. A typical vessel exhibits a low modulus during initial
   extension, begins to stiffen, and then exhibits a much higher modulus. As the vessel is extended
   further into the high- modulus region the tissue will be damaged. Region 1702 indicates a target
25 region of interface pressure where damage to the vessel can be minimized and interface pressure
   is high enough to create a clean puncture of the lumen wall.
   [00084]      In the embodiments illustrated in figures 14 and 15, high pressure delivery lines 1405
   and 1505 have a 14 mil outer diameter and 12 mil inner diameter polyimide tube. The delivery
   apertures, not visible in the figures as they are too small, are 1.5 mil. The total length of the
30 delivery lines is approximately 32 inches.
   [00085]      The following describes the expected fluid dynamic behavior for a fluid delivery
   system that includes a long fluid pipe with an exit aperture near the distal end, as do the
   embodiments in figures 5 and 6. The description particularly applies where the fluid delivery
   line has an inner diameter of approximately 12 mil and the delivery aperture is in the range of
                                                     - 18-

   about .5 to about 5 mil, or more particularly about 2 mil. For such systems the fluid velocity will
   be described by the equation:
   [00086]     v(P,Beta,p)=Cd*(1/(I -Beta^4))^.5*((2*P)/ p)
   [00087]     Where P is the pressure differential across the exit aperture, Beta is the ratio of the
 5 diameter of the delivery tube inner diameter/diameter of the aperture, p is the density of the
   delivered fluid and Cd is the coefficient of discharge. Experimental data collected demonstrates
   a value for Cd in the range of about .5 to about .8 with a value of about .65 being typical for the
   configuration listed above. Experimental data collected from such a system demonstrated 1.5
   mL delivered in 9 seconds through a 2 mil diameter exit aperture at 1200psi, using a delivery
10 fluid with a density of approximately 1.1gm / mL. Using the relation averagevelocity =
   Volumedelivered / (duration*Area-aperture), this implies an average delivery velocity of 82
   m/sec. Using the functional relation described above and a Cd of .65, the average fluid velocity
   would be approximately 78m/sec at 1200 psi as measured at the exit valve. Given the expected
   pressure loss across the 32in long, 12 mil diameter delivery tube at the average flow rate, this
15 would imply a pressure differential of approximately 1135 psi across the exit aperture.C0      2
   cartridges provide a means for maintaining a constant pressure within the constant pressure
   source as the internal pressure in a CO 2 cartridge will remain relatively constant at a given
   temperature as long as there remains a mixture of gas and liquid within the cartridge. Pressure
   could hence be adjusted by adjusting the temperature of the cartridge. The following table lists
20 the internal pressure as a function of temperature for a CO 2 cylinder containing CO 2 in both
   liquid and vapor phases.

   [00088]     Exemplary fluid agents that can be delivered, such as to treat neural tissue peripheral

30 [00089]     In some embodiments the systems herein can be used to ablate target tissue. When
   performing localized ablations of tissue, it is often advantageous to use an ablatant that is chosen
   to specifically target a particular tissue or tissue function, and to impart minimal effects on
   adjacent tissues. In all cases the residence time of an ablatant cocktail will be dependent on the
                                                       - 19-

    rate of its removal by normal body functions which include uptake by the capillary bed and the
    lymphatic system. When using a well targeted ablatant it will often be the case that it will have
    very little effect on the tissues associated with the normal removal processes. In such cases, the
    body will remove the ablatant as efficiently and quickly as possible. In such a situation it will be
 5  of great advantage to add to the ablatant cocktail some non specific ablatant, or an ablatant
    specifically targeted to impede capillary and or the lymphatic uptake to slow the body's ability to
   remove therapy targeted ablatant and thereby increase its residence time and thereby the
   magnitude of its effect for a given delivered volume and concentration.
    [000901       Use of ablatants targeted at neural function such as guanethidine, reserpine,
10 tetrodotoxins, botulinum toxin, or other ablatants have particular significance in the treatment of
   hypertension, such as in the ablation of renal nerves. These ablatants may have some effect on
   capillary uptake but should have little to no effect on lymphatic uptake.
    [000911      It has been recently noted under by fluoroscopy that there is a significant increase in
   residence time for a contrast agent that has been injected in combination with a general ablatant
15 such as ethanol (ETOH) vs. the same contrast agent which was injected in combination with
   saline. In these experiments a cocktail comprising 30% Ultravist 300 (a contrast agent) and
   either 70% ETOH or 70% saline by volume were observed over time for decay in contrast as
   measure fluoroscopically. The observation was that the contrast was observable for a longer
   period of time in the surrounding tissues when injected with ETOH as compared to when
20 injected with saline. The general ablatant increased the residence time for the contrast agent
   compared to saline.
   [000921       One aspect of the disclosure is a method of treating hypertension (e.g., but not limited
   to, from within the renal artery, such as in the applications incorporated by reference herein) by
   delivering a cocktail of a general ablatant (e.g., ethanol, glacial acetic acid, etc.) and an ablatant
25 targeted at neural function. The targeted ablatant can be any of those listed herein. In one
   embodiment the cocktail comprises ethanol as the general ablatant and guanethidine as the
   targeted ablatant. The general ablatant will increase the residence time of the guanethidine and
   achieve a more successful ablation of the renal nerves.
   [00093]       One aspect of the disclosure is a method of treating hypertension by sequentially
30 delivering a relatively smaller amount of a general ablatant, followed or preceded by delivery of
   the targeted ablatant. The general and targeted ablatants can be any of those described herein or
   any other suitable ablatants. The amount of general ablatant will be an amount smaller than is
   typically delivered to ablate the nerves, but is sufficient to increase the residence time of the
   targeted ablatant by inhibiting the body's ability to clear the targeted ablatant.
