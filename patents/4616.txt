      CONTAINER AND CONTAINER ASSEMBLY HAVING THE SAME
   1. Field of the Utility model
             The present utility model relates to a container, and more particularly to
   a container and a container assembly having the same.
 5 2. Description of Related Art
             To buy food and drink at the same time, a user has to hold a container
   containing the food with one hand and hold a container containing drink with the
   other hand. To eat the food, the container containing the drink has to be put down
   first, so this is inconvenient in use.
10           Taiwan Utility Model No. M457704, entitled " Cap Container"
   (hereafter referred to as the '704 Patent) discloses a container that can be
   combined with a bottle and contain food inside. The container of the '704 Patent
   has an annular receiving recess for containing food inside and an engaging
   portion adapted to combine with a bottle. Accordingly, the container can be
15 combined with a bottle to serve as a cap for the bottle and can contain food, such
   as popcorns inside, so that the user can eat the food and drink at the same time.
             However, the conventional container can only be applied to contain the
   food that is not applied with source, such as popcorns. To contain the food that is
   usually applied with source, such as fries, potato chips, or chicken nuggets, an
20 additional container for the source is necessary. When seeing a movie and eating
   food such as fries, potato chips or chicken nuggets at the same time, the user has
   to hold the container containing the source with one hand and takes the food to
   eat with the other hand. When eating in this way, the container containing the
   source is put on the armrest. Accordingly, the conventional container is not
                                             1

   convenient in use.
            To overcome the shortcomings, the present utility model tends to
   provide a container assembly to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned
   problems.
 5          The main objective of the utility model is to provide a container
   assembly that can contain food and source at the same time.
            The container assembly has a first container and a second container. The
   first container has a body and a hollow protrusion. The body has a receiving
   space defined in the body and a top opening defined in a top of the body and
10 communicating with the receiving space. The hollow protrusion is formed on
   and protrudes from a bottom of the receiving space to form a connection recess
   in the hollow protrusion and a bottom opening in a bottom of the body and
   communicating with the connection recess. The second container is detachably
   combined with the first container and has a body and a protrusion. The
15 protrusion is formed in the body. The body of the first container has a diameter
   smaller than a diameter of the body of the second container. The body of the first
   container has a height smaller than a height of the body of the second container.
   The protrusion of the second container has a top inserted into the connection
   recess in the body of the first container, and thereby the first container is located
20 at a central portion on a top of the second container after the first container is
   combined with the second container.
            Other objects, advantages and novel features of the utility model will
   become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in
   conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

   hollow protrusion 22 and a bottom opening 221 in a bottom of the body and
   communicating with the connection recess 223. With the arrangement of the
   protrusion 22, the receiving space 24 is annular and is formed around the
   protrusion 22.
10          The second container 10 may be formed as a bowl and comprises a body
   and a protrusion 12. The body has a receiving space 14 defined in the body and a
   top opening 141 defined in a top of the body and communicating with the
   receiving space 14. The protrusion 12 is hollow, and is formed on and protrudes
   from a bottom of the receiving space 14 to form a bottom opening 121 in a
15 bottom of the body. The protrusion 12 has a top. With the arrangement of the
   protrusion 12, the receiving space 14 is annular and is formed around the
   protrusion 12. The body of the first container 20 has a diameter smaller than a
   diameter of the body of the second container 10, and the body of the first
   container 20 has a height smaller than a height of the body of the second
20 container 10. Preferably, the diameter of the body of the first container 20 is
   larger than one fourth of and smaller than one third of the diameter of the body of
   the second container 10.
            With reference to Fig. 3, the first container 20 is detachably combined
   with the second container 10. The shape of the connecting recess 223 of the first

   container 20 corresponds to the shape of the protrusion 12 of the second
   container 10. The protrusion 12 of the second container 10 has a length longer
   than a length of the protrusion 22 of the first container 20. Accordingly, the top
   of the protrusion 12 of the second container 10 can be inserted into the
 5 connection recess 223 of the first container 20, and the first container 20 is
   located at a central portion on a top of the second container 10 after the first
   container 20 is combined with the second container 10.
            Because the diameter of the body of the first container 20 is in the range
   of one third and one fourth of the body of the second container 10, the first
10 container 20 can only cover part of the top opening 141 of the body of the second
   container 10. In use, food, such as fries, potato chips or chicken nuggets can be
   put in the receiving space 14 in the second container 10, and source, such as
   ketchup or sweet and sour source can be put in the receiving space 24 in the first
   container 20. Accordingly, a user can take the food in the second container 10 to
15 dip the food in the source in the first container 20.
            With reference to Figs. 2, 3, and 7, the body of the second container 10
   further has an engagement portion 16 formed on the bottom of the body of the
   second container 10 to connect the second container 10 with beverage containers
   of different diameters. The engagement portion 16 is composed of multiple
20 engaging recesses 161, 163, 165 of different diameters to form the engagement
   portion 16 as a stepped recess. Preferably, the engagement portion 16 comprises

   (PET) bottle, a second engaging recess 163 applied to connect with an aluminum
   can, and a third engaging recess 165 applied to connect with a beverage cup. In
                                             5

   addition, the protrusion 12 of the second container 10 has a through hole 125
   defined through the top of the protrusion 12 of the second container 10 and
   communicating with the bottom opening 121. The protrusion 22 of the first
   container 20 has at least one slit 225 defined in the top of the protrusion 22 of the
 5 first container 20 at a position corresponding to the through hole 125 in the
   protrusion 12 of the second container 10. Accordingly, a straw can be inserted
   into the slit 225 and the through hole 125 and then into the bottle or cup
   connected with the container assembly in accordance with the utility model.
            With reference to Figs 2 and 3, each engaging recess 161, 163, 165 of the
10 engagement portion 16 has multiple engaging ribs 166, 167, 168, 169 formed on
   an inner surface of the engaging recess 161, 163, 165. Preferably, the engaging
   ribs 167 in the first engaging recess 163 are laterally formed on the inner surface
   of the engaging recess 163. The engaging ribs 167, 169 in the second or third
   engaging recess 163, 165 are longitudinally or laterally formed on the inner
15 surface of the engaging recess 163, 165. With the arrangement of the engaging
   ribs 166, 167, 168, 169, the container assembly can be connected securely with a
   beverage container. With reference to Fig. 7, in another embodiment of the
   second container 10, each engaging rib 169 in each engaging recess 161, 163,
   165 is an engaging knob. With reference to Figs. 10 and 11, each engaging rib
20 166 in each engaging recess 161, 163, 165 is longitudinally formed on the inner
   surface of the engaging recess 161, 163, 165 and has a length, a top end, and a
