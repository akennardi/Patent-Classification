20     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
          HFO-1234yf has been suggested for use as a refrigerant, heat
   transfer fluid, aerosol propellant, foam expansion agent, among other

           HCFC-243db, HCFO-1233xf, and HCFC-244bb are available from
   specialty chemical manufacturers, including SynQuest Laboratories, Inc.
   (Alachua, FL, U.S.A.) or may be made as described herein. For instance,
 5 HCFC-243db, HCFO-1233xf, and HCFC-244bb may be prepared by non
   catalytic chlorination of HFO-1243zf, as described in International Patent
   Application Publication No. W02008/054782, published May 8, 2008.
   Also, HCFO-1 233xf and HCFC-244bb may be prepared by catalytic
   fluorination of 243db as described in International Patent Application
10 Publication No. W02008/054781, published May 8, 2008. The additional
   compounds present in each disclosed composition will depend upon the
   method of manufacture.
           In some embodiments, certain precursor compounds to HCFC
   243db, HCFO-1 233xf, or HCFC-244bb contain impurities that then appear
15 as additional compounds in the described compositions. In other
   embodiments, these precursor compounds may themselves react during
   the 243db formation to form additional compounds that then appear in the
   HCFC-243db compositions. In other embodiments, the reaction conditions
   under which the HCFC-243db, HCFO-1 233xf, or HCFC-244bb are
20 produced also produce by-products, by which is meant adventitious
   reaction pathways may occur simultaneously to produce compounds other
   than HCFC-243db, HCFO-1 233xf or HCFC-244bb and the quantity and
   identity of these additional compounds will depend upon the particular
   conditions under which the HCFC-243db, HCFO-1 233xf or HCFC-244bb
25 are produced.
           In one embodiment, HFO-1 234yf may be produced in a single step
   from HCFC-243db. In another embodiment, the reaction sequence may
                                       -10-

   be carried out in a step-wise manner. In another embodiment, HCFO
   1233xf may be produced from HCFC-243db and then HCFO-1 233xf may
   be converted directly to HFO-1 234yf. In yet another embodiment, HCFC
   244bb may be produced from HCFC-243db and then the HCFC-244bb
 5 may be converted to HFO-1234yf.
   Fluorochlorination of HFO-1243zf
            In some embodiments, HFO-1243zf may be used to make HCFC
   243db, HCFO-1233xf, HCFC-244db, and/or HFO-1234yf by
10 fluorochlorination. HFO-1243zf is commercially available from E.I. DuPont
   de Nemours and Company (Wilmington, DE, USA).
            The fluorochlorination reaction may be carried out in the liquid or
   vapor phase. For liquid phase embodiments of the invention, the reaction
   of HFO-1243zf with HF and C12 may be conducted in a liquid-phase
15 reactor operating in batch, semi-batch, semi-continuous, or continuous
   modes. In the batch mode, HFO-1243zf, C12, and HF are combined in an
   autoclave or other suitable reaction vessel and heated to the desired
   temperature.
            In one embodiment, this reaction is carried out in semi-batch mode
20 by feeding C12 to a liquid-phase reactor containing HF and HFO-1243zf or
   by feeding HFO-1 243zf and C12 to a liquid-phase reactor containing HF, or
   by feeding C12 to a mixture containing HF and reaction products formed by
   initially heating HFO-1 243zf and HF. In another embodiment, HF and C12
   may be fed to a liquid-phase reactor containing a mixture of HFO-1243zf
25 and reaction products formed by reacting HF, C12, and HFO-1243zf. In
   another embodiment of the liquid-phase process, HF, C12, and HFO
   1243zf may be fed concurrently in the desired stoichiometric ratio to the
   reactor containing a mixture of HF and reaction products formed by
   reacting HF, C12, and HFO-1243zf.
30          Suitable temperatures for the reaction of HF and C12 with HFO
   1243zf in the liquid-phase reactor are, in one embodiment, from about
   800C to about 1800C, and in another embodiment, from about 100 C to
                                          -11-

   about 1500C. Higher temperatures typically result in greater conversion of
   the HFO-1243zf.
           A suitable molar ratio of HF to total amount of HFO-1 243zf fed to
   the liquid-phase reactor is, in one embodiment, at least stoichiometric and
 5 in another embodiment, is from about 5:1 to about 100:1. Of note are
   embodiments wherein the molar ratio of HF to HFO-1243zf is from about
   8:1 to about 50:1. A suitable molar ratio of C12 to total amount of HFO
   1243zf fed to the liquid-phase reactor is from about 1:1 to about 2:1.
           The reactor pressure in the liquid-phase process is not critical and
io in batch reactions is usually the autogenous pressure of the system at the
   reaction temperature. The pressure of the system increases as hydrogen
   chloride is formed by replacement of hydrogen substituents by chlorine,
   and by replacement of chlorine substituents by fluorine in the starting
   materials and intermediate reaction products. In a continuous process it is
15 possible to set the pressure of the reactor in such a way that the lower
   boiling products of the reaction, such as HCI, HFO-1 234yf (CF3CF=CH2),
   E/Z-1234ze (E/Z-CF3CH=CHF), and HFC-245cb (CF3CF2CH3), are vented
   from the reactor, optionally through a packed column or condenser. In this
   manner, higher boiling intermediates remain in the reactor and the volatile
20 products are removed. Typical reactor pressures are from about 20 psig
   (239 kPa) to about 1,000 psig (6,994 kPa).
           In some embodiments, in which the reaction is conducted using a
   liquid-phase process, catalysts which may be used include carbon, AIF3,
   BF3, FeCl3-aFa (where a     = 0 to 3), FeX3 supported on carbon, SbC3-aFa,
25 AsF3, MC15-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M = Sb, Nb, Ta, or Mo), and M'C14-cFc
   (where c = 0 to 4, and M' = Sn, Ti, Zr, or Hf). In another embodiment,
   catalysts for the liquid phase process are MC15-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M
   =  Sb, Nb, or Ta).
           In another embodiment, the reaction of HF and C12 with HFO
30 1243zf is carried out in the vapor phase. Typically a heated reactor is
   used. A number of reactor configurations are possible including horizontal
   or vertical orientation of the reactor as well as the sequence of reaction of
                                           -12-

   the HFO-1243zf with HF and C12. In one embodiment of the invention, the
   HFO-1 243zf may be initially vaporized and fed to the reactor as a gas.
           In another embodiment of the invention, HFO-1243zf may be
   contacted with HF, optionally in the presence of C12, in a pre-reactor prior
 5 to reaction in the vapor-phase reactor.    In one embodiment, the pre
   reactor may be empty. In another embodiment, the reactor is filled with a
   suitable packing such as nickel-copper alloys commercially available from
   Special Metals Corp. (New Hartford, New York) under the trademark
   Monel*, (hereinafter "Monel*") nickel-based alloys commercially available
io from Haynes International (Kokomo, Indiana) under the trademark
   Hastelloy®, (hereinafter "Hastelloy*") or other nickel alloy turnings or wool,
   or other material inert to HCI and HF which allows efficient mixing of HFO
   1243zf and HF vapor.
           Suitable temperatures for the pre-reactor in one embodiment are
15 from about 800C to about 2500C, in another embodiment, from about
   100 C to about 2000C. Temperatures greater than about 1000C result in
   some conversion of the HFO-1 243zf to compounds having a higher
   degree of fluorination. Higher temperatures result in greater conversion of
   the HFO-1243zf entering the reactor and a greater degree of fluorination in
20 the converted compounds. Under these conditions, for example, a mixture
   of HF, C12, and HFO-1243zf is converted to a mixture containing
   predominantly HCFC-243db and HCFC-244db (CF3CHCICH2F).
           The degree of fluorination reflects the number of fluorine
   substituents that replace chlorine substituents in the HFO-1 243zf and their
25 chlorinated products. For example, HCFC-253fb represents a higher
   degree of fluorination than HCC-250fb and HFO-1243zf represents a
   higher degree of fluorination than HCO-1 240zf.
           The molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1 243zf in the pre
   reactor is in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric ratio of HF to
30 the total amount of HFO-1 243zf to about 50:1. In another embodiment,
   the molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1243zf in the pre-reactor
   is from about twice the stoichiometric ratio of HF to the total amount of
   HFO-1 243zf to about 30:1. In another embodiment, the molar ratio of HF
                                         -13-

   to the total amount of HFO-1243zf is present in the pre-reactor, and no
   additional amount of HF is added to the vapor-phase reaction zone.
            In another embodiment, the HFO-1 243zf may be contacted with C12
   in a pre-reactor, optionally in the presence of HF, prior to reaction in the
 5 vapor-phase reactor.
            Suitable temperatures for the pre-reactor for this embodiment of the
   invention are from about 800C to about 2500C, preferably from about
   100 C to about 2000C. Under these conditions, at least a portion of HFO
   1243zf is converted to HCFC-243db. Higher temperatures typically result
io in a higher degree of halogenation of the HFO-1 243zf.
            The degree of halogenation reflects the total number of halogen
   substituents (chlorine plus fluorine) in a halopropane and/or halopropene
   product. For example, HFO-1234yf has a higher degree of halogenation
   (i.e., 4) than does HFO-1243zf (i.e., 3).
15          The molar ratio of C12 to the total amount of HFO-1243zf is, in one
   embodiment, from about 0.5:1 to about 2:1. In another embodiment, the
   molar ratio of C12 to the total amount of the HFO-1 243zf is from about 1.1:1
   to about 1:1.
            In one embodiment, the HFO-1243zf is vaporized, optionally in the
20 presence of HF, and fed to a pre-reactor or to a vapor-phase reactor along
   with HF and C12.
            Suitable temperatures for the vapor-phase reaction are from about
   1200C to about 5001C. Temperatures of from about 2500C to about
   3500C favor the formation of HFO-1 234yf and HFC-245cb. Temperatures
25 of from about 3500C to about 4500C favor the formation of HFO-1234ze,
   HFC-245fa, and HCFO-1 233zd. At temperatures of from about 2500C to
   about 4500C, some HCFO-1 233xf is also produced. Higher temperatures
   result in greater conversion of HFO-1 243zf and higher degrees of
   fluorination and halogenation in the converted compounds.
30          Suitable reactor pressures for the vapor-phase reactor may be from
   about 1 to about 30 atmospheres. A pressure of about 15 to about 25
   atmospheres may be advantageously employed to facilitate separation of
   HCI from other reaction products, and the suitable reaction time may vary
                                           -14-

   from about 1 to about 120 seconds, preferably from about 5 to about 60
   seconds.
           The molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1 243zf for the
   vapor-phase reaction is, in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric
 5 ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1243zf to about 50:1 and, in
   another embodiment, from about 10:1 to about 30:1.
           In one embodiment, a catalyst is used in the reaction zone for the
   vapor-phase reaction of HF and C12 with HFO-1243zf. Chlorofluorination
   catalysts which may be used in the vapor phase reaction include carbon;
io graphite; alumina; fluorided alumina; aluminum fluoride; alumina
   supported on carbon; aluminum fluoride supported on carbon; fluorided
   alumina supported on carbon; magnesium fluoride supported on aluminum
   fluoride; metals (including elemental metals, metal oxides, metal halides,
   and/or other metal salts); metals supported on aluminum fluoride; metals
15 supported on fluorided alumina; metals supported on alumina; and metals
   supported on carbon; mixtures of metals.
           Suitable metals for use as catalysts (optionally supported on
   alumina, aluminum fluoride, fluorided alumina, or carbon) include
   chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium,
20 iridium, platinum, manganese, rhenium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum,
   titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, copper, silver, gold, zinc, and/or metals
   having an atomic number of 58 through 71 (i.e., the lanthanide metals). In
   one embodiment, when used on a support, the total metal content of the
   catalyst will be from about 0.1 to about 20 percent by weight based on the
25 total weight of the catalyst; in another embodiment from about 0.1 to about
   10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the catalyst.
           Suitable chlorofluorination catalysts for the vapor-phase reactions
   include chromium-containing catalysts including chromium(IlI) oxide
   (Cr203); Cr203 with other metals such as magnesium halides or zinc
3o halides supported on Cr203; chromium(IIl) halides supported on carbon;
   mixtures of chromium and magnesium (including elemental metals, metal
   oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally supported on
   graphite; and mixtures of chromium and other metals (including elemental
                                         -15-

   metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally
   supported on graphite, alumina, or aluminum halides such as aluminum
   fluoride.
           Chromium-containing catalysts are well known in the art. They may
 5 be prepared by either precipitation methods or impregnation methods as
   generally described by Satterfield on pages 87-112 in Heterogeneous
   Catalysis in Industrial Practice, 2 nd edition (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991).
           Of note are chlorofluorination catalysts that comprise at least one
   chromium-containing component selected from the group consisting of
io crystalline alpha-chromium oxide where from about 0.05 atom % to about
   6 atom % of the chromium atoms in the alpha-chromium oxide lattice are
   replaced by trivalent cobalt atoms, and crystalline alpha-chromium oxide
   where from about 0.05 atom % to about 6 atom % of the chromium atoms
   in the alpha-chromium oxide lattice are replaced by trivalent cobalt atoms
15 which has been treated with a fluorinating agent. These catalysts,
   including their preparation, have been disclosed in U. S. Patent
   Application Publication US2005/0228202.
           Optionally, the metal-containing catalysts described above can be
   pretreated with HF. This pretreatment can be accomplished, for example,
20 by placing the metal-containing catalyst in a suitable container, and
   thereafter, passing HF over the metal-containing catalyst. In one
   embodiment, such container can be the reactor used to perform the
   chlorofluorination reaction. In one embodiment, the pretreatment time is
   from about 15 to about 300 minutes, and the pretreatment temperature is
25 from about 2000C to about 450C.
           In one embodiment, the product mixture comprises HFC-245cb,
   HFC-245fa, HFO-1 234yf, HFO-1 234ze, HCFO-1 233zd and HCFO-1 233xf.
           In one embodiment, halopropane by-products that may be formed

   product compounds from such a product mixture.
25 Fluorination of HCFC-243db
           In some embodiments, HCFC-243db may be used to make HCFC
   HCFO-1 233xf, HCFC-244db, and/or HFO-1 234yf by fluorination. These
   reactions are shown in FIG. 1. The fluorination reaction may be carried
   out in the liquid or vapor phase. For liquid phase embodiments of the
30 invention, the reaction of HCFC-243db with HF may be conducted in a
   liquid-phase reactor operating in batch, semi-batch, semi-continuous, or
   continuous modes. In the batch mode, starting HCFC-243db and HF are
                                         -17-

   combined in an autoclave or other suitable reaction vessel and heated to
   the desired temperature.
            In one embodiment, this reaction is carried out in semi-batch mode
   by feeding HF to a liquid-phase reactor containing HCFC-243db or by
 5 feeding HCFC-243db to a liquid-phase reactor containing HF, or by
   feeding HF to a mixture containing HF and reaction products formed by
   initially heating HCFC-243db and HF. In another embodiment, HF may be
   fed to a liquid-phase reactor containing a mixture of HCFC-243db and
   reaction products formed by the reaction of HF, and HCFC-243db. In
io another embodiment of the liquid-phase process, HF, and HCFC-243db
   may be fed concurrently in the desired stoichiometric ratio to the reactor
   containing a mixture of HF and reaction products formed by reacting HF,
   and HCFC-243db.
            Suitable temperatures for the reaction of HF with HCFC-243db in
15 the liquid-phase reactor are, in one embodiment, from about 800C to about
   1800C, in another embodiment, from about 1000C to about 1500C. Higher
   temperatures typically result in greater conversion of the HCFC-243db.
            A suitable molar ratio of HF to HCFC-243db fed to the liquid-phase
   reactor is, in one embodiment, at least stoichiometric and, in another
20 embodiment, is from about 5:1 to about 100:1. Of note are embodiments
   wherein the molar ratio of HF to HCFC-243db is from about 8:1 to about
   50:1.
            The reactor pressure in the liquid-phase process is not critical and
   in batch reactions is usually the autogenous pressure of the system at the
25 reaction temperature. The pressure of the system increases as hydrogen
   chloride is formed by replacement of chlorine substituents by fluorine in
   the HCFC-243db and intermediate reaction products. In a continuous
   process it is possible to set the pressure of the reactor in such a way that
   the lower boiling products of the reaction, such as HCI, CF3CF=CH2, and
3o E/Z-CF3CH=CHF, are vented from the reactor, optionally through a
   packed column or condenser. In this manner, higher boiling intermediates
   remain in the reactor and the volatile products are removed. Typical
                                          -18-

   reactor pressures are from about 20 psig (239 kPa) to about 1,000 psig
   (6,994 kPa).
            In embodiments in which the reaction is conducted using a liquid
   phase process, catalysts which may be used include carbon, AIF3, BF3,
 5 FeCl3-aFa (where a = 0 to 3), FeX3 supported on carbon, SbC13-aFa, AsF3,
   MCI5-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M = Sb, Nb, Ta, or Mo), and M'Cl4-cFo
   (where c = 0 to 4, and M' = Sn, Ti, Zr, or Hf). In one embodiment,
   catalysts for the liquid phase process are MC15-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M
   = Sb, Nb, or Ta).
10          In one embodiment, the reaction of HF with HCFC-243db is carried
   out in the vapor phase. Typically a heated reactor is used. A number of
   reactor configurations are possible including horizontal or vertical
   orientation of the reactor as well as the sequence of reaction of the
   starting materials with HF. In one embodiment, the HCFC-243db may be
15 initially vaporized and fed to the reactor as a gas.
            In another embodiment of the invention, the HCFC-243db may be
   contacted with HF in a pre-reactor prior to reaction in the vapor-phase
   reactor. The pre-reactor may be empty, but is preferably filled with a
   suitable packing such as nickel-copper alloys commercially available from
20 Special Metals Corp. (New Hartford, New York) under the trademark
   Monel*, nickel-based alloys such as Hastelloy*, or other nickel alloy
   turnings or wool, or other material inert to HCI and HF which allows
   efficient mixing of HCFC-243db and HF vapor.
            Suitable temperatures for the pre-reactor in one embodiment are
25 from about 800C to about 2500C, in another embodiment, from about
   100 C to about 200CC. Temperatures greater than about 1000C result in
   some conversion of the HCFC-243db to compounds having a higher
   degree of fluorination. Higher temperatures result in greater conversion of
   the HCFC-243db entering the reactor and a greater degree of fluorination
30 in the converted compounds. Under these conditions, for example, a
   mixture of HF and HCFC-243db is converted to a mixture containing
   predominantly HF, HCI, HCFC-243db, HCFC-244db (CF3CHCICH2F), and
   HCFO-1 233xf.
                                         -19-

           The degree of fluorination reflects the number of fluorine
   substituents that replace chlorine substituents in the HCFC-243db and
   their fluorinated products. For example, HFO-1 234yf represents a higher
   degree of fluorination than HCFO-1233xf.
 5         The molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HCFC-243db in the
   pre-reactor is, in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric ratio of
   HF to the total amount of HCFC-243db to about 50:1. In another
   embodiment, the molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HCFC-243db in
   the pre-reactor is from about twice the stoichiometric ratio of HF to the
io total amount of HCFC-243db to about 30:1. In another embodiment, the
   molar ratio of HF to the amount of HCFC-243db is present in the pre
   reactor, and no additional amount of HF is added to the vapor-phase
   reaction zone.
            In one embodiment, the HCFC-243db and HF are vaporized and
15 fed to a pre-reactor or to a vapor-phase reactor.
           Suitable temperatures for the vapor-phase reaction are from about
   1200C to about 5000C. Temperatures in the range of from about 3000C to
   about 3500C favor the formation of HFO-1234yf and HFC-245cb and
   HCFO-1 233xf. Temperatures in the range of from about 3500C to about
20 4500C favor the additional formation of HFO-1234ze, HFC-245fa, and
   HCFO-1 233zd. Higher temperatures result in greater conversion of
   HCFC-243db and greater degrees of fluorination in the converted
   products. Reactor temperatures of from about 1500C to about 275C
   favor the formation of HCFO-1 233xf as the major product.
25         Suitable reactor pressures for the vapor-phase reactor may be from
   about 1 to about 30 atmospheres. A pressure of about 15 to about 25
   atmospheres may be advantageously employed to facilitate separation of
   HCI from other reaction products, and the suitable reaction time may vary
   from about 1 to about 120 seconds, preferably from about 5 to about 60
30 seconds.
           The molar ratio of HF to the amount of HCFC-243db for the vapor
   phase reaction is, in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric ratio
                                         -20-

   of HF to the amount of HCFC-243db to about 50:1 and, in another
   embodiment, from about 10:1 to about 30:1.
           In some embodiments, a catalyst is used in the reaction zone for
   the vapor-phase reaction of HF with HCFC-243db. Fluorination catalysts
 5 which may be used in the vapor phase reaction include carbon; graphite;
   alumina; fluorided alumina; aluminum fluoride; alumina supported on
   carbon; aluminum fluoride supported on carbon; fluorided alumina
   supported on carbon; magnesium fluoride supported on aluminum fluoride;
   metals (including elemental metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or
io other metal salts); metals supported on aluminum fluoride; metals
   supported on fluorided alumina; metals supported on alumina; and metals
   supported on carbon; mixtures of metals.
           Suitable metals for use as catalysts (optionally supported on
   alumina, aluminum fluoride, fluorided alumina, or carbon) include
15 chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium,
   iridium, platinum, manganese, rhenium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum,
   titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, copper, silver, gold, zinc, and/or metals
   having an atomic number of 58 through 71 (i.e., the lanthanide metals). In
   some embodiments, when used on a support, the total metal content of
20 the catalyst will be from about 0.1 to about 20 percent by weight based on
   the total weight of the catalyst; in another embodiment, from about 0.1 to
   about 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the catalyst.
           Typical fluorination catalysts for the vapor-phase reactions in this
   invention include chromium-containing catalysts including chromium(III)
25 oxide (Cr203); Cr203 with other metals such as magnesium halides or zinc
   halides supported on Cr203; chromium(III) halides supported on carbon;
   mixtures of chromium and magnesium (including elemental metals, metal
   oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally supported on
   graphite; and mixtures of chromium and other metals (including elemental
30 metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally
   supported on graphite, alumina, or aluminum halides such as aluminum
   fluoride.

   be prepared by either precipitation methods or impregnation methods as
   generally described by Satterfield on pages 87-112 in Heterogeneous

io where from about 0.05 atom % to about 6 atom % of the chromium atoms
   in the alpha-chromium oxide lattice are replaced by trivalent cobalt atoms
   which has been treated with a fluorinating agent. These catalysts,

   Application Publication US2005/0228202.
15         Optionally, the metal-containing catalysts described above can be

   embodiment of this invention, such container can be the reactor used to
20 perform the fluorination reaction in this invention. Typically, the
   pretreatment time is from about 15 to about 300 minutes, and the
   pretreatment temperature is from about 2000C to about 4500C.

   General Procedure for Product Analysis
          The following general procedure is illustrative of the method used
   for analyzing the products of fluorination reactions. Part of the total
   reactor effluent was sampled on-line for organic product analysis using a
30 gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (GC/MS).
   The gas chromatography utilized a 20 ft. (6.1 m) long x 1/8 in. (0.32 cm)
   diameter tube containing perfluorinated polyether sold under the
   trademark Krytox@ by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company
                                         -25-

   (hereinafter "DuPont") of Wilmington, Delaware on an inert carbon
   support. The helium flow was 30 mL/min (5.0 x 10-7 m3 /sec). Gas
   chromatographic conditions were 600C for an initial hold period of
   three minutes followed by temperature programming to 2000C at a rate of
 5 60C/minute.
   Preparation of 98%Chromium/2%Cobalt Catalyst
          A solution of 784.30 grams Cr(N03)3[9(H20)] (1.96 moles) and
   11.64 grams Co(N03)2[6(H20)] (0.040 mole) was prepared in 2000 mL of
10 deionized water. The solution was treated dropwise with 950 mL of 7.4 M
   aqueous ammonia until the pH reached about 8.5. The slurry was stirred
   overnight at room temperature and then evaporated to dryness in air at
   110-120"C. The dried catalyst was then calcined in air at 4000C for 24
   hours prior to use.

                         Chlorofluorination of HFO-1243zf
          The 98% chromium/2% cobalt catalyst prepared above (21.4
30 grams, 15 mL, -12 to +20 mesh, (1.68 to 0.84 mm)) was placed in a 5/8"
   (1.58 cm) diameter Inconel@ (Special Metals Corp. (New Hartford, New
   York)) nickel alloy reactor tube heated in a fluidized sand bath. The
   catalyst was pre-fluorinated by treatment with HF as follows. The catalyst
                                        -26-

   was heated from 450C to 1750C in a flow of nitrogen (50 cc/min) over the
   course of about 1.5 hours. HF was then admitted to the reactor at a flow
   rate of 50 cc/min for 1.3 hours at a temperature of 1750C. The reactor
   nitrogen flow was decreased to 20 cc/min and the HF flow increased to
 5 80 cc/min; this flow was maintained for 0.3 hour. The reactor temperature
   was then gradually increased to 4000C over 1 hour. After this period, the
   HF and nitrogen flow was stopped and the reactor brought to the desired
   operating temperature. A flow of HF vapor, HFO-1 243zf, and C12 then
   started through the reactor. Part of the reactor effluent was analyzed by
io on line GC/MS.
           The results of the chlorofluorination of HFO-1243zf over the 98/2
   Cr/Co catalyst at various operating temperatures and indicated molar
   ratios of HF, HFO-1243zf and C12 are shown in Table 2; analytical data is
   given in units of GC area %. The nominal catalyst bed volume was 15 cc;
15 the contact time (CT) was 15 seconds. Examples 1 and 2 were carried out
   in the absence of the catalyst.

20                          Fluorination of HCFC-243db
           The 98% chromium/2% cobalt catalyst prepared above (21.4
   grams, 15 mL, -12 to +20 mesh, (1.68 to 0.84 mm)) was placed in a 5/8"
   (1.58 cm) diameter Inconel@ nickel alloy reactor tube heated in a fluidized
   sand bath. The catalyst was pre-fluorinated by treatment with HF as
25 follows. The catalyst was heated from 45 0C to 1750C in a flow of nitrogen
   (50 cc/min) over the course of about 1.5 hours. HF was then admitted to
   the reactor at a flow rate of 50 cc/min for 1.3 hours at a temperature of
   1750C. The reactor nitrogen flow was decreased to 20 cc/min and the HF
   flow increased to 80 cc/min; this flow was maintained for 0.3 hour. The
30 reactor temperature was then gradually increased to 4000C over 1 hour.
   After this period, the HF and nitrogen flow was stopped and the reactor
   brought to the desired operating temperature. A flow of HF vapor and
                                          -28-

    HCFC-243db (CF3CHCICH2CI) was then started through the reactor. Part
    of the reactor effluent was analyzed by on line GC/MS.
            The results of the fluorination of HFC-243db over the 98/2 Cr/Co
    catalyst at various operating temperatures and indicated molar ratios of
 5  HF and HCFC-243db are shown in Table 3; analytical data is given in
    units of GC area %. The nominal catalyst bed volume was 15 cc; the

           The contents of a small PTFE vial containing 20 grams of viscous
   SbF5 were poured into a dry 400 mL Hastelloy* shaker tube. The tube
   was closed and was pressurized with nitrogen for leak testing. The shaker
   tube was then cooled to less than - 40 2C with dry ice, slowly vented, and
10 then evacuated. 75 grams (3.75-moles) of anhydrous HF was condensed
   into the shaker tube followed by 165 grams (1.26-moles) of HCFO-1 233xf.
   The shaker tube was placed in a barricade and shaking was started.
           The shaker tube was agitated at ambient temperature (~20-230C)
   and the pressure was 21 to 25 psig. After 2 hours, shaking was stopped
15 and 150 mL of water was carefully pumped into the shaker tube. The tube
   was left overnight and then cooled to 0 to 50C in an ice bath before
   depressurization and transferring the contents to a plastic container. The
   container was kept on ice.
           The container contents were poured into a polypropylene
20 separatory funnel containing some ice. The lower organic layer was light
   amber in appearance. The organic layer was separated into a media
   bottle made of a glass sold under the trademark of Pyrex® by Corning
   (Lowell, MA) (hereinafter "Pyrex") containing ~50-mL of 4 molar (pH 7)

   phosphate buffer and ice (~1 00-mL). The organic layer was again
   separated and poured into a dry Pyrex* media bottle containing a small
   amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Crude yield was 164.3 grams
   (about 120-mL, 86%).
 5         GC/MS of the crude material showed that it was mostly HCFC
   244bb. Other components included 0.13% 245cb, 0.09% 245eb, 0.16%
   1233xf, and other byproducts totaling 12.2%.
