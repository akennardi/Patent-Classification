25 Overview of exemplary gaming system
   Figure 1 shows an example gaming system 1 where a player
   tracking system 150 is in data communication over a
   network 2, such as an Ethernet, with a bank of four gaming
30 devices in the form of standalone gaming machines 10. Each
   gaming system has an associated player tracking module 50
   adapted to communicate with the player tracking system
   150. The player tracking module 50 is arranged to read
   information from a player card, for example employing a
35 magnetic stripe reader or an RFID reader depending on the
   type of card employed. A player identifier is reported to
   the player tracking system 150. The player tracking system
                                              9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                               - 10
   has a player tracker 161 implemented by processor 160
   executing player tracking software stored in the memory
   170 in accordance with techniques know in the art. For
   example, by employing the Sentinel system provided by
 5 Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd.    As is known in
   the art, the player tracker 161 receives reporting
   information from the PTM 50 indicative of activity on the
   gaming machine 10, for example:  amount wagered, number of
   games played, amount won, etc. Player tracker 161 updates
10 a relevant player record in player database 172 based on
   the activity. As is known in the art, the player activity
   may result
   in the accumulation of loyalty points that may be redeemed
   for goods or services at later dates.
15
   As will be described in further detail below, the bonus
   controller is arranged to respond to trigger conditions
   arising from player tracking by the player tracker to make
   bonus awards. In the embodiment, a trigger condition
20 results in an initial award being made to one of the
   gaming devices 10  (a "trigger gaming device") and further
   awards being made to eligible ones of the plurality of
   gaming devices 10 within the venue based on their physical
   proximity to the triggering.
25
   Gaming devices
   Gaming devices capable of participating in the method of
   gaming and bonus system of the embodiment can take any
30 suitable form including stand alone gaming machines and
   server based gaming terminals.
   A gaming device in the form of a gaming machine 10 is
   illustrated in Figure 2.   The gaming machine 10 includes a
35 console 12 having a display 14 on which are displayed
   representations of a game 16 that can be played by a
   player. A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a
                                               9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                              - 11
   bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to interact with
   the gaming machine, in particular during game play. The
   mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input mechanism 24 which
   in this example includes a coin input chute 24A and a bill
 5 collector 24B. Other credit input mechanisms may also be
   employed, for example, a card reader for reading a smart
   card, debit card or credit card. Other gaming machines may
   be configured for ticket in that they have a ticket reader
   for reading tickets having a value and crediting the
10 player based on the face value of the ticker. As described
   above, a player tracking module  (not shown in Figure 1)
   having a reading device may also be provided for the
   purpose of reading a player tracking device, for example
   as part of a loyalty program. The player tracking device
15 may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any other
   portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
20 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player tracking module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
25 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game. Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12. A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
30 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device. Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
35 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device. The top box 26 may also include
                                               9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                              - 12
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.
 5 Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
10 having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102. Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
15 volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
20 including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100. The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
25 own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices. A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102. Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
30 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
35 screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism), a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
                                               9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                              - 13
   coin output mechanism 111. Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
 5 screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used.
10 In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
15 database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database. In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
20 communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103. The memory 103 includes RAM 103A,
25 EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C. The RAM 103A
   typically temporarily holds program files for execution by
   the processor 102 and related data. The EPROM 103B may be
   a boot ROM device and/or may contain some system or game
   related code. The mass storage device 103C is typically
30 used to store game programs, the integrity of which may be
   verified and/or authenticated by the processor 102 using
   protected code from the EPROM 103B or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
35 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
                                               9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                              - 14
   In a client server architecture a gaming device is
   provided by a gaming client and game server (and
   optionally other gaming network components). A gaming
 5 client has a similar outward appearance to gaming machine
   10 but the game server implements most or all of the game
   and as such acts as the game controller while the terminal
   operated by the player essentially provides only the
   player interface. The gaming terminal receives player
10 instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
   machine for display.  Further details of a client/server
   gaming architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213 and
   PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
15 incorporated herein by reference. In such an embodiment, a
   linked game controller can be provided, for example, by a
   dedicated server in data communication with the game
   server.
20 Figure 5 shows that a gaming device may be connected
   within a gaming network 200 which provides additional
   and/or enhanced functionality. The gaming network 200
   includes a network 201, which for example may be an
   Ethernet network. Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in
25 three banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5,
   are connected to the network 201. The gaming machines 202
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3. While
   banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure
30 5, banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also
   envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201. For example, the displays 204 may be
35 associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
                                              9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   A player tracking system with a bonus controller can be
 5 provided within such a network 200 by player tracking
   server 205.
   A database management server 206 may manage storage of
   game programs and associated data for downloading or
10 access by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.
   Typically, if the gaming system enables players to
   participate in a Jackpot game, a Jackpot server 207 will
   be provided to perform accounting functions for the
   Jackpot game.
15
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
20 relating to particular games. An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
25 systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
30 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers. For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided. For example, the game
35 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided. Further, persons skilled in the art
                                              9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                              - 16
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

   Referring to Figure 6, there is shown an exemplary layout
   600 of a casino floor from which it will be apparent that
   the casino floor includes a plurality of banks 610A to
   610P, each including a plurality of gaming devices, in the
10 form of gaming machines such as slot machines, poker
   machines or the like. As indicated in Figure 1, the memory
   170 stores layout data 171 representative of the physical
   layout of the gaming machines shown in Figure 6A.
15 The player tracking system 150 may be arranged to display
   the layout of gaming machines graphically to a user of the
   system, for example, a casino manager - e.g. at a user
   terminal. In which case, the layout data may be as shown
   in Figure 6A. In other embodiments, the layout data may
20 include co-ordinates representative of location of the
   gaming machines on the casino floor. For example, co
   ordinates relative to a particular reference point or a
   defined feature of the gaming venue such as a cashier
   station. In some embodiments, the layout data may include
25 both graphical data and co-ordinate data.
   An operator of the player tracking system uses a terminal
   to establish bonus rule data 173 which defines how a bonus
   event can be triggered as well as how additional bonus
30 awards are made responsive to the triggering event. In the
   embodiment, the user defines a plurality of radial zones
   of defined physical dimensions such that when a triggering
   event occurs, bonus awards are made to each eligible
   gaming device within a defined physical proximity of the
35 position of a gaming device in respect of which the
   triggering event occurs. In the embodiment, the bonus
   controller 162 includes an initial prize awarder 710 which
                                              9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                              - 17
   determines based on the bonus rule data 173 that a bonus
   award is to be made to one of the gaming devices on the
   gaming venue floor 600. The awarding of this initial bonus
   award triggers the award of bonuses to other eligible
 5 gaming devices.
   In this respect, in the embodiment, eligible gaming
   devices are those where a player tracking device has been
   presented to a player tracking module associated with the
10 gaming device. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 7, bonus
   controller 162 includes an eligibility module 730 which
   applies the eligibility criteria of the gaming device
   being active within the player tracking system based on
   information communicated or obtained from the player
15 tracker 161.
   Typically, the trigger for an initial prize awarder 710
   awarding an initial prize to one of the gaming devices
   will be the fact that the player tracker 161 updates the
20 player database 172 to reflect some criteria. For example,
   if the player has achieved a defined turnover criteria.
   Alternatively, the bonus award to the additional machines
   within a physical proximity of the triggering gaming
   device may occur as a result of a player of the particular
25 gaming device winning a particular prize through play of
   the gaming device.
   In other embodiments, eligibility to be awarded the bonus
   award may be based on a different or additional criterion.
30 For example, to gaming devices deemed to be active within
   the relevant periods. For example, if the player placed a
   wager within the defined period prior to the initial prize
   awarder 710 awarding the initial prize to one of the
   gaming devices.
35
   As is shown in Figure 6B, additional bonus awards are made
   to gaming devices within a physical proximity of the
                                              9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                              - 18
   triggering gaming device 621. In this embodiment, the
   triggering gaming device 621 is the second gaming machine
   from the top in the right hand column of the gaming
   machines of gaming machine bank 610M. That is, this bank
 5 contains 14 separate gaming machines arranged back to back
   in two columns.  A number of zones are defined relative to
   the triggering gaming device 621 namely a closest zone
   622, a second closest zone 623, a third closest zone 624
   and a fourth closest zone 625 each of which are based on
10 the radial physical proximity of the gaming devices to the
   triggering gaming device. Accordingly, it will be
   appreciated that the bonus controller 720 applies the
   proximity rules defining the zones with the zone
   determiner 720 to determine machines within the proximity
15 of the triggering gaming device. The machine identifier
   740 determines which of the gaming devices within those
   zones are eligible based on the eligibility criteria.
   Different prizes are awarded based on the zones such that
   the closest zone 622 results in a higher bonus award than
20 the furthest zone 625 and accordingly, based on the
   identified zones and the identity of the machines within
   zones 622 to 625, a bonus prize awarder 750 awards
   different prizes to different ones of the eligible
   machines.
25
   Depending on the embodiment, the award may be, for
   example, in the form of cash, credits credited to a gaming
   machine, credits credited to a player loyalty account,
   coupons which can be redeemed from services, physical
30 prizes, a multiplier bonus that can be applied to the
   gaming machine and/or to points accumulated by the player
   with the player tracking system 150 during the defined
   period.
35 Persons skilled in other embodiments, different techniques
   may be employed to identify the initial triggering device,
   such as it being selected at random. Further, it will be
                                              9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                               - 19
   appreciated that the triggering device need not
   necessarily itself be awarded a prize, instead prizes
   could only be awarded around the triggering device.
 5 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate the above
   components are the core components of a player tracking
   system with bonus controller but other components may be
   present in a bonus game controller.
10 Figure 8 illustrates a flowchart of an example method.
   Figure 8 depicts an example flow diagram representative of
   process(es) that may be implemented using, for example,
   computer readable instructions that may be used to
   facilitate game play and/or gaming tax management. The
15 example process(es) of Figure 8 may be performed using a
   processor, a controller and/or any other suitable
   processing device. For example, the example process(es) of
   Figure 8 may be implemented using coded instructions
    (e.g., computer readable instructions) stored on a
20 tangible computer readable medium such as a flash memory,
   a read-only memory (ROM), and/or a random-access memory
    (RAM).  As used herein, the term tangible computer
   readable medium is expressly defined to include any type
   of computer readable storage and to exclude propagating
25 signals.
   Additionally or alternatively, the example process(es) of
   Figure 8 may be implemented using coded instructions
    (e.g., computer readable instructions) stored on a non
30 transitory computer readable medium such as a flash
   memory, a read-only memory (ROM), a random-access memory
    (RAM), a cache, or any other storage media in which
   information is stored for any duration (e.g., for extended
   time periods, permanently, brief instances, for
35 temporarily buffering, and/or for caching of the
   information). As used herein, the term non-transitory
   computer readable medium is expressly defined to include
                                               9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                               - 20
   any type of computer readable medium and to exclude
   propagating signals.
   Alternatively, some or all of the example process(es) of
 5 Figure 8 may be implemented using any combination(s) of
   application specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC(s)),
   programmable logic device(s)   (PLD(s)), field programmable
   logic device(s)  (FPLD(s)), discrete logic, hardware,
   firmware, etc. Also, some or all of the example
10 process(es) of Figure 8 may be implemented manually or as
   any combination(s) of any of the foregoing techniques, for
   example, any combination of firmware, software, discrete
   logic and/or hardware. Further, although example processes
   are described with reference to the flow diagram of Figure
15 8, other methods of implementing the process(es) of Figure
   8 may be employed. For example, the order of execution of
   the blocks may be changed, and/or some of the blocks
   described may be changed, eliminated, sub-divided, or
   combined. Additionally, any or all of the example
20 process(es) of Figure 8 may be performed sequentially
   and/or in parallel by, for example, separate processing
   threads, processors, devices, discrete logic, circuits,
   etc.
25 The method 800 of the embodiment is shown in Figure 8.
   Initially, the bonus controller is in a wait state 810.
   When a trigger condition is met 820, a prize is awarded to
   the triggering machine 830. It is then determined what
   eligible gaming devices are within a defined physical
30 proximity of the gaming device by determining the gaming
   devices within the defined zones 840. Prizes are then
   awarded based on the zones to which eligible gaming
   devices belong.
35 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that while it
   is advantageous that the zones are radially displaced
   annular zones relative to the triggering gaming device,
                                                9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                               - 21
   other techniques could be used to define physical
   proximity of gaming devices to the triggering gaming
   device. For example, a series of squares around the
   triggering gaming device could define the zones.
 5
   Persons skilled in the art would appreciate prizes can
   vary between the zones based on the number of different
   rules, for example, the prizes may decrease linearly
   across the zones or logarithmically or be user specified
10 for each zone.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
15 electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
20 appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
25 may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
30 ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
35 be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
                                               9618689_1(GHMatters)P87046.AU.1 1/11/17

                                - 22
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
 5 to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:           a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server. That is a processor may be
10 provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory and generating outputs (for example on
   the display).   Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
15 general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor, for example, an application
   specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable
   gate array   (FPGA).

   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
   further embodiments. For example, the trigger event may
   be, a symbol combination in a game played with a gaming
 5 device or be based on a random evaluation, etc.
   Several embodiments are described above with reference to
   the drawings. These drawings illustrate certain details of
   specific embodiments that implement the systems and
10 methods and programs of the present invention. However,
   describing the invention with drawings should not be

   Certain embodiments of the present invention may be
25 implemented using an existing computer processor and/or by
   a special purpose computer processor incorporated for this
   or another purpose or by a hardwired system, for example.
   Embodiments within the scope of the present invention

   a processor. When information is transferred or provided
   over a network or another communications connection
    (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired
   or wireless) to a machine, the machine properly views the
10 connection as a machine readable medium. Thus, any such a
   connection is properly termed a machine-readable medium.
   Combinations of the above are also included within the
   scope of machine readable media. Machine-executable
   instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data
15 which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose
   computer, or special purpose processing machines to
   perform a certain function or group of functions.
   For example, Figure 9 is a block diagram of an example
20 processor platform 900 capable of executing the
   instructions of Figure 8 to implement the example systems
   and methods disclosed and described herein. The processor
   platform 900 can be, for example, a server, a personal
   computer, an Internet appliance, a set top box, or any
25 other type of computing device.
   The processor platform 900 of the instant example includes
   a processor 912.   For example, the processor 912 can be
   implemented by one or more microprocessors or controllers
30 from any desired family or manufacturer. The processor 912
   includes a local memory 913   (e.g., a cache) and is in
   communication with a main memory including a volatile
   memory 914 and a non-volatile memory 916 via a bus 918.
   The volatile memory 914 may be implemented by Synchronous
35 Dynamic Random Access Memory   (SDRAM), Dynamic Random
   Access Memory (DRAM), RAMBUS Dynamic Random Access Memory
   (RDRAM) and/or any other type of random access memory

   keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, a track-pad, a
   trackball, iso point and/or a voice recognition system.
   One or more output devices 924 are also connected to the
20 interface circuit 920.   The output devices 924 can be
   implemented, for example, by display devices       (e.g., a
   liquid crystal display, a cathode ray tube display                (CRT),
   etc.). The interface circuit 920, thus, typically includes
   a graphics driver card.
