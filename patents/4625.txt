                                                 FIELD
[0002]           This disclosure relates to prosthetics generally, and more specifically to systems
and methods for total ankle replacement.
                                            BACKGROUND
[0003]           The ankle is a joint that acts much like a hinge. The joint is formed by the union
of three bones. The ankle bone is the talus. The top of the talus fits inside a socket that is
formed by the lower end of the tibia, and the fibula, the small bone of the lower leg. Arthritis,
bone degeneration, and/or injury can cause ankle joint deterioration resulting in pain, reduced
range of motion, and decreased quality of life. In many cases, physicians are recommending
ankle replacement surgery with an implant as an option. Consequently, improved systems and
methods of providing ankle replacement surgery are desirable.
                                               SUMMARY

[00129]         ROTATION GUIDE ASSEMBLY
[00130]         FIGS. 1-3 illustrate the one example of a rotation guide assembly 40 in
accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, rotation guide assembly 40 includes
a medial gutter fork 10, a rotation guide slide 20, and a rotation guide pointer 30. FIGS. 4A and
4B illustrate the rotation guide assembly 40 assembled together in accordance with some
embodiments. The rotation guide assembly 40 assists in the accurate placement of a first guide
pin 50 which serves as a guide for alignment frame assembly 140 discussed in greater detail
below.
                                                  13

[00131]         Referring again to FIGS. 1A and 1B, medial gutter fork 10 includes a shaft 2 and
a head 4. In some embodiments, shaft 2 has a cylindrical geometry and includes a proximal end
3 and a distal end 5 each being of a first diameter A, and an inner section 1 disposed between
proximal end 3 and distal end 5 and having a second diameter B. In some embodiments, the first
diameter A is greater than second diameter B. Head 4 has a transitional portion 8, which is
connected to the distal end 5 of shaft 2, and a forked portion 7 including a pair of prongs 6. As
described in greater detail below, medial gutter fork 10 is configured to be inserted into the
medial gutter of an ankle joint to serve as a reference point to the additional elements of the
rotation guide assembly 40. In some embodiments, the head 4 does not have a forked shape
[00132]         FIGS. 2A and 2B are isometric views of a rotation guide slide 20. In some
embodiments, rotation guide slide 20 has an "L" shaped body including a first portion 12
extending longitudinally in a first direction and a second portion 14 extending laterally from the
first portion 12 in a second direction. In some embodiments, first portion 12 is longer than
second portion 14 and the first and second directions are perpendicular with respect to one
another. First portion 12 defines a first channel 16 that runs the length of first portion 12 on a
first side 13 and defines a second channel 17 on second side 15, which is disposed opposite the
first side 13. Second portion 14 defines a guide hole 18 which is configured to engage the shaft
2 of medial gutter fork 10. In some embodiments, hole 18 is located at the approximate center of
second portion 14; however, hole 18 can be located at other positions of second portion 14.
Another hole 19 is defined by the side of second portion 14 and is sized and configured to
receive a set screw (not shown) for locking the position of rotation guide slide 20 relative gutter
fork 10.
[00133]         FIG. 2C illustrates one example of a configuration of channel 16 in accordance
with some embodiments. Channel 16 is illustrated as having a flat bottom surface 16a and
angled side walls 16b and 16c that taper inwardly such that the top of channel 16 is narrower
than the bottom. Second channel 17 is aligned along the same longitudinal axis as first channel
16 and is shaped identical to first channel 16 with a flat bottom surface 17a and angled side walls
17b and 17c that taper inwardly such that the top of channel 17 is narrower than the bottom.
[00134]         FIG. 2D illustrates another example of a configuration of channel 16. As shown
in FIG. 2D, side walls 16b and 16c perpendicularly extend from bottom surface 16a. Like first
channel 16, second channel 17 can also be configured such that side walls 17b and 17c
                                                  14

perpendicularly extend from bottom wall 17a. In some embodiments, side walls 16b, 16c and
17b, 17c include internal extending rails 16d, 17d that perpendicularly extend inwardly from side
walls 16b, 16c and 17b, 17c, respectively.
[00135]         Regardless of the configuration of channels 16 and 17, either first channel 16 or
second channel 17 faces away from the ankle and will engage with rotation guide pointer 30 as
described in greater detail below. This configuration enables rotation guide slide 20 to be used
during an ankle replacement procedure for either the right ankle or left ankle.
[00136]         FIGS. 3A and 3B are isometric views of one example of a rotation guide pointer
30 in accordance with some embodiment, and FIG. 3C is a side profile view rotation guide
pointer 30. Rotation guide pointer 30 comprises a wide, rectangular base 22 and a narrow,
elongated pointer extension 24 that extends from base 22. As best seen in FIG. 3C, the underside
21 of base 22 includes a protrusion 26 configured to engage first channel 16 or second channel
17 of rotation guide slide 20. Protrusion 26 extends longitudinally across base 22 (i.e., in a
direction that is perpendicular with respect to the longitudinal length of elongated pointer
extension 24). As best seen in FIG. 3C and has a flat bottom surface 26a and angled sides 26b
and 26c such that the top portion of protrusion 26 is narrower than the bottom surface such that
protrusion 26 has a complementary shape to channels 16 and 17 of rotation guide slide 20. In
some embodiments, sides 26b and 26c of protrusion 26 perpendicularly extend from bottom
surface 26a of protrusion 26.
[00137]         Referring again to FIG. 3A, the top side 25 of base 22 includes a finger tab 27
extending perpendicularly from the top side 25 of base 22 and running along a lateral axis
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of protrusion 26. Put another way, finger tab 27 extends
from top side 25 and extends parallel to the longitudinal direction of the elongated pointer
extension 24. Finger tab 27 can be used to approximately align pointer extension 24 with the
mechanical axis of the tibia 260 as described in greater detail below.
[00138]          Still referring to FIG. 3A, top side 25 of base 22 defines a pair of screw holes 36,
with one hole being located on either side of finger tab 27. Each screw hole 36 is configured to
receive a screw 37 (FIG. 4A) to affix rotation guide pointer 30 to rotation guide slide 20. In
some embodiments, screw 37 extends through protrusion 26, exiting bottom surface 26a and
penetrating bottom surface 16a on the rotation guide slide 20. In other embodiments, screws 37
do not exit the rotation guide pointer 30; rather, screws 37 are configured to expand side walls
                                                    15

26b and 26c, causing protrusion 26 to expand within channel 16 and creating a friction
connection between rotation guide pointer and rotation guide slide.
[00139]          Pointer extension 24 extends from base 22 at a first end 31 and tapers at a second
end 32 to form a rounded point 33. Pointer extension 24 defines a pin hole 28 along its length
that extends from a top side 34 to a bottom side 35. The pin hole 28 is positioned at a distance
from the base 22 that is sufficient to allow the appropriate travel of other components, e.g.,
adjustment block 100, which is described in greater detail below.
[00140]          The use of rotation guide assembly 40 is now briefly described with reference to
FIGS. 4A and 4B, which is used once access is gained to the tibia 260 and talus 265. In some
embodiments, such access is gained by making an anterior incision lateral of the tibialis, with
care taken to avoid the anterior tendons, to expose the tibia 260, talus 265, and a portion of the
midfoot. In some embodiments, the incision is approximately 125 mm long; however, one of
ordinary skill in the art will understand that the incision can be greater or less than 125 mm.
[00141]          Gutter fork 10 is inserted into the medial gutter of the ankle joint, and rotation
guide slide 20 is operationally connected to medial gutter fork 10 by placing guide hole 18 over
shaft 2 as illustrated in FIG. 4A. Rotation guide slide 20 is positioned with either first channel
16 or second channel 17 facing away from the tibia 260. Rotation guide pointer 30 is
operationally connected to rotation guide slide 20 by sliding protrusion 26 into either first
channel 16 or second channel 17, whichever is facing away from the tibia 260. Thus assembled,
an operator uses finger tab 27 to rotate the combined rotation guide slide 20 and rotation guide
pointer 30 about an axis defined by shaft 2. A surgeon or other profession can also use finger tab
27 to slide rotation guide pointer 30 along an axis defined by first channel 16 or second channel
17. The operator thus uses finger tab 27 to rotate the combined rotation guide slide 20 and
rotation guide pointer 30 and slide rotation guide pointer 30 until pointer extension 24 is
approximately aligned with the mechanical axis of the tibia 260.
[00142]          The position of rotation guide slide 20 can be fixed relative to gutter fork 10 by
inserting a set screw (not shown) into hole 19 defined by rotation guide slide 20, and the position
of the rotation guide pointer 30 relative to the rotation guide slide 20 can be fixed by tightening
screws 37. A first guide pin 50 is inserted through pin hole 28 and into the tibia either
percutaneously or directly into the tibial shaft. With first guide pin 50 thus inserted, the entire
                                                    16

rotation guide assembly 40 is removed, leaving first guide pin 50 in place. FIG. 5 is an isometric
view of a tibia 260 with first guide pin 50 inserted and the rotation guide assembly 40 removed.
[00143]          In some embodiments, the placement of guide 50 is accomplished using patient
specific guides. Examples of such patient-specific guides and methods of making such patient
specific guides are described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 12/711,307,
entitled "Method for Forming a Patient Specific Surgical Guide Mount, U.S. Patent Application
No. 13/330,091, entitled "Orthopedic Surgical Guide," and U.S. Patent Application No.
 13/464,175, entitled "Orthopedic Surgical Guide," the entireties of which are incorporated by
reference herein. A conversion instrument for interfacing with patient specific guides is
described in greater detail below.
[00144]          ALIGNMENT FRAME ASSEMBLY AND RELATED COMPONENTS
[00145]          FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate one example of an alignment frame assembly 140 in
accordance with some embodiments. Alignment frame assembly 140 can be used to place pins
150 (FIG. 28) in a patient's tibial. In some embodiments, alignment frame 140 includes a
proximal alignment frame 109 as illustrated in FIG. 6 and a distal alignment frame 105 as
illustrated in FIG. 7.
[00146]          Referring first to FIG. 6, proximal alignment frame sub-assembly 109 includes an
elongate body with a first end 102 and a second end 104. In some embodiments, proximal
alignment frame 109 includes two knobs 106, 108 at end 102. Knob 106 can be selectively
loosened and tightened to allow for coronal rotation adjustment and for locking the adjustment of
the angle between an axis defined by the end 102 and an axis defined by the end 104 by locking
the proximal end 102 at a particular location along perpendicular slot 101 for coronal rotation
adjustment. Knob 108 allows for sagittal rotation adjustment and connecting end 102 to a
proximal tibial pin 154, which is received within hole 103, or to a knee bracket 142 as described
in greater detail below. Hinge 137 allows for end 102 to pivot relative to end 104.
[00147]          Turning now to FIG. 7, distal alignment frame sub-assembly 105 extends between
a first end 107 and a second end 124. At end 107, the distal alignment frame 105 includes an
elongate body 126 defining a central channel 126a, which extends the length of body 126 and is
configured to receive end 104 of the proximal alignment frame 109 therein. A knob 128 is
provided at end 107 and is configured to allow adjustment and fixation of the length of the
proximal alignment frame 109. For example, knob 128 can be loosened to enable end 104 of
                                                  17

proximal alignment frame 109 to be slid within channel 126a, and knob 128 can be tightened to
prevent relative movement between proximal alignment frame 109 and distal alignment frame
subassembly 105.
[00148]          At end 124, the distal alignment frame 105 includes a rectangular body or
structure 190 defining a plurality of holes 132. Holes 132 extend from a top surface 191 to a
bottom surface 193 of structure 190 and are sized and configured to receive pin sleeves 176
(FIG. 24A) for installing pins 150 into the tibia 260. Although six holes 132 are shown in FIG.
7, fewer or more holes are provided in some embodiments. As described in greater detail below,
pins 150 are inserted into the tibia 260 and are used for positioning other devices during a total
ankle replacement surgery in accordance with some embodiments.
[00149]          Still referring to FIG. 7, a hole 194 is defined in a structure 195, which is disposed
in a distal-most portion of distal alignment frame 105. Structure 195 is hingedly connected to
rectangular structure 190 and is sized and configured to receive a guide pin 50 within hole 194,
which is inserted into the tibia 260 using rotation guide assembly 40 as described above. A knob
196 is configured to lock frame 105 to pin 50 received within hole 194.
[00150]          As best seen in FIG. 17, structure 190 defines a longitudinal slot 138 that extends
parallel to the longitudinal direction of distal alignment frame 105 (i.e., in a distal to proximal
direction). Longitudinal slot 138 is configured to receive a shaft of an angel wing alignment
guide 160. Structure 190 also defines a hole 139 that extends from top surface 191 and intersects
slot 138. Hole 139 is configured to receive a set screw (not shown) to secure the angel wing
alignment guide 160 in place as described in greater detail below.
[00151]          FIG. 8 illustrates one example of a knee bracket 142 in accordance with some
embodiments. Knee bracket 142 includes a base 144 that is curved to be positioned over the
proximal end of the tibia 260 and a post 146 configured to be received within the hole 103 of the
proximal end 102 of the proximal alignment frame 109. A hook 152 extends from an upper
surface of each end of knee bracket 142. Hooks 152 are provided to secure a strap, such as strap
148 illustrated in FIG. 9, to knee bracket 142. In some embodiments, strap 148 is formed from
rubber, but strap 148 can be provided from other materials as will be understood by one of
ordinary skill in the art. Strap 148 defines a plurality of holes 150 that are sized and configured
to receive hooks 152 of knee bracket 142.
                                                    18

[00152]          FIG. 10 is an isometric view of one example of an angel wing alignment guide
160 in accordance with some embodiments. Angel wing alignment guide 160 includes a
hippocrepiform base 162 defining a plurality of holes 164 at both ends. A post 166 extends
perpendicularly from the base 162 and is configured to be received within the slot 138 at end 124
of the distal alignment frame 105 as best seen in FIG. 17. Holes 164 are sized and configured to
receive an alignment rod, such as alignment rod 170 illustrated in FIG. 11. In some
embodiments, alignment rod 170 has an elongate body that includes a stop collar 172 disposed
along its length to divide alignment rod 170 into unequal portions 170A and 170B. As shown in
FIG. 11, portion 170A is shorter than portion 170B.
[00153]          The installation of alignment frame assembly 140 is described briefly with
reference to FIGS. 12-28. FIG. 12 illustrates one example of alignment frame assembly 140 in
its assembled form. In some embodiments, alignment frame assembly 140 is assembled by
inserting end 104 of the proximal alignment frame 109 into end 107 of distal alignment frame
105. Alignment frame assembly 140 is connected to the tibia by sliding the hole 194 at end 124
of the distal alignment frame 105 over the first guide pin 50 that is positioned in tibia 260 as
shown in FIG. 12. A pin 154 is installed percutaneously through the hole 103 at the proximal
end 102 of the proximal alignment frame 109 into a tibial tuberosity.
[00154]          Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 13A-13C, the knee bracket 142 and rubber strap
148 can be used to secure the alignment frame assembly 140 to the proximal end of the tibia 260.
For example, knee bracket post 146 is inserted into the hole 103 defined at end 102 of the
proximal alignment frame 109 such that knee bracket base 144 is positioned over the proximal
end of the tibia 260. Rubber strap 148 is used to secure the patient's leg to knee bracket 142.
For example, rubber strap 148 is wrapped laterally around the tibia 260, and hooks 152 of the
knee bracket base 144 are inserted into the holes 151 of the rubber strap 148.
[00155]          The distal end 124 of the distal alignment frame 105 is placed above the tibia such
that a gap, G, is provided between the distal alignment frame 105 and the tibia as shown in FIG.
14. In some embodiments, the gap is approximately 20-25 mm from the frame 105 to the tibia
260; however, gap, G, can have other dimensions that are greater than or less than 20-25 mm.
Once the desired gap is achieved, distal knob 196 is turned to lock the distal end 124 of the distal
alignment frame 105 to the first guide pin 50, as illustrated in FIG. 14.
                                                   19

[00156]          As described above, the proximal alignment frame 109 is adjustable in length and
can be fixed at a particular length by turning knob 128 of the distal alignment frame 105 as
shown in FIG. 18. First knob 106 at the proximal end 102 of the proximal alignment frame 109
can be turned as indicated by arrow A2 to allow adjustment of the angle of a perpendicular slot
101 at the proximal end 102 of the proximal alignment frame 109 for coronal rotation adjustment
as indicated by arrows A3 and A4. As shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, knob 108 of the proximal
alignment frame 109 is turned as indicated by arrow Al to lock the alignment frame assembly
140 to the pin 154 and/or knee bracket post 146.
[00157]          FIG. 17 is an isometric view of the angel wing alignment guide 160 attached to
the distal end 124 of the distal alignment frame 105, which is connected to the tibia via the first
guide pin 50. In some embodiments, the angel wing alignment guide 160 is attached to the
alignment frame assembly 140 by inserting the angel wing alignment guide post 166 into the slot
138 at the distal end 124 of the distal alignment frame 105. A set screw (not shown) is inserted
through hole 139 that intersects the slot 138 and secured with a hex driver 174 (FIG. 19). The
set screw (not shown) can be loosened to allow proximal/distal adjustment of the angel wing
alignment guide 160. In some embodiments, the position of the angel wing alignment guide 160
is viewed under A/P fluoroscopy to establish coronal alignment, which is typically parallel to the
natural joint line, as illustrated in FIG. 20.
[00158]          As illustrated in FIG. 21, the portion 170B of alignment rod 170 is inserted
through one of the holes 164 in either side of the angel wing alignment guide base 162, and
alignment rod 170 is inserted into one of the holes 164 until stop collar 172 abuts angle wing
alignment guide base 162. Second knob 108 and/or the distal knob 196 of the alignment frame
assembly 140 can be turned to allow sagittal rotation adjustment, as illustrated in FIG. 22. The
position of the alignment rod 170 can be viewed under lateral fluoroscopy to establish sagittal
rotation, which is typically parallel to a shaft of the tibia 260, as illustrated in FIG. 23.
[00159]          After the adjustments are made, the angel wing alignment guide 160 and
alignment rod 170 are removed. As illustrated in FIGS. 24A and 25, pin sleeves 176 are inserted
into a pair of aligned holes 132 of the plurality of holes 132 at the distal end 124 of the distal
alignment frame 105 that provide the optimal bone purchase. As illustrated in FIG. 25, this
position is shown as the two center holes 132 in the superior and inferior rows of holes; however,
the optimal bone purchase position could be the medial or lateral holes 132. A trocar, such as
                                                   20

trocar 178 illustrated in FIG. 24B, is inserted into each of the pin sleeves 176 to create "stab
wounds" for percutaneous pins, as illustrated in FIG. 26. The trocar 178 is then removed.
[00160]          As illustrated in FIG. 27, a pin 150 is inserted into each of the pin sleeves 176 and
through both cortices of the tibia 260, which is used for positioning of other structures of the
total ankle replacement system as described in greater detail below. Once the pins 150 are
placed, the pin sleeves 176 are removed and the second knob 108 and distal knob 196 are
loosened to remove the alignment frame assembly 140. The proximal tibial pin 154 or knee
bracket 142 and the first guide pin 50 are then removed, leaving pins 150 in the tibia 260, as
illustrated in FIG. 28.
[00161]          POSITION ADJUSTMENT GUIDE AND RELATED COMPONENTS
[00162]          FIG. 29 is an isometric diagram of a position adjustment device 100 (also referred
to below as an "adjustment block") for positioning of drilling and cutting tools for tibia
resectioning and for tibia trial insertion in accordance with some embodiments. Adjustment
block 100 provides a common reference location for locating tools and the tibia trial components
throughout sizing, resectioning, and trialing procedures. In some embodiments, the adjustment
block 100 is small enough in profile to position a cut guide into the wound space close to the
tibia bone without applying excess skin tension. The physician can use the adjustment block to
position a drill guide and/or cut guide closer to the tibia bone, to make more accurate cuts with
less chance of the blade or pins flexing.
[00163]          The adjustment block 100 has three independently positionable frames 110, 120,
and 130 for precisely positioning a tool holder 134 adjacent the joint to be replaced.
[00164]          The first frame 110 is configured to be attached to two fixation pins 150 ,which
have been inserted in the anterior surface of the tibia, near the distal end of the tibia using the
instrumentation as described above. A locking screw 112 actuates a locking plate (not shown),
which bears against the fixation pins 150 to secure the adjustment block 100 relative to the pins.
The first frame has a proximal-distal adjustment knob 111 coaxially connected to a screw 113.
The screw 113 can have an Acme thread, trapezoidal thread, square thread or other suitable
thread for leadscrew use. The second frame 120 is fixedly attached or unitarily formed with a
leadscrew nut (not shown), which the screw 113 drives. Rotation of the proximal-distal
adjustment knob 111 rotates screw 113 to advance or retract the second frame 120 in the
proximal-distal direction. When the second frame 120 is at the desired proximal-distal
                                                   21

coordinate, the physician advances the locking screw 114 to lock the second frame 120 to the
first frame 110 in place.
[00165]          The second frame 120 has at least one medial-lateral adjustment knob 121a, 121b
coaxially connected to a screw 123. The screw 123 can have an Acme thread, trapezoidal thread,
square thread or other suitable thread for leadscrew use. The screw 123 drives a leadscrew nut
(not shown), to which the third frame 130 is fixedly attached or unitarily formed. Rotation of the
medial-lateral adjustment knob 121a or 121b rotates screw 123 to move the third frame 130 in
the medial-lateral direction. When the third frame 130 is at the desired medial-lateral coordinate,
the physician advances the locking screw 122 to lock the leadscrew 123 of the second frame 120
in place.
[00166]          The third frame 130 has an anterior-posterior adjustment knob 131 coaxially
connected to a screw 133. The screw 133 can have an Acme thread, trapezoidal thread, square
thread or other suitable thread for leadscrew use. The screw 133 drives a leadscrew nut 136, to
which a tool holder 134 is fixedly attached or with which tool holder 134 is unitarily formed.
Rotation of the anterior-posterior adjustment knob 131 rotates screw 133 to move the tool holder
134 in the anterior-posterior direction. The tool holder 134 is adapted to hold a drilling tool, a
cutting tool, or a tibia trial 210.
[00167]          FIG. 30 is an exploded view showing the adjustment block 100, tibia trial 210,
poly trial insert 230, and floating trial 250. FIG. 31 is an isometric view of the tibia trial 210.
FIG. 32 is an anterior (front) elevation view of the tibia trial 210. FIG. 33 is a sagittal (side)
elevation view of the tibia trial 210.
[00168]          The tibia trial 210 provides the profile of the tibia tray portion of an ankle
replacement system. The tibia trial 210 comprises a plate 211 with a top surface adapted to fit
against a distal surface 262 of the resectioned tibia 260 (FIG. 41). The plate 211 has a plurality
of holes 212 (FIG. 31) to be used to locate peg holes 263 in the resectioned tibia 260 (FIG. 41).
The plate 211 has a bottom surface 216 including a channel adapted to receive a trial insert, such
as a poly trial insert 230. An anterior tibia reference member 218 extends from the plate 211 as
best seen in FIG. 33. The anterior tibia reference member 218 has a posterior surface 219
adapted to contact an anterior surface 261 of the tibia 260 (FIG. 41) when the tibia trial 210 is
positioned properly. The tibia trial 210 has an anterior mounting portion 213, which defines
holes 214, that is sized and shaped to be mounted to the tool holder 134 of the adjustment block
                                                   22

100. In some embodiments, the tibia trial 210 has a notch 217 for aligning an anterior surface of
the poly trial insert 230 with the tibia trial 210. Alignment (or misalignment is readily visible by
checking whether the notch 217 is aligned with an edge of the poly trial insert 230). In some
embodiments, the tibia trial 210 is formed of a strong, corrosion resistant material such as
stainless steel or a titanium alloy.
[00169]          Referring again to FIG. 30, poly trial insert 230 is configured to provide the
profile of the poly insert of an ankle replacement system. The poly trial insert 230 comprises a
top surface 231 adapted to be detachably mounted to the bottom surface 216 of the plate 211 of
the tibia trial 210 (FIG. 31). The poly insert 230 has a concave bottom surface 232 with a size
and shape of a prosthetic tibia joint surface of the ankle replacement system. The thickness of
the poly trial insert 230 matches the poly insert of the ankle replacement system to which the
poly trial insert 230 corresponds, allowing verification of the size and thickness of the poly insert
using the poly trial insert 230. In some embodiments, the poly insert of the ankle replacement
system has a locking tab to prevent release from the talar tray after surgery; but the poly trial
insert 230 has a non-locking tab 233 with a ramped surface, to be detachably inserted in the tibia
trial 210 and removed after sizing and resectioning is completed. The non-locking tab 233 fits in
a corresponding recess (not shown) in the bottom surface 216 of the tibia trial 210. The posterior
end of the poly trial insert 230 has an undercut 234. In some embodiments, the poly trial insert
230 is made from the same type of material used in the poly insert of an ankle replacement
system. In some embodiments, the poly trial insert 230 is made of a chemical-resistant material
such as polyphenylsulfone, which is also referred to as RadelR.
[00170]          FIG. 34 is an isometric view of the floating trial 250. The floating trial 250 is
configured to provide a contour that matches the contour of the talar dome of the ankle
replacement system, which is described in greater detail below. The floating trial 250 is
configured to be inserted beneath the poly trial insert 230 to contact the concave bottom surface
232 of insert 230. The floating trial 250 comprises a member 251 having at least one convex
anterior surface with a size and shape of a prosthetic talar dome of the ankle replacement system,
to permit articulation with the concave surface 232 of the insert. The posterior surface 255 of the
member 251 is shaped to match the contour of the resectioned talus. In some embodiments, the
floating trial 250 has two convex surfaces 251 as shown in FIG. 34. The floating trial 250
further includes a handle portion 252, which is sized to project from the resection site, so the
                                                    23

physician can easily optimize the position of the floating trial for smooth articulation with the
poly trial insert 230. The handle 252 of the floating trial 250 has a plurality of pin holes 253 for
receiving fixation pins to be used for locating a talar cut guide (not shown). Once the position is
optimized, the pins are inserted through the pin holes 253 before completing the resectioning of
the talus. In some embodiments, the floating trial 250 is formed of a strong, corrosion resistant
material such as stainless steel or a titanium alloy. In some embodiments, the floating trial 250
also has one or more anterior chamfers 254 for reference and alignment.
[00171]          FIGS. 35-45 show various stages of a method of resectioning and trialing, using
the adjustment block 100, optional drill guide 280, optional cut guide 290, tibia trial 210, poly
trial insert 230 and floating trial 250. This is one example of a use of the devices, but is not
limiting.
[00172]          FIG. 35 shows the adjustment block 100 fixed to the fixation pins 150 (e.g., 3.2
mm pins), which have been inserted in the anterior surface of the tibia 260 near the distal end
261 of the tibia (not shown). Also shown in FIG. 35 is a drill guide 280 attached to the tool
holder 134 of the adjustment block 100, with the first frame 110 slightly above the anterior
surface of the tibia 260. In some embodiments, the tool holder 134 includes a stage with a pair
of pins 135, and the drill guide 280 has a corresponding pair of mounting ears 283 with holes
adapted to snap onto the pins 135. This tool holder design is just exemplary in nature, and other
embodiments include other suitable mounting structures as described in greater detail below.
[00173]          In the embodiment of FIG. 35, the drill guide 280 is a small profile device sized
and shaped to be inserted beneath the retracted skin (not shown) in the ankle region. The drill
guide 280 has at least two guide holes 281 to be used to drill pilot holes in the tibia 260. The
drill guide also has pin holes 282 that can be used to pin the drill guide to the bone, for position
fixation. In some embodiments, the drill guide 280 has sizing patterns 285 showing the size and
location of one or more resectioning cuts corresponding to the holes to be drilled using the drill
guide 280. In some embodiments, the drill guide 280 has one or more reference lines 286 that
the physician optionally can use to position the drill guide 280 (by adjusting the proximal-distal
knob 111, the medial-lateral knob 121a or 121b, and the anterior-posterior knob. In some
embodiments, the lines 285, 286 are visible under a fluoroscope, so the physician can view the
position and size of the lines 285, 286 in situ, relative to the patient's bones.
                                                   24

[00174]         The physician sizes the tibial tray component of the ankle replacement system by
mounting a drill guide 280 on the tool holder and adjusting its position as described above. The
position adjustment device (adjustment block) 100 is locked with the tool holder 134 at first
coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions.
[00175]         The physician views the X-ray of the tibia bone 260 and drill guide 280 and
determines whether it is the optimum size and position for the patient. The position can be
adjusted based on the X-ray, using knobs 111, 121, 131. If the size of the resectioning cut
corresponding to the drill guide 280 is too large or too small, the physician removes the drill
guide, selects a different size drill guide, and snaps the new drill guide onto the tool holder 134
of the adjustment block 100. The drill guide is then repositioned against the tibia, imaged by
fluoroscope, and the size is again checked. To facilitate fluoroscopic X-ray imaging, the drill
guide 280 can be made of plastic, while the circles surrounding holes 281 and the patterns 285,
286 can be made of metal. Thus, only the circles surrounding holes 281 and the patterns 285, 286
appear on the X-ray, superimposed against the tibia 260 and talus 265.
[00176]         Although some embodiments use a single drill guide 280 for sizing, location of
fixation pins by holes 282 and drilling corners 281, other embodiments described below use a
first guide with holes 282 and patterns 285, 286 for sizing the tibia trial 210 and locating the
fixation pins, and a second guide (e.g., a drilling guide) with holes 281 and 282 for performing
the drilling. Because the adjustment block 100 and the pins in holes 282 provide common
references, the holes 281 can still be drilled with proper location relative to the pin holes 282 and
patterns 285, 286.
[00177]         FIG. 36 shows the tibia 260 with adjustment block 100 and drill guide 280. Soft
tissue is omitted for ease of viewing. When the physician has verified that the optimum size of
drill guide 280 has been selected, the physician pins the drill guide 280 to the tibia 260 using
(e.g., 2.4 mm) fixation pins 287 inserted through the pin holes 282 and trimmed such that pins
287 extend slightly above the drill guide 280. Then the physician drills holes in the tibia 260
through the guides holes 281 using the drill guide 280 and drill 288. The holes thus drilled in the
bone 260 define corners of a resectioning cut to be performed in the tibia. The physician then
removes the drill guide 280, while leaving the pins 287 in place (in the distal portion of the tibia
260 to be removed by the resectioning). While removing the drill guide 280, the adjustment
block can remain locked in the first coordinates with the first frame 110 adjusted to the same
                                                   25

proximal-distal coordinate and the second frame 120 adjusted to the same medial-lateral
coordinate.
[00178]          FIG. 37 shows the adjustment block 100 still fixed to the fixation pins 150 in the
same position, with a cut guide 290 mounted to the tool holder 134 of the adjustment block 100.
The cut guide 290 has a plurality of slots 295, sized and located to connect the comer holes
drilled with the drill guide 280. The cut guide 290 is sized and shaped to match the drill guide
280. Thus, the physician has a set of drill guides 280 and a corresponding set of cut guides 290.
The selection of a drill guide size automatically selects the corresponding cut guide size to make
cuts which are sized and located to connect the corner holes drilled with the drill guide 280, as
described above. The cut guide 290 has a corresponding pair of mounting ears 293 with holes
adapted to snap onto the pins 135. The cut guide 290 also has pin holes 292 which are sized and
located to receive the fixation pins 287. This aligns the position of the cut guide 290 with the
position previously occupied by the drill guide 280, to ensure alignment of the resectioning cuts
with the previously drilled corner holes. In some embodiments, the cut guide 290 includes
additional ears 296 with pin holes for receiving additional fixation pins 297.
[00179]          To mount the cut guide 290, the physician slides the holes 292 of cut guide 290
over the fixation pins 287 and snaps the cut guide into place on the tool holder 134. For stability,
the physician can then insert two more fixation pins 297 through the pin holes of ears 296 and
into the talus bone 265. With the cut guide 290 securely pinned to bones 260, 265, the physician
performs the resectioning cuts through the guide slots 295, cutting the bone to connect the
previously drilled holes. In some embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 37,
one cut guide 290 is used for both the tibia resection and the first cut of the talar resection. The
cut guide 290 is then removed from the surgery site, and detached from the adjustment block
100. The sections of the tibia 260 and talus 265 that have been cut are removed, along with the
fixation pins 287 and 297. In other embodiments (not shown), the tibia cut guide is only used to
resection the tibia, and a separate cut guide is used to resection the talus after removal of the tibia
cut guide.
[00180]          The use of the adjustment block 100 permits the holes 281 to be drilled first with
a first tool, and the cuts to be performed afterwards with a second tool, while maintaining
accurate alignment between the holes and the cuts. Drilling the holes first avoids stress
concentrations at the corners of the resectioned distal tibia.
                                                  26

[00181]           Although some embodiments described herein use a drill guide 280 and a cut
guide 290 commonly fixed using the adjustment block 100 and fixation pins 287, other
embodiments attach different tools to the tool holder 134 for purpose of resectioning the tibia
and talus. For example, some embodiments include a cut guide without using a separate drill
guide.
[00182]           Following the initial resectioning of tibia 260, which is described in greater detail
below, the physician inserts the tibia trial 210, poly trial insert 230 and floating trial 250, while
the adjustment block 100 is still locked to the two fixation pins 150, and the tool holder 134 is in
the first coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions. Should the physician
choose to temporarily remove the adjustment block from the surgery site (e.g., for inspection,
cleaning or suctioning), the physician returns the adjustment block to the same coordinates to
locate the tool holder 134 at the same position to complete the procedure. Because the fixation
pins 150 are excluded from the distal portion of the tibia removed by the resection, the fixation
pins 150 are available throughout the procedure for use in adjusting or correcting the resection
cuts.
[00183]           The physician snaps the tibia trial 210 onto the tool holder 134. FIGS. 38 and 39
show the adjustment block in position with the tibia trial 210 attached. The adjustment block
100 is adjusted to position the tool holder in an anterior-posterior direction, while the tool holder
is at the first coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions. The tibia trial 210
is repositioned in the posterior direction until a predetermined portion of the tibia trail contacts
an anterior cortex of the tibia. In some embodiments, the position of the third frame 130 is
adjusted until the posterior surface 219 of anterior tibia reference member 218 extending from
the plate 211 contacts the anterior cortex of the tibia 260.
[00184]           In some embodiments, the tibial trial 210 is used in connection with a spacer 240
to assess the ligament laxity of the ankle joint as shown in FIGS. 39A and 39B. Spacer 240 can
be provided in a variety of thicknesses including, but not limited to 4 mm, 5 mm, and 6 mm to
list only a few possibilities. As shown in FIGS. 33A and 33B, spacer 240 includes an elongate
body 242 including an extension 244 at one end. Extension 244 defines spaced apart holes 246
that are sized and configured to receive fixation pins 297 therein. A blind hole 248 that is at least
partially threaded is also defined by spacer 240 and is configured for aiding the removal of
                                                    27

spacer 240 from its engagement with tibial trial 210. In some embodiments, spacer 240 is
fabricated from a radiolucent material.
[00185]           Once tibia 260 is resectioned using the superior and angled medial and lateral
slots of cutting guide 290 shown in FIG. 37, the resected portion of the tibia 260 is removed.
Tibia trial 210 is inserted as described above, and spacer 240 is inserted into engagement with
tibia trial 210 as shown in FIGS. 39A and 39B. The combination of tibia trial 210 and spacer
240 are used to assess the ligament laxity prior to resection of the upper talus. Once the ligament
laxity has been assessed, spacer 240 can be removed and cutting guide 290 can be placed back
over pins 297 and the inferior slot can be used to resect to the top of talus 265 as shown in FIG.
39C.
[00186]           In some embodiments, an additional talar cutting guide, such as talar cutting guide
270 illustrated in FIGS. 39D and 39E, can be used to provide an initial talar resection or to
further resect the talus beyond the resection provided by cutting guide 290. As shown in FIGS.
39D and 39E, illustrate one example of a cutting guide 270 coupled to a resected talus 265 by
fixation pins 297, which are disposed within distal holes 272. A set of proximal holes 274,
which are offset from distal holes 272, and an elongate cutting slot 276 slot also are defined by
cutting guide 270. As can be seen by comparing FIGS. 39D and 39E, proximal holes 274 are
offset from distal holes 272 by a distance to provide a surgeon with the options of resecting
different amounts of the talus bone. In some embodiments, the vertical difference between the
position of holes 272 and holes 274 is 2 mm. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will
understand that the vertical distance between the center of holes 272 and 274 can be greater or
less than 2 mm.
[00187]           FIG. 40 shows the tibia 260 and talus 265 with the tibia trial 210 in position. The
tibia peg drill (not shown) is placed in the head of a tibia peg drill guide 299, and is inserted in
the holes 212 (FIG. 31) of the tibia trial 210. The physician drills a plurality (e.g., 3) peg holes
263 in the distal surface 262 of the resectioned tibia 260 using the tibia peg drill 299. The holes
212 (FIG. 31) of the tibia trial 210 are used to locate these holes 263. FIG. 41 shows the distal
end 261 of the tibia 260 at the completion of the peg drilling, with the three peg holes 263 in the
resectioned surface 262 of the tibia.
[00188]           The tibia trial 210 is used to verify size and shape of the resectioning using the
tibia trial, prior to implanting the ankle replacement system. Advantageously, the steps of
                                                     28

attaching the tibia trial 210 to the tool holder 134, adjusting the position adjustment device 100
to position the tool holder 134 in an anterior-posterior direction, and placing the tibia trial 210 on
the resectioned tibia 260 using the tool holder 134, can be formed without inserting any
additional location fixing pins into the tibia, while the tool holder is locked in the first
coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions.
[00189]          FIGS. 42 and 43 show the adjustment block 100 and tibia trial 210, after installing
the poly trial insert 230 into the tibia trial 210 and positioning the floating trial 250 between the
talus 265 and the poly insert trial 230, to permit articulation with the concave surface 232 of the
poly insert trial 230 while the tool holder is in the first coordinates in the proximal-distal and
medial-lateral directions. The physician can now assess the fit of the ankle replacement system,
including size, anterior-posterior position, and whether the tibia has been sized, drilled and cut
optimally. If any adjustments are deemed appropriate to the tibia resectioning, the physician can
reapply the cut guide with the adjustment block set to the same proximal-distal and medial
lateral coordinates used before.
[00190]          Referring to FIGS. 44 and 45, the physician now performs a trial reduction to
ensure the correct poly insert height and talus dome position. The talar implant anterior
posterior coordinate is determined by moving the floating trial 250 to the location where it best
articulates with the concave surface 232 of the poly trial insert 230. Two additional fixation pins
298 are inserted through the pin holes 253 of the floating trial 250 using a K-wire, such as a 2
mm K-wire, for example. Additional resection guides, described in greater detail below can be
positioned by sliding pin holes in the resection guide(s) over the fixation pins 298. The
remaining talar cuts are then performed to match the geometry of the talar dome implant of the
ankle replacement system as described below.
[00191]          A position adjustment device (or adjustment block) 100 as described above
provides a fixed point of reference that facilitates the AP position of the tibial and talar implants
of an ankle replacement system. The adjustment block 100 is capable of fixing a tibial trial 210
via a modular connection 134 to avoid insertion of additional pins in the distal tibia. The tibial
trial 210, while attached to the adjustment block 100, allows the user to set the tibial implant
anterior-posterior position by abutting the anterior post 218 against the tibial bone. The tibial
trial 210 also serves as a drill guide to prepare the tibial pegs on the tibial implant.
                                                    29

[00192]          The tibial trial 210 while rigidly fixed to the adjustment block 100 then translates
the anterior-posterior position to the talar trial 250 by using the poly trial insert 230 to articulate
with the talar (dome) trial 250. The talar trial 250 also has chamfer indicators 254 to help the
user determine the optimal talar anterior-posterior position.
[00193]          Advantageously, the system and method described above uses the adjustment
block 100 as a fixed reference to associate all other instruments used for trial sizing and trials
related to tibial side of the ankle replacement. Thus, a tibial sizer (e.g., drill guide 280), tibial
resection guide (e.g., cut guide 290), and tibial trial 210 can all be anchored at the same position
defined by the adjustment block 100. This method preserves the distal layer of the tibia to avoid
excess pin holes from fixation pins and devices.
[00194]          The compact size of the adjustment block allows the tools to be fixed and placed
close to the surgery site, for more accurate cuts, with reduced chance of components flexing.
Sizing guides (e.g., drill guide 280) and resection guides (e.g. cut guide 290) can all be placed in
the surgical window. The position of the tools and trials can be accurately adjusted by turning the
adjustment knobs 111, 121, 131 in a small area.
[00195]          FIGS. 46 and 47 show another embodiment of the adjustment block 300
configured with a tool holder 330. The adjustment block 300 has two independently positionable
frames 110, 120 for precisely positioning a tool holder 330 in the proximal-distal and medial
lateral directions, adjacent the joint to be replaced.
[00196]          The first frame 110 is configured to be attached to two fixation pins 150 which
have been inserted in the anterior surface of the tibia, near the distal end of the tibia as described
above. A locking screw 112 actuates a locking plate (not shown), which bears against the
fixation pins 150 to secure the adjustment block 100 relative to the pins. The first frame has a
proximal-distal adjustment knob 111 coaxially connected to a screw 113. The screw 113 can
have an Acme thread, trapezoidal thread, square thread or other suitable thread for leadscrew
use. The second frame 120 is fixedly attached or unitarily formed with a leadscrew nut (not
shown), which the screw 113 drives. Rotation of the proximal-distal adjustment knob 111 rotates
screw 113 to advance or retract the second frame 120 in the proximal-distal direction. When the
second frame 120 is at the desired proximal-distal coordinate, the physician advances the locking
screw 114 to lock the second frame 120 to the first frame 110 in place.
                                                    30

 [00197]        The second frame 120 has at least one medial-lateral adjustment knob 121a, 121b
coaxially connected to a screw 123. The screw 123 can have an Acme thread, trapezoidal thread,
square thread or other suitable thread for leadscrew use. The screw 123 drives a leadscrew nut
(not shown), to which the tool holder 330 is fixedly attached or unitarily formed with. Rotation
of the medial-lateral adjustment knob 121a or 121b rotates screw 123 to move the tool holder
330 in the medial-lateral direction. When the tool holder 330 is at the desired medial-lateral
coordinate, the physician advances the locking screw 122 to lock the leadscrew 123 of the
second frame 120 in place.
 [00198]        The position of the tool holder 330 in the anterior-posterior direction is
determined by location of the first frame 110 relative to the pins 150. The tool holder 330 can
have any of a variety of configurations for easily attaching a tool or trial. One example of a tool
holder 330 is illustrated in FIG. 46. As shown in FIG. 46, tool holder 330 includes a dovetail
joint 332 and defines a cavity 334 between rails 336 of dovetail joint 332. Tool holder 330 also
defines a hole 338 extending in a direction parallel to the direction in which rails 336 of dovetail
joint 332 extend from a first side 340 to a second side 342.
 [00199]        Cavity 334 is sized and configured to receive a locking wedge 344 therein. As
best seen in FIG. 46, locking wedge 344 is cross-pinned in cavity 334 by the combination of pins
346, 348, which are respectively received in holes 350, 352 (see also FIG. 52). For example, a
pair of pins 346 are received within holes 350, and a pin 348 is received within hole 352.
Locking wedge 344 includes a pair of spaced apart notches 354 (FIG. 52) each being sized and
configured to receive a biasing member 356. Biasing members 356, which may take the form of
compression springs, are disposed within notches 354 and urge locking wedge 344 towards hole
338. A slot 358 (FIG. 52) is defined in locking wedge 344 and is sized and configured to receive
pin 348 (FIG. 46) therein to prevent locking wedge 344 from being separated from tool holder
330.
 [00200]        Referring again to FIG. 52, the upper surface 360 of locking wedge 344 includes a
pair of chamfered or angles 362, which facilitate engagement with a locking screw 364 and the
displacement and movement of locking wedge 344 relative to tool holder 330. For example,
hole 338 defined by tool holder 330 is sized and configured to receive locking screw 364 and is
in communication with cavity 334 such that shoulders 366 and 368 of locking screw 364 are in
abutment with chamfers 362 of locking wedge 344. In addition to shoulders 366, 368, locking
                                                 31

screw includes an enlarged head 370 and threads or other engagement feature 372 at a distal end
for engaging a corresponding structure defined by locking wedge 344 for maintaining locking
wedge 344 in a locked position such that locking wedge is pressed against biasing members 356
and engages a tool disposed within dovetail joint 332. A pin 374 is disposed within hole 376
defined by tool holder 330 at a position in which pin 374 is configured to contact shoulder 368
when locking screw 364 is in an unlocked position to maintain locking screw 364 in engagement
with tool holder 330.
[00201]          FIG. 47 illustrates an example of a coronal sizing and drill guide 380, which is
similar to drill guide 280 described above, that is configured to be mated to tool holder 330. One
of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other tools (e.g., a cut guide) and trials (e.g., tibia
trial) can be adapted to fit the tool holder 330.
[00202]          Coronal sizing and drill guide 380 includes corner drill holes 382, fixation holes
384, 386, sizing pattern 388, a slot 390, and a coronal parallax cue pin 392. Comer drill holes
382 are sized and configured to receive a drill or reamer therein as described above and in
greater detail below. Fixation holes 384, 386 are sized and configured to receive a pin (e.g.,
fixation pin 297) therein for pinning the coronal sizing and drill guide 380 to the tibia and talus,
respectively. Coronal sizing guide 380 can be formed from plastic or other material that is
translucent under a fluoroscope.
[00203]          Slot 390 is sized and configured to receive a mating extension 412 of a guide arm
402 for supporting a sagittal sizing guide assembly 400 as shown in FIG. 48 and described in
greater detail below. Sizing patterns 388 have a shape that corresponds to the outer dimensions
of a tibial implant 1100 (FIG. 84) of an ankle replacement system and is formed from a material
that is opaque under a fluoroscope. Examples of such material include, but are not limited to, a
metallic material. Still referring to FIG. 47, coronal parallax cue pin 392 is located in coronal
sizing and drill guide 380 provides for coronal parallax adjustment as it is aligned with a pair of
pins (not shown) disposed on either side of cue pin 392.
[00204]          Coronal sizing and drill guide 380 also includes a dovetail extension 394
including a pair of opposed rails 396 which extend from an upper surface 398 of coronal sizing
and drill guide 380. Rails 396 are sized and configured to be complementary to rails 336 of
dovetail joint 332 of tool holder 330.
                                                   32

[00205]         Adjustment block 100, tool holder 330, and drill guide 380 are configured to
support a sagittal sizing guide assembly 400 as illustrated in FIGS. 48-56. As best seen FIG. 50,
sagittal sizing guide assembly 400 includes a guide arm 402, a ratchet arm frame 420, and a
sagittal sizing guide body 460.
[00206]         Turning now to FIGS. 48 and 49, guide arm 402 extends from a first attachment
end 404 to a second end 406, which is disposed at a distance from end 404. Attachment end 404
has an enlarged cross-sectional area relative to the sliding area 408 such that one or more
shoulders 410 sized and configured to providing a stop for ratchet arm frame 420. A mating
extension 412 extends from attachment end 404 and has an elongate shape that is sized and
configured to be received within reference line 286 (FIG. 35) defined by drill guide 280
described above. A second extension 414 extends from attachment end 404 in a direction
opposite of mating extension 412 and provides an area for grasping or otherwise being
manipulated. In some embodiments, extension 414 terminates at region 416 having a cylindrical
shape, although one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that region 416 can have other
geometric shapes to facilitate manipulation.
[00207]          Sliding area 408 and second end 406 are elongate and have a cross-sectional
shape that facilitates sliding while at the same time preventing rotation by ratchet arm frame 420.
In some embodiments, for example, sliding area 408 and second end 406 have a trapezoidal
cross sectional area such that ratchet arm frame 420 can slide along the length of guide arm 402
without rotationally pivoting. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that sliding area
408 and second end 406 can have other cross-sectional geometries.
[00208]         Turning now to FIGS. 49-53, ratchet arm frame 420 defines an opening 422
(FIGS. 49 and 52) sized and configured to receive sliding area 408 and second end 406 slidably
therein as shown in FIG. 49. A second hole 424 illustrated in FIG. 49 is defined by ratchet arm
frame 420 orthogonal to opening 422 such that the second hole 424 intersects opening 422.
Ratchet arm frame 420 also defines a blind opening 426 and one or more pin or screw holes 428.
Blind opening 426 extends inwardly from the side 430 that is disposed opposite the side 432 in
which the second hole 424 is defined as best seen in FIG. 53. One or more pin or screw holes
428 inwardly extend from side 434 and intersect with blind opening 426.
[00209]         A locking knob 436 is sized and configured to be received within opening 422
and lock the position of ratchet arm frame 420 along the length of guide arm 402. In some
                                                   33

embodiments, locking knob 436 is biased by a biasing member (not show), such as a
compression spring, such that an abutment portion (not shown) of locking knob engages and
frictionally locks a portion of the sliding area 408 of guide arm 402. Blind opening 426 is sized
and configured to receive a portion of a ratchet arm 442 therein. As best seen in FIGS. 52-53,
ratchet arm 442 includes a plurality of ridges 444 or notches along at least one side 446. Ratchet
arm 442 is coupled to ratchet arm frame 420 by pins or screws 448 that are received within pin
or screw holes 428.
[00210]         Referring now to FIG. 53, sagittal sizing guide body 460 is shown as a rectangular
cuboid defining a channel 462 that extends through the length of sagittal sizing guide body 460
from a first side 464 to a second side 466. A third side 468 defines a chamber 470 sized and
configured to receive a biasing member 472 and push button 474 therein. Push button 474
defines a window 476 (FIGS. 50 and 52) that is sized and configured to receive ratchet arm 442
therein. The bottom ledge 478 of window 476 (FIG. 52) has a width that is sized and configured
to be received within the ridges 444 defined in the side 446 of ratchet arm 442.
[00211]         As shown in FIGS. 52 and 53, a dowel hole 480 inwardly extends from side 466
and is sized and configured to receive a dowel 482 that is formed from a material that is opaque
to fluoroscopy. Dowel hole 480 is disposed at distance from side 484 of sagittal sizing guide
body 460 that corresponds to a location at which the tibia is resected, and dowel hole 480 has a
length that corresponds to a length of tibial implant 1100 of ankle replacement prosthesis 1000,
which is described in greater detail below. Sagittal sizing guide body 460 also includes a fluoro
opaque profile 486 having a size and shape that corresponds to the profile of talar implant 1200
of ankle replacement prosthesis 1000. In some embodiments, the fluoro-opaque profile 486 is
disposed within a recess defined by sagittal sizing guide body 460, and, in some embodiments,
fluoro-opaque profile 486 is coupled to an exterior surface of sagittal sizing guide body 460
using an adhesive or mechanical coupling as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the
art.
[00212]         The combination of dowel 482 and fluoro-opaque profile 486 advantageously
enable the sizing of a talar implant 1200 and the appropriate height of the talar resection to be
check using fluoroscopy prior to resecting the talus. The resection height can be adjusted and
locked in by adjusting knob 111 of adjustment block 100. A number of sagittal sizing guide
bodies 460 can be available such that a surgeon or other health care professional can select the
                                                  34

appropriate size based on the actual anatomy of the patient. The differently sized sagittal sizing
guide bodies 460 can be swapped for one another until the appropriate sagittal sizing guide body
460 is identified.
[00213]         TALAR RESECTION GUIDE AND RELATED COMPONENTS
[00214]         FIGS. 55A-55F illustrate one example of a talar resection guide base 2100 in
accordance with some embodiments. The talar resection guide base 2100 is configured for use
as a base for an anterior talar pilot guide 2130, which is illustrated in FIG. 56, and an anterior
talar finish guide 2142, which is illustrated in FIG. 58, in resecting a talus 265.
[00215]         Talar resection guide base 2100 defines a slot 2102 that extends transversely
across the base 2100. As described in greater detail below, slot 2102 is arranged and configured
to align with the interconnecting holes 2132 defined by anterior talar pilot guide 2130 (FIG. 57)
and slot 2144 defined by the anterior talar finish guide 2142 (FIG. 59). The talar resection guide
base 2100 also includes a plurality of holes 2104-2110 each being sized and configured to
receive a pin or other surgical instrument therein. For example, two inferior holes 2104, 2106
are defined on medial and lateral sides 2120, 2122 of lower flange 2101 of the base 2100 that
extends away from slot 2102. Holes 2104, 2106 are configured to receive fixation pins 298, and
Inferior hole 2105, which is defined between the two inferior holes 2104, 2106, is configured to
receive a pin 2155 (FIG. 62B).
[00216]         Holes 2108, 2110 are defined on medial and lateral sides 2120, 2122 of the upper
flange 2103 of base 2100, and each hole is configured to receive a respective pin 2154, 2156
(FIG. 63) or other surgical device. Although there are five holes 2104-2110 configured to
receive pins described, fewer or more holes are provided in some embodiments.
[00217]         The talar resection guide base 2100 includes holes 2112-2118 disposed near the
slot 2102. Holes 2112, 2114 are defined by upper flange 2103 above the slot 2102, and holes
2116, 2118 are defined by lower flange 2101 below the slot 2102. Slot 2102 includes a shoulder
2124 that extends along the circumference of slot 2102. The superior side 2126 of the shoulder
2124 includes a narrow lateral slit 2128 extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of slot 2012
and being sized and configured to receive a saw blade or bone saw therein. Slit 2128 is
configured to aid in creating a posterior talar chamfer resection 2170 as described below.
[00218]         Turning now to FIG. 56, an isometric view of one example of the anterior talar
pilot guide 2130 is illustrated in accordance with some embodiments. The anterior talar pilot
                                                  35

guide 2130 includes a plurality of interconnecting holes 2132a, 2132b, 2132c, 2132d that
cooperate to define a slot 2132 that extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the anterior talar
pilot guide 2130. Each hole of slot 2132 is configured to receive a talar reamer 2162 (FIGS. 66
67). The anterior talar pilot guide 2130 also includes pegs 2134, 2136 on its posterior side 2138.
Each peg 2134, 2136 is sized and configured to be received in holes 2112-2118 adjacent to slot
2102 of the talar resection guide base 2100 such that the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 can be
coupled to the talar resection guide base 2100 as illustrated in FIG. 57. The anterior talar pilot
guide 2130 further includes an inferior tab 2140 for ease of assembly and disassembly.
[00219]         FIG. 58 is anisometric view of one example of the anterior talar finish guide 2142
in accordance with some embodiments. The anterior talar finish guide 2142 includes a slot 2144
extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of finish guide 2142. Slot 2144 is configured to
receive the talar reamer 2162 (FIGS. 66, 70-71). Anterior talar finish guide 2142 also includes
pegs 2146, 2148, which extend inferiorly from the posterior side 2150 of finish guide 2142 and
are configured to be received in holes 2112-2118 near the slot 2102 of the talar resection guide
base 2100 such that anterior talar finish guide 2142 can be coupled to talar resection guide base
2100 as shown in FIG. 59. The anterior talar finish guide 2142 also includes an inferior tab 2152
for ease of assembly and disassembly.
[00220]         The use of the talar resection guide base 2100 in combination with the anterior
talar pilot guide 2130 and anterior talar finish guide 2142 is described with reference to FIGS.
60-74. FIG. 60 is an isometric view of one example of the talar resection guide base 2100
attached to a talus 265 via fixation pins 298 in accordance with some embodiments. The talar
resection guide base 2100 is connected to a talus 265 by sliding the holes 2104, 2106 of the talar
resection guide base 2100 over fixation pins 298, which can be previously installed having been
guided using a talar dome trial device, such as floating trial 250 shown in FIG. 30 and described
above. In some embodiments, the talar resection guide base 2100 is seated flush to the
previously resected talar surface. As illustrated in FIGS. 61 and 62A, temporary fixation screws
or pins 2154, 2156 are inserted into the two holes 2108, 2110 on either side of the base 2100
using a T-handle pin driver 2158, which is illustrated in FIG. 61. As illustrated in FIG. 62B, pin
2155 can be inserted through inferior hole 2105 for additional stability. Pin 2155 can be cut
flush to the surface of the talar resection guide base 2100 to prevent interference with any saw
blades and reamers.
                                                   36

[00221]         Turning now to FIGS. 63 and 64, an appropriately sized saw blade or bone saw
2160 is inserted through the lateral slit 2128 in the shoulder 2124 of the slot 2102 of the talar
resection guide base 2100. The saw blade or bone saw 2160 is used to resect the talus 265 to
create the posterior talar chamfer 2170, as best in FIG. 74. Once the area is resected, the saw
blade or bone saw 2160 is removed.
[00222]         As illustrated in FIG. 65, the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 is coupled to the talar
resection guide base 2100 by inserting the pegs 2134, 2136 of the anterior talar pilot guide 2130
into holes 2112, 2114 located in the upper flange 2103 above the slot 2102 of the talar resection
guide base 2100. An appropriate size talar reamer, such as talar reamer 2162 illustrated in FIG.
66, is used to make plunge cuts through the interconnecting holes that form slot 2132 of the
anterior talar pilot guide 2130. In some embodiments, the talar reamer 2162 has a solid elongate
body 2164 with one end 2166 configured to be received in the holes 2132 of the anterior talar
pilot guide 2130 as a means to make plunge cuts in the talus 265. The talar reamer 2162 includes
a collar 2168 on its end 2166 that serves as a stop for reaming depth.
[00223]         Turning now to FIG. 67, plunge cuts are made to prepare the talar surface for
making an anterior chamfer 2172, which is best seen in FIG. 74. Once the plunge cuts have been
made, the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 is removed from the talar resection guide base 2100 and
is rotated 180' as shown in FIG. 68. Pegs 2134, 2136 of the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 are
inserted into two holes 2116, 2118 below the slot 2102 of the talar resection guide base 2100.
[00224]         As illustrated in FIG. 69, the talar reamer 2160 is used to plunge cut through the
interconnecting holes that collectively define slot 2132 of the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 to
prepare the talar surface for an anterior flat 2174, which is best seen in FIG. 74. The anterior
talar pilot guide 2130 is removed from the talar resection guide base 2100 once the plunge cuts
have been made.
[00225]         FIG. 70 illustrates the anterior talar finish guide 2142 coupled to talar resection
guide base 2100, which is accomplished by inserting the pegs 2146, 2148 of the anterior talar
finish guide 2142 into two holes 2112, 2114 defined in the upper flange 2103 of the talar
resection guide base 2100. With finish guide 2142 coupled to talar resection guide base 2100,
the talar reamer 2162 is used to perform the finishing cuts for the anterior chamfer 2172 by
sliding the talar reamer 2162 from side to side within the slot 2144 of the finish guide 2142, as
indicated by arrow ARI in FIG. 71. In some embodiments, the talar reamer 2162 is positioned
                                                   37

flush against the anterior talar finish guide 2142 for each reaming step to ensure that the bone
cuts are at the proper depth.
[00226]          Once the finishing cuts for the anterior chamfer 2172 have been made, the
anterior talar finish guide 2142 is removed from the talar resection guide base 2100 and is rotated
180' as illustrated in FIG. 72. The pegs 2146, 2148 of the anterior talar finish guide 2142 are
inserted into holes 2116, 2118 defined by the lower flange 2101 of the talar resection guide base
2100. As shown in FIG. 73, the talar reamer 2162 is used to perform the finishing cuts for the
anterior talar flat 2174 by sliding the talar reamer 2162 from side to side within the slot 2144 of
the finish guide 2142, as indicated by arrow AR2. FIG. 74 illustrates the talus 265 once the
anterior talar finish guide 2142, talar resection guide base 2100, and pins 2154, 2156 have been
removed. The edges of the residual bone can be cleaned up as will be understood by one of
ordinary skill in the art.
[00227]          FIG. 75 is an isometric views of one example of a talar peg drill guide 2180 in
accordance with some embodiments. The talar peg drill guide 2180 has an arcuate body
configured to be placed on a joint space of the resected talus 265. In the embodiment illustrated
in FIG. 75, talar peg drill guide 2180 includes holes 2182, 2184, 2186 on its anterior side. One
smaller hole 2182 is disposed between holes 2184, 2186 and is configured to receive a pin 2210.
Holes 2184, 2186, which are disposed on either side of hole 2182, are configured to receive an
anterior peg drill 2212 (FIG. 79). In some embodiments, the superior surface of talar peg drill
guide 2180 has a contour that is similar to the contour of the articulating surface of the ankle
replacement prosthesis as shown in FIG. 75.
[00228]          FIG. 76 illustrates one example of a talar implant holder 2188 in accordance with
some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 76, talar implant holder 76 can be a scissor-shaped tool
having a first end 2190 and a second end 2192, which are attached at an approximate center
2189. End 2190 includes two arms 2194, 2196 with each arm 2194, 2196 defining a respective
hole 2198, 2200 at its detached end. Holes 2198, 2200 are sized and configured to receive a
surgeon's finger as a means to grasp the talar implant holder 2188. End 2192 defines two legs
2202, 2204 with each leg 2202, 2204 being curved inwardly at its detached end 2206, 2208 as a
means to grasp a talar implant such as the talar peg drill guide 2180.
[00229]          Turning now to FIG. 77, the previously described tibial tray trial 210 is inserted
into the resected joint space between tibia 260 and talus 265. The talar implant holder 2188
                                                  38

(FIG. 76) is used to insert the talar peg drill guide 2180 into the joint space below tibial tray trial
210. The previously described poly trial insert 230 is inserted into the tibial trial 210. A trial
reduction is performed to establish optimal talar medial/lateral positioning. The foot F is slightly
plantarflexed and a pin 2210 is inserted through the small hole 2182 in the center of the talar peg
drill guide 2180 as a means to temporarily hold the talar peg drill guide 2180 in position, as
illustrated in FIG. 78.
[00230]          FIG. 79 illustrates one example of an anterior peg drill 2212 in accordance with
some embodiments. Peg drill 2212 includes a stop 2214 that is configured to limit the depth to
which the peg drill 2212 is inserted into a bone. FIG. 80 illustrates anterior peg drill 2212 being
inserted into holes 2184, 2186 to drill holes 2216, 2218 shown in FIG. 81. Holes 2216, 2218
formed by anterior peg drill 2212 being inserted into holes 2284, 2286 are sized and configured
to receive anterior pegs 1202 for securing the talar dome 1200 to talus 265 (FIG. 99) as described
in greater detail below. FIG. 81 illustrates the holes 2216, 2218 formed in talus 265 and the
resected joint space once pins 2210 are removed from in the tibia 260 and talus 265 as are the
talar peg drill guide 2180, poly trial insert 230, and tibial trial 210.
[00231]          FIGS. 82 and 83 illustrate one example of a tibial tray impaction insert 2220 in
accordance with some embodiments. As shown in FIGS. 82 and 83, the tibial tray impaction
insert 2220 has a body 2222 having a rectangular cuboid shape with curved insertion edge 2223
configured to be received in tibial implant 1100 (FIGS. 84, 86) as described in greater detail
below. More particularly, body 2222 includes two opposed longer sides 2234, 2236 that are
separated from one another by curved insertion edge 2223 and end 2226 from which extension
2224 is disposed. Body 2222 also includes a superior side 2237 and an inferior side 2238.
[00232]          The tibial tray impaction insert 2220 includes an extension 2224 extending
perpendicularly from end 2226 of tibial tray impaction insert 2220. Extension 2224 also has a
shape of a rectangular cuboid and defines a hole 2228 on its anterior face 2230 that is sized and
configured to receive an end 2266 of insertion handle 2264, which is shown in FIG. 87.
[00233]          One example of a tibial implant 1100 is illustrated in FIGS. 84 and 85. Tibial
implant 1100 has a rectangular cuboid body 1102 with a plurality (three in this example) pegs
1104 protruding out of the superior side 1106 of body 1102. Pegs 1104 are configured to be
received holes 263 formed in the tibia 260 (FIG. 41) as described above. Holes 1108, 1110 are
defined by the anterior face 1112 of tibial implant 1100 with each hole 1108, 1110 being sized
                                                   39

and configured to receive two attachment screws 3500 (FIGS. 93A, 93B) for use with a poly
inserter as described in greater detail below. Tibial implant 1100 also includes opposed
shoulders 1114, 1118 that are curved or chamfered relative to superior side 1102 and sides 1120,
1122 of body 1102. A recessed area or recess 2257 extends posteriorly from anterior face 1112
to insertion end (or posterior end) 1116 along the inferior side 1124 of implant 1100.
[00234]          Recess 2257 is sized and configured to receive the sides 2234, 2236 and curved
edge 2223 of the tibial tray impaction insert 2220 as a means for holding the tibial tray impaction
insert 2220 in place in the tibial implant 1100 as shown in FIG. 86. The coupling between tibial
tray impaction insert 2220 and implant 1100 is achieved by sliding the tibial tray impaction
insert 2220 into the tibial implant 1100. Bone cement (not shown) can be applied to the superior
1106, medial 1120, and lateral sides 1122 of the rectangular body 1102 of the tibial implant 1100
while the anterior face 1112 of the tibial tray 1100 and inferior side 2238 of the tibial implant
impaction insert 2220 remains free of any cement.
[00235]          Turning now to FIG. 88, the assemblage of tibial tray implant 1100 and tibial tray
impaction insert 2220 are shown being inserted into the resected joint space between tibia 260
and talus 265 using insertion handle 2264, which is illustrated in FIG. 87. Insertion handle 2264
is coupled to hole 2228 of tibial tray impaction insert 2220 and moves three pegs 1104 of the
tibial implant 1100 into alignment with holes 263 formed in the tibia 260 (FIG. 41). The
insertion handle 2264 is then removed from the hole 2228 of the rectangular extension 2224 of
the tibial tray impaction insert 2220. A mallet or other impaction device can be used to strike
extension 2230 of tibial impaction insert 2220 as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in
the art. The tibial impaction insert 2220 can be slid out of engagement with tibial tray implant
2220, which is configured to receive a poly implant/insert 1300 using a poly insertion device
3100, 3300.
[00236]          POLY INSERTER AND RELATED COMPONENTS
[00237]          FIGS. 89 through 95 illustrate the construction and operation of one example of a
poly inserter 3100 and poly insert guide rail 3300 in accordance with some embodiments. The
purpose of poly inserter 3100 and poly insert guide rail 3300 is to assist in the accurate
placement of a poly implant 1300 as will be appreciated and understood after reading the
following description and referencing the figures.
                                                  40

[00238]          FIG. 89 is an isometric view of a poly inserter 3100. Poly inserter 3100
comprises an elongate body 3102 having gripping handle 3148 defining an aperture 3106 that is
at least partially threaded and has an internal diameter sized and configured to slidably receive a
majority of a shaft 3108 of a plunger rod 3110. Gripping handle 3148 defines a pair of gripping
holes 3152 and attachment screw receiving holes 3154.
[00239]          A locking protrusion 3116 extends at an angle from the elongate body 3102
adjacent to the proximal end 3104. Locking protrusion 3116 defines a rectangular opening 3114
that is sized and configured to receive a locking tab 3112 and a cylindrical opening 3118 that
aligns with threaded aperture 3106 for receiving plunger rod 3110 therethrough. Locking tab
3112 defines an aperture 3150 which is configured to receive plunger rod 3110. A pair of
opposed channels 3120 extend proximally from the distal end 3122 of the elongate body 310.
Channels 3120 are sized and configured to receive attachment screws 3500 (FIGS. 93A and 93B)
and are. Opposed channels 3120 are aligned with attachment screw receiving holes 3154 in
gripping handle 3148.
[00240]          Plunger rod 3110 includes a handle 3124 at its proximal end 3126. A shoulder
3132 is disposed adjacent to an enlarged threaded portion 3130 that is disposed between the
proximal end 3126 and a distal end 3128 of plunger rod 3110. A push bar 3140 is connected to
the distal end 3128 of plunger rod 3110 by inserting a push bar extension 3144 into a blind hole
3142 located at the distal-most end of plunger rod 3110. In some embodiments, push bar 3140 is
cross-pinned to plunger rod 3110 using a pin 3138, which is inserted into hole 3134 located at
distal end 3128. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other securement
mechanisms can be used to couple push bar 3142 to plunger rod 3110. A circumferential recess
3146 is defined about the external surface of the push bar extension 3144 and is sized and
configured to receive the pin 3138 therein for coupling the push bar 3140 to the distal end 3128
of the plunger rod 3110. Distal end 3128 of plunger rod 3100 further includes a distal notch
3127.
[00241]          FIG. 90 is an isometric view of a poly inserter 3100 once assembled. Locking tab
3112 is inserted into rectangular opening 3114. Plunger rod 3110 is inserted through threaded
aperture 3106 and cylindrical opening 3118. Push bar 3140 is then connected to the distal end
3128 of plunger rod 3110 as described above.
                                                  41

[00242]         FIG. 91 is an isometric view of one example of a poly insert guide rail 3300 in
accordance with some embodiments. Although shown as a separate component from poly
inserter 3100, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that guide rail 3300 can be
integrally formed with poly inserter 3100. Guide rail 3300 includes a pair of spaced apart rails
3302 connected to a central portion 3306 by a pair of downconnectors 3304. Each rail 3302 has
an interior edge 3308 and an exterior edge 3310. In some embodiments, interior edges 3308 are
rounded while exterior edges 3310 are squared. Downconnectors 3304, which extend in a
direction perpendicular to the direction in which rails extend and central portion 3306 extends,
include a railing protrusion 3312 running parallel with the length of rails 3302. Together, the
interior edges 3308 of rails 3302 and the railing protrusion 3312 define a pair of recesses 3314
configured to slide over the lateral edges 3156 of the elongate body 3102 of poly inserter 3100.
Poly insert guide rail 3300 is coupled to poly inserter 3100 by sliding poly inserter guide rail
3300 over poly inserter 3100 such that recesses 3314 are aligned with lateral edges 3156 of
elongate body 3102.
[00243]         FIG. 92 is an isometric view of a poly inserter 3100 coupled with a poly inserter
guide rail 3300 for guiding a poly insert 1300, which is shown disposed between rails 3302. In
use, plunger rod 3110 is pulled proximally and locked in its proximal-most position by engaging
locking tab 3112. For example, with plunger rod 3110 pulled to its proximal-most position,
distal notch 3127 is aligned with locking tab 3112. Locking tab 3112 is depressed into
rectangular opening 3114, causing the narrower top portion of aperture 3150 to engage distal
notch 3127 and hold plunger rod 3110 in the proximal-most position. This engagement prevents
plunger rod 3110 from prematurely implanting poly implant 1300. Plunger rod 3110 is
prevented from being fully removed as push bar 3140 has a length that is larger than cylindrical
opening 3118. With the plunger rod 3110 locked relative to the position of the poly inserter
3100, a poly implant 1300 is positioned between extending rails 3302 of poly inserter guide rail
3300 as shown in FIG. 92.
[00244]         FIG. 93A is an isometric view of attachment screws 3500 installed in tibial
implant 1100. Attachment screws 3500 comprise a threaded proximal end 3504, a shoulder
portion 3508, a shaft 3502, and a threaded distal portion 3506, which is shown in FIG. 93B.
Attachment screws 3500 are configured to be threadably inserted into tibial implant 1100 using
                                                  42

threaded distal end 3506. Attachment screws 3500 are additionally configured, once threadably
inserted into tibial implant 1100, to be inserted into opposed channels 3120 of poly inserter 3100.
[00245]          FIG. 93B is an isometric view of attachment screws 3500 as they are being
installed in tibial implant 1100. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 93B, attachment
screw 3500 has a non-threaded tip 3510 disposed adjacent to threaded distal portion 3506, which
engages threaded holes 1108, 1110 of tibial implant 1100.
[00246]          FIG. 94 is an isometric view of a poly inserter 3100 connected to attachment
screws 3500 installed in the tibial tray 1100 with the poly insert removed for simplifying the
view. With attachment screws 3500 threadably inserted into threaded holes 1108, 1110 of tibial
implant 1100, the assembled poly inserter 3100 is lowered onto attachment screws 3500 such
that attachment screws 3500 are disposed within opposed channels 3120. An attachment nut
3602 is threadably connected to the threaded proximal end 3504 of each attachment screw 3500
to secure poly inserter to the anterior face 1112 of the tibial implant 1100.
[00247]          FIGS. 95A and 95B are lateral side views of the operation of poly inserter 3100
once secured to tibial implant 1100 in accordance with some embodiments. Locking tab 3112
(not shown in FIGS. 95A and 95B) is pulled in a direction away from elongate body 3102 such
that the wider diameter base of aperture 3150 is aligned with plunger rod 3110 to permit plunger
rod 3110 to slide relative to the elongate body 3102 of poly inserter 3100. Handle 3124 is used
to slide the plunger rod 3110 distally such that poly implant 1300, positioned between rails 3302
of poly inserter guide rail 3300, is slid distally into the resected tibial bone space.
[00248]          Plunger rod 3110 is moved distally until enlarged threaded portion 3130 abuts
threaded hole 3106 of poly inserter 3100 at which point plunger rod 3110 is rotated about its
longitudinal axis to facilitate distal (axial) translation of the plunger rod 3110 relative to elongate
body 3102. Poly implant 1300 does not rotate as the plunger rod 3110 rotates since the plunger
rod 3110 is allowed to spin relative to the push bar 3140 that is in abutting contact with the poly
implant 1300 due to the pin 3138 that is received within the circumferential slot 3146 defined by
push bar extension 3144. Shoulder 3132 prevents excessive downward motion of poly implant
1300 because its diameter is larger than threaded aperture 3106, arresting movement once the
entire enlarged threaded portion 3130 has been threadably inserted into threaded aperture 3106.
[00249]          When poly implant 1300 has been inserted into resected tibial bone space, poly
inserter 3100 is removed from its engagement with poly implant 1300 by removing attachment
                                                    43

nuts 3602 and pulling on handle 3124. Due to the threaded engagement between enlarged
threaded portion 3130 and threaded aperture 3106, poly inserter 3100 is slid along the attachment
screws 3500 until disengaged. As an alternative, poly inserter 3100 may be removed by pulling
on gripping handle 3148. Attachment screws 3500 are then unscrewed from tibial implant 1100.
[00250]          ANKLE REPLACEMENT PROSTHESIS
[00251]          FIGS. 96-98 provide various views of the complete ankle replacement prosthesis
1000 in accordance with some embodiments, and FIG. 99 illustrates the position of the ankle
replacement prosthesis 1000 upon completion of an ankle replacement procedure.
[00252]          Ankle replacement prosthesis 1000 comprises tibial implant 1100, talar implant
1200, and poly implant 1300.
[00253]          Upon completion of an ankle replacement procedure, tibial implant 1100 is
connected to the tibia 260, with pegs 1104 disposed within peg holes 263 in the resectioned tibia
260. Talar implant 1200 is connected to the talus 265, with talar dome anterior pegs 1202
disposed within holes 2214 and 2216. Poly implant 1300 is inserted and disposed between tibial
implant 1100 and talar implant 1200.
[00254]          METHOD OF ANKLE REPLACEMENT
[00255]          A method of performing an ankle replacement is disclosed using the above
described system.
[00256]          An anterior incision is made lateral of the tibialis avoiding the anterior tendons
and never bundle to expose the tibia 260, talus 265, and a portion of the midfoot. In some
embodiments, the incision is approximately 125 mm long; however, one of ordinary skill in the
art will understand that the incision can be greater or less than 125 mm. Gutter fork 10,
illustrated in FIG. 1, is inserted into the medial gutter of the ankle joint.
[00257]          Once medial gutter fork 10 is inserted into the medial gutter of the ankle joint,
rotation guide slide 20 is operationally connected to medial gutter fork 10 by placing guide hole
18 over shaft 2 as illustrated in FIG. 4A. Rotation guide slide 20 is positioned with either first
channel 16 or second channel 17 facing away from the tibia 260. Rotation guide pointer 30 is
operationally connected to rotation guide slide 20 by sliding protrusion 26 into either first
channel 16 or second channel 17, whichever is facing away from the tibia 260. Thus assembled,
an operator uses finger tab 27 to rotate the combined rotation guide slide 20 and rotation guide
pointer 30 about an axis defined by shaft 2. An operator may also use finger tab 27 to slide
                                                   44

rotation guide pointer 30 along an axis defined by first channel 16 or second channel 17. The
operator thus uses finger tab 27 to rotate the combined rotation guide slide 20 and rotation guide
pointer 30 and slide rotation guide pointer 30 until pointer extension 24 is approximately aligned
with the mechanical axis of the tibia 260.
[00258]         Once the rotation guide assembly 40 is positioned as described above, the position
of the rotation guide pointer 30 relative to the rotation guide slide 20 is fixed by tightening
screws 37. A first guide pin 50 is inserted through pin hole 28 and into the tibia 260 as shown in
FIG. 4B. With first guide pin 50 thus inserted, the entire rotation guide assembly 40 is removed,
leaving first guide pin 50 in place as illustrated in FIG. 5.
[00259]         With attention now to FIG. 12, the alignment frame assembly 140 is assembled by
inserting the distal end 104 of the proximal alignment frame 109 into the distal alignment frame
105. The alignment frame assembly 140 is connected to the tibia 260 by sliding the hole 194 of
the distal end 124 of the distal alignment frame 105 over the first guide pin 50. A pin 154 is
installed percutaneously through the hole 103 at the proximal end 102 of the proximal alignment
frame 109 into a tibial tuberosity.
[00260]         Alternatively, the knee bracket 142 and rubber strap 148 can be used to secure the
alignment frame assembly 140 to the proximal end of the tibia 260, as illustrated in FIGS. 13A
and 13B. The knee bracket post 146 is inserted into the hole 103 at the proximal end 102 of the
proximal alignment frame 109. The knee bracket base 144 is then positioned over the proximal
end of the tibia 260 and secured in place using the rubber strap 148 by wrapping the rubber strap
148 laterally around the tibia 260 and attaching the hooks 152 of the knee bracket base 144 to the
holes 151 of the rubber strap 148.
[00261]         Turning now to FIG. 14, once the alignment frame assembly 140 is connected to
the proximal end of the tibia 260, the distal end 124 of the distal alignment frame 105 is placed
above the tibia 260 such that a gap, G, is provided between the distal alignment frame 105 and
the tibia 260. In some embodiments, the gap G is approximately 20-25 mm from the frame 105
to the tibia 260; however, gap G can have other dimensions that are greater than or less than 20
25 mm. Once the desired gap is achieved, distal knob 196 is turned to loosely lock the distal end
124 of the distal alignment frame 105 to the first guide pin 50.
[00262]         As illustrated in FIGS. 13A-16, the proximal alignment frame 109 is adjustable in
length and is maintained at a fixed length by turning the most proximal knob 128 of the distal
                                                   45

alignment frame 105. The second knob 108 of the proximal alignment frame 109 is then turned
as indicated by arrow Al to loosely lock the alignment frame assembly 140 to the pin 154 and/or
knee bracket post 146.
[00263]         The angel wing alignment guide 160 is then attached to the alignment frame
assembly 140 by inserting the angel wing alignment guide post 166 into the slot 138 at the distal
end 124 of the distal alignment frame 105, as illustrated in FIG. 17. A set screw (not shown) is
then inserted through hole 139 that intersects the slot 138 and secured with a hex driver 174.
The set screw (not shown) can be loosened to allow proximal/distal adjustment of the angel wing
alignment guide 160.
[00264]         As shown in FIG. 18, coronal rotation adjustments can be made to the proximal
alignment frame 109. The first knob 106 at the proximal end 102 of the proximal alignment
frame 109 can be turned as indicated by arrow A2 to allow adjustment of the angle of a
perpendicular slot 101 at the proximal end 102 of the proximal alignment frame 109 for coronal
rotation adjustment as indicated by arrows A3 and A4. The position of the angel wing alignment
guide 160 can be viewed under A/P fluoroscopy to establish coronal alignment, which is
typically parallel to the natural joint line, as illustrated in FIG. 20. Once coronal alignment is
established, first knob 106 is turned in direction A2 to lock the relative positions of proximal
alignment frame 109 and angel wing alignment guide 160.
[00265]         Continuing now to FIG. 21, the alignment rod 170 is inserted through one of the
holes 164 in either side of the angel wing alignment guide base 162 where it slides along the hole
164 until it reaches the stop collar 172. Either the second knob 108 or the distal knob 196 of the
alignment frame assembly 140 can be turned to allow sagittal rotation adjustment, as illustrated
in FIG. 22. The position of the alignment rod 170 can be viewed under lateral fluoroscopy to
establish sagittal rotation, which is typically parallel to a shaft of the tibia 260, as illustrated in
FIG. 23.
[00266]         The angel wing alignment guide 160 and alignment rod 170 are removed once the
desired position has been achieved. As illustrated in FIGS. 24 and 25, two pin sleeves 176 are
inserted into two aligned holes 132 of the plurality of holes 132 at the distal end 124 of the distal
alignment frame 105 that provide the optimal bone purchase, which is typically the two center
holes 132. A trocar 178, as illustrated in FIG. 24B, is inserted into each of the pin sleeves 176 to
                                                     46

create "stab wounds" for percutaneous pins, as illustrated in FIG. 26. The trocar 178 is then
removed.
[00267]          As illustrated in FIG. 27, a pin 150 is inserted into each of the pin sleeves 176 and
through both cortices of the tibia 260. Once the pins 150 are placed, the pin sleeves 176 are
removed and the second knob 108 and distal knob 196 are loosened to remove the alignment
frame assembly 140. The proximal tibial pin 154 or knee bracket 142 and the first guide pin 50
are then removed, leaving pins 150 in the tibia 260, as illustrated in FIG. 28.
[00268]          The adjustment block 100 of FIG. 29 is lowered onto pins 150 until first frame
110 is slightly above the anterior surface of the tibia 260. Locking screw 112 is then rotated to
lock the position of adjustment block 100 relative to the tibia 260.
[00269]          With attention now to FIG. 35, a drill guide 280 is connected to the adjustment
block 100, lowered onto the anterior surface of the tibia 260, and locked into position using a set
screw (not shown). Drill guide 280 is then translated to the center of the ankle joint using
proximal-distal adjustment knob 111 and the medial-lateral adjustment knobs 121 a and 121b.
Once centered, the position of drill guide 280 is locked using set screws (not shown).
[00270]          The operator sizes the tibial implant 1100 of the ankle replacement system by
mounting a drill guide 280 on the tool holder and adjusting its position using knobs 111, 121,
131. The physician views an X-ray of the tibia bone 260 and drill guide 280 and determines
whether it is the optimum size and position for the patient. The position can be adjusted based
on the X-ray, using knobs 111, 121, 131. If the size of the resectioning cut corresponding to the
drill guide 280 is too large or too small, the physician removes the drill guide, selects a different
size drill guide, and snaps the new drill guide onto the tool holder 134 of the adjustment block
100. The drill guide is then repositioned against the tibia 260, imaged by fluoroscope, and the
size is again checked.
[00271]          With attention now to FIGS. 50-53, the sagittal sizing guide assembly 400 is then
used to fluoroscopically identify the appropriate talar implant 1200 size and to set the appropriate
height of talar resection. Sagittal sizing guide assembly 400 is connected to coronal sizing and
drill guide 380 by lowering guide arm 402 such that mating extension 412 is engaged with slot
390. For minimal parallax distortion the sagittal sizing guide assembly 400 should be oriented to
hang on the side of the ankle closest to the c-arm receiver and the sagittal sizing guide assembly
400 should be placed as close to the bones of the ankle joint, particularly the tibia 260, as
                                                   47

possible. The sagittal guides are used to appropriately evaluate and position the proximal/distal
resection placement of tibial and talar resections. In some embodiments, the talar size and talar
chamfer preparations are estimated with the talar profile 486 on the distal side of sagittal guide.
The tibia tray length is also indicated with the tibial pin length which is the proximal pin 480.
The push button 476 allows for appropriate AP placement.
[00272]          As described above, the sagittal sizing guide body 460 includes a combination of
dowel 482 and fluoro-opaque profile 486 to advantageously enable the sizing of a talar implant
1200 and the appropriate height of the talar resection to be checked using fluoroscopy prior to
resecting the talus. The height of resection height can be adjusted and locked in by adjusting
knob 111 of adjustment block 100. A number of sagittal sizing guide bodies 460 can be
available such that a surgeon or other health care professional can select the appropriate size
based on the actual anatomy of the patient. The differently sized sagittal sizing guide bodies 460
can be swapped for one another until the appropriate sagittal sizing guide body 460 is identified.
[00273]          As illustrated in FIG. 36, to resect the tibia 260, drill guide 280 is first pinned to
the tibia 260 using fixation pins 287 inserted through the pin holes 282 and trimmed such that
pins 287 extend slightly above the drill guide 280. Then the operator drills holes in the tibia 260
through the guides holes 281 using the drill guide 280 and drill 288. The holes thus drilled in the
bone 260 define proximal corners of a resectioning cut to be performed in the tibia. The operator
then removes the drill guide 280, while leaving the pins 287 in place (in the distal portion of the
tibia 260 to be removed by the resectioning). While removing the drill guide 280, the adjustment
block 100 can remain locked in the first coordinates with the first frame 110 adjusted to the same
proximal-distal coordinate and the second frame 120 adjusted to the same medial-lateral
coordinate.
[00274]          With attention now to FIG. 37, a cut guide 290 corresponding to previously
utilized drill guide 280 is connected to adjustment block 100 and fixation pins 287. In some
embodiments, additional fixation pins 297 are used to pin cut guide 290 to the talus bone 265.
Once the cut guide 290 is positioned and pinned, the operator performs the resectioning cuts
through the guide slots 295, cutting the bone to connect the previously drilled holes. In some
embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 37, one cut guide 290 is used for both
the tibia resection and the first cut of the talar resection. The cut guide 290 is then removed from
the surgery site, and detached from the adjustment block 100. The sections of the tibia 260 and
                                                     48

talus 265 that have been cut are removed, along with the fixation pins 287 and 297. Various
tools such as a corner chisel, bone removal screw, posterior capsule release tool, and bone rasp
may be used to complete the resection, remove the resected portions from the surgery site, and
clean the resection edges.
[00275]          In some embodiments, a single coronal sizing and drill guide 380 is used in place
of a drill guide 280 and cut guide 290.
[00276]          As illustrated in FIG. 38, following the initial resectioning the operator inserts the
tibia trial 210 into the resected joint space and seated flush against the resected tibia 260. In
some embodiments, the operator leaves adjustment block 100 locked to fixation pins 150 and
snaps the tibia trial 210 onto the tool holder 134. In other embodiments, the adjustment block
100 is removed and tibia trial 210 is pinned in place using fixation pins.
[00277]          With tibia trial 210 in place and seated flush against the resected tibia 260, the
operator drills a plurality (e.g., 3) peg holes 263 in the distal surface 262 of the resectioned tibia
260 using the tibia peg drill 299. In some embodiments, a tibial peg punch is used to prepare peg
holes 263. The holes 212 (FIG. 31) of the tibia trial 210 are used to locate peg holes 263. FIG.
41 shows the distal end 261 of the tibia 260 at the completion of the peg drilling, with the three
peg holes 263 in the resectioned surface 262 of the tibia.
[00278]          With attention now to FIGS. 42-45, the operator now performs a trial reduction to
ensure the correct height of the poly trial insert 230 and the correct position of the talus dome.
Floating trial 250 and poly trial insert 230 are inserted into the resected joint space. The talar
implant anterior-posterior coordinate is determined by moving the floating trial 250 to the
location where it best articulates with the concave surface 232 of the poly trial insert 230. Once
the position of floating trial 250 is optimized, two additional fixation pins 298 are inserted
through the pin holes 253 of the floating trial 250. Floating trial 250 and poly insert trial 230 are
then removed from the resectioned joint space and two additional resectioning cuts, described
below, are performed to match the geometry of the talar dome to the talar implant 1200 of the
ankle replacement system.
[00279]          As shown in FIG. 60, the talar resection guide base 2100 is connected to the talus
265 by sliding holes 2104, 2106 of the talar resection guide base 2100 over fixation pins 298.
Temporary fixation screws or pins 2154, 2156 are inserted into the two holes 2108, 2110 on
either side of the base 2100 using a T-handle pin driver 2158. A bone saw 2160 is inserted
                                                   49

through the lateral slit 2128 in the shoulder 2124 of the slot 2102 of the talar resection guide base
2100. The saw blade or bone saw 2160 is used to resect the talus 265 to create the posterior talar
chamfer 2170, as illustrated in FIG. 74. Once the area is resected, the bone saw 2160 is and
resected bone piece are removed from the surgery site.
[00280]          As illustrated in FIG. 65, the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 is then inserted into
the talar resection guide base 2100 and a talar reamer 2162 is used to make plunge cuts through
the interconnecting holes 2132 of the anterior talar pilot guide 2130. As illustrated in FIG. 68,
the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 is removed from the talar resection guide base 2100 and is
rotated 180'. The talar reamer 2162 is then used to plunge cut through the interconnecting holes
2132 of the anterior talar pilot guide 2130 to prepare the talar surface for an anterior flat 2174 as
best seen in FIG. 74. The anterior talar pilot guide 2130 is then removed from the talar resection
guide base 2100.
[00281]          Next, as shown in FIG. 70, an anterior talar finish guide 2142 is inserted into the
talar resection guide base 2100 and the talar reamer 2162 is used to perform the finishing cuts for
the anterior chamfer 2172 by sliding the talar reamer 2162 from side to side within the slot 2144
of the finish guide 2142, as indicated by arrow AR1. The anterior talar finish guide 2142 is then
removed from the talar resection guide base 2100, is rotated 180', and re-engaged with the talar
resection guide base 2100. The talar reamer 2162 is then used to perform the finishing cuts for
the anterior talar flat 2174 by sliding the talar reamer 2162 from side to side within the slot of the
finish guide 2142, as indicated by arrow AR2. Having completed the talar finishing cuts, the
anterior talar finish guide 2142, talar resection guide base 2100 and temporary fixation pins
2154, 2156 are removed from the surgery site.
[00282]          Having completed resectioning the ankle joint, the tibial trial 210 is again
positioned in the resectioned tibial bone space and connected to adjustment block 100. In
alternative embodiments, the tibial trial 210 is again pinned in place using fixation pins. The
talar implant holder 2188 is used to insert the talar peg drill guide 2180 into the joint space of the
resected talus 265. The poly trial insert 230 is inserted into the tibial trial 210. A trial reduction
is performed to establish optimal talar medial/lateral positioning. The foot F is slightly
plantarflexed and a pin 2210 is inserted through the small hole 2182 in the center of the talar peg
drill guide 2180 as a means to temporarily hold the talar peg drill guide 2180 in position, as
illustrated in FIG. 78.
                                                    50

[00283]          As illustrated in FIG. 80, anterior peg drill 2212 is inserted into each of the holes
2184, 2186 of the talar peg drill guide 2180 and is used to drill holes 2214, 2216 for the talar
dome anterior pegs 1202. Pin 2210 in the talus 265 is removed and the talar peg drill guide
2180, poly trial insert 230, and tibial trial 210 are also removed from the surgery site.
[00284]          With attention now to FIGS. 83-86, the tibial tray impaction insert 2220 is
attached to the tibial implant 1100 in preparation for insertion of tibial implant 1100. Bone
cement (not shown) may be applied to the superior, medial and lateral sides 1106, 1120, 1122 of
the rectangular body 1102 of the tibial implant 1100, but the anterior face 1112 and inferior side
2238 of the tibial implant impaction insert 2220 remain free of bone cement. The insertion
handle 2264 is inserted into the hole 2228 of the rectangular extension 2224 of the tibial tray
impaction insert 2220. The insertion handle 2264 is used to insert the tibial implant 1100 and
tibial tray impaction insert 2220 into the resected space of the tibia 260. Tibial implant 1100 is
inserted and connected to tibia 260 with the three pegs 1104 of the tibial implant 1100 inserted
into peg holes 263. The insertion handle 2264 is then removed, and an offset tibial implant
impactor may be used to complete seating of the tibial implant 1100. Fluoroscopic imaging may
be used to verify the tibial implant 1100 is fully seated.
[00285]          The talar implant 1200 is then prepared for implantation. In some embodiments,
bone cement is applied to portions of the talar implant 1200 which will seat on the talus 265.
Talar implant 1200 is then connected to the talus 265, with talar dome anterior pegs 1202
disposed within holes 2214 and 2216. A talar implant impactor may be used to complete seating
of the talar implant 1200, and fluoroscopic imaging may be used to verify the talar implant 1200
is fully seated.
[00286]          The ankle joint is now prepared for a poly implant 1300. Poly inserter 3100 is
assembled as shown in FIG. 90 by inserting locking tab 3112 into rectangular opening 3114,
inserting plunger rod 3110 through threaded aperture 3106 and cylindrical opening 3118, and
connecting push bar 3140 to the distal end 3128 of plunger rod 3110 as described above. Poly
insert guide rail 3300 is then coupled to poly inserter 3100.
[00287]          With attention now to FIGS. 93A and 93B, attachment screws 3500 are
threadably inserted into tibial implant 1100. Poly inserter 3100 is lowered onto attachment
screws 3500 such that attachment screws 3500 are disposed within opposed channels 3120. An
attachment nut 3602 is threadably connected to the threaded proximal end 3504 of each
                                                   51

attachment screw 3500 to secure poly inserter to the anterior face 1112 of the tibial implant
1100.
[00288]          As illustrated in FIGS. 95A and 95B, locking tab 3112 is pulled in a direction
perpendicular to elongate body 3102 such that the wider diameter base of aperture 3150 is
aligned with plunger rod 3110 to permit plunger rod 3110 to slide relative to the elongate body
3102 of poly inserter 3100. Handle 3124 is used to slide the plunger rod 3110 distally such that
poly implant 1300, positioned between extending rails 3302 of poly inserter guide rail 3300, is
slid distally into the resected tibial bone space.
[00289]          Once poly implant 1300 has been inserted into resected tibial bone space, poly
inserter 3100 is removed from its engagement with poly implant 1300 by removing attachment
nuts 3602 and pulling on handle 3124. Attachment screws 3500 are then unscrewed from tibial
implant 1100.
[00290]          With attention now to FIG. 99, upon completion of an ankle replacement
procedure, tibial implant 1100 is connected to the tibia 260, with pegs 1104 disposed within peg
holes 263 in the resectioned tibia 260. Talar implant 1200 is connected to the talus 265, with
talar dome anterior pegs 1202 disposed within holes 2214 and 2216. Poly implant 1300 is
inserted and disposed between tibial implant 1100 and talar implant 1200.
[00291]          PATIENT-SPECIFIC ADAPTER
[00292]          As noted above, various modifications can be made to the disclosed systems and
methods. One example of such a modification is to utilize patient-specific locator mounts, such
as those described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 12/711,307, entitled
"Method for Forming a Patient Specific Surgical Guide Mount, U.S. Patent Application No.
13/330,091, entitled "Orthopedic Surgical Guide," and U.S. Patent Application No. 13/464,175,
entitled "Orthopedic Surgical Guide," the entireties of which are incorporated by reference
herein, to mount the coronal sizing and drill guide 380 to a tibia 260 instead of using the
adjustment block 300 and other associated instrumentation.
[00293]          For example and referring to FIG. 100, a patient-specific mount 3000 can be
fabricated to be positioned at the distal end of tibia 260. The patient-specific mount 3000
includes a pin holder extension 3002 that is configured to hold a pin 3004 in a position such that
pin 2004 extends parallel to the mechanical (e.g., longitudinal) axis of the tibia 260. Pin 3004
can be used to check the proper alignment using fluoroscopy as will be understood by one of
                                                   52

ordinary skill in the art. When the patient-specific guide is properly positioned, pins 287, such as
those described above to secure cut guide 290 (FIGS. 36 and 37), are inserted through holes 3006
that are positioned to align with holes 282 of drill guide 280 or corresponding holes of cut guide
290 and/or coronal sizing and drill guide 380. Patient-specific mount 3000 also includes holes
3008 that are sized and configured to receive pins 3010. Once pins 287 and 3010 have been
installed, patient-specific guide mount 3000 is slid over these pins 287, 3010 and removed.
[00294]         As shown in FIG. 101, coronal sizing and drill guide 380 can be slid over pins
287 and a conversion instrument 3500 is slid over pins 3010. As best seen in FIGS. 102-105,
conversion instrument 3500 includes an elongate body 3502 extending from a proximal end 3504
to a distal end 3506. Conversion instrument 3500 includes a first and second oblong sections
3508, 3510 that extend transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of instrument 3500.
Each oblong section 3508, 3510 defines a respective plurality of interconnected holes 3512,
3514.
[00295]         The distal end 3506 of instrument 3500 includes a dovetail joint 3516 having a
similar construction to the dovetail joint 332 described above with respect to tool holder 330. A
cavity 3518 is defined at the distal end 3506 of instrument 3500 between rails 3520. Cavity 3518
is sized and configured to receive a locking wedge 3522 as best seen in FIGS. 104 and 105. A
through hole 3524 extends from a first side 3526 to a second side 3528 of the distal end 3506 of
instrument 3500 and is sized and configured to receive a locking bolt 3530 therein. Locking bolt
3530 includes a pair of spaced apart shoulders 3532, 3534 along its length. Shoulders 3532,
3534 are configured to abut angled surfaces 3536, 3538 of locking wedge 3522 to press locking
wedge 3522 against a dovetail member of drill guide 280, cut guide 290, and/or coronal sizing
and drill guide 380. In some embodiments, locking bolt 3530 is cross-pinned within hole 3524
by a pin 3540 as best seen in FIG. 105.
[00296]         Locking wedge 3522 is biased in a proximal direction by compression springs
3542, 3544, which are cross-pinned by pins 3546, 3548 such that they are disposed within
channels 3550, 3552 defined by locking wedge 3522. Locking wedge 3522 also defines a
vertical slot 3554 that is sized and configured to receive pin 3556 to cross pin wedge 3522 within
cavity 3518. Turning back to FIG. 102, holes 3558 are defined by the distal end 3506 of
instrument 3500 on either side of dovetail joint 3516. Holes 3558 are sized and configured to
receive pins 3010 therein as shown in FIG. 101.
                                                  53

[00297]          The conversion instrument 3500 can be secured to coronal sizing and drill guide
380 by having dovetail extension 394 of coronal sizing and drill guide 380 be received within
dovetail joint 3516. A hex driver, such as hex driver 174 illustrated in FIG. 19, is used to tighten
locking bolt 3530 within hole 3524. The rotation of locking bolt 3530 causes the engagement
end 3560 (FIG. 105) of locking bolt, which can be threaded or have another engagement feature
disposed thereon, engage a corresponding structure disposed within distal end of instrument
3500 and axially move such that shoulders 3532, 3534 of bolt 3530 contact angled surfaces
3536, 3538 of locking wedge 3522. The axial movement of bolt 3522 causes locking wedge
3522 to move distally compressing compression springs 3548, 3550 and forcing the bottom
surface of locking wedge 3522 against dovetail extension, which is frictionally locked by rails
3520. The remainder of the surgical procedure can be carried out as described above.
[00298]          In some embodiments, a surgical alignment system includes a guide arm, a ratchet
arm frame configured to be coupled slidably to the guide arm, a ratchet arm configured to be
coupled to the ratchet arm frame, and a sagittal sizing guide body configured to be coupled to the
ratchet arm. The sagittal sizing guide body includes a first radiopaque object disposed at a first
