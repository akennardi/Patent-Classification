                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     L-fucose, also referred to as 6-deoxy-L-galactose, is a monosaccharide that is a
component of some N- and 0-linked glycans and glycolipids in animals. (See Becker and
Lowe, Glycobiology 13:41R-51R (2003).) Fucose is typically added as a terminal
modification to glycans, including glycans attached to blood group antigens, selectins and
antibodies. Fucose can be attached to glycans via a(1,2)-, a( 1,3)-, a( 1,4)- and a( 1,6)
linkages by specific fucosyltransferases. a( 1,2)-fucose linkages are typically associated
with the H-blood group antigens. a( 1,3)- and a( 1,4)-fucose linkages are associated with
modification of Lewis' antigens. a( 1,6)-fucose linkages are associated with N-linked
GlcNAc molecules, such as those on antibodies.
[0003]     Fucosylation of proteins is believed to play a role in mammalian development.
Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of the FX gene exhibit pleiotropic abnormalities
including a lethal phenotype. Reduced recovery of mice from heterozygous crosses was
also reported. (Becker et al., Mammalian Genome 14: 130-139 (2003). Aberrant protein
fucosylation has been proposed to be associated with human disease, including up
regulation of sialyl Lewis' and sialyl Lewisy in cancers. These glycans are ligands for E
and P-selectin molecules. In it speculated that increases in sialyl Lewis' and sialyl Lewisy
glycans on cancer cells increases metastases through interaction with E- and P-selectins on
endothelium. Increased fucosylated glycans have also been observed in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, however, there are no approved therapeutic approaches
targeting protein fucosylation levels.

                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [0004]    The methods and compositions described herein are premised in part on the
   unexpected results presented in the Examples, showing that animals administered a
 5 fucose analog have reduced protein fucosylation. Fucosylation of antibodies and other
   proteins can be modulated using the fucose analogs described herein.
   [0005]    In one aspect, methods and compositions for the in vivo production of
   defucosylated proteins are provided. Animals, such as mammals, administered a fucose
   analog (having formula I, II, III, IV, V or VI) produce proteins, such as cell surface
10 proteins, having reduced fucosylation. The reduction in fucosylation is relative to
   animals untreated with the fucose analogs having formula I, II, III, IV, V or VI,
   respectively.
   [0006]    In a related aspect, methods and compositions for the in vivo production of
   antibodies and antibody derivatives with reduced core fucosylation are provided.
15 Animals administered a fucose analog (having formula I, II, III, IV, V or VI) produce
   antibodies and antibody derivatives having reduced core fucosylation (i.e., reduced
   fucosylation of N-acetylglucosamine of the complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chains
   bound to the Fc region through the N-acetylglucosamine of the reducing terminal of the
   sugar chains). The reduction in core fucosylation is relative to animals untreated with
20 the fucose analogs of having formula I, II, III, IV, V or VI, respectively.
   [0007]    In another aspect, pharmaceutical compositions containing fucose analogs and
   formulated for administration to a target animal are provided. The fucose analogs can be
   formulated for administration to an animal to inhibit or reduce fucosylation in vivo.
   [0008]    These and other aspects of the present invention may be more fully understood
25 by reference to the following detailed description, non-limiting examples of specific
   embodiments, and the appended figures.

   dot blot, second dashed rectangle from the right and corresponding column of upper dot
   blot), and 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083; lower dot blot, right most rectangle and
   corresponding column of upper dot blot). After correcting for loading level, the %
   fucosylation is shown on the graph at the right.
10 [0010]     Figure 2 shows the effects on antibody core fucosylation of administration of
   fucose analogs via drinking water. The graphs show % fucosylation of antibodies as a
   determined by gas chromatograph (GC): panels A and B show fucosylation levels of the
   anti-KLH antibodies (Abs) isolated from the treated groups while panels C and D show
   the fucosylation levels of the remaining (non-KLH-specific) IgG antibodies. Panels A
15 and C show the percent fucosylation of each animal determined using a purified antibody
   standard curve (0-100% fucosylation). Panels B and D show the fucosylation level of
   the treated groups as a percentage of the average untreated control group value.
   [0011]     Figure 3 shows the effects on antibody core fucosylation of administration of
   fucose analogs via drinking water. In this figure, fucosylation levels of the non-KLH
20 specific antibodies are shown. Dot blots of protein loading levels (upper left) and fucose
   specific bioluminescence (lower left) are shown for cAC10 standards (upper and lower
   dot blots, left most rectangle), untreated control (upper and lower dot blots, second from
   the left (upper) and right rectangles), and 2-fluorofucose (upper and lower dot blots,
   second from the left (lower) and second from the right rectangles (upper and lower)).
25 After correcting for loading level, the % fucosylation is shown in the graph on the right.
   [0012]     Figure 4 shows the effects of different doses of 2-fluorofucose, administered
   via drinking water, on antibody core fucosylation. The dot blots show protein loading
   levels (left) and fucose specific bioluminescence (middle) for untreated control and 1, 10,
   and 100 mM SGD-2083 (as indicated). The % fucosylation compared to untreated is

                                                  3

   individual mice, and the white cell count was determined by counting on a
   hemacytometer using Turk's solution of exclude red blood cells. Panel B. To determine
   neutrophil counts, the percentage of white blood cells that were Gr- 1+ was determined
   by flow cytometry and applied to the total cell count determined in (A). Panel C. A pool
 5 of lymph nodes was collected from individual mice, single cell suspensions were
   prepared and cells were counted on a hemacytometer. Symbols represent individual
   mice (n=3 per group; diamonds, untreated; squares, 1 mM 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083);
   triangles, 10 mM 2-fluorofucose; circles, 100 mM 2-fluorofucose).
   [0014] Figure 6 shows the effects of administration of 2-fluorofucose on E-selectin
10 binding to neutrophils. Panel A. An example of neutrophil identification by flow
   cytometry. Cells were gated on forward and side scatter to include live white blood cells
   and then applied to the histogram depicting Gr- 1 staining to identify neutrophils. The
   positive cells were gated, the percentage positive cells determined (used for cell counts in
   Figure 5B), and the gate was applied to the histograms in (B). Panel B. Examples of E
15 selectin binding to neutrophils from an untreated animal (left) and an animal treated with
   orally administered 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) at 100mM (right). Grey histograms
   show E-selectin binding and the dotted lines show binding of the secondary reagent
   alone. The geometric mean fluorescent intensity was determined for E-selectin binding.
   Panel C. Geometric mean fluorescent intensity of E-selectin binding was determined for
20 each animal as in (B) and compared between groups (n=3, per group; error bars represent
   standard deviation).

   certain fucose analogs. The LS174T, PC-3, Ramos, HL-60cy and Caki-1 cell lines were
   examined.
25 [0016]    Figure 8 shows the effects of administration of fucose analogs to mouse
   xenograft cancer models. The results of mouse xenograft models with LS174T, PC-3,
   Ramos, HL-60 and Caki-1 cell lines (pre-treated with 2-flurofucose (SGD-2083)), are
   shown in panels A-E, respectively. The results of a mouse xenograft model with an
   untreated LS 174Tcell lines are shown in panel F.

                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   Definitions
   [0018]    The term "antibody" refers to (a) immunoglobulin polypeptides and
 5 immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin polypeptides, i.e., polypeptides of
   the immunoglobulin family, or fragments thereof, that contain an antigen binding site(s)
   that immunospecifically binds to a specific antigen and have an Fc domain comprising a
   complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain(s), or (b) conservatively substituted derivatives
   of such immunoglobulin polypeptides or fragments that immunospecific ally bind to the
10 antigen. Antibodies are generally described in, for example, Harlow & Lane,
   Antibodies: A LaboratoryManual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988).
   [0019]    An "antibody derivative" means an antibody, as defined above (including an
   antibody fragment), or Fc domain or region of an antibody comprising a complex N
   glycoside linked sugar chain, that is modified by covalent attachment of a heterologous
15 molecule such as, e.g., by attachment of a heterologous polypeptide (e.g., a ligand
   binding domain of heterologous protein), or by glycosylation (other than core
   fucosylation), deglycosylation (other than non-core fucosylation), acetylation,
   phosphorylation or other modification not normally associated with the antibody or Fc
   domain or region.
20 [0020]    The term "monoclonal antibody" refers to an antibody that is derived from a
   single cell clone, including any eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell clone, or a phage clone,
   and not the method by which it is produced. Thus, the term "monoclonal antibody" is
   not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology.
   [0021]    The term "Fc region" refers to the constant region of an antibody, e.g., a CHi
25 hinge-CH2-CH3 domain, optionally having a CH4 domain, or a conservatively substituted
   derivative of such an Fc region.
   [0022]    The term "Fc domain" refers to the constant region domain of an antibody, e.g.,
   a CHI, hinge,  CH2, CH3   or CH4 domain, or a conservatively substituted derivative of such
   an Fc domain.
30 [0023]    An "antigen" is a molecule to which an antibody or antibody derivative
   specifically binds.
                                                5

   [0024]     The terms "specific binding" and "specifically binds" mean that the antibody or
   antibody derivative will bind, in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding target
   antigen and not with the multitude of other antigens. Typically, the antibody or antibody
   derivative binds with an affinity of at least about 1x10-7 M, and preferably 10- M to 10 9
 5 M, 10-" M, 10-" M, or 10-1 M and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity
   that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g.,
   BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen.
   [0025]     The terms "inhibit" or "inhibition of" means to reduce by a measurable amount,
   or to prevent entirely.
10 [0026]     As used herein, "alkynyl fucose peracetate" refers to any or all forms of alkynyl
   fucose (5-ethynylarabinose) with acetate groups on positions R -4 (see formula I and II,
   infra), including 6-ethynyl-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2,3,4,5-tetrayl tetraacetate, including the
   (2S,3S,4R,5R,6S) and (2R,3S,4R,5R,6S) isomers, and 5-((S)-1-hydroxyprop-2-ynyl)
   tetrahydrofuran-2,3,4-triyl tetraacetate, including the (2S,3S,4R,5R) and (2R,3S,4R,5R)
15 isomers, and the aldose form, unless otherwise indicated by context. The terms "alkynyl
   fucose triacetate", "alkynyl fucose diacetate" and "alkynyl fucose monoacetate" refer to
   the indicated tri-, di- and mono-acetate forms of alkynyl fucose, respectively.
   [0027]     Unless otherwise indicated by context, the term "alkyl" refers to an
   unsubstituted saturated straight or branched hydrocarbon having from 1 to 20 carbon
20 atoms (and all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific numbers of
   carbon atoms therein), unless otherwise specified. An alkyl group of 1 to 3, 1 to 8 or 1 to
   10 carbon atoms is preferred. Examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso

   selected from N, 0, P, or S). The ring that includes the heteroatom can be aromatic or
   non-aromatic. Unless otherwise noted, the heterocycle is attached to its pendant group at
   any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure.

10 [0042]     Unless otherwise noted, the term "carbocycle," refers to a substituted or
   unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated non-aromatic monocyclic ring system having
   from 3 to 6 ring atoms (and all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific
   numbers of carbon atoms therein) wherein all of the ring atoms are carbon atoms.
   [0043]     Carbocycle groups, whether alone or as part of another group, when substituted
15 can be substituted with, for example, one or more groups, preferably 1 or 2 groups (and
   any additional substituents selected from halogen), including, but not limited to: halogen,
   C1 -C8 alkyl, -C 2 -C8 alkenyl, -C 2 -C8 alkynyl, -O-(C 1 -C8 alkyl), -O-(C 2 -C8 alkenyl), -0

20 N(R') 2 and -CN; where each R' is independently selected from H, -C 1 -C8 alkyl, -C 2 -C8
   alkenyl, -C 2 -C8 alkynyl, or aryl.
   [0044]     Examples of monocyclic carbocylic substituents include cyclopropyl,
   cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, 1-cyclopent-1-enyl, 1-cyclopent-2-enyl, 1-cyclopent-3-enyl,

   cycloheptatrienyl, and -cyclooctadienyl.
   [0045]     When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in any
   formula, its definition in each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other.
   Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations
30 result in stable compounds.

   [0046]     Unless otherwise indicated by context, a hyphen (-) designates the point of
   attachment to the pendant molecule. Accordingly, the term "-(C1 -C10 alkylene)aryl" or
   "-C1 -C1o alkylene(aryl)" refers to a C1 -C1o alkylene radical as defined herein wherein the
   alkylene radical is attached to the pendant molecule at any of the carbon atoms of the
 5 alkylene radical and one of the hydrogen atom bonded to a carbon atom of the alkylene
   radical is replaced with an aryl radical as defined herein.
   [0047]     When a particular group is "substituted", that group may have one or more
   substituents, preferably from one to five substituents, more preferably from one to three
   substituents, most preferably from one to two substituents, independently selected from
10 the list of substituents. The group can, however, generally have any number of
   substituents selected from halogen.
   [0048]     It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular
   location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that molecule. It is
   understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of this invention
15 can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are active
   and chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art
   as well as those methods set forth herein.
   [0049]     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory
   agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other
20 generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.
   The term "pharmaceutically compatible ingredient" refers to a pharmaceutically
   acceptable diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the fucose analog is
   administered.
   [0050]     "Small electron-withdrawing groups" refers to any substituent that has greater
25 electronegativity at the site of substituent attachment than, e.g., a hydrogen atom or
   hydroxy group or relative to the substituent present in fucose at that site. Generally, the
   small electron-withdrawing group has 10 or fewer atoms (other than hydrogen) and
   includes groups such as nitro; cyano and cyanoalkyl (e.g., -CH 2CH 2CN); halogens;
   acetylene or other alkynes or halo alkynes (e.g., -C--CCF 3); alkenes or halo alkenes;
30 allenes; carboxylic acids, ester, amides and halo substituted forms thereof; sulfonic and
   phosphonic acids, esters and amides, and halo substituted forms thereof; haloalkyl
   groups (e.g., -CF 3, -CHF 2, -CH 2CF3 ), acyl and haloacyl groups (e.g., -C(O)CH 3 and
                                                    11

   C(O)CF 3); alkylsulfonyl and haloalkylsulfonyl (e.g., -S(O) 2 alkyl and -S(O) 2haloalkyl);
   aryloxy (e.g., phenoxy and substituted phenoxy); aralkyloxy (e.g, benzyloxy and
   substituted benzyloxy); and oxiranes. Preferred small electron-withdrawing groups are
   those having 8, 7 or 6 or fewer atoms (other than hydrogen).
 5 [0051]    The fucose analogs are typically substantially pure from undesired contaminant.
   This means that the analog is typically at least about 50% w/w (weight/weight) purity, as
   well as being substantially free from interfering proteins and other contaminants.
   Sometimes the agents are at least about 80% w/w and, more preferably at least 90% or
   about 95% w/w purity. Using conventional purification techniques, homogeneous
10 product of at least 99% w/w can be obtained.
   General
   [0052]    The invention provides methods and compositions for reducing protein
   fucosylation in an animal. The methods are premised in part on the unexpected results
15 presented in the Examples showing that administering a fucose analog to a subject (e.g.,
   a mammal) results in an antibody or antibody derivative having reduced core
   fucosylation, and other proteins also having reduced fucosylation. "Reduced
   fucosylation" in the context of proteins generally refers to reduced addition of fucose to
   glycans via a(1,2)-, a(1,3)-, a(1,4)- and a(1,6)- linkages. "Core fucosylation" in the
20 context of an antibody refers to addition of fucose ("fucosylation") to N
   acetylglucosamine ("GlcNAc") at the reducing terminal of an N-linked glycan of an
   antibody. "Reduced core fucosylation" in the context of an antibody refers to a reduction
   of fucose linked to N-acetylglucosamine ("GlcNAc") at the reducing terminal of an N
   linked glycan of an antibody, as compared to an untreated animal.
25 [0053]    In the various aspects described herein, the animal to which the fucose analog is
   administered is typically a mammal and is preferably human. The invention therefore
   further provides methods and compositions for reducing protein fucosylation in a
   mammal, such as a human.
   [0054]    In other aspects, pharmaceutical compositions of fucose analogs and
30 pharmaceutical excipients are provided in which an effective amount of a fucose
   analog(s) is in admixture with the excipients, suitable for administration to a animal. In
                                                 12

   some embodiments, the fucose analog is in dry form (e.g., lyophilized), optionally with
   stabilizers that enhance the composition stability for longer term storage. In some
   embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of a fucose analogs and pharmaceutical
   excipients is formulated for administration to a mammal. In some further embodiments,
 5 a pharmaceutical composition of a fucose analogs and pharmaceutical excipients is
   formulated for administration to a human.
   [0055]     In some embodiments, fucosylation of complex N-glycoside-linked sugar
   chains bound to the Fc region (or domain) of an antibody is reduced. As used herein, a
   "complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain" is typically bound to asparagine 297
10 (according to the numbering system of Kabat), although a complex N-glycoside linked
   sugar chain can also be linked to other asparagine residues. As used herein, the complex
   N-glycoside-linked sugar chain has a bianntennary composite sugar chain, mainly having
   the following structure:
                                                                                        +/-Fucax1

                               +/- GlcNAcp1     -     4Manp1        o 4GcNAcp1        , 4GIcNAc

     +/-Galp1        o 4GIcNAcp1       o 2Manal
15 where + indicates the sugar molecule can be present or absent, and the numbers indicate
   the position of linkages between the sugar molecules. In the above structure, the sugar
   chain terminal which binds to asparagine is called a reducing terminal (at right), and the
   opposite side is called a non-reducing terminal. Fucose is usually bound to N
   acetylglucosamine ("GlcNAc") of the reducing terminal, typically by an al,6 bond (the
20 6-position of GlcNAc is linked to the 1-position of fucose). "Gal" refers to galactose,
   and "Man" refers to mannose.
   [0056]     A "complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain" excludes a high mannose type of
   sugar chain, in which only mannose is incorporated at the non-reducing terminal of the
   core structure, but includes 1) a complex type, in which the non-reducing terminal side
25 of the core structure has one or more branches of galactose-N-acetylglucosamine (also
   referred to as "gal-GlcNAc") and the non-reducing terminal side of Gal-GlcNAc
                                                13

   optionally has a sialic acid, bisecting N-acetylglucosamine or the like; or 2) a hybrid
   type, in which the non-reducing terminal side of the core structure has both branches of
   the high mannose N-glycoside-linked sugar chain and complex N-glycoside-linked sugar
   chain.
 5 [0057]    In some embodiments, the "complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain" includes
   a complex type in which the non-reducing terminal side of the core structure has zero,
   one or more branches of galactose-N-acetylglucosamine (also referred to as "gal
   GlcNAc") and the non-reducing terminal side of Gal-GlcNAc optionally further has a
   structure such as a sialic acid, bisecting N-acetylglucosamine or the like, but excludes
10 chains with a high mannose component.
   [0058]    According to the present methods, typically only a minor amount of fucose is
   incorporated into the sugar chain(s) (e.g., a glycan or complex N-glycoside-linked sugar
   chains) after administering a fucose analog. For example, in various embodiments, less
   than about 60%, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less
15 than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, or less
   than about 1% of the antibodies in the serum of the animal (e.g., a mammal, such as a
   human) are core fucosylated, as compared to an animal not receiving the fucose analog.
   In some embodiments, substantially none (i.e., less than 0.5%) of the antibodies in the
   serum of the animal are not core fucosylated, as compared to an animal not receiving the
20 fucose analog.
   [0059]    In some embodiments, protein fucosylation is reduced by about 60%, by about
   50%, by about 40%, by about 30%, by about 20%, by about 15%, by about 10%, by
   about 5%, or by about 1% for cell surface proteins in the animal (e.g., a mammal, such as
   a human) are fucosylated, as compared to an animal not receiving the fucose analog. In
25 some embodiments, protein fucosylation via a(1,2)-linkage is reduced by about 60%, by
   about 50%, by about 40%, by about 30%, by about 20%, by about 15%, by about 10%,
   by about 5%, or by about 1% for cell surface proteins in the animal (e.g., a mammal,
   such as a human) are fucosylated, as compared to an animal not receiving the fucose
   analog.
30 [0060]    In some embodiments, protein fucosylation via a(1,3)-linkage is reduced by
   about 60%, by about 50%, by about 40%, by about 30%, by about 20%, by about 15%,
   by about 10%, by about 5%, or by about 1% for cell surface proteins in the animal (e.g.,
                                                 14

   a mammal, such as a human) are fucosylated, as compared to an animal not receiving the
   fucose analog. In some embodiments, protein fucosylation via a(1,4)-linkage is reduced
   by about 60%, by about 50%, by about 40%, by about 30%, by about 20%, by about
   15%, by about 10%, by about 5%, or by about 1% for cell surface proteins in the animal
 5 (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) are fucosylated, as compared to an animal not
   receiving the fucose analog.
   [0061]    In some embodiments, protein fucosylation via a(1,6)-linkage is reduced by
   about 60%, by about 50%, by about 40%, by about 30%, by about 20%, by about 15%,
   by about 10%, by about 5%, or by about 1% for cell surface proteins in the animal (e.g.,
10 a mammal, such as a human) are fucosylated, as compared to an animal not receiving the
   fucose analog.
   [0062]    In some embodiments, fucosylation of white blood cells in the serum of the
   animal (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) is reduced by at least about 60%, at least
   about 50%, at least about 40%, at least about 30%, at least about 20%, at least about
15 15%, at least about 10%, or at least about 5%, as compared to an animal not receiving
   the fucose analog. In some embodiments, fucosylation via a(1,3) linkages of white
   blood cells in the serum of the animal (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) is reduced by
   at least about 60%, at least about 50%, at least about 40%, at least about 30%, at least
   about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10%, or at least about 5%, as compared to
20 an animal not receiving the fucose analog. In some embodiments, fucosylation via
   a(1,4) linkages of white blood cells in the serum of the animal (e.g., a mammal, such as
   a human) is reduced by at least about 60%, at least about 50%, at least about 40%, at
   least about 30%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10%, or at least
   about 5%, as compared to an animal not receiving the fucose analog.
25 [0063]    In some embodiments, fucosylation of antibodies in the serum of the animal
   (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) is reduced by at least about 60%, at least about 50%,
   at least about 40%, at least about 30%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least
   about 10%, or at least about 5%, as compared to an animal not receiving the fucose
   analog.
30 [0064]    In certain embodiments, only a minor amount of a fucose analog (or a
   metabolite or product of the fucose analog) is incorporated into glycans (e.g., the
                                                 15

   complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chain(s)) of the antibody, antibody derivative or other
   glycans of proteins. For example, in various embodiments, less than about 60%, less
   than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less
   than about 10%, less than about 5%, or less than about 1% of the fucose analog (or a
 5 metabolite or product of the fucose analog) is incorporated into glycans of the antibodies
   in the serum of the animal, as compared to an animal not receiving the fucose analog. In
   some embodiments, less than about 60%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less
   than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, or less
   than about 1% of the fucose analog (or a metabolite or product of the fucose analog) is
10 incorporated into glycans of cell surface proteins of the animal, as compared to an animal
   not receiving the fucose analog.
   [0065]    In some embodiments, less than about 60%, less than about 40%, less than
   about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than
   about 5%, or less than about 1% of the fucose analog (or a metabolite or product of the
15 fucose analog) is incorporated into glycans of white blood cells in the serum of the
   animal, as compared to an animal not receiving the fucose analog.
   Fucose Analo2s
   [0066]    Suitable fucose analogs for the methods of the present invention (identified
20 below as Formula I, II, III, IV, V and VI) are those that can be safely administered to a
   mammal in an amount effective to inhibit core fucosylation of complex N-glycoside
   linked sugar chains of antibodies or antibody derivatives. Fucose analogs are described
   in Published US Patent Application 2009-0317869 that reduce the incorporation of
   fucose into complex N-glycoside-linked sugar chains of antibodies or antibody
25 derivatives produced by host cells in vitro. The fucose analog can be given to a subject
   animal (e.g., a mammal) by parental, orally or other suitable mode of administration.
   [0067]    In some embodiments, a fucose analog (or an intracellular metabolite or
   product of the fucose analog) inhibits an enzyme(s) in the fucose salvage pathway. (As
   used herein, an intracellular metabolite can be, for example, a GDP-modified analog or a
30 fully or partially de-esterified analog. A product can be, for example, a fully or partially
   de-esterified analog.) For example, a fucose analog (or an intracellular metabolite or
                                                 16

   product of the fucose analog) can inhibit the activity of fucokinase, or GDP-fucose
   pyrophosphorylase. In some embodiments, a fucose analog (or an intracellular
   metabolite or product of the fucose analog) inhibits fucosyltransferase (such as a 1,2
   fucosyltransferase, 1,3-fucosyltransferase, 1,4-fucosyltransferase, or 1,6
 5 fucosyltransferase (e.g., the FUT8 protein)). In some embodiments, a fucose analog (or
   an intracellular metabolite or product of the fucose analog) can inhibit the activity of an
   enzyme in the de novo synthetic pathway for fucose. For example, a fucose analog (or
   an intracellular metabolite or product of the fucose analog) can inhibit the activity of
   GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase or/or GDP-fucose synthetase. In some embodiments, the
10 fucose analog (or an intracellular metabolite or product of the fucose analog) can inhibit
   a fucose transporter (e.g., GDP-fucose transporter).
   [0068]    In some embodiments, the fucose analog has the following formula (I) or (II):

10 Pharmaceutical Compositions
   [0131]     Fucose analogs of formulae I, II, III, IV, V and VI (hereinafter 'fucose
   analogs') can be formulated for therapeutic applications. The fucose analogs can be
   formulated as pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically or
   prophylactically effective amount of the fucose analog and one or more pharmaceutically
15 compatible (acceptable) ingredients. For example, a pharmaceutical or non
   pharmaceutical composition typically includes one or more carriers (e.g., sterile liquids,
   such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic
   origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like). Water is a
   more typical carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously.
20 Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as
   liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable excipients include, for
   example, amino acids, starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk,
   silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk,
   glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The composition, if desired, can
25 also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.
   These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills,
   capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. Examples of suitable
   pharmaceutical carriers are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by
   E.W. Martin. Such compositions will typically contain a therapeutically effective
30 amount of the fucose analog, typically in purified form, together with a suitable amount
                                                   27

   of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The
   formulations correspond to the mode of administration.
   [0132]    The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be in any form that
   allows for the composition to be administered to an animal (e.g., a mammal). The
 5 pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be in any form that allows for the
   composition to be administered to a mammal. The pharmaceutical compositions
   described herein can be in any form that allows for the composition to be administered to
   a human.
   [0133]    The compositions can be in the form of a solid or liquid. Typical routes of
10 administration include, without limitation, oral, parenteral, sublingual, and ocular.
   Parenteral administration includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,
   intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are
   administered parenterally or orally. These pharmaceutical compositions can be
   formulated so as to allow a fucose analog to be bioavailable upon administration of the
15 composition to an animal. Compositions can also take the form of one or more dosage
   units, where for example, a tablet can be a single dosage unit, and a container of a fucose
   analog in solid form can hold a plurality of dosage units.
   [0134]    Materials used in preparing the pharmaceutical compositions can be non-toxic
   in the amounts used. It will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art that the
20 optimal dosage of the active ingredient(s) in the pharmaceutical composition will depend
   on a variety of factors. Relevant factors include, without limitation, the type of animal
   (e.g., human), the particular form of the fucose analog, the manner of administration, the
   composition employed, and the severity of the disease or condition being treated.
   [0135]    The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle can be particulate, so that
25 the compositions are, for example, in tablet or powder form. The carrier(s) can be liquid,
   with the compositions being, for example, an oral syrup or injectable liquid.
   [0136]    When intended for oral administration, the composition is preferably in solid or
   liquid form, where semi-solid, semi-liquid, suspension and gel forms are included within
   the forms considered herein as either solid or liquid.
30 [0137]    As a solid composition for oral administration, the composition can be
   formulated into a powder, granule, compressed tablet, pill, capsule, chewing gum, wafer
                                                 28

   or the like form. Such a solid composition typically contains one or more inert diluents.
   In addition, one or more of the following can be present: binders such as
   carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, or gelatin; excipients
   such as starch, lactose or dextrins, disintegrating agents such as alginic acid, sodium
 5 alginate, Primogel, corn starch and the like; lubricants such as magnesium stearate or
   Sterotex; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide; sweetening agents such as sucrose or
   saccharin, a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate or orange flavoring,
   and a coloring agent.
   [0138]     When the composition is in the form of a capsule, e.g., a gelatin capsule, it can
10 contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as polyethylene
   glycol, cyclodextrin or a fatty oil.
   [0139]     The composition can be in the form of a liquid, e.g., an elixir, syrup, solution,
   emulsion or suspension. The liquid can be useful for oral administration or for delivery
   by injection. When intended for oral administration, a composition can comprise one or
15 more of a sweetening agent, preservatives, dye/colorant and flavor enhancer. In a
   composition for administration by injection (as described above), one or more of a
   surfactant, preservative, wetting agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent, buffer,
   stabilizer and isotonic agent can also be included.
   [0140]     Liquid compositions, whether they are solutions, suspensions or other like
20 form, can also include one or more of the following: sterile diluents such as water for
   injection, saline solution, preferably physiological saline, Ringer's solution, isotonic
   sodium chloride, fixed oils such as synthetic mono or digylcerides which can serve as the
   solvent or suspending medium, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, cyclodextrin, propylene
   glycol or other solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben;
25 antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and
   agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. Physiological
   saline is a preferred adjuvant. An injectable composition is preferably sterile.
   [0141]     As noted above, the amount of the fucose analog that is effective in the
30 treatment of a particular disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder
   or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro
   or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges.
                                                  29

   The precise dose to be employed in the compositions will also depend on the route of
   administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided
   according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances.
   [0142]    The compositions comprise an effective amount of a fucose analog such that a
 5 suitable dosage will be obtained. Typically, this amount is at least about 0.01% of a
   fucose analog by weight of the composition. When intended for oral administration, this
   amount can be varied to range from about 0.1% to about 80% by weight of the
   composition. Preferred oral compositions can comprise from about 4% to about 50% of
   the fucose analog by weight of the composition. Preferred compositions of the present
10 invention are prepared so that a parenteral dosage unit contains from about 0.01% to
   about 2% by weight of the fucose analog.
   [0143]    For intravenous administration, the composition can comprise from about 1 to
   about 250 mg of a fucose analog per kg of the animal's body weight. In some
   embodiments, the amount administered will be in the range from about 1 to about 25
15 mg/kg of body weight of the fucose analog. Preferably, the amount administered will be
   in the range from about 4 to about 25 mg/kg of body weight of the fucose analog.
   [0144]    Generally, the dosage of fucose analog administered to an animal is typically
   about 0.1 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg of the animal's body weight. Preferably, the dosage
   administered to an animal is between about 0.1 mg/kg and about 20 mg/kg of the
20 animal's body weight, more preferably about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of the animal's
   body weight.
   [0145]    The compositions comprise an effective amount of a fucose analog such that a
   suitable dosage will be obtained. Typically, this amount is at least about 0.01% of a
   fucose analog by weight of the composition. When intended for oral administration, this
25 amount can be varied to range from about 0.1% to about 80% by weight of the
   composition. Preferred oral compositions can comprise from about 4% to about 50% of
   the fucose analog by weight of the composition. Preferred compositions of the present
   invention are prepared so that a parenteral dosage unit contains from about 0.01% to
   about 2% by weight of the fucose analog.
30 [0146]    For intravenous administration, the composition can comprise from about 1 to
   about 250 mg of a fucose analog per kg of the animal's body weight. In some
                                                30

   embodiments, the amount administered will be in the range from about 1 to about 25
   mg/kg of body weight of the fucose analog. Preferably, the amount administered will be
   in the range from about 4 to about 25 mg/kg of body weight of the fucose analog.
   [0147]     Generally, a fucose analog or a pharmaceutical composition thereof can be
 5 administered on a daily, weekly, biweekly or monthly schedule, according to the desired
   effect. A fucose analog or a pharmaceutical composition thereof can be administered
   from about I to 5, about I to about 10, about I to about 15, or more cycles, wherein each
   cycle is a month in duration. The doses within each cycle can be given on daily, every
   other day, twice weekly, weekly, bi-weekly, once every three weeks or monthly. A cycle
10 may optionally include a resting period, during which fucosylation of proteins (e.g.,
   antibodies or other proteins) increases. Alternatively, a resting period can be included
   between cycles. Such a resting period can allow restoration of fucosylation of proteins
   involved in essential functions.
   [0148]     The preferred mode of administration of a fucose analog, or a pharmaceutical
15 composition thereof, is left to the discretion of the practitioner, and will depend in-part
   upon the site of the medical condition (such as the site of cancer or autoimmune disease).
   In one embodiment, the fucose analog or compositions are administered parenterally. In
   another embodiment, the fucose analog or compositions are administered orally.
   [0149]     In specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer one or more fucose
20 analogs or compositions locally to the area in need of treatment. This can be achieved,
   for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery; topical
   application; by injection; or by means of an implant, the implant being of a porous, non
   porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or
   fibers. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former
25 site) of a cancer, tumor or neoplastic or pre-neoplastic tissue.
   [0150]     In another embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or
   former site) of a manifestation of an autoimmune disease.
   [0151]     In another embodiment, the fucose analogs can be delivered in a vesicle, in
   particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in
30 LIPOSOMES     IN THE THERAPY OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND        CANCER, Lopez-Berestein and
   Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327;
   see generally ibid.).
                                                 31

   [0152]     In yet another embodiment, the fucose analogs or compositions can be
   delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (see
   Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit.Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al.,
   Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another
 5 embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF
   CONTROLLED RELEASE, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fa. (1974);
   CONTROLLED DRUG BIOAVAILABILITY, DRUG PRODUCT DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE,
   Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J.Macromol. Sci.
   Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985);
10 During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)).
   Other controlled-release systems discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527
   1533 (1990)) can be used.
   [0153]     The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant or excipient, with which a fucose
   analog is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids, such as water and
15 oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut
   oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The carriers can be saline, gum
   acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition,
   auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents can be used. In one
   embodiment, when administered to an animal, the fucose analogs or compositions and
20 pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. Water is a preferred carrier when the
   fucose analogs are administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose
   and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable
   solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers also include excipients such as starch,
   glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate,
25 glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene,
   glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain
   minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.

   Treatment of Cancer
   [0155]     The fucose analogs are useful for treating cancer in patients. Administration of
   a fucose analog to an animal (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) in need thereof can
 5 result in inhibition of the multiplication of a tumor cell(s) or cancer cell(s), or treatment
   of cancer in an animal (e.g., a human patient). The fucose analogs can be used
   accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of animal cancers.
   [0156]     The fucose analogs are also useful for enhancing the in vivo production of
   antibodies lacking core fucosylation. Increasing the proportion of such antibodies
10 against cancer targets in a patient can result in inhibition of the multiplication of a tumor
   cell(s) or cancer cell(s), or treatment of cancer in an animal (e.g., a human patient). The
   fucose analogs can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of
   animal cancers.
   [0157]     Particular types of cancers that can be treated with the fucose analogs include,
15 solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Such cancers include, but are not limited to:
   (1) solid tumors, including but not limited to fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma,

   Hodgkin's Lymphoma, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, Heavy
   chain disease, and Polycythemia vera.
   Multi-Modality Therapyfor Cancer
10 [0158]    Cancer, including, but not limited to, a tumor, a metastasis, or any disease or
   disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, can be treated or prevented by
   administration of a fucose analog of any of formulae I, II, III, IV, V or VI as provided
   above, to an animal (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) in need thereof. In some
   embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating or preventing cancer,
15 comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a fucose
   analog and optionally a chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment the
   chemotherapeutic agent is that with which treatment of the cancer has not been found to
   be refractory. In another embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent is that with which the
   treatment of cancer has been found to be refractory. The fucose analogs can be
20 administered to an animal that has also undergone surgery as treatment for the cancer.
   [0159]    In one embodiment, the additional method of treatment is radiation therapy.
   [0160]    In a specific embodiment, the fucose analog is administered concurrently with
   the chemotherapeutic agent or with radiation therapy. In another specific embodiment,
   the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation therapy is administered prior or subsequent to
25 administration of a fucose analog, preferably at least an hour, five hours, 12 hours, a day,
   a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, or several months (e.g., up to three months),
   prior or subsequent to administration of a fucose analog.
   [0161]    A chemotherapeutic agent can be administered over a series of sessions, and
   can be any one or a combination of the chemotherapeutic agents provided herein. With
30 respect to radiation, any radiation therapy protocol can be used depending upon the type
   of cancer to be treated. For example, but not by way of limitation, x-ray radiation can be
   administered; in particular, high-energy megavoltage (radiation of greater that 1 MeV
   energy) can be used for deep tumors, and electron beam and orthovoltage x-ray radiation
                                                34

   can be used for skin cancers. Gamma-ray emitting radioisotopes, such as radioactive
   isotopes of radium, cobalt and other elements, can also be administered.
   [0162]    Additionally, the invention provides methods of treatment of cancer with a
   fucose analog as an alternative to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, where the
 5 chemotherapy or the radiation therapy has proven or can prove too toxic, e.g., results in
   unacceptable or unbearable side effects, for the subject being treated. The animal being
   treated can, optionally, be treated with another cancer treatment such as surgery,
   radiation therapy or chemotherapy, depending on which treatment is found to be
   acceptable or bearable.

   inhibitors: thapsigargin.
   Adjuvant Therapy for Cancer
   [0164]    The fucose analogs can be used as an adjuvant, in combination with a cancer
15 vaccine. The term "cancer vaccine" as used herein means a compound that selectively
   damages tumor cells by inducing and/or enhancing a specific immune response against
   the tumor cells. A cancer vaccine can be, for example, a medicament comprising a
   peptide, polypeptide or protein of a TAA or TSA, and pharmaceutical compositions
   containing a peptide, polypeptide or protein of a TAA or TSA. As used herein, TSA
20 refers to a "tumor-specific antigen" and TAA refers to a tumor-associated antigen. TSAs
   are molecules unique to cancer cells. TAAs are molecules shared, but differently
   expressed, by cancer cells and normal cells.
   [0165]    The dosage of the cancer vaccine can be determined with appropriate
   modifications according to the extent of stimulation of an immune response against the
25 vaccine. In general, it is between 0.01 and 100 mg/day/adult human, or preferably
   between 0.1 and 10 mg/day/adult human as an active principle. The cancer vaccine can
   be administered from once every few days to every few months. Administration can be
   carried out according to well-known methods for administrating a peptide, polypeptide
   or protein for medical use, such as subcutaneously, intravenously, or intramuscularly. In
30 order to induce and/or enhance the immune response during administration, the peptide,
   polypeptide or protein can be used, in the presence or absence of an appropriate adjuvant,
   with or without linking to a carrier. The carrier is not limited as long as it exerts no
   harmful effect by itself onto the human body and is capable of enhancing antigenicity;
                                                 36

   cellulose, polymeric amino acids, albumin, and the like can be given as examples of
   carriers. Adjuvants can be those used in general for peptide vaccine inoculation, and a
   Freund incomplete adjuvant (FIA), aluminum adjuvant (ALUM), Bordetella pertussis
   vaccine, mineral oil, and the like can be given as examples. In addition, the formulation
 5 can be suitably selected by applying a suitable well-known method for formulating a
   peptide, polypeptide or protein.
   [0166]     Otherwise, an effective cancer vaccine effect can be obtained also by collecting
   a fraction of mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood of a patient, incubating them
   with the peptide, polypeptide or protein of the present invention, and then returning the
10 fraction of mononuclear cells in which induction of CTL and/or activation of CTL was
   observed, into the blood of the patient. A fucose analog can be co-administered during
   or after re-administration of the mononuclear cells. Culture conditions, such as
   mononuclear cell concentration, concentration of the peptide, polypeptide or proteins,
   culture time, and the like, can be determined by simply repeating studies. A substance
15 having a capability to enhance the growth of lymphocytes, such as interleukin-2, may be
   added during culturing.
   Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases
20 [0167]     The fucose analogs are useful for modulating an autoimmune disease or for
   treating an autoimmune disease, so as to decrease symptoms and/or the autoimmune
   response. The fucose analogs can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the
   treatment of an autoimmune disease in an animal.
   [0168]     In one embodiment, the fucose analogs down-regulate or down-modulate an
25 auto-immune antibody associated with a particular autoimmune disease.
   [0169]     Particular types of autoimmune diseases that can be treated with the fucose
   analogs include, but are not limited to, Th2-lymphocyte related disorders (e.g., atopic
   dermatitis, atopic asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, Omenn's syndrome,
   systemic sclerosis, and graft versus host disease); Th1 lymphocyte-related disorders
30 (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, Sjorgren's syndrome,
   Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Grave's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, Wegener's
   granulomatosis, and tuberculosis); activated B lymphocyte-related disorders (e.g.,
                                                  37

                                           EXAMPLES
20 Example 1: In vivo production of non-fucosylated antibodies
   Methods:
   [0180]    Female BALB/c mice were immunized with Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin
   (KLH) 30-60 days prior to starting this study. For the first study, mice were dosed ip
   with 150 mg/kg of alkynyl fucose (SGD-1887), alkynyl fucose peracetate (SGD-1890),
25 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083), or 2-fluorofucose triacetate (SGD-2084) daily for 7 days or
   were untreated. On day 2, mice were also boosted with KLH. On the day after the last
   ip dose, mice were terminally bled and serum obtained. For the second study, mice were
   given 100 mM of 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) in their drinking water or given untreated
   water for 7 days, boosted with KLH, and continued with 100 mM 2-fluorofucose
30 containing drinking water or untreated water for 7 more days before being terminally
   bled. Serum was then obtained. No mice died in either study. For both studies, serum
                                                 42

   was passed over a commercial anti-KLH affinity column to obtain KLH-specific
   polyclonal antibodies. The flow through from the anti-KLH affinity column was passed
   over a commercial protein A column to obtain the remaining antibodies.
   [0181]    Dot blots: 0.5 pg each of antibodies from untreated and treated animals, as well
 5 as standards of antibody cAC1O having known amounts of core fucosylation (0 to 100%
   fucose), were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins levels were
   visualized by Ponceau staining. The blot was probed with biotinylated Aspergillus
   oryzae L-fucose-specific lectin (AOL) (which binds to fucosylated antibodies) and
   developed with streptavidin HRP and ECL. Gel loading (visible) and fucose signals
10 (bioluminescence) were measured with an Alpha Innotech camera and quantitated with
   the machine software.
   [0182]    Gas chromatography (GC): 40 pg each of the antibodies from untreated and
   treated animals that had been dialyzed against water, were subjected to methanolysis in
   methanolic HCl. Control samples of antibody cAC1O with 0 to 100% fucose were
15 similarly treated. The resulting methylglycosides were derivatized by trimethylsilylation
   of the monosaccharide alcohols using a commercially available cocktail, Tri-Sil. The
   resulting trimethylsilyl methylglycosides were examined on a Hewlet Packard gas
   chromatograph with flame ionization detection using a temperature gradient on an
   Agilent J&W DB-1 column. The relevant peaks were identified by retention time
20 comparison to sugar standards derivatized in parallel with the Ab samples. Peaks were
   integrated using the GC software. The fucose/mannose peak area ratios were used to
   determine the fucosylation state of the antibodies.
   Results:
   [0183]    Study 1: Figure 1 shows the dot blot (left side) from antibodies that did not bind
25 to KLH, but were recovered from protein A column. Results are shown for cAC1O
   standards (lower dot blot, left most dashed rectangle and corresponding columns of
   upper dot blot), untreated control (lower dot blot, second dashed rectangle from the left
   and corresponding column of upper dot blot), and alkynyl fucose (SGD-1887; lower dot
   blot, middle dashed rectangle and corresponding column of upper dot blot), alkynyl
30 fucose peracetate (SGD-1890, lower dot blot, second dashed rectangle from the right and
   corresponding column of upper dot blot), and 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083; lower dot blot,
   right most rectangle and corresponding column of upper dot blot). Normalizing for
                                                43

   loading level, the percent fucosylation is also shown in the graph on the right. On
   average, the fucosylation levels of the antibodies were reduced by about one third, as
   compared to the untreated controls.
   [0184]     Figure 2 shows the fucosylation levels of both the anti-KLH antibodies (panels
 5 A and B) and the remaining serum IgG molecules isolated from the treated groups
   (panels C and D). Fucosylation levels are shown both as percent fucosylation based on
   the cAC1O antibody standards (panels A and C) and the average value for the treated
   groups as a percentage of the average value for the untreated control group (panels B and
   D). On average, the fucosylation levels of the anti-KLH antibodies were reduced by
10 about one half by treatment with three of the fucose analogs. The remaining collected
   antibodies also exhibited a reduction in core fucosylation of about one quarter. In this
   study, overall antibody levels (KLH-specific and non-specific) increased in the mice
   after exposure to KLH. As a result, most antibodies were newly synthesized during the
   treatment periods. These observations indicate that newly produced antibodies can
15 exhibit reduced core fucosylation following administration of a fucose analog.
   [0185]     Study 2: In this study, the effect of oral administration of fucose analogs was
   examined. Figure 3 shows the results of treatment of mice by oral administration of
   fucose analogs. Antibody fucosylation levels examined were those of the antibodies that
   did not bind to KLH, but were recovered from the protein A column. Results are shown
20 for cAC10 standards (upper and lower dot blots, left most rectangle), untreated control
   (upper and lower dot blots, second from the left (upper) and right rectangles), and 2
   fluorofucose (upper and lower dot blots, second from the left (lower) and second from
   the right rectangles (upper and lower)). Normalizing for loading level, the percent
   fucosylation is also shown in the graph at the right. Core fucosylation levels of
25 antibodies from the treated animals were nearly eliminated: on average, fucosylation
   levels were 7% for treated and 81% for untreated animals. These observations indicate
   that oral administration of fucose analogs is an effective means to decrease antibody
   fucosylation levels.

   [0186] Fucose analogs have been evaluated for their effect on antibody core fucosylation
   at concentrations of 50pM and 1 mM generally as described in Published US Patent
   Application 2009-0317869. Briefly, the protocol was as follows: A CHO DG44 cell
   line producing a humanized IgGI anti-CD70 monoclonal antibody, h1F6 (see
 5 International Patent Publication WO 06/113909) was cultured at 7.5 x 105 cells per mL
   in 2 mLs of CHO culture media at 370, 5% CO 2 and shaking at 100 RPM in a 6 well
   tissue culture plate. Media was supplemented with insulin like growth factor (JGF),
   penicillin, streptomycin and either 1 mM or 50 pM of the fucose analog. On day 5 post
   inoculation, the culture was centrifuged at 13000 RPM for 5 minutes to pellet the cells;
10 antibodies were then purified from supernatant.
   [0187] Antibody purification was performed by applying the conditioned media to
   protein A resin pre-equilibrated with IX phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. After
   washing resin with 20 resin bed volumes of IX PBS, antibodies were eluted with 5 resin
   bed volumes of Immunopure IgG elution buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).
15 A 10% volume of IM Tris pH 8.0 was added to neutralize the eluted fraction. The
   results are shown in the following tables.

   Example 3: Production of non-fucosylated antibodies in vivo following oral
   adminstration
 5 [0190]    In this study, the effects of oral administration of the fucose analog 2
   fluorofucose (SGD-2083) were further examined. Female BALC/c mice were offered 1,
   10 and 100 mM 2-fluorofucose in their drinking water for 14 days. Mice were
   immunized with TiterMAX Classic and offered 1, 10 and 100 mM 2-fluorofucose in
   their drinking water for an additional 7 days. Mice were then terminally bled and serum
10 obtained. Endogenous antibodies were purified by passing the serum over a protein A
   column.
   [0191]    The collected antibodies were evaluated for fucosylation levels by dot blot as
   follows. Antibodies from untreated and treated animals (0.5 pg each), as well as
   standards of cAC1O with 0 to 100% fucose (only study 1), were blotted onto a
15 nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins levels were visualized with Ponceau S. The blot
   was probed with biotinylated AOL lectin and developed with streptavidin HRP and ECL
   (as described above). Gel loading (visible) and fucose signals (bioluminescence) were
   measured with an Alpha Innotech camera and quantitated with the machine software.
   Results:
20
   [0192]    There was a dose-dependent decrease in fucosylation levels of antibodies over
   the three concentrations of 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083). Referring to Figure 4, antibody
   fucosylation levels were highest in the untreated control and 1 mM 2-fluorofucose
   groups (left and middle panels, upper two rectangles). Antibodies from the intermediate
25 concentration of 2-fluorofucose were nearly as depleted of fucose as the high
   concentration of 100 mM 2-fluorofucose. These results confirm that administration of 2
   fluorofucose to mice can inhibit core antibody fucosylation.
   Example 4: Affects of fucose analogs on human cells
30
   [0193] The ability of different fucose analogs to inhibit the fucosylation of IgG
   antibodies produced by human myeloma cells as well as the fucosylation of surface
   proteins of human cancer cell lines was investigated. In a first study, the ability of
                                                  52

   fucose analogs to inhibit fucosylation of IgG produced by the cell line LP- 1, a human
   multiple myeloma cell line, was investigated. The antibodies produced by, and found in
   the culture medium of, untreated LP- 1 cells were confirmed to be of the IgG type by
   western blot using anti-human IgG detection (data not shown). This was accomplished
 5 by growing 20 mL of LP-1 cells in a T-75 culture flask (250,000 cells/mL) for 5 days at
   37 'C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in IgG-depleted tissue culture media (90%
   RPMI with 10% IgG-depleted heat inactivated FBS). Harvest of the cells was by
   centrifugation (200 x g, 4 'C, 5 min), and the culture medium was collected. The
   medium was filtered through a 0.22 pm filter and then incubated with 1 mL of a 50%
10 MabSelectTM protein A resin slurry in PBS at 4 'C with rotation overnight to capture the
   IgG. The resin slurry was allowed to settle and most of the medium was removed. The
   resin slurry was transferred with -0.5 mL media to two cellulose acetate filter spin cups
   and was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 1 min. The resin bed was then washed 3 times with
   0.5 mL PBS. The IgG was eluted with 700 pL of Pierce IgG elution buffer (into with 52
15 pL of 9 M Tris buffer, pH 9.5 to adjust the pH after elution). The resulting elution was
   transferred to a 10,000 MW cutoff centrifugal concentrator and the sample was
   concentrated to approximately 20 pL. 1 pL of the concentrated sample was loaded on an
   SDS polyacrylamide gel for separation followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose
   membrane. Staining of the blot for total protein was with Ponceau S and for
20 identification of isotype with anti-human IgG antibody.    The total protein stain showed
   bands consistent with molecular weights of IgG heavy and light chains and the anti
   human IgG stain showed reaction with the protein band consistent with the molecular
   weight of heavy chain as expected.
   [0194] Antibody fucosylation can also be determined using a biotin-labeled Aspergillus
25 oryzae L-fucose-specific lectin (AOL), which binds specifically to the a-1,6-linked
   fucose of the antibody. This method for fucose detection works for both blotted protein
   that has either been separated by SDS-PAGE or for protein that has been applied to
   nitrocellulose without separation. The fluorescent signal generated using the AOL-biotin
   conjugate with streptavidin-HRP binding and ECL detection can be quantitated using an
30 Alpha Innotech FlourChem@      Q system.   The IgG isolated from LP- 1 culture displayed
   an AOL-dependent signal in the band corresponding to the MW of the heavy chain as
   expected (data not shown). The analogs 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) and 2-fluorofucose
                                                53

   peracetate (SGD-2084) did not inhibit fucosylation of antibody, but alkynyl fucose
   peracetate (SGD-1890) did.
   [0195] To further evaluate the activities of different fucose analogs, 48 different fucose
   analogs and other four glycosylation inhibitors were tested for their ability to affect the
 5 fucosylation the LP-1-generated IgG. LP-1 cells (250,000 cells/mL, 3 mL per compound
   in 6-well plates) were incubated with 100 pM of each fucose analog for 5 days at 37 'C
   with a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in IgG-depleted tissue culture media (90%
   RPMI with 10% IgG-depleted heat inactivated FBS). The IgG was isolated as described
   above using only 0.5 mL of MabSelectTM protein A resin slurry and one spin cup per
10 sample with elution in 400 pL of IgG elution buffer into 25 pL of 9 M Tris buffer, pH 9.
   The eluates were concentrated to 10-20 pL per sample and 2 pL of each of the
   concentrated eluates were dotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and stained with
   Ponceau S to estimate and adjust the sample loading for AOL staining. From this
   estimation of total protein in each sample, approximately 0.5 pg of each sample was
15 dotted onto the membrane, air-dried, and stained with Ponceau S. An image of this
   stained membrane was captured using an Alpha Innotech FlourChem@          Q system.   The
   membrane was then blocked with 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in Tris Buffered
   Saline (TBS) for 1 hr, washed with TBST (TBS with Triton) 3 times and then incubated
   with 5 pg/ml biotinylated-AOL for 1 hr. The membrane was washed again with TBST 3
20 times, followed by Streptavidin-HRP incubation for 30 min and final washes with TBST
   3 times. The bioluminescent signal was revealed using chemiluminescence reagents
   (ECL) and was analyzed using an Alpha Innotech FlourChem@          Q system and
   Alphaview@ software. The results are shown in the following table. For some analogs,
   multiple samples were analyzed, as indicated in the table.

   [0196] Three fucose analogs were chosen for a full SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis to
   show that changes in the fucose signal on the heavy chain can be detected by this
   technique. The three analogs chosen were used at a concentration of 50 pM. These
   analyses compared the activity of 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083), 2-fluorofucose peracetate
 5 (SGD-2084), and alkynyl fucose peracetate (SGD-1890) with antibody from untreated
   cells. Use of alkynyl fucose peracetate produced IgG that did not show reactivity with
   the biotinylated AOL, confirming that changes in AOL signal can be detected by this
   method while 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) and 2-fluorofucose peracetate (SGD-2084)
   showed no apparent change in the AOL signal. These results are generally consistent
10 with the results for these compounds in Table 4.
   [0197] Many of the fucose analogs tested in Table 4 appeared to decrease fucosylation of
   antibody produced by human myeloma cells. The dot blots of the compounds showed
   that 10 of them were potentially strong inhibitors of IgG fucosylation in human cells,
   using decrease in AOL signal as an indication of inhibition. These fucose analogs are
15 alkynyl fucose peracetate (SGD-1890), alkynyl fucose tetrapropionate (SGD-2010), 1
   methyl fucose triacetate (SGD-2039), 5-ethyl fucose tetraacetate (SGD-1989), 6-fluoro
   fucose tetraacetate (SGD-1988), 6-bromo fucose tetraacetate (SGD-1969), 6'6-difluoro
   fucose tetraacetate (SGD-2046), 6-keto-6-ethyl fucose tetraacetate (SGD-2067), 5-epoxy
   fucose tetraacetate (SGD-2020), and 5-methylketo fucose tetraacetate (SGD-1964).
20 [0198] To further define the results of the AOL dot blot, samples of the IgGs produced
   by cells treated with the following fucose analogs (that gave moderate to strong
   decreases in the dot blot AOL signal) were isolated and examined by reducing PLRP-MS
   to verify the fucosylation status using the MW of the heavy chain: alkynyl fucose
   peracetate; 5-vinylfucose tetraaceate; 5-methylketofucose tetraacetate; 6-bromofucose
25 tetraacetate; 6-fluorofucose tetraacetate; 5-ethylfucose tetraacetate; 5-epoxyfucose
   tetraacetate; 6'6-difluorofucose tetraacetate; 6-keto-6-ethyl fucose tetraacetate; and 2
   fluorofucose peracetate.
   [0199] 40 mL samples of LP-1 cells (250,000 cells/mL) were treated with 100 PM of a
   fucose analog for 5 days as described above, and the IgGs were purified as described
30 using protein A resin. The yields were estimated by UV spectroscopy assuming an
   extinction coefficient of 1.4 AU/(mg/mL). Seven of the ten compounds yielded enough
   IgG to perform the analysis (use of SGD-2067, SGD-1964, and SGD-2020 yielded <10
   pg of IgG, likely due to toxicity of the analogs to the cells). The remaining IgGs were
                                                 57

   reduced with 10 mM DTT at 37'C for 15 min and were separated on PLRP followed by
   MS analysis using a QTOF mass spectrometer. The resulting heavy chain peaks were
   examined and compared to the IgG generated by untreated cells.
   [0200] The mass spectrometry results are shown in Table 5 (below). The mass
 5 spectrometry signals were evaluated by comparing the peak height of the heavy chain
   versus heavy chain minus fucose and heavy chain minus fucose plus the mass of the
   fucose analog (which would arise if there was incorporation of the analog into the
   antibody carbohydrate). Four of the ten compounds tested were partial or full inhibitors
   of 1,6-fucosylation on the antibody. Alkynyl fucose peracetate (SGD-1890) provided
10 complete inhibition while 2-fluorofucose peracetate (SGD-2084) was next best with 70%
   inhibition followed by 6'6-difluorofucose tetraacetate (SGD-2046) and 6-bromofucose
   tetraacetate (SGD-1969) with -33 and 20% inhibition mixed with incorporation of the
   analog into the carbohydrate.

   Example 5: Affects of fucose analogs on protein fucosylation
   [0201] The effects of the four partial to full inhibitors, alkynyl fucose peracetate (SGD
   1890), 2-fluorofucose peracetate (SGD-2084), 6'6-difluorofucose tetraacetate (SGD
   2046), and 6-bromofucose tetraacetate (SGD-1969), on protein cell surface fucosylation
 5 was tested for human cancer cells by incubation of five different human-derived cancer
   cell lines (Caki-1, PC-3, Ramos, LS174t, and HL60cy). 100 pM of each inhibitor was
   used under standard culture conditions for approximately 1-2 weeks with regular changes
   of culture medium including fresh inhibitor. After the incubation period, the cells were
   analyzed by FACS using four different detection reagents: biotinylated-Lens culimaris
10 agglutinin-A (LCA), anti-Lewis' antibody (anti-SSEA1), an anti-Lewis' antibody
   (cBR96), and a Recombinant Human P-Selectin/CD62P/Fc Fusion protein. The
   procedure involved washing of the cells with FACS buffer (PBS + 10% bovine serum
   albumin + 0.02% sodium azide) 3 times followed by incubation with the primary
   detection reagent for 1 hr at 4 'C, followed by 3 washes with FACS buffer and then
15 incubation with the secondary detection reagent for 1 hr at 4 'C. The cells were finally
   washed with FACS buffer 3 times and resuspended in FACS buffer and examined using
   a BD FACScan instrument. The LCA reagent recognizes sequences containing a-linked
   mannose residues and its affinity is markedly enhanced by a-linked fucose residues
   attached to the N-acetylchitobiose portion of the core oligosaccharide. The P-selectin
20 fusion protein detects P-selectin ligand present on the surface of cells, an interaction
   which involves the sialyl Lewis' epitope present of the P-selectin ligand.
   [0202] All of the cell lines examined showed staining with the LCA reagent, which
   recognizes sequences containing (-linked mannose residues, the affinity of which is
   markedly enhanced by a-linked fucose residues attached to the N-acetylchitobiose
25 portion of the core oligosaccharide. The LCA detection of this sugar epitope was
   decreased upon treatment of the cells with all of the inhibitors (100 PM). This suggests
   that the overall presence of fucose on the cell surface is affected by treatment with the six
   fucose analogs examined.
   [0203] Figure 7 shows the results of these studies. For LewisX, of the cell lines
30 examined only untreated LS 1745t and HL60cy had significant Lewisx detected on the
   cell surface (anti-SSEAI staining) (Figure 7A). The anti-SSEAI detection of this
   structure was significantly decreased upon treatment of the cells with all of the fucose
   analogs (100 pM).
                                                  59

   [0204] For Lewisy, of the cell lines examined, only untreated LS1745t and HL60cy had
   significant Lewis Y detected on the cell surface (cBR96 staining) (Figure 7B). The
   cBR96 detection of this structure was significantly decreased upon treatment of the cells
   with all of the fucose analogs (100 pM).
 5 [0205] For P-selectin, of the cell lines examined, only untreated HL60cy had significant
   P-selectin ligand detected on the cell surface. The detection of this ligand was decreased
   somewhat by treatment of the cells with all fucose analogs, except for alkynyl furocse
   peracetate (SGD-1890) (100 pM) (Figure 7C). Untreated Ramos cells showed little P
   selectin ligand; however, upon treatment with the fucose analogs the signal for this
10 ligand increased. This is unusual and was not observed with previous treatment of these
   cells with 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) or alkylnyl fucose (SGD-1887).
   [0206] The results suggest that treatment with these fucose analogs can affect the
   presence of fucose on the cell surface in general and also specifically the fucosylation of
   Lewis X and Lewis Y modifications on the cell surface and sialyl LewisX present on the
15 P-selectin ligand.
   Example 6: Leukocytosis and decreased E-selectin binding following oral dosing of
   2-fluorofucose
   [0207] The effects of a fucose analog on leukocytosis and E-selectin binding were
20 eamined in mice. Female Balb/c mice were given oral 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) in the
   drinking water or left untreated. Mice were bled prior to dosing and then weekly for
   three weeks to assess circulating cell numbers and their ability to bind E-selectin. In one
   study, 2-fluorofucose was formulated at 1 mM, 10 mM or 100 mM in the drinking water
   (n=3 per group). At day 14, mice were treated with TiterMAX@ Classic adjuvant
25 (Sigma) to stimulate polyclonal, antigen non-specific antibody production by B cells, and
   remained on the 2-fluorofucose-containing water through day 21. In a second study,
   mice were given oral 2-fluorofucose formulated at 10 mM and 100 mM in the drinking
   water for three weeks without any other treatments (n=6). On day 21, a pool of lymph
   nodes (axillary, brachial, superficial inguinal, and mesenteric) from each of three animals
30 was assessed in addition to blood. Lymph nodes were homogenized into single cell
   suspensions, and total cell numbers were determined by counting on a hemcytometer,
   using Trypan Blue for dead cell exclusion. To determine total white cell numbers/pL
   blood, samples of blood from individual animals were counted on a hemacytometer,
                                                 60

   using Turk's solution (0.01% gentian violet in 3% acetic acid) to exclude red blood cells
   (RBCs). RBCs were eliminated from the remainder of the blood by osmotic lysis for
   flow cytometric analysis. Cells were incubated with anti-Gr-1-FITC antibodies (BD
   Biosciences) to identify neutrophils, and a recombinant E-selectin-human Fc fusion
 5 protein (R&D Systems). Cells were washed and then incubated with a PE-labeled goat
   anti-human IgG-Fc secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) to detect bound E
   selectin. Samples were collected on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using
   CellQuest software. The percentage of Gr-1+ cells was determined and absolute number
   of neutrophils was calculated using the total white cell number from the hemacytometer
10 count. In addition, flow samples were gated for Gr-1+ cells to assess E-selectin binding
   to neutrophils by histogram analysis. The geometric mean of the E-selectin fluorescent
   signal was determined from the histogram.
   Results
15 [0208] The results in Figures 5A and 5B show that oral administration of 2
   fluorofucose (SGD-2083) resulted in an increase in circulating white blood cells and
   neutrophils, in a dose-dependent manner. 2-fluorofucose given at 1 mM had very little
   effect, whereas increasing effect was observed with increasing doses of 10 mM and 100
   mM 2-fluorofucose. The data shown in Figures 5A and 5B are from the first study, day
20 14. Similar results were obtained at days 7 and 21 in the first study as well as days 7, 14,
   and 21 in the second study (data not shown). Lymph nodes were also assessed at day 21
   in the second study and Figure 5C shows that oral administration of 2-fluorofucose
   results in a marked decreased in cellularity in the lymph nodes. The effect was more
   severe at 100 mM compared to 10 mM.
25 [0209] Oral administration of 2-fluorofucose also results in decreased in E-selectin
   binding to neutrophils (Figure 6). The effects of the fucoses analogs was also dose
   dependent, with 1 mM having little effect and 10 mM and 100 mM having increasing
   effects (Figures 5B and 5C).
   [0210] The observed increases in circulating white blood cells and neutrophils
30 (leukocytosis) is consistent with the inhibition of E-selectin binding by neutrophils. E
   selectin mediates extravization of white blood cells into the periphery and lymph nodes,
   and inhibition of E-selectin binding (by inhibiting fucosylation) would also reduce
   extravization and result in accumulation of white blood cells in the blood. These results
                                                 61

   suggest that fucose analogs that inhibit protein fucosylation, and E-selecin fucosylation
   in particular, can act to inhibit autoimmunity.
   Example 7: Tumor growth inhibition by administration of fucose analogs
 5 Study 1
   [0211]    Human-derived cell lines were evaluated for their susceptibility to the fucose
   analog 2-fluorofucose in vitro. The cells lines were: LS174T colon adenocarcinoma,
   PC-3 colon adenocarcinoma, HL-60 acute mylogenous leukemia, Ramos Burkitt
   lymphoma, and Caki- 1 renal cell carcinoma. The cell lines were cultured in the presence
10 of 100 pM 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) in growth media, 100 PM alkynylfucose (SGD
   1887) in growth media, or control growth media (without a fucose analog) for two
   weeks. The growth media were MEM Eagle with 10% FBS (LS174T), 50:50 F12 and
   RPMI with 10% FBS (PC-3), RPMI with 10% FBS (HL-60), IMDM with 10% FBS
   (Ramos), and McCoy with 10% FBS (PC-3). The cells were evaluated for cell surface
15 fucosylation by FACS using antibody cBR96 to detect LewisY, antibody SSEA-1 to
   detect LewisX, P-selectin ligand to detect P-selectin, and AOL lectin to detect the
   general level of fucosylation.
   Results:
20 [0212] The results of the FACS evaluation revealed variable levels of fucosylated cell
   surface proteins on the different cell lines (data not shown). 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083)
   was generally a better inhibitor of protein fucosylation than alkynyl fucose (SGD-1887).
   Study 2
25 [0213] To further evaluate the activity of these fucose analogs, further studies were
   performed in vivo using tumor cells that had been pre-treated by culturing in the
   presence of a fucose analog, or using untreated tumor cells. Tumor cells were implanted
   into 10 mice per group as follows. For the LS174T, PC-3, and Caki-1 cell lines, 5 x 105
   cells in 25% Matrigel were implanted subcutaneously into female nude mice. For HL-60
30 and Ramos cell lines, 5    x 106 cells were implanted subcutaneously into female SCID
   mice. For mice implanted with untreated tumor cells, mice were provided regular
   drinking water. For mice implanted with tumor cells pre-treated with 2-fluorofucose
   (SGD-2083), the mice were provided drinking water supplemented with 20 mM 2
                                                  62

   fluorofucose (SGD-2083). For mice implanted with tumor cells pre-treated with alkylnyl
   fucose (SGD-1887), the mice were provided with regular drinking water. The mice did
   not drink water containing alkynyl fucose.
   [0214] After 3 weeks of receiving 2-fluorofucose-containing drinking water, mice were
 5 returned to regular drinking water, except for mice with Caki- 1 tumors. The latter mice
   were returned to regular drinking water for one week. After the week of receiving
   regular water, mice were randomized to two groups of 5 each to receive drinking water
   supplemented with 20 mM 2-fluorofucose or regular drinking water. Mice were
   sacrificed when tumors reached about 1000 mm 3 .
10 [0215] Referring to Figure 8A-E, tumor growth inhibition in vivo was seen for LS174T,
   PC-3, and Caki-1 cells treated with 2-flurofucose (SGD-2083). No change in tumor
   growth was observed for HL-60 and Ramos cells. For Caki- 1, tumor growth inhibition
   was not observed during the first treatment period, but was observed after the mice were
   returned to 2-fluorofucose treatment. For the other cell lines, tumor growth inhibition
15 appeared to start when tumor size had reached about 150 mm3 . The slower growing
   Caki- 1 tumors did not reach this point until the second treatment period with 2
   fluorofucose (SGD-2083). These results indicate that treatment with fucose analogs can
   inhibit tumor growth.
20 Study 3
   [0216]    In a third study, tumor cells were implanted without prior treatment with a
   fucose analog. LS174T colon adenocarcinoma cells (5       x 10 5 cells in 25% Matrigel) were
   implanted subcutaneously into female nude mice. Mice were supplied with 50 mM 2
   fluorofucose (SGD-2083) in their drinking water from 7 days before implant until 21
25 days after implant, or were supplied with regular drinking water.
   Results
   [0217]    Referring to Figure 8F, Mice given 50 mM 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) in their
   drinking water showed a substantial inhibition of tumor growth, achieving an average
30 tumor size of 110 mm 3 versus 734 mm 3 for mice supplied with regular drinking water.
   Collectively, these results suggest that administration of a fucose analog can inhibit
   tumor growth.

   Example 8: Tumor vaccine model
   [0218]     Female Balb/c mice were immunized by subcutaneous implantation of 1
   million A20 murine lymphoma cells (killed by irradiation) on day -21 and day -7.
 5 Another group of mice were not given any immunization. On day 0, all mice were
   inoculated iv with 1.5 or 5 million live A20 cells. On days -14 through +21, mice were
   provided with 50 mM 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) in their drinking water or given
   regular drinking water. The 8 treatment groups were as follows:
           1.       No immunization, 1.5 million live A20 cells, regular drinking water
10         2.       No immunization, 5 million live A20 cells, regular drinking water

   Results
   [0219]     Referring to Figure 9A, the study design is shown. Referring to Figure 9B,
   mice that did not receive any immunization succumbed to the live A20 challenge from
   days 22-35. Mice receiving 2-fluorofucse (SGD-2083) survived a few days longer than
25 those receiving regular drinking water. Two mice immunized with 5 million killed A20
   cells and receiving regular drinking water succumbed to the live A20 challenge. All
   mice receiving immunization and 2-fluorofucose (SGD-2083) in their drinking water
   were still alive at data collection.
