Naphthyridinedione derivatives
This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015270125, the entire content of
which is incorporated herein by reference.
The invention relates to naphthyridinedione derivatives, to their preparation, to their use as medicaments
and to medicaments comprising them.
Many human genetic diseases are caused by nonsense mutations (see Keeling et al, WIREs RNA,
2011, 2, 837-852; Linde et al, Trends in Genetics, 2008, 24(11), 552-563; and Rose et al, Pharmacology
& Therapeutics, 2012 136(2), 227-266).
A nonsense mutation is a genetic mutation leading to the transformation of a sense codon into a
premature termination codon (hereinafter PTC) upstream from the normal termination codon.
Eukaryotic termination codons are UAA, UAG or UGA.
The normal termination codon stops gene translation and enables full-length, wild type protein synthesis.
A PTC prevents such wild type protein synthesis and leads to truncated, in many cases inactive,
proteins. The resulting partial/total lack of protein leads to the pathology of the disease caused by such
a nonsense mutation.
Nonsense mutations can be in-frame mutations, e.g. single nucleic acid exchanges transforming a
single codon into a PTC, or frameshift mutations, e.g. a single nucleic acid insertion/deletion
transforming the affected codon into a PTC.
A compound being able to suppress the effect of a nonsense mutation is herein called a "nonsense
mutation suppressor".
One mechanism to suppress the effect of nonsense mutations is to increase the rate of readthrough
events during translation. A compound having this mechanism of action is herein called a "readthrough
activator". In a readthrough event, an aminoacyl tRNA being near-cognate is used to recode a
termination codon into a sense codon. Under basal conditions, the recoding of a PTC into a sense
codon occurs in less than 1% of translation events, while suppression of a normal stop codon occurs at
a frequency of <0.1%. Amino acids inserted by recoding will not necessarily be identical to the
corresponding amino acids of the wild-type protein; however many amino acid substitutions are
functionally tolerated. Thus, a protein produced by readthrough activation may possess activity strongly
similar to the wild-type protein. Consequently, by increasing the rate of PTC-recoding enough functional
protein may be restored to provide a therapeutic benefit to patients carrying a nonsense mutation.

                                                  -2
   Another mechanism to suppress the effect of nonsense mutations is to inhibit nonsense
   mediated mRNA decay (NMD). A compound having this mechanism of action is herein called
   a "NMD inhibitor". NMD regulates the total level of PTC-bearing transcripts: it detects and
 5 degrades such transcripts to prevent synthesis of truncated proteins which might be
   nonfunctional or deleterious owing to dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects. Inhibition
   of NMD increases the number of transcripts available which could also be a mechanism to
   restore enough functional protein for a therapeutic benefit.
10 Compounds described as nonsense mutation suppressors are certain aminoglycoside
   antibiotics, e.g. in W02007113841, and certain 1,2,4-oxadiazole benzoic acids, e.g. in
   W02004091502 and a compound commonly called amlexanox (W02012016930).
   W02009086303 describes agents for increasing lifespan. W096/28444 describes
   dihydropyrimidoquinolinone compounds as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
15 Other pyridopyrimidinedione derivatives are described in WO1 99208719, in Synthetic
   Communications, 1999, 29(22), 3919-3937, in Monatshefte fuer Chemie, 1996, 127(8/9),
   917-925.
   Nonsense mutation suppressors are considered to be useful in the treatment of a wide range
20 of diseases caused by nonsense mutations. Prominent examples of diseases caused by
   nonsense mutations are diseases caused by nonsense mutations in lysosomal enzymes,
   e.g. mucopolysaccharidosis I (Hurler syndrome) caused by nonsense mutations in E-L
   iduronidase; hemophilia A or hemophilia B caused by nonsense mutations in coagulation
   factors 7, 8 or 9; cystic fibrosis caused by nonsense mutations in the chloride channel CFTR;
25 diseases caused by nonsense mutations in structural proteins, e.g. Duchenne or Becker
   Muscle Dystrophy caused by nonsense mutations in dystrophin; or cancer caused by
   nonsense mutations in APC or p53.
   There is a need to provide new nonsense mutation suppressors that are good drug
30 candidates. In particular, preferred compounds should be potent nonsense mutation
   suppressors whilst showing little potency in other drug target assays, e.g. GPCR or ion
   channel assays. They should exhibit a low binding to plasma proteins. They should be well
   absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, be sufficiently metabolically stable and possess
   favorable pharmacokinetic properties. They should be non-toxic and demonstrate few side-

                                                         -3
   effects. Furthermore, the ideal drug candidate will be able to exist in a physical form that is
   stable, non-hygroscopic and easily formulated.
   The compounds of the invention are nonsense mutation suppressors and are therefore
 5 potentially useful in the treatment of a wide range of diseases caused by nonsense
   mutations, particularly wherein the disease is selected from hemophilia A, hemophilia B,
   cystic fibrosis, mucopolysaccharidosis I, Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy, Becker Muscle
   Dystrophy, loss of APC caused cancer and loss of p53 caused cancer.

   In the context of the invention, the definition of R1 as a "five- to seven-membered monocyclic
10 saturated or unsaturated non-aromatic ring system, wherein said ring system may contain

   As used herein, the term "isomers" refers to different compounds that have the same
   molecular formula but differ in arrangement and configuration of the atoms. Also as used
   herein, the term "an optical isomer" or "a stereoisomer" refers to any of the various stereo
   isomeric configurations which may exist for a given compound of the invention and includes
 5 geometric isomers. It is understood that a substituent may be attached at a chiral center of a
   carbon atom. The term "chiral" refers to molecules which have the property of non
   superimposability on their mirror image partner, while the term "achiral" refers to molecules
   which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. Therefore, the invention includes
   enantiomers, diastereomers or racemates of the compound. "Enantiomers" are a pair of
10 stereoisomers that are non- superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1:1 mixture of a
   pair of enantiomers is a "racemic" mixture. The term is used to designate a racemic mixture
   where appropriate. "Diastereoisomers" are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric
   atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is
   specified according to the Cahn- Ingold- Prelog R-S system. When a compound is a pure
15 enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon may be specified by either R or S.
   Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (-)
   depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at
   the wavelength of the sodium D line. The compounds described herein may contain one or
   more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other
20 stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or
   (S)-. Unless otherwise provided herein, the invention is meant to include all such possible
   isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures.
   Optically active (R)- and (S)- isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral
   reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques.
25
   If the compound contains a double bond, the substituent may be E or Z configuration.
   If the compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl, the cycloalkyl substituent may have a
   cis- or trans-configuration.
30
   Any asymmetric atom (e.g. carbon or the like) of the compound(s) of the invention can be
   present in racemic or enantiomerically enriched, for example the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)
   configuration. In certain embodiments, each asymmetric atom has at least 50 %
   enantiomeric excess, at least 60 % enantiomeric excess, at least 70 % enantiomeric excess,
35 at least 80 % enantiomeric excess, at least 90 % enantiomeric excess, at least 95 %

   enantiomeric excess, or at least 99 % enantiomeric excess in the (R)- or (S)- configuration.
   Substituents at atoms with unsaturated bonds may, if possible, be present in cis- (Z)- or
   trans- (E)- form.
 5 Accordingly, as used herein, a compound of the invention can be in the form of one of the
   possible isomers, rotamers, atropisomers, tautomers or mixtures thereof, for example, as
   substantially pure geometric (cis or trans) isomers, diastereomers, optical isomers
   (antipodes), racemates or mixtures thereof.
10 Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical
   differences of the constituents, into the pure or substantially pure geometric or optical
   isomers, diastereomers, racemates, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional
   crystallization.
15 Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical
   antipodes by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof,
   obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or
   basic compound. In particular, a basic moiety may thus be employed to resolve the
   compounds of the invention into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of a
20 salt formed with an optically active acid, e.g., tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, diacetyl
   tartaric acid, di-O,O'-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid or camphor-1 0-sulfonic
   acid. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high pressure
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral adsorbent.
25 Depending on substituent definition, compounds of formula (l'), (I), (la'), (Ia) or (Ib) may
   occur in various tautomeric forms. All tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are
   embraced by the invention.
   For example, compounds of formula (I), in which R1, R2, R4 and R5 are as defined under
   formula (I), and R3 is hydrogen, may exist in tautomeric forms (1-1), (1-2) or (1-3):

   As used herein, the terms "salt" or "salts" refers to an acid addition or base addition salt of a
   compound of the invention. "Salts" include in particular "pharmaceutically acceptable salts".
   The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts that retain the biological
   effectiveness and properties of the compounds of this invention and, which typically are not
 5 biologically or otherwise undesirable. The compounds of the invention may be capable of
   forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or
   groups similar thereto.
   The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention can be synthesized from a basic or
10 acidic moiety, by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by
   reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate
   base or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the
   appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or
   in a mixture of the two. Generally, use of non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate,
15 ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile is desirable, where practicable. Lists of additional
   suitable salts can be found, e.g., in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 20th ed., Mack
   Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., (1985); and in "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts:
   Properties, Selection, and Use" by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany,
   2002).
20
   When both a basic group and an acid group are present in the same molecule, the
   compounds of the invention may also form internal salts, e.g., zwitterionic molecules.
   Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically
25 labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by
   the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a
   selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into
   compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
   phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as 2 H, 3H,     11c, 13c, 14c, 15N, 18 F 31 P, 32

30 1251 respectively. The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined
   herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes, such as 3H and           14C,  or those into
   which non-radioactive isotopes, such as 2 H and       13C  are present. Such isotopically labelled
   compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with           14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for
             2      3
   example H or H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography
35 (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate

   tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an     F labeled
   compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically-labeled
   compounds of formula (I'), (I), (la'), (Ia) or (Ib) can generally be prepared by conventional
   techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in
 5 the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled
   reagents in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.
                                                                                 2
   Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e.,      H or D) may afford
   certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example
10 increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic
   index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent of a
   compound of the formula (I'), (I), (la'), (Ia) or (Ib). The concentration of such a heavier
   isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term
   "isotopic enrichment factor" as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance
15 and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this
   invention is denoted deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each
   designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each
   designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500
   (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500
20 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least
   6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at
   least 6600      (99%    deuterium   incorporation),  or at    least 6633.3      (99.5%   deuterium
   incorporation).
25 Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein
   the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D20, d 6-acetone, d6-DMSO.
   Compounds of the invention that contain groups capable of acting as donors and/or
   acceptors for hydrogen bonds may be capable of forming co-crystals with suitable co-crystal
30 formers. These co-crystals may be prepared from compounds of formula (I'), (I), (la'), (Ia) or
   (Ib) by known co-crystal forming procedures. Such procedures include grinding, heating, co
   subliming, co-melting, or contacting in solution compounds of formula (I'), (I), (la'), (Ia) or (Ib)
   with the co-crystal former under crystallization conditions and isolating co-crystals thereby
   formed. Suitable co-crystal formers include those described in WO 2004/078163. Hence the

   WO 2015/186063                                                                  PCT/IB2015/054174
                                                  -17
   invention further provides co-crystals comprising a compound of formula (I'), (I), (la'), (Ia) or
   (Ib).
   The invention also envisages the use of pro-drugs of the compounds of the invention that
 5 convert in vivo to the compounds of the invention. A pro-drug is an active or inactive
   compound that is modified chemically through in vivo physiological action, such as
   hydrolysis, metabolism and the like, into a compound of the invention following administration
   of the prodrug to a subject. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using pro
   drugs are well known by those skilled in the art. Prodrugs can be conceptually divided into
10 two non-exclusive categories, bioprecursor prodrugs and carrier prodrugs. See The Practice
   of Medicinal Chemistry, Ch. 31-32 (Ed. Wermuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001).
   Furthermore, the compounds of the invention, including their salts, can also be obtained in
   the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization. The
15 compounds of the invention may inherently or by design form solvates with pharmaceutically
   acceptable solvents (including water); therefore, it is intended that the invention embrace
   both solvated and unsolvated forms. The term "solvate" refers to a molecular complex of a
   compound of the invention (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) with one or
   more solvent molecules. Such solvent molecules are those commonly used in the
20 pharmaceutical art, which are known to be innocuous to the recipient, e.g., water, ethanol,
   and the like. The term "hydrate" refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.
   The compounds of the invention, including salts, hydrates and solvates thereof, may
   inherently or by design form polymorphs.
25 Various embodiments of the invention are described herein. It will be recognized that
   features specified in each embodiment may be combined with other specified features to
   provide further embodiments of the present invention.
   The definition of the substituents applies to compounds of formula (I), (I'), (Ia), (la') and (Ib)
   as applicable.

   Tablets may be either film coated or enteric coated according to methods known in the art.
   Suitable compositions for oral administration include an effective amount of a compound of
 5 the invention in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible
   powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions
   intended for oral use are prepared according to any method known in the art for the
   manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or
   more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents,
10 coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and
   palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with nontoxic
   pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets.
   These excipients are, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium
   carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating
15 agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin
   or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The
   tablets are uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in
   the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For
   example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be
20 employed. Formulations for oral use can be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the
   active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium
   phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with
   water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.
25 Certain injectable compositions are aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and
   suppositories are advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. Said
   compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing,
   wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure
   and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.
30 Said compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating
   methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1-75%, or contain about 1-50%, of the active
   ingredient.
   Suitable compositions for transdermal application include an effective amount of a compound
35 of the invention with carrier. Carriers include absorbable pharmacologically acceptable

   solvents to assist passage through the skin of the host. For example, transdermal devices
   are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the
   compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the
   compound of the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged
 5 period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.
   Suitable compositions for topical application, e.g., to the skin and eyes, include aqueous
   solutions, suspensions, ointments, creams, gels or sprayable formulations, e.g., for delivery
   by aerosol or the like. Such topical delivery systems will in particular be appropriate for
10 dermal application, e.g., for the treatment of skin cancer, e.g., for prophylactic use in sun
   creams, lotions, sprays and the like. They are thus particularly suited for use in topical,
   including cosmetic, formulations well-known in the art. Such may contain solubilizers,
   stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.
15 As used herein a topical application may also pertain to an inhalation or to an intranasal
   application. They are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a
   mixture, for example a dry blend with lactose, or a mixed component particle, for example
   with phospholipids) from a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a
   pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer or nebuliser, with or without the use of a
20 suitable propellant.
   The invention further provides anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms
   comprising the compounds of the invention as active ingredients, since water may facilitate
   the degradation of certain compounds.
25
   Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared
   using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity
   conditions. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such
   that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are preferably
30 packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be
   included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not
   limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e. g., vials), blister packs,
   and strip packs.

   The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise
   one or more agents that reduce the rate by which the compound of the invention as an active
   ingredient will decompose. Such agents, which are referred to herein as "stabilizers," include,
   but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers, etc.
 5
   As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents,
   dispersion media, coatings, surfactants, antioxidants, preservatives (e.g., antibacterial
   agents, antifungal agents), isotonic agents, absorption delaying agents, salts, preservatives,
   drugs, drug stabilizers, binders, excipients, disintegration agents, lubricants, sweetening
10 agents, flavoring agents, dyes, such like materials and combinations thereof, as would be
   known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical
   Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company, 1990, pp. 1289- 1329). Except insofar as any
   conventional carrier is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic or
   pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated.
15
   The compounds of formula I or pharmaceutical acceptable salts thereof exhibit valuable
   pharmacological properties and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals.
   Furthermore, compounds of formula (I), (I'), (Ia), (la') or (Ib) may be useful for research on
20 diseases caused by nonsense mutations, e.g. as tool compounds.
   In particular, compounds of formula (I), (I'), (Ia), (la') or (Ib) I act as nonsense mutation
   suppressors on frequent PTCs, e.g. on Y122X in the mRNA of the cystic fibrosis
   conductance regulator protein (CFTR). This can be determined in vitro, for example, using
25 cell lines expressing GFP-CFTR-Y122X-Renilla constructs as described herein.
   The compounds of the invention may be therefore useful in the prevention, treatment or
   delay of progression of diseases caused by nonsense mutations
   The term "disease caused by nonsense mutation" is known in the field. It relates to a disease
30 being present in patients carrying a nonsense mutation in a disease-relevant gene wherein
   the nonsense mutation causes a partial/total lack of protein which then causes the pathology
   of the disease.
   In one embodiment, the disease is selected from hemophilia A, hemophilia B, cystic fibrosis,
   mucopolysaccharidosis I, Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy, Becker Muscle Dystrophy, loss of
35 APC caused cancer and loss of p53 caused cancer.

   For the above-mentioned indications (the conditions and disorders) the appropriate dosage
   will vary depending upon, for example, the compound employed, the host, the mode of
   administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in
 5 general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage of from
   about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg
   body weight, e.g. 1 mg/kg. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily
   dosage is in the range from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 to about
   400 mg, most preferably from about 10 to about 100 mg of the compound of the invention
10 conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day.
   For use according to the invention, a compound of the invention may be administered as
   single active agent or in combination with other active agents, in any usual manner, e.g.
   orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example in the form
15 of injection solutions or suspensions. A combination comprising a compound of the invention
   and another active agent will be referred to as "combination of the invention".
   A compound of the invention, may be combined with a readthrough activator, e.g.
   negamycin, RT13, RT14, ataluren or an aminoglycoside readthrough activator, e.g.
20 paromomycin, amikacin, G418, NB30, NB54 or NB84.
   A compound of the invention, may be combined with a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay
   inhibitor, e.g. NMDI-1.
25 Negamycin, RT13, RT14, ataluren, aminoglycoside readthrough activators and NMDI-1 are
   described e.g. in Keeling et al, WIREs RNA, 2011, 2, 837-852.
   The compounds of the invention may be useful for the prevention of diseases caused by
   nonsense mutations.

   a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a disease caused by a
 5 nonsense mutation comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a
   compound of formula (I), (I'), (Ia), (la') or (Ib) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,
   wherein the disease is selected from the afore-mentioned list, suitably hemophilia A,
   hemophilia B, cystic fibrosis and mucopolysaccharidosis I (Hurler syndrome).
10 The term "a therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of the invention refers to an
   amount of the compound of the invention that will elicit the biological or medical response of
   a subject, for example, ameliorate symptoms, alleviate conditions, slow or delay disease
   progression, or prevent a disease, etc. In one non-limiting embodiment, the term "a
   therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of the compound of the invention that,
15 when administered to a subject, is effective to at least partially alleviating, inhibiting,
   preventing and/or ameliorating a disease caused by nonsense mutations. In another non
   limiting embodiment, the term "a therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of the
   compound of the invention that, when administered to a cell, or a tissue, or a non-cellular
   biological material, or a medium, is effective to at least partially suppress the effect of
20 nonsense mutations.
   As used herein, the term "subject" refers to an animal. Preferably, the animal is a mammal.
   A subject also refers to for example, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses,
   dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice, fish, birds and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the
25 subject is a human.
   As used herein, the term "inhibition" or "inhibiting" refers to the reduction or suppression of a
   given condition, symptom, or disorder, or disease, or a significant decrease in the baseline
   activity of a biological activity or process.
30
   As used herein, the term "treating" or "treatment" of any disease or disorder refers in one
   embodiment, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., slowing or arresting or reducing the
   development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another

   Biological Testing
   In-vitro Testing: CFTR-Y122X assay
   Activity of compounds of the present invention was examined in recombinant, dual reporter
25 isogenic Hek293 cell lines ("CFTR-Y122X assay"). The engineered reporter constructs
   contained the 18 bp sequence strech corresponding to a common Y122X PTC mutation in
   CFTR class I mutant patients (see Sermet-Gaudelus, BMC Medicine, 2007, 5(5)). Instead of
   a tyrosine (Y) in position 122 of the CFTR protein a TGA stop codon interrupts the open
   reading frame (Y122X) of the corresponding mRNA This TGA stop codon triplet (followed by
30 the pyrimidine base cytosine) is permissive to aminoglycoside mediated translational
   readthrough which served as positive control for high throughput screening. A corresponding

                                                   - 66
   TAA stop codon variant and a wildtype non mutated construct was used for confirmation and
   counter screening. The CFTR sequence was sandwiched between an eGFP reporter, and a
   triple myc tag sequence fused to a full length Renilla reporter. All sequences, including an
   intron containing one positioned pre-eGFP (b-globin intron) were cloned in frame. The
 5 corresponding expression constructs were stably expressed in the isogenic HEK-R4 cell host
   (Invitrogen Incorp.) and selected by blasticidin resistance. The isogenic integration of the
   construct minimizes gene dose effects and improves assay reproducibility. Stably integrated
   single cell derived clones were selected and characterized for aminoglycoside mediated
   readthrough. A clone with optimal growth characteristics and strong response (EC5o of 1.5
10 mM) to paromomycin was pursued for HTS assay development. Readthrough of Y122X
   accumulates an intracellular localized fusion protein approximately 65.5 kDa in size as
   controlled by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence using an anti-renilla antibody.
   The eGFP reporter pre-PTC mutation serves as visual control for genetic stability of the
   screening clones and minimizes protein degradation of small fusion protein amounts. In the
15 assay, compound concentration was 10 pM. In miniaturized 1536 well format 2000 cells were
   dispensed in 4 pl/well and incubated for 24 h at 370C, 5% C02. 40 nl compounds were
   placed on the cells with control wells containing 1 ul Paramomycin and 14.4 mM final
   concentration. Compounds were incubated for 24h. Renilla Glo substrate (2.5 ul) was added
   and plates were centrifuged and processed for luminescence measurement using various
20 readers. Activity calculation was done using the equation: Al (%) = 100*(S-NC)/ (AC-NC)
   where AC, NC and S correspond to active controls (injection of Stimulation buffer = 100%
   stimulation), neutral controls (buffer injection which Iloprost EC1 0) and screening samples
   (S). NC corresponds to 0% activity whereas AC is 100% activity (14 mM paromomycin).
   False positive artefacts were removed in confirmation and validation screening using the
25 same assay format followed by counterscreening using the respective wildtype construct
   (w/o PTC mutation) cell model. Compounds were tested up to 100 pM compound
   concentration.

   In-vitro testing: Hurler patient derived fibroblast cell cultures
   Activity of compounds of the present invention was examined in patient derived fibroblast
   cells. The genotyped cells were derived from the Coriell Institute (# GM00798) and contain
   an in frame homozygous TGG to TAG change at nucleotide 1293 of exon 9 which results in a
20 W402X mutation. The W402X mutation is one of the most common Hurler syndromes
   causing loss of function mutation. Between 60-70 % of genotyped patients contain either the
   Q70X and/or the W402X in mutation and are classified as severe MPSI patients. This TAG
   stop codon triplet is permissive to aminoglycoside mediated translational readthrough which
   served as activity control for compound testing. Readthrough of W402X restores alpha-L
25 Iduronidase activity which results in removal of lysosomal accumulated
   Glycosaminoglycan's. Iduronidase expression could neither be detected by Taqman PCR@
