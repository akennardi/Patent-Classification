                                                 Inhalable medicaments
    The present disclosure accompanies a divisional application of AU 2014361087, the contents of
    which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
    The present invention relates to inhalable medicaments, and particularly to inhalable 32-agonists, like
  5 formoterol.
    Inhalable 32adrenoceptor agonists (often abbreviated to "P2-agonists") are widely used to treat
    respiratory diseases and particularly asthma and COPD. They are typically divided into short-acting
    P2-agonists (SABAs) and long-acting 32-agonists (LABAs). Examples of SABAs include salbutamol,
    levosalbutamol, terbutaline, pirbuterol, procaterol, clenbuterol, metaproterenol, fenoterol, bitolterol,
  0 ritodrine and isoprenaline.            Examples of LABAs include formoterol,       salmeterol, bambuterol,
    indacaterol and carmoterol.           Many are used as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. An example of
    particular interest is formoterol fumarate.
    Inhalable 32-agonists are typically administered using a dry powder inhaler (DPI), a pressurised
    metered dose inhaler (pMDI) or a nebuliser. In these approaches, the active ingredient must be in the
  5 form of particles which are small enough to be inhaled via the mouth and into the lungs. In many
    instances, the active ingredients are micronised prior to formulation.         This is essential where the
    active ingredient is not in solution.       The particle size of the inhalable 32-agonist is typically in the
    region of 1-5 microns (mass median aerodynamic diameter).
    Inhalable 32-agonists treat respiratory disorders by acting on 32-adrenoceptors in the respiratory tract.
 .0 However, these receptors are also located, inter alia, in the heart and blood vessels, and
    administration of 32-agonists is widely documented as leading to adverse cardiac side effects. It is
    believed that these adverse events occur when the 32-agonists enter the bloodstream. A common
    mechanism for entry of 32-agonists into the bloodstream is that some of the particles which are too
    large to be inhaled deposit in the throat and are swallowed by the patient. There is a need in the art
25  for formulations of inhalable 32-agonists which provide the required therapeutic effect whilst
    minimising cardiac side effects.
    This requirement is magnified for combination products. Combination products are well established in
    the art and are known to improve patient convenience and compliance.                  One example is the
    combination of an inhalable 32-agonist and an inhalable corticosteroid, e.g. formoterol fumarate and
30  budesonide.             A drawback of combination products are that control over the dose of the individual
    active ingredients is reduced. For the inhaled corticosteroid, this is not a serious concern because the
    therapeutic window of inhaled corticosteroids is wide. That is, it is difficult for a patient to exceed the
    recommended daily intake of inhaled corticosteroid.          However, the 32-agonist is more of a concern
                                                             1
    10427867_2 (GHMatters) P103411.AU.1

    since the therapeutic window is narrower and 32-agonists, as previously mentioned, are associated
    with serious adverse effects, including cardiac side-effects.
    Accordingly, the present invention provides a dry powder inhaler comprising:
    a reservoir containing a dry powder formulation and an arrangement for delivering a metered dose of
  5 the medicament from the reservoir; and
    a delivery passageway for directing an inhalation-induced air flow through a mouthpiece, the delivery
    passageway extending to the metered dose of medicament,
    wherein the formulation comprises an inhalable 32-agonist having a particle size distribution of d1 0 <1
    pm, d50 = 1-3 pm, d90 = 3.5-6 pm and NLT 99% <10 pm and a lactose carrier.
  0 The combination of this DPI and formulation surprisingly shows a reduced systemic exposure leading
    to reduced side effects.
    In an embodiment the inhaler may further comprising a deagglomerator, preferably a cyclone
    deagglomerator, preferably comprising:
    an inner wall defining a swirl chamber extending along an axis from a first end to a second end;
  5 a dry powder supply port in the first end of the swirl chamber for providing fluid communication
    between the delivery passageway of the inhaler and the first end of the swirl chamber;
    at least one inlet port in the inner wall of the swirl chamber adjacent to the first end of the swirl
    chamber providing fluid communication between a region exterior to the deagglomerator and the first
    end of the swirl chamber;
 .0 an outlet port providing fluid communication between the second end of the swirl chamber and a
    region exterior to the deagglomerator; and
    vanes at the first end of the swirl chamber extending at least in part radially outwardly from the axis of
    the chamber, each of the vanes having an oblique surface facing at least in part in a direction
    transverse to the axis; whereby a breath-induced low pressure at the outlet port causes air flows into
25  the swirl chamber through the dry powder supply port and the inlet port.
    In an embodiment, the reservoir may be a sealed reservoir including a dispensing port, and the
    inhaler may further comprise:
    a channel communicating with the dispensing port and including a pressure relief port;
    a conduit providing fluid communication between an interior of the sealed reservoir and the pressure
30  relief port of the channel; and
    a cup assembly movably received in the channel and including, a recess adapted to receive
    medicament when aligned with the dispensing port, a first sealing surface adapted to seal the
    dispensing port when the recess is unaligned with the dispensing port, and a second sealing surface
    adapted to sealing the pressure relief port when the recess is aligned with the dispensing port and
35  unseal the pressure relief port when the recess is unaligned with the dispensing port.

    The present invention is based on a DPI providing active metering and a cyclone deagglomerator
    combined with a 32-agonist formulation which has a narrowly defined particle size distribution. The
    d90 value in particular is closely controlled to provide a coarser than usual powder and it has been
    surprisingly found that such a powder reduces systemic exposure to the 32-agonist and hence
 .0 minimises cardiac side effects.
    The inhalable 32-agonist is preferably selected form salbutamol, levosalbutamol, terbutaline,
    pirbuterol,        procaterol,      clenbuterol, metaproterenol, fenoterol, bitolterol,  ritodrine, isoprenaline,
    formoterol, salmeterol, bambuterol, indacaterol, carmoterol or pharmaceutically acceptable salts
    thereof.       This list includes SABAs and LABAs (defined hereinabove).               An example of particular
25  interest is formoterol fumarate, e.g. formoterol fumarate dihydrate.
    The inhalable 32-agonist may be prepared by jet milling.                The process comprises the steps of
    providing the 32-agonist in particulate form, jet milling the 32-agonist and collecting the resultant
    micronised powder.
    First, the 32-agonist is provided in particulate form. Particulate forms of 32-agonists are widely used in
30  the milling process. The particles of the 32-agonist are hard enough to be fractured during the milling
    process. The inhalable 32-agonist in particulate form preferably has a Young's modulus of >0.5 GPa,
    more preferably >1 GPa, more preferably >5 GPa and most preferably >10 GPa. Young's modulus
    may be determined by nanoindentation, e.g. using an atomic force microscope (AFM).
    The powder is preferably prepared by jet milling. As shown in Fig. 1, a jet mill 1 utilises a shallow
35  cylindrical grinding chamber 2 into which a high-pressure gas is charged from interchangeable
    nozzles 3 spaced at regular intervals around the perimeter of the chamber 2 via a manifold 4. Gas
                                                                4
    10427867_2 (GHMatters) P103411.AU.1

    enters the grinding chamber in the form of high-energy jets at a fixed pressure. The axes of the jets
    are tangential to an imaginary circle, having a radius between the outer walls of the chamber and the
    gas outlet port, such radius being a function of the product to be milled and of the particle size to be
    targeted. The fluid jets thus generate a high-speed vortex 5 into which is introduced from a feed
  5 funnel 6 the material to be micronised using a feed gas 7. The chamber 2 may be lined with a liner 8.
    The jet milling is typically performed under the following conditions: a feed pressure of 8.0-10 bar; a
    grinding pressure of 4.0-6.0 bar; and a feed rate of 1.8-2.2 Kg/h. The milled powder is discharged via
    an outlet 9. These conditions are particularly tailored to providing 32-agonists suitable for the present
    invention. The higher feed rate distributes the energy from the grinding over a greater number of
  0 particles thereby limiting the size reduction effect.
    The resulting powder is collected and is in a form suitable for inhalation.
    The resulting 32-agonist powder has the following particle size distribution d10 <1 pm, d50 = 1-3 pm,
    d90 = 3.5-6 pm and NLT 99% <10 pm.            Preferably, the 32-agonist powder has the following particle
    size distribution d1 0 = 0.4-0.6, d50 = 1.5-2.5 and d90 = 3.6-5.1.      Most preferably, it has the following
  5 particle size distribution d1O = 0.46-0.53, d50 = 1.68-1.92 and d90 = 3.68-5.07. These particle size
    distributions most preferably apply to the 32-agonist, formoterol fumarate.
    The particle size of the 32-agonist powder may be measured by laser diffraction as a dry dispersion,
    e.g. in air, such as with a Sympatec HELOS/BF equipped with a RODOS disperser.
    The formulation of the present invention is administered using a DPI.          The carrier is lactose. The
 .0 lactose carrier preferably has a particle size distribution of d10 = 20-65 pm, d50 = 80-120 pm, d90         =
    130-180 pm and <10 pm = <10%. Preferably, the particle size distribution of the lactose is d10 = 20
    65 pm, d50 = 80-120 pm, d90 = 130-180 pm and <10 pm = <6%. The lactose is preferably lactose
    monohydrate (a-lactose monohydrate) and may be prepared by standard techniques, e.g. sieving.
    The particle size distribution of the lactose may be measured by laser diffraction as a dry dispersion,
25  using the technique described hereinabove.
    The formulation may further comprise one or more additional inhalable active ingredients, preferably a
    corticosteroid, e.g. budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate or fluticasone. A particularly preferred
    combination is formoterol fumarate and budesonide.
    It is preferable that substantially all of the particles of the corticosteroid are less than 10 pm in size.
30  This is to ensure that the particles are effectively entrained in the air stream and deposited in the
    lower lung, which is the site of action. Preferably, the particle size distribution of the corticosteroid is
    d10 <1 pm, d50 = <5 pm, d90 = <10 pm and NLT 99%< 10 pm.

    The delivered dose of the 32-agonist (the "labelled" quantity, i.e. the amount actually delivered to the
    patient) will depend on the nature of the 32-agonist.               By way of example, the delivered dose of
    formoterol fumarate, as base, is preferably 1-20 ig per actuation, with specific examples being 4.5
    and 9 pg per actuation. The doses are based on the amount formoterol present (i.e. the amount is
  5 calculated without including contribution to the mass of the counterion).               The delivered dose of
    budesonide is preferably 50-500 pg per actuation, with specific examples being 80, 160 and 320 pg
    per actuation.               Particularly preferred delivered doses of budesonide/formoterol in pg are 80/4.5,
    160/4.5 and 320/9.
    The delivered dose of the active agent is measured as per the USP <601>, using the following
  0 method.         A vacuum pump (MSP HCP-5) is connected to a regulator (Copley TPK 2000), which is
    used for adjusting the required drop pressure Pi in a DUSA sampling tube (Dosage Unit Sampling
    Apparatus, Copley). The inhaler is inserted into a mouthpiece adaptor, ensuring an airtight seal. Pi is
    adjusted to a pressure drop of 4.0 KPa (3.95-4.04 KPa) for the purposes of sample testing. After
    actuation of the inhaler, the DUSA is removed and the filter paper pushed inside with the help of a
  5 transfer pipette. Using a known amount of solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water (40:40:20)), the
    mouthpiece adaptor is rinsed into the DUSA. The DUSA is shaken to dissolve fully the sample. A
    portion of the sample solution is transferred into a 5 mL syringe fitted with Acrodisc PSF 0.45 pm filter.
    The first few drops from the filter are discarded and the filtered solution is transferred into a UPLC
    vial. A standard UPLC technique is then used to determine the amount of active agent delivered into
 .0 the DUSA. The delivered doses of the inhaler are collected at the beginning, middle and end of
    inhaler life, typically on three different days.
    The present invention also provides a dry powder inhaler comprising the formulation as defined
    herein. Several types of DPI are known in the art. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention,
    the dry powder inhaler comprises the following features.
25  The preferred inhaler comprises a reservoir containing a dry powder medicament and an arrangement
    for delivering a metered dose of the medicament from the reservoir; a cyclone deagglomerator for
    breaking up agglomerates of the dry powder medicament; and a delivery passageway for directing an
    inhalation-induced air flow through a mouthpiece, the delivery passageway extending to the metered
    dose of medicament.
30  In a preferred form, the deagglomerator comprises:
    an inner wall defining a swirl chamber extending along an axis from a first end to a second end;
    a dry powder supply port in the first end of the swirl chamber for providing fluid communication
    between the delivery passageway of the inhaler and the first end of the swirl chamber;
    at least one inlet port in the inner wall of the swirl chamber adjacent to the first end of the swirl
35  chamber providing fluid communication between a region exterior to the deagglomerator and the first
    end of the swirl chamber;
                                                                  6
    10427867_2 (GHMatters) P103411.AU.1

    an outlet port providing fluid communication between the second end of the swirl chamber and a
    region exterior to the deagglomerator; and
    vanes at the first end of the swirl chamber extending at least in part radially outwardly from the axis of
    the chamber, each of the vanes having an oblique surface facing at least in part in a direction
  5 transverse to the axis; whereby a breath-induced low pressure at the outlet port causes air flows into
    the swirl chamber through the dry powder supply port and the inlet port.
    In a further preferred embodiment, the reservoir is a sealed reservoir including a dispensing port, and
    the inhaler further comprises
    a channel communicating with the dispensing port and including a pressure relief port;
  0 a conduit providing fluid communication between an interior of the sealed reservoir and the pressure
    relief port of the channel; and
    a cup assembly movably received in the channel and including, a recess adapted to receive
    medicament when aligned with the dispensing port, a first sealing surface adapted to seal the
    dispensing port when the recess is unaligned with the dispensing port, and a second sealing surface
  5 adapted to sealing the pressure relief port when the recess is aligned with the dispensing port and
    unseal the pressure relief port when the recess is unaligned with the dispensing port.
    The dose metering system includes a cup received in the channel, which is movable between the
    dispenser port and the delivery passageway, a cup spring biasing the cup towards one of the
    dispenser port and the passageway, and a yoke movable between at least two positions. The yoke
 .0 includes a ratchet engaging the cup and preventing movement of the cup when the yoke is in one of
    the positions, and allowing movement of the cup when the yoke is in another of the positions.
    The inhaler includes a cyclone deagglomerator for breaking up agglomerates of the active ingredients
    and carrier. This occurs prior to inhalation of the powder by a patient. The deagglomerator includes an
    inner wall defining a swirl chamber extending along an axis from a first end to a second end, a dry
25  powder supply port, an inlet port, and an outlet port.
    The supply port is in the first end of the swirl chamber for providing fluid communication between a
    dry powder delivery passageway of the inhaler and the first end of the swirl chamber. The inlet port is
    in the inner wall of the swirl chamber adjacent to the first end of the swirl chamber and provides fluid
    communication between a region exterior to the deagglomerator and the swirl chamber. The outlet
30  port provides fluid communication between the second end of the swirl chamber and a region exterior
    to the deagglomerator.
    A breath induced low pressure at the outlet port causes air flows into the swirl chamber through the
    dry powder supply port and the inlet port. The air flows collide with each other and with the wall of the
    swirl chamber prior to exiting through the outlet port, such that the active is detached from the carrier
                                                         7

    (lactose). The deagglomerator further includes vanes at the first end of the swirl chamber for creating
    additional collisions and impacts of entrained powder.
    A first breath-actuated air flow is directed for entraining a dry powder from an inhaler into a first end of
    a chamber extending longitudinally between the first end and a second end, the first air flow directed
  5 in a longitudinal direction.
    A second breath-actuated airflow is directed in a substantially transverse direction into the first end of
    the chamber such that the air flows collide and substantially combine.
    Then, a portion of the combined air flows is deflected in a substantially longitudinal direction towards a
    second end of the chamber, and a remaining portion of the combined air flows is directed in a spiral
  0 path towards the second end of the chamber. All the combined air flows and any dry powder
    entrained therein are then delivered from the second end of the chamber to a patient's mouth.
    The deagglomerator ensures that particles of the actives are small enough for adequate penetration
    of the powder into a bronchial region of a patient's lungs during inhalation by the patient.
    The inhaler preferably has a dose counter. The inhaler includes a mouthpiece for patient inhalation, a
  5 dose-metering arrangement including a pawl movable along a predetermined path during the
    metering of a dose of medicament to the mouthpiece by the dose-metering arrangement, and a dose
    counter.
    In a preferred form, the dose counter includes a bobbin, a rotatable spool, and a rolled ribbon
    received on the bobbin, rotatable about an axis of the bobbin. The ribbon has indicia thereon
 !0 successively extending between a first end of the ribbon secured to the spool and a second end of the
    ribbon positioned on the bobbin. The dose counter also includes teeth extending radially outwardly
    from the spool into the predetermined path of the pawl so that the spool is rotated by the pawl and the
    ribbon advanced onto the spool during the metering of a dose to the mouthpiece.
    The preferred inhaler includes a simple, accurate and consistent mechanical dose metering system
25  that dispenses dry powdered medicament in discrete amounts or doses for patient inhalation, a
    reservoir pressure system that ensures consistently dispensed doses, and a dose counter indicating
    the number of doses remaining in the inhaler.
    With reference to the drawings, the inhaler 10 generally includes a housing 18, and an assembly 12
    received in the housing (see Fig. 3). The housing 18 includes a case 20 having an open end 22 and a
30  mouthpiece 24 for patient inhalation, a cap 26 secured to and closing the open end 22 of the case 20,
    and a cover 28 pivotally mounted to the case 20 for covering the mouthpiece 24 (see Figs. 2, 3 and
                                                           8

   10). The housing 18 is preferably manufactured from a plastic such as polypropylene, acetal or
   moulded polystyrene, but may be manufactured from metal or another suitable material.
   The internal assembly 12 includes a reservoir 14 for containing dry powered medicament in bulk form,
   a deagglomerator 10' that breaks down the medicament between a delivery passageway 34 and the
 5 mouthpiece 24, and a spacer 38 connecting the reservoir to the deagglomerator.
   The reservoir 14 is generally made up of a collapsible bellows 40 and a hopper 42 having an
   dispenser port 44 (see Figs. 3-6, 8 and 9) for dispensing medicament upon the bellows 40 being at
   least partially collapsed to reduce the internal volume of the reservoir.
   The hopper 42 is for holding the dry powder medicament in bulk form and has an open end 46 closed
 0 by the flexible accordion-like bellows 40 in a substantially air-tight manner.
   An air filter 48 covers the open end 46 of the hopper 42 and prevents dry powder medicament from
   leaking from the hopper 42 (see Fig. 8).
   A base 50 of the hopper 42 is secured to a spacer 38, which is in turn secured to the deagglomerator
   10' (see Figs. 4-6, 8 and 9). The hopper 42, the spacer 38, and the deagglomerator 10' are preferably
 5 manufactured from a plastic such as polypropylene, acetal or moulded polystyrene, but may be
   manufactured from metal or another suitable material.
   The hopper 42, the spacer 38 and the deagglomerator 10' are connected in a manner that provides
   an air tight seal between the parts. For this purpose heat or cold sealing, laser welding or ultrasonic
   welding could be used, for example.
20 The spacer 38 and the hopper 42 together define the medicament delivery passageway 34, which
   preferably includes a venturi 36 (see Fig. 17) for creating an entraining air flow. The spacer 38 defines
   a slide channel 52 communicating with the dispenser port 44 of the hopper 42, and a chimney 54
   providing fluid communication between the medicament delivery passageway 34 and a supply port 22'
   of the deagglomerator 10' (see Figs. 8 and 9). The slide channel 52 extends generally normal with
25 respect to the axis "A" of the inhaler 10.
   The deagglomerator 10' breaks down agglomerates of dry powder medicament before the dry powder
   leaves the inhaler 10 through the mouthpiece 24.
   Referring to Figs. 18-23, the deagglomerator 10' breaks down agglomerates of medicament, or
   medicament and carrier, before inhalation of the medicament by a patient.
                                                        9

     In general, the deagglomerator 10' includes an inner wall 12' defining a swirl chamber 14' extending
    along an axis A' from a first end 18' to a second end 20'. The swirl chamber 14' includes circular
    cross-sectional areas arranged transverse to the axis A', that decrease from the first end 18' to the
    second end 20' of the swirl chamber 14', such that any air flow traveling from the first end of the swirl
  5 chamber to the second end will be constricted and at least in part collide with the inner wall 12' of the
    chamber.
     Preferably, the cross-sectional areas of the swirl chamber 14' decrease monotonically. In addition, the
    inner wall 12'is preferably convex, i.e., arches inwardly towards the axis A', as shown best in Fig. 23.
    As shown in Figs. 18, 20 and 23, the deagglomerator 10' also includes a dry powder supply port 22' in
  0 the first end 18' of the swirl chamber 14' for providing fluid communication between a dry powder
    delivery passageway of an inhaler and the first end 18' of the swirl chamber 14'. Preferably, the dry
    powder supply port 22' faces in a direction substantially parallel with the axis A' such that an air flow,
    illustrated by arrow 1' in Fig. 23, entering the chamber 14' through the supply port 22' is at least
    initially directed parallel with respect to the axis A'of the chamber.
  5  Referring to Figs. 18-23, the deagglomerator 10' additionally includes at least one inlet port 24' in the
    inner wall 12' of the swirl chamber 14' adjacent to or near the first end 18' of the chamber providing
    fluid communication between a region exterior to the deagglomerator and the first end 18' of the swirl
    chamber 14'. Preferably, the at least one inlet port comprises two diametrically opposed inlet ports
    24', 25' that extend in a direction substantially transverse to the axis A' and substantially tangential to
 .0 the circular cross-section of the swirl chamber 14'. As a result, air flows, illustrated by arrows 2' and 3'
    in Figs. 18 and 22, entering the chamber 14' through the inlet ports are at least initially directed
    transverse with respect to the axis A' of the chamber and collide with the air flow 1' entering through
    the supply port 22' to create turbulence. The combined air flows, illustrated by arrow 4' in Figs. 22 and
    23, then collide with the inner wall 12' of the chamber 14', form a vortex, and create additional
25  turbulence as they move towards the second end 20' of the chamber.
     Referring to Figs. 18-20 and 23, the deagglomerator 10' includes vanes 26' at the first end 18' of the
    swirl chamber 14' extending at least in part radially outwardly from the axis A'of the chamber. Each of
    the vanes 26' has an oblique surface 28' facing at least in part in a direction transverse to the axis A'
    of the chamber. The vanes 26' are sized such that at least a portion 4A' of the combined air flows 4'
30  collide with the oblique surfaces 28', as shown in Fig. 23. Preferably, the vanes comprise four vanes
    26', each extending between a hub 30' aligned with the axis A' and the wall 12' of the swirl chamber
     14'.
    As shown in Figs. 18-23, the deagglomerator 10' further includes an outlet port 32' providing fluid
    communication between the second end 20' of the swirl chamber 14' and a region exterior to the
35  deagglomerator. A breath induced low pressure at the outlet port 32' causes the air flow 1' through
                                                           10
    10427867_2 (GHMatters) P103411.AU.1

    the supply port 22' and the air flows 2',3' through the inlet ports and draws the combined air flow 4'
    through the swirl chamber 14'. The combined air flow 4' then exits the deagglomerator through the
    outlet port 32'. Preferably the outlet port 32' extends substantially transverse to the axis A', such that
    the air flow 4' will collide with an inner wall of the outlet port 32' and create further turbulence.
  5 During use of the deagglomerator 10' in combination with the inhaler, patient inhalation at the outlet
    port 32' causes air flows 1',2',3' to enter through, respectively, the dry powder supply port 22' and the
    inlet ports. Although not shown, the air flow 1' through the supply port 22' entrains the dry powder into
    the swirl chamber 14'. The air flow 1' and entrained dry powder are directed by the supply port 22' into
    the chamber in a longitudinal direction, while the air flows 2',3' from the inlet ports are directed in a
  0 transverse direction, such that the air flows collide and substantial combine.
    A portion of the combined air flow 4' and the entrained dry powder then collide with the oblique
    surfaces 28' of the vanes 26' causing particles and any agglomerates of the dry powder to impact
    against the oblique surfaces and collide with each other. The geometry of the swirl chamber 14'
    causes the combined air flow 4' and the entrained dry powder to follow a turbulent, spiral path, or
  5 vortex, through the chamber. As will be appreciated, the decreasing cross-sections of the swirl
    chamber 14' continuously changes the direction and increases the velocity of the spiralling combined
    air flow 4' and entrained dry powder. Thus, particles and any agglomerates of the dry powder
    constantly impact against the wall 12' of the swirl chamber 14' and collide with each other, resulting in
    a mutual grinding or shattering action between the particles and agglomerates. In addition, particles
 .0 and agglomerates deflected off the oblique surfaces 28' of the vanes 26' cause further impacts and
    collisions.
    Upon exiting the swirl chamber 14', the direction of the combined air flow 4 and the entrained dry
    powder is again changed to a transverse direction with respect to the axis A', through the outlet port
    32'. The combined air flow 4' and the entrained dry powder retain a swirl component of the flow, such
25  that the air flow 4' and the entrained dry powder spirally swirls through the outlet port 32'. The swirling
    flow causes additional impacts in the outlet port 32' so as to result in further breaking up of any
    remaining agglomerates prior to being inhaled by a patient.
    As shown in Figs. 18-23, the deagglomerator is preferably assembly from two pieces: a cup-like base
    40' and a cover 42'. The base 40' and the cover 42' are connected to form the swirl chamber 14'. The
30  cup-like base 40' includes the wall 12' and the second end 20' of the chamber and defines the outlet
    port 32'. The base 40' also includes the inlet ports of the swirl chamber 14'. The cover 42' forms the
    vanes 26' and defines the supply port 22'.
    The base 40' and the cover 42' of the deagglomerator are preferably manufactured from a plastic
    such as polypropylene, acetal or moulded polystyrene, but may be manufactured from metal or
35  another suitable material. Preferably, the cover 42' includes an anti-static additive, so that dry powder
                                                            11

    will not cling to the vanes 26'. The base 40' and the cover 42' are then connected in a manner that
    provides an air tight seal between the parts. For this purpose heat or cold sealing, laser welding or
    ultra-sonic welding could be used, for example.
    Although the inhaler 10 is shown with a particular deagglomerator 10', the inhaler 10 is not limited to
  5 use with the deagglomerator shown and can be used with other types of deagglomerators or a simple
    swirl chamber.
    The dose metering system includes a first yoke 66 and a second yoke 68 mounted on the internal
    assembly 12 within the housing 18, and movable in a linear direction parallel with an axis "A" of the
    inhaler 10 (see Fig. 3). An actuation spring 69 is positioned between the cap 26 of the housing 18 and
  0 the first yoke 66 for biasing the yokes in a first direction towards the mouthpiece 24. In particular, the
    actuation spring 69 biases the first yoke 66 against the bellows 40 and the second yoke 68 against
    cams 70 mounted on the mouthpiece cover 28 (see Fig. 10).
    The first yoke 66 includes an opening 72 that receives and retains a crown 74 of the bellows 40 such
    that the first yoke 66 pulls and expands the bellows 40 when moved towards the cap 26, i.e., against
  5 the actuation spring 69 (see Fig. 3). The second yoke 68 includes a belt 76, which receives the first
    yoke 66, and two cam followers 78 extending from the belt in a direction opposite the first yoke 66
    (see Figs. 4, 12 and 13), towards the cams 70 of the mouthpiece cover 28 (Figs. 10 and 11).
    The dose metering system also includes the two cams 70 mounted on the mouthpiece cover 28 (see
    Figs. 10 and 11), and movable with the cover 28 between open and closed positions. The cams 70
 .0 each include an opening 80 for allowing outwardly extending hinges 82 of the case 20 to pass
    therethrough and be received in first recesses 84 of the cover 28. The cams 70 also include bosses
    86 extending outwardly and received in second recesses 88 of the cover 28, such that the cover 28
    pivots about the hinges 82 and the cams 70 move with the cover 28 about the hinges.
    Each cam 70 also includes first, second and third cam surfaces 90,92,94, and the cam followers 78 of
25  the second yoke 68 are biased against the cam surfaces by the actuation spring 69. The cam
    surfaces 90,92,94 are arranged such the cam followers 78 successively engage the first cam surfaces
    90 when the cover 28 is closed, the second cam surfaces 92 when the cover 28 is partially opened,
    and the third cam surfaces 94 when the cover 28 is fully opened. The first cam surfaces 90 are
    spaced further from the hinges 82 than the second and the third cam surfaces, while the second cam
30  surfaces 92 are spaced further from the hinges 82 than the third cam surfaces 94. The cams 70,
    therefore, allow the yokes 66,68 to be moved by the actuation spring 69 parallel with the axis "A" of
    the inhaler 10 in the first direction (towards the mouthpiece 24) through first, second and third
    positions as the cover 28 is opened. The cams 70 also push the yokes 66, 68 in a second direction
    parallel with the axis "A" (against the actuation spring 69 and towards the cap 26 of the housing 18)
35  through the third, the second and the first positions as the cover 28 is closed.

    The dose metering system further includes a cup assembly 96 movable between the dispenser port
    44 of the reservoir 14 and the delivery passageway 34. The cup assembly 96 includes a medicament
    cup 98 mounted in a sled 100 slidably received in the slide channel 52 of the spacer 38 below the
    hopper 42 (see Figs. 6 and 7). The medicament cup 98 includes a recess 102 adapted to receive
  5 medicament from the dispenser port 44 of the reservoir 14 and sized to hold a predetermined dose of
    dry powdered medicament when filled. The cup sled 100 is biased along the slide channel 52 from the
    dispenser port 44 of the hopper 42 towards the delivery passageway 34 by a cup spring 104, which is
    secured on the hopper 42 (see Figs. 5 and 6).
    The dose metering system also includes a ratchet 106 and a push bar 108 on one of the cam
  0 followers 78 of the second yoke 68 that engage a boss 110 of the cup sled 100 (see Figs. 6, 12 and
    13). The ratchet 106 is mounted on a flexible flap 112 and is shaped to allow the boss 110 of the sled
    100 to depress and pass over the ratchet 106, when the boss 110 is engaged by the push bar 108.
    Operation of the dose metering system is discussed below.
    The reservoir pressure system includes a pressure relief conduit 114 in fluid communication with the
  5 interior of the reservoir 14 (see Figs. 8 and 9), and a pressure relief port 116 in a wall of the slide
    channel 52 (see Figs. 6 and 9) providing fluid communication with the pressure relief conduit 114 of
    the hopper 42.
    The medicament cup assembly 96 includes a first sealing surface 118 adapted to seal the dispenser
    port 44 upon the cup assembly being moved to the delivery passageway 34 (see Figs. 6 and 7). A
 .0 sealing spring 120 is provided between the sled 100 and the cup 98 for biasing the medicament cup
    98 against a bottom surface of the hopper 42 to seal the dispenser port 44 of the reservoir 14. The
    cup 98 includes clips 122 that allow the cup to be biased against the reservoir, yet retain the cup in
    the sled 100.
    The sled 100 includes a second sealing surface 124 adapted to seal the pressure relief port 116 when
25  the recess 102 of the cup 98 is aligned with the dispenser port 44, and an indentation 126 (see Fig. 7)
    adapted to unseal the pressure relief port 116 when the first sealing surface 118 is aligned with the
    dispenser port 44. Operation of the pressure system is discussed below.
    The dose counting system 16 is mounted to the hopper 42 and includes a ribbon 128, having
    successive numbers or other suitable indicia printed thereon, in alignment with a transparent window
30  130 provided in the housing 18 (see Fig. 3). The dose counting system 16 includes a rotatable bobbin
    132, an indexing spool 134 rotatable in a single direction, and the ribbon 128 rolled and received on
    the bobbin 132 and having a first end 127 secured to the spool 134, wherein the ribbon 128 unrolls
    from the bobbin 132 so that the indicia is successively displayed as the spool 134 is rotated or
    advanced.
                                                       13
    10427867_2 (GHMatters) P103411.AU.1

    The spool 134 is arranged to rotate upon movement of the yokes 66,68 to effect delivery of a dose of
    medicament from the reservoir 14 into the delivery passageway 34, such that the number on the
    ribbon 128 is advanced to indicate that another dose has been dispensed by the inhaler 10. The
    ribbon 128 can be arranged such that the numbers, or other suitable indicia, increase or decrease
  5 upon rotation of the spool 134. For example, the ribbon 128 can be arranged such that the numbers,
    or other suitable indicia, decrease upon rotation of the spool 134 to indicate the number of doses
    remaining in the inhaler 10.
    Alternatively, the ribbon 128 can be arranged such that the numbers, or other suitable indicia,
    increase upon rotation of the spool 134 to indicate the number of doses dispensed by the inhaler 10.
  0 The indexing spool 134 preferably includes radially extending teeth 136, which are engaged by a pawl
    138 extending from one of the cam followers 78 (see Figs. 4 and 12) of the second yoke 68 upon
    movement of the yoke to rotate, or advance, the indexing spool 134. More particularly, the pawl 138 is
    shaped and arranged such that it engages the teeth 136 and advances the indexing spool 134 only
    upon the mouthpiece 24 cover 28 being closed and the yokes 66,68 moved back towards the cap 26
  5 of the housing 18.
    The dose counting system 16 also includes a chassis 140 that secures the dose counting system to
    the hopper 42 and includes shafts 142,144 for receiving the bobbin 132 and the indexing spool 134.
    The bobbin shaft 142 is preferably forked and includes radially nubs 146 for creating a resilient
    resistance to rotation of the bobbin 132 on the shaft 142. A clutch spring 148 is received on the end of
 !0 the indexing spool 134 and locked to the chassis 140 to allow rotation of the spool 134 in only a single
    direction (anticlockwise as shown in Fig. 15). Operation of the dose counting system 16 is discussed
    below.
    Fig. 14 illustrates the relative movements of the boss 110 of the cup sled 100, and the ratchet 106
    and the push bar 108 of the second yoke 68 as the mouthpiece cover 28 is opened and closed. In the
25  first position of the yokes 66,68 (wherein the cover 28 is closed and the cam followers 78 are in
    contact with the first cam surfaces 90 of the cams 70), the ratchet 106 prevents the cup spring 104
    from moving the cup sled 100 to the delivery passageway 34. The dose metering system is arranged
    such that when the yokes are in the first position, the recess 102 of the medicament cup 98 is directly
    aligned with the dispenser port 44 of the reservoir 14 and the pressure relief port 116 of the spacer 38
30  is sealed by the second sealing surface 124 of the cup sled 100.
    Upon the cover 28 being partially opened such that the second cam surfaces 92 of the cams 70
    engage the cam followers 78, the actuator spring 69 is allowed to move the yokes 66,68 linearly
    towards the mouthpiece 24 to the second position and partially collapse the bellows 40 of the
    medicament reservoir 14. The partially collapsed bellows 40 pressurizes the interior of the reservoir
35  14 and ensures medicament dispensed from the dispenser port 44 of the reservoir fills the recess 102
                                                        14

    of the medicament cup 98 such that a predetermined dose is provided. In the second position,
    however, the ratchet 106 prevents the cup sled 100 from being moved to the delivery passageway 34,
    such that the recess 102 of the medicament cup 98 remains aligned with the dispenser port 44 of the
    reservoir 14 and the pressure relief port 116 of the spacer 38 remains sealed by the second sealing
  5 surface 124 of the cup assembly 96.
    Upon the cover 28 being fully opened such that the third cam surfaces 94 engage the cam followers
    78, the actuator spring 69 is allowed to move the yokes 66,68 further towards the mouthpiece 24 to
    the third position. When moved to the third position, the ratchet 106 disengages, or falls below the
    boss 110 of the cup sled 100 and allows the cup sled 100 to be moved by the cup spring 104, such
  0 that the filled recess 102 of the cup 98 is position in the venturi 36 of the delivery passageway 34 and
    the dispenser port 44 of the reservoir 14 is sealed by the first sealing surface 118 of the cup assembly
    96. In addition, the pressure relief port 116 is uncovered by the indentation 126 in the side surface of
    the sled 100 to release pressure from the reservoir 14 and allow the bellows 40 to further collapse
    and accommodate the movement of the yokes 66,68 to the third position. The inhaler 10 is then ready
  5 for inhalation by a patient of the dose of medicament placed in the delivery passageway 34.
    As shown in Fig. 17, a breath-induced air stream 4' diverted through the delivery passageway 34
    passes through the venturi 36, entrains the medicament and carries the medicament into the
    deagglomerator 10' of the inhaler 10. Two other breath-induced air streams 2', 3' (only one shown)
    enter the deagglomerator 10' through the diametrically opposed inlet ports 24', 25' and combine with
 .0 the medicament entrained air stream 150 from the delivery passageway 34. The combined flows 4'
    and entrained dry powder medicament then travel to the outlet port 32' of the deagglomerator and
    pass through the mouthpiece 24 for patient inhalation.
    Once inhalation is completed, the mouthpiece cover 28 can be closed. When the cover 28 is closed,
    the trigger cams 70 force the yokes 66,68 upwardly such that the first yoke 66 expands the bellows
25  40, and the pawl 138 of the second yoke 68 advances the indexing spool 134 of the dose counting
    system 16 to provide a visual indication of a dose having been dispensed. In addition, the cup
    assembly 96 is forced back to the first position by the pusher bar 108 of the upwardly moving second
    yoke 68 (see Fig. 14) such that the boss 110 of the cup sled 100 is engaged and retained by the
    ratchet 106 of the second yoke 68.
30  The present invention also provides the inhaler of any aspect and embodiment of the invention for use
    in treating a respiratory disease.    In particular, the respiratory disease may be asthma or chronic
    obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
    In any aspect of the invention, it is envisaged that the asthma may be any severity of asthma, for
    example the asthma may be mild, mild to moderate, moderate, moderate to severe, or severe

   asthma. Such asthma may be classified as GINA stage 1, 2, 3 or 4 according to the Global Initiative
   for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, as would be understood by a person of skill in the art.
   The present invention will now be described with reference to the examples, which are not intended to
   be limiting.
 5 Examples
   Example 1
   Two samples of formoterol fumarate dihydrate were micronised by jet milling. The two batches were
   assigned codes 7544MA (conventional milling) and 7544MO (invention).                       The micronisation
   conditions are set out in Table 1.

   The process for batch 7544MO uses a lower grinding pressure and a higher feed rate than for batch
   7544MA. As such, the process for batch 7544MO utilises a lower energy to micronise formoterol than
15 for batch 7544MA.                   This is the reason that the batches made by the 7544MO process have
   consistently higher d90 diameter than those of the batches made by the 7544MA process.
   The particle sizes of the two batches were measured using a laser light scattering and a dry particle
   dispersion method, e.g. in air, such as with a Sympatec HELOS/BF equipped with a RODOS
   disperser and the results are set out in Table 2 and Fig. 24.

   The particle size distribution of different batches of micronised formoterol, show an average median
   diameter (d50) of ca. 1.7 mm with a range of 1.6-1.9 mm. The two micronised codes, 7544MA and
   7544MO, are not significantly different in fine particle size fraction, below approximately d50.
 5 However, the two micronisation codes do show clear differences in terms of their coarse particle
   fraction; this is clearly seen in Fig. 25. Table 2 shows that the d90 diameter for the five 7544MO
   formoterol batches (ca. 4.3 mm) is higher than the seven 7544MA formoterol batches (ca. 3.3 mm).
   Example 2
   A pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical study was conducted.         The PK study assessed a number of key
 0 formulation parameters, metered dose (device dose cup volume), formulation blend strength, drug
   substance particle size and lactose particle size, using a stepwise approach.      The PK study was
   carried out on the middle strength product (160/4.5 pg). Batch A contained formoterol 7544MA and
   batch B contained formoterol 7544MO.         For both batch A and batch B, the inhaler, the budesonide
   and the lactose were the same.
15 The key findings of the PK study are highlighted in Fig. 25. The data show that the coarser particle
   size formoterol lowers Cmax significantly, i.e. by more than 20%.
