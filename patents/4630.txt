                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
   [0001]
10           The present invention relates to an indoor unit of an air conditioner.
   Description of Related Art
   [0002]
             Conventionally, an indoor unit of an air conditioner has a structure in which a
15 heat exchanger, a blower fan and so on are accommodated in a casing.         Additionally, for
   example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.
   2004-101013, the casing is covered with a front surface cover having an inlet port and an
   outlet port provided above and below each other and an upper surface cover installed on
   an upper surface of the front surface cover.    In this casing, the upper surface cover
20 disposed on the front surface cover is divided and disposed in a right and left direction,
   or a service cover is installed with an opening providing for electrical components on a
   part of the upper surface cover, thereby reducing costs and improving external
   appearance.
25                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   Technical Problem

                                                  2
   [0003]
             However, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No.
   2004-101013, since the service cover covers only an upper portion of a side portion of
   the front surface cover (casing), even if the service cover is removed, it is not easy to
 5 access the internal electrical components.     Further, in Japanese Unexamined Patent
   Application, First Publication No. 2004-101013, even if the service cover or the upper
   surface cover is simply exchanged, it is impossible to sufficiently improve the aesthetic
   appearance.
   [0004]
10           Therefore, the present invention provides an indoor unit of an air conditioner
   with which it is possible to secure workability at the time of maintenance or the like
   while the aesthetic appearance is improved.
   [0005]
            An indoor unit of an air conditioner according to a first aspect of the present
15 invention includes a casing; a blower fan and a heat exchanger accommodated in the
   casing; a top panel, a front surface panel, a bottom surface panel having a flap, and a rear
   surface panel continuously disposed to surround a body portion of the casing; and right
   and left side surface panels which are detachable and continuous with the top panel, the
   front surface panel, the bottom surface panel and the rear surface panel and configured to
20 cover an entire side portion of the casing.
   [0006]
             According to the indoor unit of the air conditioner, since the respective panels
   continuously cover the body portion and side portions of the casing and surround them,
   the entire design surface of the indoor unit which is seen from the outside can be formed
25 to have a continuous appearance with a good configuration.        Further, since the side

                                                   3
   surface panel detachably covers an entire side portion of the casing, access to electrical
   components and the like inside the casing is facilitated by removing the side surface
   panel.
   [0007]
 5           According to the indoor unit of the air conditioner according to a second aspect
   of the present invention, in the first aspect, side portion accommodating spaces may be
   provided between the right and left side surface panels and a side portion of the casing,
   and a controller configured to control the blower fan and the heat exchanger may be
   accommodated in afirst side portion accommodating space, and a device may be
10 accommodated in asecond side portion accommodating space to be attachable to and
   detachable from at least one of the casing and the side surface panels.
   [0008]
             As described above, even when the side portion accommodating space is
   provided inside first side portion of the casings and the controller is accommodated
15 therein, the side portion accommodating space can be opened to a large extent by
   removing the side surface panel from the casing, and workability when installing, adding,
   replacing and repairing the controller can be improved.
   [0009]
             Also, since a side portion accommodating space is also provided inside the
20 second side portion of the casing, various kinds of device such as optional components
   can be disposed in the second side portion accommodating space.         Therefore, since
   various kinds of devices such as optional parts are covered by side surface panels, the
   optional components or the like are not exposed in a visible area.     Thus, it is possible to
   install various devices such as optional components without the aesthetic appearance of
25 the indoor unit deteriorating.

                                                   4
   [0010]
              Further, according to the indoor unit of the air conditioner according to a third
   aspect of the present invention, in the second aspect, a weight of a second side surface
   panel forming the second side portion accommodating space may be greater than that of
 5 a first side surface panel forming the first side portion accommodating space.
   [0011]
             As described above, when the weight of the second side surface panel in which
   the device is detachably accommodated is greater than that of the first side surface panel
   in which the controller is accommodated, it is possible to balance the weights of the right
10 and left sides of the indoor unit in the case in which a device such as an optional
   component is not provided in the second side portion accommodating space.           Also,
   since the controller is heavier than the optional components, even when an optional
   component is provided in the second side portion accommodating space, the weights of
   the right and left sides of the indoor unit can be balanced.
15 [0012]
              Further, according to the indoor unit of the air conditioner according to a fourth
   aspect of the present invention, in the first to third aspects, the bottom surface panel may
   be detachably installed on the casing.
             As described above, if the bottom surface panel is detachable from the casing,
20 by removing the bottom surface panel, it is possible to expose a bottom of the casing
   without disassembling the casing to a great extent.
             Accordingly, when various members or devices are installed on or separated
   from the bottom side of the casing or when various members and devices arranged on the
   bottom side are repaired or exchanged, it is easy to access the bottom side, and thus the
25 workability such as manufacturing and maintaining of the indoor unit can be improved.

                                                   5
   [0013]
             Further, according to the indoor unit of the air conditioner according to a fifth
   aspect of the present invention, in the fourth aspect, a member supporting portion may be
   provided on a bottom surface portion of the casing covered with the bottom surface
 5 panel.
            As described above, in the case in which the member supporting portion is
   provided on the bottom portion of the casing covered with the bottom panel, for example,
   even when a wiring or the like is added between the right and left side portions of the
   casing, since the wiring is not exposed to the outside of the indoor unit, adding of the
10 wiring and the like can be performed without the aesthetic appearance of the air
   conditioner deteriorating.
   [0014]
             Further, according to the indoor unit of the air conditioner according to a sixth
   aspect of the present invention, in the first to fifth aspects, the top panel may have a
15 plurality of separate top panels separable from each other.
             As described above, if the top panel has a plurality of separate top panels which
   can be separated from each other, it is possible to replace each separate top panel, thereby
   improving the maintainability.     In addition, it is possible to improve the aesthetic
   appearance of the indoor unit by changing a color for each separate top panel, or the like.
20 [0015]
             Further, according to the indoor unit of the air conditioner according to a seventh
   aspect of the present invention, in the first to sixth aspects, the top panel, the bottom
   surface panel, the rear surface panel, and the side surface panels may be detachable from
   each other and may be detachably fixed to the casing.
25 [0016]

                                                 6
            As described above, when all the adjacent panels are separable and detachable
   from each other, it is easy to detach each of the panels and to expose corresponding
   portions of the casing to the outside, thereby further improving workability.      Further,
   since the adjacent panels are fixed to each other, it is possible to sufficiently secure a
 5 strength for the indoor unit.
   [0017]
            According to the indoor unit of the air conditioner, workability, such as for
   maintenance, can be secured while improving the aesthetic appearance.

             The side surface panel 28 is locked on the casing 11 by the locking portion 34 in
   the facing direction and fastened by the fastening portion 35 in the direction intersecting
   the facing direction, and thus the side surface panel 28 and the casing 11 are fixed to each
20 other such that they may not be relatively displaced.
   [0036]
             A side portion accommodating space 29 capable of accommodating various
   devices 33 is provided inside of each side surface panel 28.      That is, the side portion
   accommodating space 29 is a space formed between the side portion 11 b of the casing 11
25 and the end wall 28a in a state in which the side surface panel 28 is connected to the

                                                 12
   casing 11.
   [0037]
            In the embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, a controller 32 is accommodated in first
   side portion accommodating space 29.      The controller 32 is supported by the side
 5 portion 1lb of the casing 11 and further covered with the side surface panel 28 in a state
   of being covered with a detachable controller cover 40.
   [0038]
            As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, various devices 33 can be accommodated in the
   second side portion accommodating space 29, and in the embodiment, the various
10 devices 33 are optional components and the like and are components such as an
   extension board which connects between a terminal like a mobile phone and the indoor
   unit 10.   Here, the various devices 33 are not limited to these optional components, and
   some functions of the controller 32 may be provided in the second side portion
   accommodating space 29 at the time of manufacturing.
15 [0039]
            Here, a claw-shaped device locking portion 37 which fixes the various devices
   33 accommodated in the side portion accommodating space 29 is provided on the end
   wall 28a of the side surface panel 28 which covers the second side portion
   accommodating space 29.       Due to the device locking portion 37, the various devices 33
20 can be fixed to the side surface panel 28 without using fasteners such as screws.
   [0040]
            Additionally, in the top panel 24, the bottom surface panel 26, the rear surface
   panel 27 and the pair of side surface panels 28 which cover the casing 11, adjacent panels
   24, 26, 27 and 28 are separably fixed to each other by screws, locking claws or the like
25 (not shown) not to be relatively displaced.

                                                    13
   [0041]
             According to the indoor unit 10 described above, the entire body portion 11 a of
   the casing 11 is continuously covered and surrounded by the panels 18, 24, 26 and 27,
   and the side portions 1lb are covered with the side surface panels 28, and thus the entire
 5 surface of the casing 11 is continuously covered.       Accordingly, it is possible to make the
   entire design surface viewed from the outside continuous with good appearance and to
   improve the aesthetic appearance of the indoor unit 10.
   [0042]
             Further, the side surface panel 28 which covers the entire side portion 1lb is
10 detachable from the casing 11.       Therefore, it is possible to easily expose an inside of the
   side portion 1lb of the casing 11 simply by removing the side surface panel 28 without
   disassembling the casing 11.       Accordingly, it is easy to access the electrical components
   such as the controller 32 inside the casing 11.      Thus, workability is good at the time of
   installing, adding, exchanging, and repairing the controller 32 and other constituent
15 devices.
   [0043]
             Further, it is possible to add other various devices 33 to the second side portion
   accommodating space 29 or to separate and dispose a part of the configuration of the
   controller 32.    Additionally, since the various devices 33 and the like are covered with
20 the side surface panel 28, the various devices 33 and the like are not exposed in a visible
   range.    Therefore, it is possible to install the various devices 33 and the like without
   deteriorating the aesthetic appearance of the indoor unit 10.
   [0044]
             In the indoor unit 10 of the embodiment, since the bottom surface panel 26 is
25 attachable to and detachable from the casing 11, it is possible to expose a bottom of the

                                                  14
   casing 11 by removing the bottom surface panel 26 without disassembling the casing 11
   on a large-scale.
            Accordingly, when various members or devices are installed at or separated
   from the bottom side of the casing 11 or when the various members and devices arranged
 5 on the bottom side are repaired or exchanged, it is easy to access the bottom side, and
   thus the workability such as manufacturing and maintenance of the indoor unit 10 can be
   improved.
   [0045]
            Further, in the embodiment, for example, it is possible to hook and support the
10 wiring connecting the controller 32 of a first side portion accommodating space 29 and
   the device 33 of a second side portion accommodating space 29 by the member
   supporting portion 31.     Also at this time, by removing the bottom surface panel 26, the
   wiring hooking work can be performed without largely disassembling the casing 11.
   Furthermore, even if a wiring is added according to the addition of such a device 33, the
15 wiring is not exposed to the outside by the bottom surface panel 26.        Therefore, the
   aesthetic appearance of the indoor unit 10 is not deteriorated.
   [0046]
            Further, since the top panel 24 has a plurality of separate top panels 24a which
   can be separated from each other, it is possible to replace each separate top panels 24a,
20 thereby improving the maintainability.      In addition, it is possible to improve the
   aesthetic appearance of the indoor unit 10 by changing a color for each separate top
   panels 24a, or the like.
   [0047]
            Further, in the indoor unit 10 of the embodiment, when all the adjacent panels 18,
25 24, 26, 27 and 28 are separable and detachable from each other, each of the panels 18, 24,

                                                  15
   26, 27 and 28 are easily removed to expose corresponding portions of the casing 11 to the
   outside, thereby further improving the workability.      Also, since the panels 24, 26, 27
   and 28 excluding the inlet panel 18 are fixed to each other for adjacent panels, sufficient
   strength of the indoor unit 10 can be secured.
 5 [0048]
            Although the embodiments of the present invention have been described in
   detail above, it is possible to make some design changes within a range not departing
   from the technical idea of the present invention.
             For example, of all the panels 18, 24, 26, 27 and 28 covering and forming the
10 casing 11, the panels 24, 26, 27 and 28 are fixed to each other, but the panels 24, 26 and
   27 may be directly fixed to the casing 11.
   [0049]
             Further, shapes and weights of the right and left side surface panels 28 may be
   different from each other.     For example, a weight of the other side surface panel 28
15 forming the second side portion accommodating space 29 may be larger than that of one
   side surface panel 28 forming the first side portion accommodating space 29.        In this
   case, when the weight of the other side surface panel 28 on the side in which the devices
   33 are detachably accommodated is greater, it is possible to balance the weights of the
   right and left sides of the indoor unit 10 in the case in which devices 33 such as the
20 optional components are not provided in the second side portion accommodating space
   29.   Also, since the controller 32 is heavier than the optional components, even when
   the optional component is provided in the second side portion accommodating space 29,
   the weights of the right and left sides of the indoor unit 10 can be balanced.
   [0050]
25           Further, the shapes of the right and left side surface panels 28 may be

                                                 16
   determined so that a volume of the second side portion accommodating space 29 in
   which the device 33 is accommodated is larger than that of the first side portion
   accommodating space 29 in which the controller 32 is accommodated.
   [0051]
 5          Further, the device 33 such as the optional component may be fixed not to the
   side surface panel 28 but to the side portion 1lb of the casing 11.
