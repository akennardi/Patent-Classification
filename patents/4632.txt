                                             PRIORITY
[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority of Korean Patent Application Serial No.
10-2017-0014044, filed on January 31, 2017, and U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.
62/592,752, filed on November 30, 2017.
                                               FIELD
[0002] The present disclosure relates to a hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly, and more
particularly, to a hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly having a breakout enclosure for
arranging optical fibers and power conducts from a feeder cable into hybrid optical
electrical groups carried from the breakout enclosure by hybrid breakout cables.
                                          BACKGROUND
[0003] Due to an exponential increase in the amount of information needed for subscribers
along with industrial development, a fiber to the home (FTTH) era has begun, in which
optical cables reach the inside of buildings to increase the amount of transmitted
information remarkably.
[0004] In some telecommunication networks, a hybrid cable that transmits both optical and
power signals is connected to equipment or other devices such as an exchange, a base
station (BS), or a remote radio head (RRH) to ultimately enable the transmission and
reception of a high-frequency wireless signal or the like. Furthermore, the rapid increase of
mobile communication data traffic attributed to the introduction and proliferation of
smartphones has resulted in earlier introduction of 4th generation (4G) communication than
expected (with 5th generation soon to follow), and communication service providers have
improved structures, for effective network deployment and reduction of operation cost.
[0005] As the number of antennas installed in a BS or the like increases according to recent
communication schemes (topologies / network designs), the number of RRHs or equipment
connected to the RRHs is also increased.
                                                - 1-

[0006] In regard to a conventional cable device including an enclosure structure connected
to one hybrid cable, a manufacturer strips the hybrid cable to separate cables, and
additionally connects each optical unit cable or power line unit cable to a power line unit
and an optical unit of a jumper cable inside an enclosure. Particularly in the case of
equipment configured as an integrated closed enclosure type, the manufacturer has no way
to accurately check a connection relationship between internal structures during the task.
As a result, the manufacturer is not able to detect an internal failure rapidly, and thus may
find a connection failure after manufacturing.
[0007] Moreover, if each optical unit or power line unit is separately connected, the number
of connectors is increased. The resulting increase in the length of a cable leads to power loss
and an increase of part cost and installation cost.
[0008] Embodiments of the invention may provide a hybrid optical-electrical cable
assembly configured in an open enclosure structure in order to reduce task failures by
enabling easy check of an internal failure and thus real-time supplementation during a task.
[0009] Embodiments of the invention may provide a hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly
for efficiently and stably transmitting an optical signal and an electrical signal at the same
time by means of a single hybrid optical-electrical cable structure.
[0010] Embodiments of the invention may provide a hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly
in which a simple hybrid optical-electrical cable connector is configured to facilitate tasks for
an operator and thus decrease personnel cost and save time.
                                            SUMMARY

electrical breakout cables, and a second end for connecting with the RRH. The second end
may include a signal breakout box for breaking out optical signals and power signals
received from the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable.
[0013] A hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly according to an embodiment of the
present disclosure is configured as an open enclosure type. Therefore, internal failures that
may occur during a task can be easily detected and overcome in real time, thereby reducing

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0024] Various embodiments of the present disclosure are described with reference to the
accompanying drawings. However, the scope of the present disclosure is not intended to be
limited to the particular embodiments and it is to be understood that the present disclosure
covers various modifications, equivalents, and/or alternatives falling within the scope and
spirit of the present disclosure. In relation to a description of the drawings, like reference
numerals denote the same components.
[0025] In the present disclosure, the term 'have', 'may have', 'include', or 'may include'
signifies the presence of a specific feature (for example, number, function, operation, or
component such as part), not excluding the presence of one or more other features.
[0026] In the present disclosure, the term 'A or B', 'at least one of A or/and B', or 'one or
more of A or/and B' may cover all possible combinations of enumerated items. For example,
'A or B', 'at least one of A and B', or 'at least one of A or B' may represent all of the cases of
(1) inclusion of at least one A, (2) inclusion of at least one B, and (3) inclusion of at least one
A and at least one B.
[0027] The term as used in the present disclosure, 'first' or 'second' may modify the names
of various components irrespective of sequence and/or importance, not limiting the
components. These expressions are used to distinguish one component from another
component. For example, a first user equipment (UE) and a second UE may indicate
different UEs irrespective of sequence or importance. For example, a first component may
be referred to as a second component and vice versa without departing from the scope of
the present disclosure.
[0028]     When it is said that a component (for example, a first component) is 'operatively or
communicatively coupled with/to' or 'connected to' another component (for example, a
second component), it should be understood that the one component is connected to the
other component directly or through any other component (for example, a third
component). On the other hand, when it is said that a component (for example, a first
                                                  -5-

component) is 'directly connected to' or 'directly coupled to' another component (for
example, a second component), it may be understood that there is no other component (for
example, a third component) between the components.
[0029] The term 'configured to' as used herein may be replaced with, for example, the term
'suitable for' 'having the capacity to', 'designed to', 'adapted to', 'made to', or 'capable of'
under circumstances. The term 'configured to' may not necessarily mean 'specifically
designed to' in hardware. Instead, the term 'configured to' may mean that a device is
'capable of' with another device or part. For example, 'a processor configured to execute A,
B, and C' may mean a dedicated processor (for example, an embedded processor) for
performing the corresponding operations or a generic-purpose processor (for example, a
central processing unit (CPU) or an application processor (AP)) for performing the
operations.
[0030] The terms as used in the present disclosure are provided to describe merely specific
embodiments, not intended to limit the scope of other embodiments. It is to be understood
that singular forms include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
Unless otherwise defined, the terms and words including technical or scientific terms used
in the following description and claims may have the same meanings as generally
understood by those skilled in the art. The terms as generally defined in dictionaries may be
interpreted as having the same or similar meanings as or to contextual meanings of related
technology. Unless otherwise defined, the terms should not be interpreted as ideally or
excessively formal meanings. When needed, even the terms as defined in the present
disclosure may not be interpreted as excluding embodiments of the present disclosure.
[0031] Now, with reference to the attached drawings, a description will be given of a hybrid
optical-electrical cable assembly that distributes and extends a hybrid optical-electrical
cable according to an embodiment. In the present disclosure, the term 'operator' may refer
to a person that installs or manufactures an electronic device or a device (for example, an
artificial intelligence electronic device) that installs an electronic device.
[0032] FIG. la is a perspective view illustrating a connection relationship between a hybrid
optical-electrical cable assembly 100 and a peripheral device according to various
embodiments of the present disclosure. FIG. lb is a perspective view illustrating a
                                                 -6-

connection relationship between the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 100 in a part S
of FIG. la shown as enlarged and a signal breakout block 31 of a hybrid optical-electrical
jumper cable structure 30 (or "hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable assembly 30").
[0033] Referring to FIGS. la and 1b, the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 100 may be
an antenna device for optical communication and/or power communication between a base
station (BS) 10 (for example, a digital unit) and remote radio heads (RRHs) 20.
[0034] According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the hybrid optical
electrical cable assembly 100 may include a hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 110
connected to the BS 10, hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 120 connected to the RRHs
20, and a breakout enclosure 130 for breaking out the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable
110 into a plurality of hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 120..
[0035] According to various embodiments, the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 110
provided to the breakout enclosure 130 may include a plurality of power line units (power
conductors group together) and a plurality of optical units (optical fibers grouped together
in at least one optical fiber cable).
[0036] The breakout enclosure 130 that facilitates connection and replacement may be
required to break out the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 110 provided to, for
example, the RRHs 20 or remote radio antennas (RRAs) into the plurality of hybrid optical
electrical breakout cables 120.
[0037] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 130 may be configured
to include a space in which an optical breakout box is mounted and a part supporting each
cable (i.e., the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 110 hybrid optical-electrical breakout
cables 120). The optical breakout box breaks out light and power of the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 110 by grouping the light and the power into at least one hybrid
optical-electrical group, and a part supporting each cable. Stated differently, the at least
one optical fiber cable that groups the plurality of optical fibers of the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 110 together is broken out within the optical breakout box so that
the plurality of optical fibers exit the optical breakout box in sub-groups or individually.
                                                 -7-

[0038] The hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 120 distributed from the breakout
enclosure 130 may include a plurality of power line units and a plurality of optical units.
According to various embodiments, a hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable structure 30
including at least one signal breakout block 31 may be disposed between a hybrid optical
electrical breakout cable 120 and an RRH 20. The hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable
structure 30 may include a hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable 32 extended from the
hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 120 through a connector or the like, and at least one
signal breakout block 31 that breaks out each of optical and power signals. As many hybrid
optical-electrical jumper cable structures 30 as the number of hybrid optical-electrical
breakout cables 120 distributed from the breakout enclosure 130 may be configured. For
example, each of the plurality of hybrid optical-electrical jumper cables 32 may be
connected individually to one of the plurality of hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables
120.
[0039] According to various embodiments, the at least one signal breakout block 31
functions to break out the hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable 32 into an optical cable and
a power cable inside the RRH 20. The hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable 32 may be
connected to the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 120 by means of a connector
structure including a connector of a hybrid optical-electrical type or the like, which will be
described later in detail.
[0040] According to various embodiments, optical fiber cables 111 for transmitting an
optical signal may be disposed in a center area, and power cables 112 for transmitting an
electrical signal may be disposed around the optical fiber cables 111, in the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 110. In another example, the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable
120 may include an optical fiber cable 121 with a plurality of optical fibers, and a pair of
power cables 122 disposed in a partial area of the outer circumferential surface of the
optical fiber cable 121.
[0041] According to an example, each of the optical fiber cables 111 and 121 may include a
central tension member, a plurality of tubes 111a or 121a, and a tube binder 111b or 121b.
The central tension member is disposed at the center of the optical fiber cable 111 and
provides a tensile force to the optical fiber cable 111. The plurality of tubes 111a disposed
                                               -8-

around the central tension member are hollow cylinders, and a plurality of optical
transmission media may be accommodated in the hollow spaces.
[0042] According to an example, optical transmission media of any type may be mounted as
optical signal transmission media inside the plurality of tubes 111a and 121a. The optical
transmission media may include, for example, general optical fibers each including only a
core and a clad or further including a resin layer in addition to a core and a clad, tight buffer
optical fibers, and ribbon optical fibers. The plurality of tubes 111a and 121a may be
disposed around the central tension member, linearly, spirally, in an S-Z manner, or the like.
[0043] According to an example, a plurality of power cables 112 or 122 are disposed around
or at a side of the optical fiber cable 111 or 121. The plurality of power cables 112 or 122
may be disposed linearly, spirally, in an S-Z manner, or the like. For example, the plurality of
power cables 112 of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 110 may be wound around the
optical fiber cable 111 in direct contact with the outer circumference of the optical fiber
cable 111. Thus, the plurality of power cables 112 may surround the optical fiber cable 111.
[0044] According to an embodiment, each of the plurality of power cables 112 or 122 may
include a plurality of conducting wires as transmission media of an electrical signal or a
ground line, and a coating deposited in direct contact on the outer circumferences of the
conducting wires to thereby surround the conducting wires so that the conducting wires
may be isolated from the outside. The conducting wires may typically be copper wires. The
coating may be formed on the outer circumferences of the conducting wires by direct
extrusion molding. The coating may be formed of plastic, such as polyethylene (PE),
polyolefin, ethylene vinylacetate copolymer (EVA), or polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
[0045] A specific structure of the breakout enclosure 130 will be described below.
[0046] FIG. 2a is an exploded perspective view of a hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly
200 according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, and FIG. 2b is an exploded
perspective view of the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 200, viewed from a different
direction from in FIG. 2a.
[0047] Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 200 may
include a hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 for transmitting an optical signal and an
                                                -9-

electrical signal at the same time, a breakout enclosure 230 for arranging light and power of
the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 into a plurality of hybrid optical-electrical
groups and distributing the hybrid optical-electrical groups, and hybrid optical-electrical
breakout cables 220 extending from the breakout enclosure 230 and then connected to
RRHs. The hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 200 illustrated in FIGS. 2a and 2b may be
identical fully or partially to the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 100 illustrated in
FIG. 1.
[0048] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 230 includes a tube
shaped housing. The hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 may be inserted into one end
of the breakout enclosure 230, and the inserted hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210
may be broken out in the breakout enclosure 230 and extended to a plurality of hybrid
optical-electrical cables 220 through the other end of the breakout enclosure 230.
[0049] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 230 may include a
housing 231, gaskets 232 mounted in the housing 231, an optical breakout box 235, support
members 233 and 236, and a sealing member 234.
[0050] The housing 231 may be formed by engaging a plurality of separate shells 231a and
231b (or "brackets 231a and 231b") each being a split half. The housing 231 may be shaped
like, for example, a tube or pipe with both ends open.
[0051] According to various embodiments, the housing 231 may be fabricated as the first
and second split shells 231a and 231b, and then completed by engaging the first and second
shells 231a and 231b with each other. The first and second shells 231 and 231b may be
injection molds formed of one of polymer (polycarbonate (PC) or polyethylene
terephthalate (PET)), polyacrylic acid sodium salt (PAAS), polyhenylene sulfide (PPS), and
polyphthal amide (PPA). The first and second shells 231a and 231b may be fabricated by zinc
die casting or aluminum die casting, or by processing a metal. In another example, the outer
circumferential surfaces of the first and second shells 231a and 231b may be coated with a
material strong against hypersaline water. For example, the outer circumferential surfaces
of the first and second shells 231a and 231b may be coated or plated with a material strong
against corrosion in hypersaline water, so that electronic parts arranged in the first and
second shells 231a and 231b may be protected from an ambient environment.
                                                - 10 -

[0052] According to various embodiments, the hybrid optical-electrical cables 210 and 220
are engaged with and extended from both open end portions of the housing 231 being a
pipe structure. For example, one end of the housing 231 may include a first opening 231c
into which the hybrid optical-electrical cable 210 is inserted. A mounting surface shaped in
correspondence with the shape of the outer circumferential surface of the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 210 may be formed along the periphery of the first opening 231c, so
that the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 may be mounted on and engaged with the
mounting surface. In another example, a mounting surface shaped in correspondence with
the shape of the outer circumferential surface of an engagement between the hybrid
optical-electrical feeder cable 210 and the sealing member 234 may be formed along the
periphery of the first opening 231c.
[0053] According to various embodiments, the other end of the housing 231 may include a
second opening 231d through which the distributed hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables
220 are extended. A mounting surface shaped in correspondence with the shape of the
outer circumferential surface of the second support member 236 engaged with the hybrid
optical-electrical breakout cables 220 may be formed along the periphery of the second
opening 231d.
[0054] According to various embodiments, the mounting surfaces formed along the
peripheries of the first and second openings 231c and 231d may be formed by engaging the
first bracket 231a with the second bracket 231b. For example, semi-circular mounting
surfaces may be formed on the first and second shells 231a and 231b, and a circular opening
may be formed by engaging the shells 231a and 231b with each other. However, although
the openings 231c and 231d and peripheral portions of the openings 231c and 231d are
circular, their shapes are not limited to circle. Thus, the openings 231c and 231d and the
peripheral portions of the openings 231c and 231d may be formed into various shapes
according to the shapes of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 and/or the hybrid
optical-electrical breakout cables 220.
[0055] According to various embodiments, the housing 231 is configured in an open
enclosure type including the first and second shells 231a and 231b whose engagement areas
correspond to each other. Therefore, the inner space of the housing 231 may be checked
                                                - 11 -

during a task. Accordingly, operators may readily find a failure in internal part engagement
and rapidly take an action, thus saving power. For example, after the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 210 and the plurality of hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220
are mounted or engaged inside the first bracket 231a, the second bracket 231b may be
engaged with the first bracket 231a. In another example, after the internal cables of the
hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 are divided into at least one group and the at least
one group is connected to the plurality of hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220, the
first shell 231a may be engaged with the second shell 231b.
[0056] According to various embodiments, the first and second shells 231a and 231b may
be engaged with each other, thereby forming the exterior of the hybrid optical-electrical
cable assembly 200 and reinforcing strength. For example, a plurality of openings or
recesses may be formed in the first and second shells 231a and 231b according to
arrangement of electronic parts in the device, and parts may be installed and engaged in the
openings or recesses, thereby increasing strength.
[0057] According to various embodiments, various structures may be formed on the
surfaces of the first and second shells 231a and 231b according to arrangement of electronic
parts in the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 200 or an engagement structure
between the first and second shells 231a and 231b. For example, a space for
accommodating the optical breakout box 235 and the plurality of support members 233 and
236 may be formed in each of the first shell 231a and the second shell 231b or by
engagement between the first shell 231a and the second shell 231b. The space for
accommodating the optical breakout box 235 and the plurality of support members 233 and
236 may be formed in each of the first shell 231a and the second shell 231b or by engaging
the first shell 231a and the second shell 231b with each other. The space for the optical
breakout box 235 and the plurality of support members 233 and 236 may be formed as a
recess or a rib that surrounds parts. According to various embodiments, mutually
corresponding engagement bosses or engagement holes may be formed between the first
shell 231a and the second shell 231b. For example, as an engagement member such as a
screw is engaged with an engagement member or an engagement hole, the first shell 231a
                                               - 12 -

and the second shell 231b may be engaged with each other, face to face or with a partial
area of each shell accommodated in the other shell.
[0058] According to various embodiments, the gaskets 232 may be disposed along the
periphery of the housing 231 in order to prevent introduction of foreign materials. For
example, grooves or recesses for mounting the gaskets 232 therein may be formed at
peripheral areas of the first shell 231a and the second shell 231b, and the gaskets 232 may
be arranged in the recesses, so that the inner space of the housing 231 may be effectively
sealed from the engagement areas of the first shell 231a and the second shell 231b based
on the engagement mechanism of the first shell 231a and the second shell 231b. The
gaskets 232 may be formed into closed loops each including a pair of curved surfaces. The
gaskets 232 may be formed of an elastic material, thus effectively sealing the inside with the
hybrid optical-electrical cable mounted therein from the outside.
[0059] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 230 may be disposed
around the first opening 231c of the housing 231, and may include the first support member
233 supporting the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 inserted into the first opening
231c.
[0060] The first support member 233 may be configured to include a hollow hole
corresponding to an end portion of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210, and
support the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 so that the hybrid optical-electrical
feeder cable 210 may be inserted into the hollow hole and thus may not shake. In addition,
the first support member 233 may support the optical cables extended from the hybrid
optical-electrical feeder cable 210 not to shake in the optical breakout box 235.
[0061] For example, the first support member 233 may be configured in a plurality of
segments, and then the segments may be engaged with each other, surrounding an end
portion of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210. The first and second shells 231a
and 231b may be provided with grooves in which the first support member 233 is mounted,
and thus the first support member 233 engaged with the hybrid optical-electrical feeder
cable 210 may be fixedly mounted in the grooves.
                                              - 13 -

[0062] According to an embodiment, while the first support member 233 is shaped into a
square and configured as separate components, the first support member 233 is not limited
to the specific configuration. Rather, the first support member 233 may be formed into
various shapes and the number of first support members 233 may vary, as far as the hybrid
optical-electrical feeder cable 210 can be inserted into the optical breakout box 235 and
supported without tremor.
[0063] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 230 may include the
sealing member 234 disposed around the first opening 231c into which the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 210 is inserted, in order to seal the breakout enclosure 230 from the
outside.
[0064] The sealing member 234 includes a hollow hole corresponding to the end portion of
the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210, and the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable
210 may be inserted into the hollow hole, with its end portion surrounded. The first and
second shells 231a and 231b may be provided with grooves in which the sealing member
234 may be mounted, and the sealing member 234 engaged with the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 210 may be fixedly mounted in the grooves. The sealing member 234
may include a ring-shaped protrusion 234a protruding outward, and the protrusion 234a
may form at least one water-proof contact surface, while elastically contracting and
expanding.
[0065] For example, the protrusion formed along the outer circumferential surface of an
end portion of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 may elastically contact the
inner surface of the housing 231, thus causing overlap. As a result, the compressed water
proof/dust-proof structure of the sealing member 234 forms the water-proof contact
surface, thereby effectively blocking an externally introduced fluid and stably supporting the
hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 from an external impact.
[0066] According to an example of the present disclosure, the sealing member 234 is
shaped into a tube and formed integrally, which should not be construed as limiting. As far
as the sealing member 234 can effectively seal the space between the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 210 and the housing 231, many modifications may be made to the
sealing member 234 in terms of shape and number.
                                               - 14 -

[0067] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 230 may be disposed
inside the housing 231, and include the optical breakout box 235 for breaking out the optical
fiber cables 211 of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210 into a plurality of cables,
and providing the cables to the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220.
[0068] According to various embodiments, the optical breakout box 235 may be configured
in a form with both ends opened. For example, the optical breakout box 235 may include an
inlet opening 235a with a single hole into which the optical fiber cables 211 are inserted,
and an outlet opening 235b having a plurality of holes through the inserted optical fiber
cables 211 are broken out into a plurality of optical fiber cables 211. The inlet opening 235a
and the outlet opening 235b are formed in different sizes. For example, the optical breakout
box 235 may be fabricated in the shape of a square funnel on the whole.
[0069] According to various embodiments, the plurality of holes may be arranged at
predetermined intervals in the outlet opening 235b. For example, 9 holes may be arranged
in 3 rows and 3 columns. Thus, the optical fiber cables 211 may be divided into 9 cables
through the holes. However, the plurality of holes in the outlet opening 235b are not limited
to the specific arrangement and number. Rather, various modifications can be made in
correspondence with the number and shape of hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220
to be provided to RRHs.
[0070] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 230 may be disposed
around the second opening 231d of the housing 231, and include the second support
member 236 that supports the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220 extended
through the second opening 231d.
[0071] According to various embodiments, the second support member 236 may include
hollow holes corresponding to end portions of the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables
220, and may support the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220 distributed from the
optical breakout box 235 and the housing, without tremor.
[0072] According to various embodiments, the breakout enclosure 230 may group a
plurality of optical fiber cables and power cables included in the single hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 210 into groups each including a predetermined number of optical
                                               - 15 -

fiber cables and power cables, and distribute the groups to the respective hybrid optical
electrical breakout cables 220. For example, the optical cables and the power cables may be
broken out into 9 hybrid optical-electrical cables, and the second support member 236 may
include 9 holes corresponding to the hybrid optical-electrical cables. However, the plurality
of holes are not limited to the specific arrangement and number. Various modifications can
be made in correspondence with the number and shape of hybrid optical-electrical breakout
cables 220 to be provided to the RRHs.
[0073] According to various embodiments, the second support member 236 may be
fabricated in such a manner that each of the plurality of penetrating holes may be engaged
with an end portion of one hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 220, surrounding the end
portion. The first and second shells 231a and 231b may be provided with grooves for
mounting the second support member 236 therein, and the second support member 236
engaged with the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220 may be fixedly mounted in
the grooves.
[0074] According to various embodiments, the second support member 236 may be formed
into a cylinder with a plurality of holes. The second support member 236 may be formed in
such a size that the outer circumferential surface of the second support member 236 may
match to the second opening 231d of the housing 231. However, the second support
member 236 is not limited thereto, and many shapes are available for the second support
member 236 as far as the second support member 236 can support the hybrid optical
electrical breakout cables 220 extended outward, without tremors.
[0075] At least a partial area of the gaskets 232 may be disposed on the outer
circumferential surface of the second support member 236 in order to seal the second
opening 231d through which the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220 are extended,
from the outside. For example, a part of the gaskets 232 are formed in a shape
corresponding to the outer circumferential surface of the second support member 236, thus
forming a water-proof contact surface with one surface of the second support member 236
and/or the inner surface of the housing 231. At least a part of the gaskets 232 may
elastically seal the vicinity of the second opening 231d, thereby blocking introduction of
foreign materials such as a fluid into the housing.
                                               - 16 -

[0076] The breakout enclosure 230 may include a ground member 237 formed on the outer
circumferential surface of the housing 231, for grounding. The ground member 237 may
protrude from the outer circumferential surface of the housing 231, at a position
corresponding to the optical breakout box 235 in the inside.
[0077] FIGS. 3a and 3b are perspective views illustrating a hybrid optical-electrical cable
assembly 300 according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. FIG. 4 is an
exploded enlarged perspective view of the interior of the hybrid optical-electrical cable
assembly 300 in which a hybrid optical-electrical cable is mounted in a breakout enclosure
330.
[0078] Referring to FIGS. 3a, 3b, and 4, the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 300 may
include a hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310 for transmitting an optical signal and an
electrical signal at the same time, a breakout enclosure 330 for breaking out light and power
of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310 into hybrid optical-electrical forms, and
hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320 that are broken out from the breakout
enclosure 230 and connected to RRHs. The hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310, the
breakout enclosure 330, and the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320 illustrated in
FIGS. 3a, 3b, and 4 may be identical fully or partially to the hybrid optical-electrical feeder
cable 210, the breakout enclosure 230, and the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220
illustrated in FIG. 2, in terms of structure.
[0079] In the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly 300 according to various
embodiments, the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310 with a single cable mounted in
the breakout enclosure 330 is broken out into a plurality of hybrid optical-electrical
breakout cables 320. For example, the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310 may be
broken out into 9 hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320 which may be connected
respectively to a plurality of RRHs (the RRHs 20 in FIG. 1).
[0080] In another example, the plurality of distributed hybrid optical-electrical breakout
cables 320 may be connected to the afore-described signal breakout blocks (the signal
breakout blocks 31 in FIG. 1), rather than they are connected directly to the RRHs. The
connection relationship between a signal breakout block 31 and a hybrid optical-electrical
breakout cable 320 will be described later.
                                              - 17 -

[0081] According to various embodiments, the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310
engaged with a first support member 333 and the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables
320 engaged with a second support member 336 may be mounted in a mounting space
between a groove and a rib inside a first shell 331a in the hybrid optical-electrical cable
assembly 300. Further, an optical breakout box 335 may be mounted between the hybrid
optical-electrical feeder cable 310 and the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320.
[0082] The hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310 surrounded by a first sealing member
334 may be mounted in the first hole 331c of the first shell 331a. The first member 333 may
surround an end portion of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310 and may be
mounted inside the first shell 331a, so that the end portion of the hybrid optical-electrical
feeder cable 310 may be fixed in the first shell 331a.
[0083] According to various embodiments, optical fiber cables 311 of the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 310 may be broken out into a plurality of optical fiber cables by the
optical breakout box 335 and then introduced into the hybrid optical-electrical breakout
cables 320. In another example, power cables of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable
310 may be broken out into a plurality of power cables in another space of the housing 331
(for example, a space other than the optical breakout box 335) and then introduced into the
hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320.
[0084] According to various embodiments, the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320
surrounded by a second support member 336 may be mounted in a second opening 331d of
the first shell 331a. Thus, the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320 may be
hermetically sealed, while being supported. According to an embodiment, a gasket 332 may
be mounted along the periphery of the first shell 331a (or the second shell 331b),
hermetically sealing the first shell 331a (or the second shell 331b).
[0085] After the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 310 engaged with the first support
member 333 and the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 320 engaged with the second
support member 336 are mounted in the inner space of the first shell 331a, the second shell
331b may be engaged with the first shell 331. In this manner, the hybrid optical-electrical
cable assembly 300 may be completed. For example, the first and second shells 331 and
                                               - 18 -

331b may be engaged with each other by engaging an engagement member such as a screw
with an engagement member or an engagement hole.
[0086] In the hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly according to the present disclosure, a
simple antenna cable connection module is configured to facilitate a task of an operator. As
a result, personnel cost is reduced and time is saved.
[0087] FIG. 5a is a perspective view illustrating a connection relationship between a hybrid
optical-electrical feeder cable 410 and hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 420 in a
breakout enclosure 430 according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, and
FIG. 5b is a perspective view of the connection relationship illustrated in FIG. 5a, viewed
from a different direction.
[0088] Referring to FIGS. 5a and 5b, a hybrid optical-electrical cable assembly may include
the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 410 for transmitting an optical signal and an
electrical signal at the same time, the breakout enclosure 430 for breaking out light and
power of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 410 into hybrid optical-electrical forms,
and hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 420 broken out from the breakout enclosure
430. The hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 410, the breakout enclosure 430, and the
hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 420 illustrated in FIGS. 5a and 5b may be identical
fully or partially to the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 210, the breakout enclosure
230, and the hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 220 illustrated in FIG. 2, in terms of
structure.
[0089] With reference to FIGS. 5a and 5b, a description will be given of one group of an
optical cable 411 and a power cable 412 which are inserted into one hybrid optical-electrical
breakout cable 420.
[0090] According to various embodiments, an optical cable 411 of the hybrid optical
electrical feeder cable 410 is separated by an optical breakout box 435, and a power cable
412 is separated in an area near to the optical breakout box 435. Then, the optical cable 411
and the power cable 412 may be inserted into one hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable
420. For example, the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 410 may include hybrid optical
electrical cables for 9 RRHs. The breakout enclosure 430 may break out the plurality of
                                                 - 19 -

optical cables 411 into 9 groups, and at least one optical cable 411 in one of the groups may
be provided as a part of one hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 420. In another
example, a plurality of power cables 12 of the hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 410 may
be broken out into 9 groups in an area other than the optical breakout box 435, and at least
one power cable 412 in one of the groups may be provided as a part of the hybrid optical
electrical breakout cable 420.
[0091] Therefore, at least one optical cable 411 including a plurality of optical fibers for one
RRH, and at least one power cable 412 (for example, a pair of power cables) may be
grouped into one group, forming one hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 420. The single
hybrid optical-electrical feeder cable 410 including hybrid optical-electrical cables for 9 RRHs
may be broken out 9 hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 420, each for one RRH.
[0092] The other plurality of hybrid optical-electrical breakout cables 412 are formed in the
above same manner, which will not be described herein.
[0093] FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating a connection relationship between a
connector structure 520a at one end of a hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 520 and a
connector structure 31a connected to the signal breakout block 31 of a hybrid optical
electrical jumper cable structure according to various embodiments of the present
disclosure.
[0094] Referring to FIG. 6, a hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 520 broken out from a
breakout enclosure and a signal breakout block 31 may be identical fully or partially to the
hybrid optical-electrical breakout cable 220 and the signal breakout block 31 illustrated in
FIG. 1, in terms of structure.
[0095] According to various embodiments, one end of the hybrid optical-electrical breakout
cable 520 may be disposed in a second opening (the second opening 231d in FIG. 2) of a
housing (the housing 231 in FIG. 2), and the other end of the hybrid optical-electrical
breakout cable 520 has a first connector structure 520a such as an optical-electrical
connector. The first connector structure 520a may be connected to a second connector
structure 31a at one end of the hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable 32, and the signal
breakout block 32 connected to the second connector structure 31a may break out an
                                               - 20 -

optical signal and a power signal of the hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable 32, for
electrical connection to an RRH.
[0096] According to various embodiments, the first connector structure 520a of the hybrid
optical-electrical breakout cable 520, and the second connector structure 31a at one end of
the hybrid optical-electrical jumper cable 32 may be configured as hybrid optical-electrical
types, for simultaneous connection of an optical signal and a power signal.
[0097] According to various embodiments, the first connector structure 520a may be
engaged with the second connector structure 31a by arranging the connector structures
520a and 31a face to face and then pushing them. For example, the outer diameter of the
first connector structure 520a may be smaller than that of the second connector structure
31a, and an end portion of the first connector structure 520a may be inserted into an end
portion of the second connector structure 31a. Thus, a lengthwise movement of the first
connector structure 520a may be restricted. Subsequently, the first connector structure
520a and/or the second connector structure 31a may be pushed and thus fixedly engaged
with each other. Further, the first connector structure 520a and the second connector
structure 31a may easily be separated from each other by pulling the first connector
structure 520a and/or the second connector structure 31a in different directions.
[0098] Conventionally, an optical cable and a power cable are separate and thus need an
additional connection operation. Moreover, the optical cable and the power cable are
engaged by a plurality of rotations or attachment/detachment, thereby increasing cost and
causing errors frequently. In contrast, according to an example of the present disclosure, an
optical-power integrated type is configured inside the connector structure, and a hybrid
optical-electrical connector is configured in a push-pull coupling mechanism according to a
fast, stable plug and play solution. Accordingly, a fast, stable connector coupling structure
which is easily installed may be provided.
[0099]    The above-described electronic device according to various embodiments of the
present disclosure is not limited to the foregoing embodiments and the attached drawings.
Thus, those skilled in the art will understand that many replacements, variations, and
modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.
