                                  ABSTRACT
A handle mounting assembly having a handle adapted for turning about an
axis and a drive member operable on a latch and/or lock mechanism. The
drive member is rotatably mounted to the handle and has one or more
apertures located on an annulus of the drive member. The assembly also
includes a handing plate which is non-rotatably mounted to the handle and
has an aperture to align with one apertures of the drive member in at least
one position relative to the axis of the handle. The assembly further includes
an escutcheon which receives a part of the handle therethrough and a fixing
member to substantially fix, in the direction of the axis of the handle, the
handle relative to the escutcheon. A biasing member biases the drive member
towards the handing plate and a fastener passes through the aligned
apertures of the handing plate and the drive member to secure the handing
plate and the driver member together.

                          HANDLE MOUNTING ASSEMBLY
                             FIELD OF THE INVENTION
    [1] The present invention relates to a handle mounting assembly. In
          particular, although not exclusively, the invention relates to mounting
          lever handles for door locks and latches.
                         BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
    [2] Reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
          admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge in
          Australia or elsewhere.
    [3] Mounting assembles for symmetric handles, such as lever handles, are
          well known and come in two categories: sprung stops and fixed stops.
    [4] Some prior art systems use sprung drive members having ramped
          faces such that when the handle is moved from a neutral, or unhanded
          configuration, into a particular configuration, a tab or protrusion on a
          handing plate is locked into a recess formed by the ramped face of the
          drive member. Once the handing plate is secured in this position, a
          screwdriver or similar tool is required to push the drive member away
          from the handing plate so that the handle can be rotated back to a
          neutral position before being rotated to lock the handing plate into the
          recess of the drive member which corresponds to the desired
          configuration. The above process is complicated and without due care,
          or reference to the supplied instructions, installers are prone to
3509423vl

                                           2
          breaking the assembly by trying to forcibly rotating the handle to the
          desired position from the locked position without first unlocking the
          handing plate from the drive member.
    [5] Further sprung mechanisms have removable springs as lever stops.
          For re-handing from left hand to right hand the spring assembly needs
          to be relocated leaving the installer with a handful of parts to be
          relocated. This creates the potential for parts to be misplaced or the
          mechanism to be incorrectly assembled.
    [6] Fixed stop mechanisms usually have a removable stop or stop
          assembly that needs to be removed or partially removed for handing to
          take place. Again, the above can cause possible lost parts or incorrect
          part re-assembly by the installer.
    [7] Fixed stop mechanisms also suffer from shock loading to the lever and
          stop mechanism whilst the lever returns to its rest position. In order to
          counteract the effect of the shock loading on the working parts stronger
          parts (materials or larger cross section) need to be used, which can
          significantly increase costs.
                             OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
    [8] It is an object of the present invention to overcome and/or alleviate one
          or more of the disadvantages of prior art systems or provide the
          consumer with a useful or commercial choice.
                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
3509423vl

                                            3
    [9] In one form, although not necessarily the only, or the broadest form,
          the invention resides in a handle mounting assembly comprising:
                  a rotatable handle rotatable between an unhanded position and
          one or more handed positions;
                  a drive member mounted at least partially around the handle and
          biased in a centre position by a biasing member, the drive member
          having one or more apertures located on an annulus of the drive
          member;
                  a handing plate mounted to the handle, the handing plate having
          at least one aperture able to at least partially align with one of the one
          or more apertures of the drive member in at least one position, when
          the handle is in one of the handed positions; and
                  a removable fastener operable to pass through the at least
          partially aligned apertures of the handing plate and the drive member to
          rotationally secure the handing plate and the driver member together
          when the handle is in one of the handed positions.
    [10]          In some embodiments, the drive member has two apertures.
          Preferably, the two apertures are angularly spaced. More preferably,
          the drive member has two apertures angularly spaced at least 901
          apart around the annulus of the drive member. Suitably, two apertures
          are spaced apart at an angle of approximately 1801 around the annulus
          of the drive member.
    [11]          Preferably, the drive member has a projection located adjacent
          each of the two apertures in order to rotationally engage the drive
3509423vl

                                             4
          member to the handing plate whilst the handle is rotated in a downward
          direction providing extra driving engagement to the handing plate.
    [12]          Preferably, the handle mounting assembly further comprises an
          escutcheon which receives a part of the handle therethrough.
    [13]          Suitably, the drive member is located completely around the
          handle.
    [14]          Preferably, the handle mounting assembly further comprises a
          fixing member to substantially fix, in the direction of the axis of the
          handle, the handle relative to the escutcheon.
    [15]          Preferably, the handle mounting assembly further comprises a
          biasing member operable to return the handle to an neutral position.
    [16]          Preferably, the biasing member is a spring member. The spring
          member is preferably a torsional spring.
    [17]          In some      preferred embodiments,     the escutcheon      has an
          aperture which receives the part of the handle.
    [18]          Suitably, the fixing member is located on a first side of the
          handing plate and the drive member is located on a second side of the
          handing plate.
    [19]          In some preferred embodiments, the handing plate has one or
          more teeth which engage one or more complementary recesses
          formed in a spigot of the handle which passes through the escutcheon.
    [20]          It is preferred that the handing plate is located on a first side of
          the drive member and the spring member is located on a second side
          of the drive member.

    [21]          Preferably, the fixing member substantially fixes, in the direction
          of the axis of the handle, the handing plate relative to the escutcheon.
    [22]         The fixing member is preferably a circlip.
    [23]         The fastener is preferably in the form of a screw.
    [24]          Preferably, the handle includes a spigot which is received
          through the escutcheon.
    [25]          In another form, the invention resides in a method of handing a
          handle mounting assembly, the method comprising the steps of:
                 rotating a handle from an unhanded position to a handed
          position, wherein rotating the handle rotates a handing plate mounted
          to the handle to a first position which at least partially aligns an
          aperture formed in the handing plate with an aperture formed in a
          biased drive member mounted to the handle; and
                 rotationally fastening the handing plate to the drive member
          using a fastener.
    [26]          Preferably, the handle is received in an escutcheon.
    [27]          Preferably, the biased drive member is a sprung drive member.
    [28]          Further features and advantages of the present invention will
          become apparent from the following detailed description.

          another handed configuration.
                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
    [35]          Elements of the invention are illustrated in concise outline form
          in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are necessary
          to understanding the embodiments of the present invention, but so as
          not to clutter the disclosure with excessive detail that will be obvious to
          those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the present description.
    [36]          FIG. 1 and 2 illustrate exploded views of a handle mounting
          assembly 10. The assembly 10 includes an escutcheon 100 with a
          handle 110, a biasing member in the form of an operating spring 120, a
          drive member 130, a handing plate 140, a handing plate shim 150, a
          fixing member in the form of a circlip 160 and a fastener in the form of a
          screw 170.
    [37]         The handle 110 is mounted within an aperture 102 of the
          escutcheon 100 (shown in FIG. 3) and is able to be turned or pivoted
3509423vl

                                           7
          about an axis running through the aperture 102 of the escutcheon 100.
          While not shown, the escutcheon 100 can also include a button for
          operating a snib mechanism, and an opening for receiving a key.
    [38]         The handle 110 includes a spigot 112 which passes through the
          aperture 102. The spigot 112 of the handle 110 has a circlip groove
          114 which receives the circlip 160 when assembled and a pair of slots
          116 which non-rotationally engage with a pair of inwardly facing teeth
          142 on the handing plate 140.
    [39]         The handing plate 140 also includes a protuberance 144 having
          an aperture 146 which aligns with one of two apertures 132, 133
          spaced approximately 1801 apart around the annulus of the drive
          member 130.
    [40]         With reference to FIG. 2, it can be seen that the drive member
          130 further includes two raised projections 134, 135 located on
          opposing edges of the drive member 130.
    [41]          In addition, the drive member 130 includes two cut outs 136,137
          located along the edge of the drive member 130 for locating the spring
          120.
    [42]         When assembled the drive member 130 is connected to the
          spring 120 via the cut outs 136 and 137 and the spring 120 also rests
          on spring stops 103 and 104 located on the escutcheon 100. The
          protuberance 144 rests upon either of the raised projections 134 or 135
    [43]         When the handle 110 receives an external torque to rotate it
          downward, the drive member 130 exerts a force on either raised
          projection 134 or 135 via the protuberance 144. As the drive member
3509423vl

                                           8
          130 is connected to the spring 120 via the cut outs 136, 137 and the
          spring 120 is also resting on spring stops 103 and 104, rotation of the
          handle 110, as shown in FIG. 4 and 5 for example, causes one of the
          spring 120 legs to lift from either spring stop 103 or spring stop 104
          thus biasing the handle 110 against rotation and trying to return the
          handle 110 to its rest position once the external torque on the handle
          110 is removed.
    [44]         The handle mounting assembly 10 is assembled with the
          aperture 146 of the protuberance 144 aligned with indicator 131 of the
          metal drive member 130 in the non-handed position, as shown in FIG.
          3.
    [45]         Before the handle mounting assembly 10 has been installed on
          a door (not shown), the handle 110 is rotated relative to the escutcheon
          100 in a direction, to the right, for example, the aperture 146 of the
          protuberance 144 rotates into alignment with aperture 133, such that
          the protuberance 144 rests against the raised projection 135. The
          desired handing configuration is then set by using the screw 170 to
          bias the protuberance 144 towards the raised projection 135 by the
          screw 170 having an interference fit with the left side of the aperture
          133, as shown in FIG. 4.
    [46]         Advantageously, if the drive member 130 and the handing plate
          140 have not yet been secured together, the handing configuration can
          be easily changed by simply rotating the handle 110 relative to the
          escutcheon 100 in the other direction. Alas, even if the drive member
          130 and the handing plate 140 have been secured, the screw 170 can
3509423vl

                                              9
          simply be loosened, the handle 110 rotated to the opposite position
          and the screw 170 can be re-tightened through aperture 146 of the
          protuberance 144 and aperture 132 of the drive member 130 securing
          the drive member 130 and the handing plate 140 together, as shown in
          FIG. 5.
    [47]          Advantageously,      the handing     configuration  of the handle
          mounting assembly 10 can be quickly and easily switched from one
          configuration to another with the use of basic everyday tools and using
          a method that can be easily worked out without the need to read
          laborious instructions. This also minimises the risk of damaging or
          breaking components of the assembly 10, such as the protuberance of
          the handing plate.
    [48]          In this specification, adjectives such as first and second, left and
          right, top and bottom, and the like may be used solely to distinguish
          one element or action from another element or action without
          necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order.
          Where the context permits, reference to an integer or a component or
          step (or the like) is not to be interpreted as being limited to only one of
          that integer, components, or step, but rather could be one or more of
          that integer, components, or step, etc.
    [49]          Further, in this specification, the terms 'comprises', 'comprising',
          'includes', 'including', or similar terms are intended to mean a non
          exclusive inclusion, such that a method, system, or apparatus that
          comprises a list of elements does not include those elements solely,
          but may well include other elements not listed.
