                                             TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]           This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2012316175, the originally
filed specification of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
[0001A]          Various exemplary embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to exercise
equipment. More specifically, the subject matter relates to portable exercise equipment to be
used in conjunction with a bed.
                                               BACKGROUND
[0002]           Home exercise is a regular activity practiced by many individuals using various
exercise equipment to enable stretching and cardiovascular, weight, and strength training, and
can be used for health and rehabilitation. While home exercise has enabled individuals to
exercise more consistently and with greater frequency, a continuing restraint to many
individuals has been the space requirements associated with home exercise equipment.
Individuals who occupy small or crowded spaces, such as hospitals, apartments, retirement
homes, and nursing homes, may not have proper room to conduct exercises correctly without
risking injury.
[0003]           In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to have exercise equipment that does
not require significant additional space inside a home. Specifically, it would be highly
desirable to have exercise equipment that used existing elements found in homes.
                                                  SUMMARY
[0004]           A brief summary of various exemplary embodiments is presented. Some
simplifications and omissions may be made in the following summary, which is intended to
highlight and introduce some aspects of the various exemplary embodiments, but not to limit
the scope of the invention. Detailed descriptions of a preferred exemplary embodiment
adequate to allow those of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the inventive concepts will
follow in the later sections.
[0005]           Various embodiments may relate to an exercise equipment assembly to be used with
a bed assembly. The exercise equipment assembly allows the attachment of one or more

exercise bands to enable users to perform various bodyweight exercises both on and around
the bed assembly. Various embodiments relate to an exercise bed assembly comprising a bed
comprising a mattress, with or without a support frame, and an exercise assembly fitted around
the circumference of the mattress, around the circumference of the support frame, or around
both the mattress and the support frame. Various embodiments include an exercise assembly
comprising a horizontal band having a length at least equal to the circumference of the bed
and/or the support frame. Some embodiments include a reinforcement piece connected to the
horizontal band, wherein the reinforcement piece extends from a first connection point on the
horizontal band under the mattress to a second connection point opposite the first connection
point.
[0006]          In other examples, any of the aspects above can include one or more of the
following features. In some embodiments, the exercise bed assembly can further include at
least one exercise loop connected to the horizontal band. In some embodiments, the exercise
bed assembly includes at least one hole in the horizontal band. This hole can be supported
with a grommet. In some embodiments, the reinforcement piece of the exercise bed assembly
comprises at least one reinforcement strap. In some embodiments, the horizontal band of the
exercise bed assembly further comprises a fastening means, such as a buckle and catch, or a
hook-and-loop fastener (e.g., a Velcro@ brand hook and loop fasteners), at each end of the
horizontal band.
[0007]          It should be apparent that, in this manner, various exemplary embodiments enable
the use of existing elements of a home to form an exercise assembly. Particularly, by enabling
the use of a bed assembly, a user can construct an exercise assembly without using a
significant amount of additional space inside a room.

                                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0019]       FIG. 1A shows an exemplary bed assembly 100, including a mattress 10, a support
frame 20, reinforcement straps 30, buckles 40, and horizontal band 50 that includes exercise
loops 52. In exemplary embodiments, the exercise assembly includes the horizontal band 50
along with a series of reinforcement straps 30 and buckles 40. In some embodiments, exercise
bands (not shown) can hook onto or loop around the exercise loops 52.
[0020]       The mattress 10 can be, for example, a mattress of a standard size, such as a twin,
twin extra long, full, queen, king, and California king mattress sizes. In some embodiments,
the bed assembly 100 can include the mattress 10 without the support frame 20 (e.g., when the
mattress is supported by the floor). The support frame 20 can be, for example, a frame with
support beams or slats, or a spring box (i.e., "box spring") that supports the mattress. In some
embodiments, the exercise assembly can be placed between the mattress 10 and the support
frame 20, as illustrated in the bed assembly 100. In other embodiments, the exercise assembly
can be placed between the support frame 20 and the floor (not shown). In the embodiment of
FIG. IA, as well as all subsequent embodiments described herein, and other embodiments that
one of skill in the art may contemplate based on the embodiments disclosed herein, horizontal
band 50 of the exercise assembly can wrap around the circumference of either the mattress 10,
or the support frame 20, or both the mattress 10 and the support frame 20 (e.g. the horizontal
band 50 can be wide enough to wrap both the mattress 10 and support frame 20 or the
horizontal band 50 can be in the form of a dual horizontal band system for purposes of
enabling exercise loops to be provided at different heights from the floor).
[0021]       The exercise assembly can include the horizontal band 50, reinforcement straps 30,
and buckles 40. In the embodiment of FIG. 1A, as well as all subsequent embodiments
described herein, and other embodiments that one of skill in the art may contemplate based on

the embodiments disclosed herein, the exercise assembly can include the horizontal band 50
with or without any reinforcement straps 30 or buckles 40. The horizontal band 50 can be a
support band made of a strong material, such as elastic, weaved nylon, or such other
applicable materials that would be known to a person of skill in the art. The material of the
horizontal band 50 can wrap around the circumference of the mattress 10 and/ or support
frame 20. In some embodiments, the horizontal band 50 can be of the same length as the
circumference of the mattress 10 and/or support frame 20 (e.g., the circumference of a twin,
twin extra long, full, queen, king, or California king-sized mattress or support frame). When
the horizontal band 50 has the same length as the circumference of the mattress 10 and/or
support frame 20, the horizontal band 50 can be made of a material like elastic to enable a user
to place the horizontal band 50 around the circumference of the mattress 10 and/or support
frame 20. The length of the horizontal band 50 can be sized to be equal to a standard mattress
size (and/or corresponding support frame), such as twin, twin extra long, full, queen, king, and
California king. In such instances, the horizontal band 50 fits snuggly against the mattress 10
and/ or support frame 20 with sufficient force to remain in place around the mattress 10 and/or
support frame 20 when the user exerts force on the horizontal band 50 via exercise bands or
other attached exercise equipment.
[0022]       In some embodiments, the length of the horizontal band 50 can be longer than the
circumference of the mattress 10 and/or support frame 20 when wrapped around said mattress
10 and/or support frame 20. In such instances, a single horizontal band 50 can be used for
multiple standard bed sizes (and their corresponding support frames), including, twin, twin
extra long, full, queen, king, and California king. In these embodiments, the horizontal band
50 can also have fastening means at its ends to ensure that the horizontal band 50 remains in
place around the mattress 10 and/or support frame 20 when the user exerts force on the
horizontal band 50 via exercise bands or other attached exercise equipment. For example, the
horizontal band 50 can include a buckle and catch (not shown) through which the user tightens
the horizontal band 50 once placed around the width of the mattress 10 and/or support frame
20. The horizontal band 50 can also include other fastening means, such as a clasp, buckle
trim, hook-and-loop fastener, or similar means familiar to those of skill in the art to ensure the
horizontal band 50 remains around the circumference of the mattress 10 or the support frame
20.

[0023]       The horizontal band 50 can also include exercise loops 52. In some embodiments,
the exercise loops 52 continuously line the length of the horizontal band 50. In some
embodiments, the exercise loops 52 are spaced apart in groups to allow the reinforcement
straps 30 to loop around the horizontal band 50 without covering the exercise loops 52. In
some embodiments, the exercise loops 52 can have different widths. In such instances, the
user can, for example, use exercise bands of different thicknesses or use connectors of varying
thickness by attaching the exercise band or connector to an exercise loop 52 of the proper
width. In some embodiments, the exercise band can be looped around a section of the entire
horizontal band 50. In some embodiments, the exercise loops 52 are made of the same material
as the horizontal band 50, such as elastic or nylon. In some embodiments, the exercise loops
52 are sewn onto the horizontal band 50. In some embodiments, the horizontal band 50 can
include other attachment points for the exercise band 60. For example, the horizontal band can
include other connectors (not shown), including, for example, 0-rings, D-rings, carabiners, or
other connectors known to a person of skill in the art. For example, in some embodiments, the
horizontal band 50 can include connectors made of the same material as the connectors 63, 65
used in the exercise band.
[0024]       FIG. lB illustrates another view of the exemplary bed assembly. FIG. lB illustrates
the underside of the mattress 10, including a series of parallel reinforcement straps 30 that
extend across the width of the mattress 10 and a series of parallel reinforcement straps 30' that
extend across the length of the mattress 10. The reinforcement straps 30, 30' can be made of
the same material as the horizontal band 50, including materials like elastic and nylon. In some
embodiments, the reinforcement straps can be made of a stronger, less flexible material than
the horizontal band 50, such as nylon webbing, ballistic nylon, and similar materials used for
strength. The reinforcement straps 30, 30' can be attached to the horizontal band 50 at two
different locations. For example, a widthwise reinforcement strap 30 can be attached at a first
location on the horizontal band 50, extend below the mattress 10, and be attached at a second
location on the horizontal band 50 at the opposite side of the mattress 10. Likewise, a
lengthwise reinforcement strap 30' can be attached at a first location on horizontal band 50,
extend below the mattress 10, and be attached at a second location on the horizontal band 50 at
the opposite side of the mattress 10. In some embodiments, the reinforcement straps 30, 30'
extend between the mattress 10 and the support frame 20. In other embodiments, the

reinforcement straps 30, 30' extend below the support frame 20.
[0025]        In some embodiments, the lattice created by the parallel reinforcement straps 30, 30'
can be created by the user when weaving the individual reinforcement straps 30, 30' through
each other. In some embodiments, the reinforcement straps 30, 30' can be sewn into a pattern,
such as the lattice illustrated in FIG. 1B. In other embodiments, the lattice can be created from
fewer pieces of material. For example, in some embodiments, the lattice can be created from a
single piece of material. Other methods of creating the lattice and similar patterns are known
to a person of skill in the art.
[0026]        In some embodiments, the reinforcement straps 30, 30' can also have buckles 40, as
illustrated in FIG. 1A. The user may tighten the reinforcement straps 30, 30' through the use of
the buckles 40 in order to secure the horizontal band 50 against the mattress 10. In other
embodiments, the reinforcement straps 30, 30' can also have other types of tightening means.
This can include, for example, other types of buckles or hook-and-loop fasteners.
[0027]        In some embodiments, the user can first place the reinforcement straps 30, 30'under
the mattress 10, then weave the horizontal band 50 through the ends of the reinforcement
straps 30, 30' created by the buckles 40. The user can then tighten the horizontal band 50 using
the tightening means at the end of the horizontal band 50. Once the horizontal band is
tightened, the user can then tighten the reinforcement straps 30, 30' using the buckles 40. In
other embodiments, the user can first place the horizontal band 50 around the mattress 10
before looping the ends of the reinforcement straps 30, 30' around locations of the horizontal
band 50.
[0028]        FIG. 2A illustrates another exemplary bed assembly 200, including a mattress 10, a
support frame 20, reinforcement straps 30, horizontal band 50, exercise loops 52, and exercise
bands 60. The bed assembly 200 is similar to the bed assembly 100 of FIG. 1A. In addition,
the bed assembly 200 further has a series of exercise bands 60. The exercise bands 60 can
either be single-ended exercise bands that are attached to an exercise loop 52 on the horizontal
band 50 through a connector, or can be double-ended exercise bands with handles on each end,
with the exercise band weaved through an exercise loop 52. In the illustrative embodiment, for
example, the reinforcement piece includes reinforcement straps 30 that are affixed directly to
the horizontal band 50 (e.g., by sewing) to make its connection. In other embodiments, the
reinforcement straps can be formed as a unitary piece, or bonded through other methods (e.g.,

example, other types of buckles or hook-and-loop fasteners.
[0029]        FIG. 2B illustrates an exemplary single-ended exercise band 60, including
stretching band 61, connectors 63, 65, handle attachment 67, and handle 69. The stretching
band 61 can be made of a material like elastic, rubber, or similar stretching material to provide
resistance to a user when moved during an exercise. In some embodiments, the exercise band
60 can be a double ended exercise band. In such instances, the stretching band 61 can have no
attachments on its ends, or handles 69 with handle attachments 67 attached at each end. In
other embodiments, the exercise band 60 can be a single-ended exercise band. In such
instances, the exercise band 60 can have a connector 65 at one end to connect the stretching
band to the exercise loop 52. The exercise band can also have a connector 63 to connect the
stretching band 61 to a handle 69 via a handle attachment 67. In some embodiments, the
connectors 63, 65 and the handle attachment 67 are made of the same material, such as a
strong metal like steel. The connectors 63, 65 and handle attachment 67 can be loops with
openings like carabiners (with either a spring or a screwed gate), where the loop is closed
during exercise and open to allow attachment or detachment.
[0030]        FIG. 3 illustrates a side view of an exemplary bed assembly 300 including
horizontal band 50 with reinforcement straps 32. In the bed assembly 300, the mattress 10 has
the horizontal band 50 including exercise loops 52 fitted around its circumference, while the
reinforcement straps 32 extend below the mattress 10. In the illustrative embodiment, the
reinforcement straps 32 include one or more adjustment loops through which the horizontal
band 50 is weaved. The adjustment loops on the reinforcement straps 32 allow the user to
specify the vertical placement of the horizontal strap 50 around the mattress, and adjust the
tension in the reinforcement straps 32 to fit the mattress, as the user weaves the horizontal
strap 50 through the loops of the series of reinforcement straps 32. The adjustment loops of the
reinforcement straps 32 along with horizontal band 50 with tightening means can be used as
an exercise assembly that fits a wide range of bed sizes and bed heights.
[0031]        FIG. 4 illustrates another exemplary bed assembly 400, including a mattress 10, a
support frame 20, a horizontal band 50 with exercise loops 52, reinforcement straps 30, and
reinforcement corner straps 34. The bed assembly 400 is similar to the bed assembly 100 of
FIGS. IA and 1B. The reinforcement straps 30, 34 create a diamond pattern under the mattress

 10 (shown in FIG. 4 with dotted lines). Reinforcement corner strap 34 is split around the
corner of the mattress 10, but reforms as a single strap under the mattress 10, extending
diagonally under the mattress 10 to the opposite corner. The diamond pattern secures the
horizontal band 50 while using fewer reinforcement straps for support.
[0032]             FIG. 5 illustrates another exemplary bed assembly 500, including a mattress 10, a
support frame 20, and an exercise frame 54 with exercise loops 52. In the illustrative
embodiment, the exercise frame 54 includes the horizontal band and a reinforcement sheet
connected to the horizontal band. The reinforcement sheet can be attached at a first side of the
horizontal band, extend below the mattress 10, and be attached at a second side on the
horizontal band at the opposite side of the mattress 10. In some embodiments, the exercise
frame 54 can be sized to the dimensions of a standard mattress and may be made of a material
like elastic to be placed around the mattress 10. In other embodiments, a portion of the
exercise frame 54 (e.g., a corner) can include tightening means (not shown) to tighten the sides
of the exercise frame 54 once placed around the mattress 10. In the embodiment of FIG. 5, as
well as all other embodiments described herein, and further embodiments that one of skill in
the art may contemplate based on the embodiments disclosed herein, the bed assembly can
include the exercise frame 54 with or without a reinforcement sheet, and the exercise frame 54
may be wrapped around the mattress 10, the support frame 20, or both the mattress 10 and
support frame 20.
[0033]             FIG. 6 illustrates a side view of another exemplary bed assembly 600 including
horizontal band 50 and holes 56 with reinforcement grommets 58. In the bed assembly 600,
the mattress 10 has the horizontal band 50 including holes 56 fitted around its circumference.
In the illustrative embodiment, holes 56 each include a reinforcement grommet 58. This
reinforcement grommet 58 can maintain support for the hole 56 when either a reinforcement
strap 30 (not shown) or exercise band 60 is connected to it. The grommet 58 can be made of
supportive material, such as metal, rubber, or plastic. The holes 56 can provide connection
points on the horizontal band 50, while the grommets 58 can be added to the holes 56 to
prevent tearing or abrasion of the horizontal band 50 in locations near the holes 56.
[0034]             FIG. 7A illustrates another exemplary bed assembly, including a mattress 10, a
support frame 20, a horizontal band 50 with reinforcement straps 30, holes 56, and support
grommets 58. The bed assembly also includes single-ended restraint bands 60 with cuffs 70

attached to the user on the mattress 10. In some embodiments, the holes 56 on the horizontal
band 50 can be replaced with other points of connection, such as exercise loops 52 illustrated
in FIG. 1. In comparison with the bed assembly 200, the bed assembly 700 has been modified
with restraint bands 60 that at least partially immobilize a user. In some embodiments, the user
may have one or more parts of the body restrained using one or more restraint bands 60
connected to the cuffs 70 fitting the applicable body part. In the illustrative embodiment, for
example, the user is restrained at four limbs using four restraint bands 60 with four fitting
cuffs 70 to the point that he is effectively immobilized. In other embodiments, the material of
restraint bands 60 and/or the length of the restraint bands 60 can be chosen and/or modified to
allow the user to have a wider range of motion while restrained by the cuffs 70. In some
embodiments, other attachments (not shown) can be attached to the horizontal band 50, for
example, through attachment through holes 56 for engagement with the user. For example,
other devices can be anchored to the horizontal band 50 to be connected, further constrain, or
to further engage the user while the user is restrained.
[0035]        FIG. 7B illustrates an exemplary single-ended restraint band 60 that includes
flexible band 61, connectors 63, 65, handle attachment 67, and cuff 70. Single-ended restraint
band 60 is similar to the single ended exercise band 60 of FIG. 2B, though the restraint band
60 is configured with the primary purpose of at least partially immobilizing the user instead of
enabling the user to engage in resistance exercises. For example, the flexible band 61 can be
made from a wider range of materials than the stretching band 61, as the flexible band can be
made from flexible, non-stretching materials (e.g., leather) and similar materials known to a
person of skill in the art. Similarly, the handle 69 of the exercise band 60 in FIG. 2B has been
replaced with cuff 70, which fits around the body part of the user. Cuff 70 can be made of
material such as cloth, leather, metal, nylon, elastic, or similar material to fit around a body
part of the user. Other types of user restraints to be connected to the restraint band 60 will be
known to a person of skill in the art. Depending on the preference of the user, the type of cuff
70 can be chosen for the comfort of the user. For example, in some embodiments, the cuffs 70
can be made of a soft material with easier closing mechanisms, such as a buckle closure. In
other embodiments, the cuffs can be made of more rigid material, such as metal cuffs, and
include locks as closing mechanisms (i.e., a key lock). In some embodiments, one user can
place a body part within the cuff 70 and engage the closing mechanism. In some
