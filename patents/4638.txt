10                                            BACKGROUND
   100021       The occurrence of undesirable vegetation, e.g., weeds, is a constant problem
   facing famers in crops, pasture, and other settings. Weeds compete with crops and negatively
   impact crop yield. The use of chemical herbicides is an important tool in controlling
   undesirable vegetation.
15 [00031       There remains a need for new chemical herbicides that offer a broader spectrum of
   weed control, selectivity, minimal crop damage, storage stability, ease of handling, higher
   activity against weeds, and/or a means to address herbicide-tolerance that develops with
   respect to herbicides currently in use.

   [0005]       Also provided are methods of controlling undesirable vegetation comprising
   (a) contacting the undesirable vegetation or area adjacent to the undesirable vegetation, or
   (b) pre-emergently contacting soil or water, a herbicidally effective amount of at least one
15 compound of Formula (I) or agriculturally acceptable derivative (e.g., agriculturally
   acceptable salts, solvates, hydrates, esters, amides, N-oxides, or other derivatives) thereof.
                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0006]       As used herein, herbicide and herbicidal active ingredient mean a compound that
20 controls undesirable vegetation when applied in an appropriate amount.
   [0007]       As used herein, control of or controlling undesirable vegetation means killing or
   preventing the vegetation, or causing some other adversely modifying effect to the
   vegetation e.g., deviations from natural growth or development, regulation, desiccation,
   retardation, and the like.
25 [0008]       As used herein, a herbicidally effective or vegetation controlling amount is an
   amount of herbicidal active ingredient the application of which controls the relevant
   undesirable vegetation.
   [0009]       As used herein, applying a herbicide or herbicidal composition means delivering
   it directly to the targeted vegetation or to the locus thereof or to the area where control of
                                                     -4-

   undesired vegetation is desired. Methods of application include, but are not limited to, pre
   emergently contacting soil or water, or post-emergently contacting the undesirable
   vegetation or area adjacent to the undesirable vegetation.
   [0010]       As used herein, plants and vegetation include, but are not limited to, dormant
 5 seeds, germinant seeds, emerging seedlings, plants emerging from vegetative propagules,
   immature vegetation, and established vegetation.
   [0011]       As used herein, agriculturally acceptable salts and esters refer to salts and esters
   that exhibit herbicidal activity, or that are or can be converted in plants, water, or soil to the
   referenced herbicide. Exemplary agriculturally acceptable esters are those that are or can be
10 hydrolyzed, oxidized, metabolized, or otherwise converted, e.g., in plants, water, or soil, to
   the corresponding carboxylic acid which, depending on the pH, may be in the dissociated or
   undissociated form.
   [0012]        Suitable salts include those derived from alkali or alkaline earth metals and those
   derived from ammonia and amines. Preferred cations include sodium, potassium,
15 magnesium, and aminium cations of the formula:
                                             R13 R14     16N+
   wherein R , R , R15 and R16 each, independently represents hydrogen or Ci-C 1 2 alkyl,
   C 3-C1 2 alkenyl, or C3-C1 2 alkynyl, each of which is optionally substituted by one or more
   substituents such as hydroxy, Ci-C 4 alkoxy, Ci-C 4 alkylthio, or phenyl groups, provided that
     13   14
   R , R , R and Rio are sterically compatible. Additionally, any two R , R 14 , R 156 and Rio
                11613
20
   together may represent an aliphatic difunctional moiety containing one to twelve carbon
   atoms and up to two oxygen or sulfur atoms. Salts of the compounds of Formula (I) can be
   prepared by treatment of compounds of Formula (I) with a metal hydroxide, such as sodium
   hydroxide, with an amine, such as ammonia, trimethylamine, diethanolamine, 2-methyl
25 thiopropylamine, bisallylamine, 2-butoxyethylamine, morpholine, cyclododecylamine, or
   benzylamine, or with a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, such as tetramethylammonium
   hydroxide or choline hydroxide. Amine salts of compounds of Formula (I) are useful forms
   or derivatives of compounds of Formula (I) because they are water-soluble and lend them
   selves to the preparation of desirable aqueous based herbicidal compositions.
30 [0013]       Other forms or derivatives of compounds of the Formula (I) include N-oxides of
   compounds of Formula (I). Pyridine N-oxides can be obtained by oxidation of the
   corresponding pyridines. Suitable oxidation methods are described, for example, in
                                                    -5-

   METHODS OF PREPARING THE COMPOUNDS
   [00127]      Exemplary procedures to synthesize the compounds of Formula (I) are provided
   below.
   [00128]      The 3,5-disubstituted-4-amino-6-(optionally substituted phenyl)picolinic acids of
 5 Formula (I) can be prepared in a number of ways. As depicted in Scheme I, the 4-amino-6
   chloropicolinates of Formula (II) can be converted to the 4-amino-6-substituted-picolinates
   of Formula (III), wherein Ar is as herein defined, via Suzuki coupling with a boronic acid or
   ester, in the presence of a base, such as potassium fluoride, and a catalyst, such as
   bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) dichloride, in a polar, protic solvent mixture, such as
10 acetonitrile-water, at a temperature, such as 110 'C, e.g., in a microwave reactor (reaction
   a,). 4-Amino-6-substituted-picolinates of Formula (III) can be transformed into the 5-iodo
   4-amino-6-substituted-picolinates of Formula (IV) via a reaction with iodinating reagents,
   such as periodic acid and iodine, in a polar, protic solvent, such as methyl alcohol (reaction
   bl). Stille coupling of the 5-iodo-4-amino-6-substituted-picolinates of Formula (IV) with a
15 stannane, such as tetramethyltin, in the presence of a catalyst, such as
   bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) dichloride, in a non-reactive solvent, such as 1,2
   dichloroethane, at a temperature, such as 120-130 'C, e.g., in a microwave reactor, provides
   5-(substituted)-4-amino-6-substituted-picolinates of Formula (I-A), wherein Z1 is alkyl,
   alkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkenyl and alkylthio (reaction ci).
20 [00129]      Alternatively, 4-amino-6-chloropicolinates of Formula (II) can be transformed
   into the 5-iodo-4-amino-6-chloropicolinates of Formula (V) via a reaction with iodinating
   reagents, such as periodic acid and iodine, in a polar, protic solvent, such as methyl alcohol
   (reaction b2 ). Stille coupling of the 5-iodo-4-amino-6-chloropicolinates of Formula (V) with
   a stannane, such as tetramethyltin, in the presence of a catalyst, such as
25 bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) dichloride, in a non-reactive solvent, such as 1,2
   dichloroethane, at a temperature, such as 120-130 'C, e.g., in a microwave reactor, provides
   5-(substituted)-4-amino-6-chloropicolinates of Formula (VI), wherein Z1 is alkyl, alkenyl,
   alkynyl, haloalkenyl and alkylthio (reaction   C2). The 5-substituted-4-amino-6
   chloropicolinates of Formula (VI) can be converted to the 5-substituted-4-amino-6
30 substituted-picolinates of Formula (I-A), wherein Ar is as herein defined, via Suzuki
   coupling with a boronic acid or ester, in the presence of a base, such as potassium fluoride,
   and a catalyst, such as bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) dichloride, in a polar, protic
                                                  -39-

   solvent mixture, such as acetonitrile-water, at a temperature, such as 110 'C, e.g., in a
   microwave reactor (reaction a2).

 5 [00130]      As depicted in Scheme II, the 4,5,6-trichloropicolinate of Formula (VII) can be
   converted to the corresponding isopropyl ester of Formula (VIII), via a reaction with
   isopropyl alcohol and concentrated sulfuric acid, e.g., at reflux temperature under Dean
   Stark conditions (reaction d). The isopropyl ester of Formula (VIII) can be reacted with a
   fluoride ion source, such as cesium fluoride, in a polar, aprotic solvent, such as dimethyl
10 sulfoxide (DMSO), at a temperature, such as 80 'C, under Dean-Stark conditions, to yield
   the isopropyl 4,5,6-trifluoropicolinate of Formula (IX) (reaction e). The isopropyl 4,5,6
   trifluoropicolinate of Formula (IX) can be aminated with a nitrogen source, such as
   ammonia, in a polar, aprotic solvent, such as DMSO, to produce a 4-amino-5,6
   difluoropicolinate of Formula (X) reactionnf. The fluoro substituent in the 6-position of the
15 4-amino-5,6-difluoropicolinate of Formula (X) can be exchanged with a chloro substituent
   by treatment with a chloride source, such as hydrogen chloride, e.g., in dioxane, in a Parr
   reactor, at a temperature, such as 100 'C, to produce a 4-amino-5-fluoro-6-chloro-picolinate
   of Formula (XI) (reaction g). The 4-amino-5-fluoro-6-chloropicolinate of Formula (XI) can
   be transesterified to the corresponding methyl ester of Formula (XII) by reaction with
20 titanium(IV) isopropoxide in methyl alcohol at reflux temperature (reaction h).

   Example A. Evaluation of Postemergent Herbicidal Activity
   [00355]     Post-Emergent Test I: Seeds of test species were obtained from commercial
 5 suppliers and planted into a 13 centimeter (cm) diameter-round pot containing soil-less
   media mix (Metro-Mix 360*, Sun Gro Horticulture). Postemergence treatments were
   planted 8-12 days (d) prior to application and cultured in a greenhouse equipped with
   supplemental light sources to provide a 16 hour (h) photoperiod at 24-29 'C. All pots were
   surface irrigated.
10 [00356]     A weighted amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each
   compound was dissolved in 1.3 mL acetone-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 97:3, volume per
   volume (v/v)) and diluted with 4.1 mL water-isopropanol-crop oil concentrate (78:20:2,
   v/v/v) containing 0.02% Triton X-155 to obtain concentrated stock solutions. Additional
   application rates were obtained by serial dilution of the high rate solution into a solution
15 containing appropriate volume of 97:3 v/v mixture of acetone and DMSO and appropriate
   volume of an aqueous mixture of water, isopropyl alcohol, crop oil concentrate (78:20:2,
   v/v/v) containing 0.02% Triton X-155.
   [00357]     Formulated compounds were applied using a DeVilbiss@ compressed air sprayer
   at 2-4 pounds per square inche (psi). Following treatment, pots were returned to the
20 greenhouse for the duration of the experiment. All pots were sub-irrigated as need to
   provide optimum growing conditions. All pots were fertilized one time per week by
   subirrigating with Peters Peat-Lite Special fertilizer (20-10-20).

  [00358]     Phytotoxicity ratings were obtained 10 days after treatment postemergence
  applications. All evaluations were made visually on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 represents
  no activity and 100 represents complete plant death and is presented as indicated in Table A.

   Example B. Evaluation of Preemergent Herbicidal Activity
   [00360]     Pre-Emergent Test I: Seeds of test species were planted into round plastic pots
   (5-inch diameter) containing sandy loam soil. After planting, all pots were sub-irrigated 16 h
   prior to compound application.
 5 [00361]     Compounds were dissolved in a 97:3 v/v mixture of acetone and DMSO and
   diluted to the appropriate concentration in a final application solution containing water,
   acetone, isopropanol, DMSO and Agri-dex (crop oil concentrate) in a 59:23:15:1.0:1.5 v/v
   ratio and 0.02% w/v (weight/volume) of Triton X-155 to obtain the spray solution
   containing the highest application rate. Additional application rates were obtained by serial
10 dilution of the high rate solution with the above application solution.
   [00362]     Formulated compound (2.7 mL) was pipetted evenly over the soil surface
   followed by incorporation with water (15 mL). Following treatment, pots were returned to
   the greenhouse for the duration of the experiment. The greenhouse was programmed for an
   approximate 15 h photoperiod which was maintained at about 23-29'C during the day and
15 22-28'C during the night. Nutrients and water were added on a regular basis through
   surface irrigation and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000
   Watt lamps as necessary.
   [00363]     Herbicidal effect ratings were obtained 14 days after treatment. All evaluations
   were made relative to appropriate controls on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 represents no
20 herbicidal effect and 100 represents plant death or lack of emergence from the soil and is
   presented as indicated in Table A. Some of the compounds tested, application rates
   employed, plant species tested, and results are given in Table 4.

   Example C. Evaluation of Postemergent Herbicidal Activity
   [00364]     Post-Emergent Test II: Seeds or nutlets of the desired test plant species were
   planted in Sun Gro Metro-Mix 360 planting mixture, which typically has a pH of 6.0 to 6.8
   and an organic matter content of about 30 percent, in plastic pots with a surface area of 64
 5 square centimeters. When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a
   fungicide treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied. The plants
   were grown for 7-21 d in a greenhouse with an approximate 15 h photoperiod which was
   maintained at about 23-29 'C during the day and 22-28 'C during the night. Nutrients and
   water were added on a regular basis and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead
10 metal halide 1000-Watt lamps as necessary. The plants were employed for testing when
   they reached the first or second true leaf stage.
   [00365]     A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each test
   compound was placed in a 25 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 4 mL of a 97:3 v/v mixture
   of acetone and DMSO to obtain concentrated stock solutions. If the test compound did not
15 dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated. The concentrated stock
   solutions obtained were diluted with 20 mL of an aqueous mixture containing acetone,
   water, isopropyl alcohol, DMSO, Atplus 41 IF crop oil concentrate, and Triton@ X-155
   surfactant in a 48.5:39:10:1.5:1.0:0.02 v/v ratio to obtain spray solutions containing the
   highest application rates. Additional application rates were obtained by serial dilution of 12
20 mL of the high rate solution into a solution containing 2 mL of 97:3 v/v mixture of acetone
   and DMSO and 10 mL of an aqueous mixture containing acetone, water, isopropyl alcohol,
   DMSO, Atplus 41 IF crop oil concentrate, and Triton X-155 surfactant in a
   48.5:39:10:1.5:1.0:0.02 v/v ratio to obtain 1/2X, 1/4X, 1/8X and 1/16X rates of the high rate.
   Compound requirements are based upon a 12 mL application volume at a rate of 187 liters
25 per hectare (L/ha). Formulated compounds were applied to the plant material with an
   overhead Mandel track sprayer equipped with 8002E nozzles calibrated to deliver 187 L/ha
   over an application area of 0.503 square meters at a spray height of 18 inches (43 cm) above
   the average plant canopy height. Control plants were sprayed in the same manner with the
   solvent blank.
30 [00366]     The treated plants and control plants were placed in a greenhouse as described
   above and watered by subirrigation to prevent wash-off of the test compounds. After 14 d,
   the condition of the test plants as compared with that of the untreated plants was determined
   visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100
   corresponds to complete kill and is presented as indicated in Table A. Some of the

   Example D. Evaluation of Postemergent Herbicidal Activity in Wheat and Barley
   [00367]      Post-Emergent Test III. Seeds of the desired test plant species were planted in Sun
   Gro MetroMix* 306 planting mixture, which typically has a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 and an organic
   matter content of about 30 percent, in plastic pots with a surface area of 103.2 square
 5 centimeters (cm 2). When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide
   treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied. The plants were grown
   for 7-36 d in a greenhouse with an approximate 14 h photoperiod which was maintained at
   about 18 'C during the day and 17 'C during the night. Nutrients and water were added on a
   regular basis and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000-Watt
10 lamps as necessary. The plants were employed for testing when they reached the second or
   third true leaf stage.
   [00368]      A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each test
   compound was placed in a 25 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 4 mL of a 97:3 v/v mixture
   of acetone and DMSO to obtain concentrated stock solutions. If the test compound did not
15 dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated. The concentrated stock solutions
   obtained were diluted with 20 mL of an aqueous mixture containing acetone, water, isopropyl
   alcohol, DMSO, Agri-Dex crop oil concentrate, and X-77 surfactant in a
   48:39:10:1.5:1.5:0.02 v/v ratio to obtain spray solutions containing the highest application
   rates. Additional application rates were obtained by serial dilution of 12 mL of the high rate
20 solution into a solution containing 2 mL of 97:3 v/v mixture of acetone and DMSO and 10
   mL of an aqueous mixture containing acetone, water, isopropyl alcohol, DMSO, Agri-Dex
   crop oil concentrate, and X-77 surfactant in a 48:39:10:1.5:1.5:0.02 v/v ratio to obtain 1/2X,
   1/4X, 1/8X and 1/16X rates of the high rate. Compound requirements are based upon a 12
   mL application volume at a rate of 187 liters per hectare (L/ha). Formulated compounds
25 were applied to the plant material with an overhead Mandel track sprayer equipped with
   8002E nozzles calibrated to deliver 187 L/ha over an application area of 0.503 square meters
   at a spray height of 18 inches (43 cm) above the average plant canopy height. Control plants
   were sprayed in the same manner with the solvent blank.
   [00369]      The treated plants and control plants were placed in a greenhouse as described
30 above and watered by subirrigation to prevent wash-off of the test compounds. After 21 d,
   the condition of the test plants as compared with that of the untreated plants was determined
   visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100
   corresponds to complete kill and is presented as indicated in Table A.
                                                  -249-

   [00370]     By applying the well-accepted probit analysis as described by J. Berkson in
   Journalof the American StatisticalSociety, 48, 565 (1953) and by D. Finney in "Probit
   Analysis" Cambridge University Press (1952), herbicidal injury of a specific compound at
   various rates can be used to calculate GR 20 , GR50 , GRso and GR 90 values, which are defined
 5 as growth reduction factors that correspond to the effective dose of herbicide required to
   provide plant growth reduction (GR) of 20 percent, 50 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent,
   respectively. Probit analysis was applied to data collected from multiple dose rates of
   individual compounds utilizing the procedures explained in the following examples. The
   data for some of the dose rates and analysis of all of the dose rates are captured in the
10 following tables.
   [00371]     Some of the compounds tested, application rates employed, plant species tested,
   and results are given in Tables 7 through 11.

   Example E. Evaluation of Preemergent Herbicidal Activity
   [00372]     Pre-Emergent Test III. Seeds of test species were planted into square plastic pots
   (10 cm wide) containing sandy loam soil. After planting, all pots were sub-irrigated 16 h
   prior to compound application.
15 [00373]     A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each test
   compound was placed in a 25 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 4 mL of a 97:3 v/v mixture
   of acetone and DMSO to obtain concentrated stock solutions. If the test compound did not
   dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated. The concentrated stock solutions
   obtained were diluted with 20 mL of an aqueous mixture containing water and 0.02% w/v
20 (weight/volume) of Triton X-155 to obtain spray solutions containing the highest application
   rates. Additional application rates were obtained by serial dilution of 12 mL of the high rate
   solution into a solution containing 2 mL of 97:3 v/v mixture of acetone and DMSO and 10
   mL of an aqueous mixture containing water and 0.02% w/v (weight/volume) of Triton X- 155
   to obtain 1/2X, 1/4X, 1/8X and 1/16X rates of the high rate. Compound requirements are
25 based upon a 12 mL application volume at a rate of 187 liters per hectare (L/ha). Formulated
   compounds were applied to the soil surface with an overhead Mandel track sprayer equipped
   with 8002E nozzles calibrated to deliver 187 L/ha over an application area of 0.503 square
   meters. Control pots were sprayed in the same manner with the solvent blank.
   [00374]     The treated pots and control pots were placed in a greenhouse as described above
30 and watered through surface irrigation. After 21 d, the condition of the test pots as compared
   with that of the untreated pots was determined visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100
   percent where 0 corresponds to no herbicidal effect and 100 corresponds to plant death or
   lack of emergence from the soil and is presented as indicated in Table A.

   [00375]     By applying the well-accepted probit analysis as described by J. Berkson in
   Journalof the American StatisticalSociety, 48, 565 (1953) and by D. Finney in "Probit
   Analysis" Cambridge University Press (1952), herbicidal injury of a specific compound at
   various rates can be used to calculate GR 20 , GR50 , GRso and GR 90 values, which are defined
 5 as growth reduction factors that correspond to the effective dose of herbicide required to
   provide plant growth reduction (GR) of 20 percent, 50 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent,
   respectively. Probit analysis was applied to data collected from multiple dose rates of
   individual compounds utilizing the procedures explained in the following examples. The data
   for some of the dose rates and analysis of all of the dose rates are captured in the following
10 tables.
   [00376]     Some of the compounds tested, application rates employed, plant species tested,
   and results are given in Table 12.

   Example F. Evaluation of Postemergence Herbicidal Activity in Direct Seeded Rice
   [00377]     Seeds or nutlets of the desired test plant species were planted in a soil matrix
   prepared by mixing a loam soil (43 percent silt, 19 percent clay, and 38 percent sand, with a
   pH of about 8.1 and an organic matter content of about 1.5 percent) and river sand in an 80 to
20 20 ratio. The soil matrix was contained in plastic pots with a surface area of 139.7 cm2
                                                  -273-

   When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide treatment and/or
   other chemical or physical treatment was applied. The plants were grown for 10-17 d in a
   greenhouse with an approximate 14-h photoperiod which was maintained at about 29 'C
   during the day and 26 'C during the night. Nutrients and water were added on a regular basis
 5 and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000-Watt lamps as
   necessary. The plants were employed for testing when they reached the second or third true
   leaf stage.
   [00378]     A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each test
   compound was placed in 25 mL glass vials and dissolved in a volume of 97:3 v/v acetone
10 DMSO to obtain 12X stock solutions. If the test compound did not dissolve readily, the
   mixture was warmed and/or sonicated. The concentrated stock solutions were added to the
   spray solutions so that the final acetone and DMSO concentrations were 16.2% and 0.5%,
   respectively. Spray solutions were diluted to the appropriate final concentrations with the
   addition of 10 mL of an aqueous mixture of 1.5% (v/v) Agri-dex crop oil concentrate. The
15 final spray solutions contained 1.25% (v/v) Agri-dex crop oil concentrate. Compound
   requirements are based upon a 12 mL application volume at a rate of 187 L/ha. Formulated
   compounds were applied to the plant material with an overhead Mandel track sprayer
   equipped with 8002E nozzles calibrated to deliver 187 L/ha over an application area of 0.503
   square meters (m2 ) at a spray height of 18 inches (43 cm) above average plant canopy height.
20 Control plants were sprayed in the same manner with the solvent blank.
   [00379]     The treated plants and control plants were placed in a greenhouse as described
   above and watered by sub-irrigation to prevent wash-off of the test compounds. After 20-22
   d, the condition of the test plants, compared with that of the untreated plants, was determined
   visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100
25 corresponds to complete kill and is presented as indicated in Table A.
   [00380]     By applying the well-accepted probit analysis as described by J. Berkson in
   Journalof the American StatisticalSociety, 48, 565 (1953) and by D. Finney in "Probit
   Analysis" Cambridge University Press (1952), herbicidal injury of a specific compound at
   various rates can be used to calculate GR 20 , GR50 , GRso and GR 90 values, which are defined
30 as growth reduction factors that correspond to the effective dose of herbicide required to
   provide plant growth reduction (GR) of 20 percent, 50 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent,
   respectively. Probit analysis was applied to data collected from multiple dose rates of
   individual compounds utilizing the procedures explained in the following examples. The
                                                  -274-

data for some of the dose rates and analysis of all of the dose rates is captured in the
following tables.
[00381]     Some of the application rates and ratios employed, plant species tested, and results
are given in Table 13.
