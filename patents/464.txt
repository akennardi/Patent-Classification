            Integrated Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy Device
Technical Field
   The present disclosure relates to the technical field of medical devices, and
in particular to an integrated negative-pressure wound therapy device for
wound healing treatment.
Background Art
   1. With the development of society and the improvement of people's living
standards, there are an increasing variety of wounds, such as diabetic foot,
lower extremity venous ulcers, pressure ulcers caused by long-term bed rest,
localized ulcers caused by peripheral arterial diseases, burn wounds, and
wounds caused by surgery. Although medicine has been greatly developed
nowadays, the treatment of wound healing remains a challenge. There are
many causes of wound disunion, such as circulatory factors, nutritional factors,
neurohumoral factors, etc. At present, the commonly used methods for wound
healing treatment mainly include negative pressure sealing technique,
localized oxygen therapy, and ozone therapy.
   2. Negative-pressure drainage technology serves for sufficient cleaning and
drainage of a wound by forming a localized completely-closed environment at
the wound and then performing continuous negative pressure suction, so as to
promote the growth of new blood vessels and granulation tissues, prevent
collagen which has been already partially damaged from being further
denatured and removed, remove harmful substances exuded to the surface of
the wound, prevent or reduce further exudation from the wound and around the
wound, and provide a sealed and moist space to facilitate the repair of the
wound, promote the proliferation and migration of epithelial cells, and finally
achieve the purpose of promoting wound healing. However, therapeutic effects
on some wounds are poor still. In addition, many chronic and refractory
wounds are considered to be associated with nutrient deficiency, and energy,
carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, trace elements, and mineral metabolism
all affect the progress of wound healing, and therefore essential nutrient
supplementation is indispensable auxiliary means.
   3. The oxygen therapy can increase oxygen supply to the tissue to
accelerate the proliferation of local cells and enhance tissue repair capability,
and at the same time can widen capillaries at the wound, decrease the blood
flow resistance, accelerate the blood flow rate, reduce tissue exudation,
alleviate swelling, and thus accelerate wound healing. Oxygen has an
inhibitory effect on both Gram-negative and positive bacteria, thereby
preventing or reducing local infection.

   4. The ozone therapy has a strong ability to sterilize all types of bacteria, can
wash a wound or the surface of the wound, and can penetrate deep into the
wound to kill pathogens in deep tissues. Ozone can improve microcirculation
and hemorheology, promote the opening of capillaries, improve capillary
permeability, alleviate exudation and edema, accelerate the capillary blood
flow rate, reduce the phenomenon of aggregation of erythrocytes and platelets,
decrease the filtration of erythrocytes, increase elasticity, accelerate the blood
flow rate, decrease blood viscosity and erythrocyte coherency, and increase
oxygen supply to the tissues, and thus has positive effects on the improvement
of the nutrition/metabolism/repair and functions of the tissues.
   5. Localized nutritional therapy: in the early stage of negative-pressure
drainage, loss of nutritional ingredients at a wound is caused due to the
drainage, which is very unfavorable to wound healing, and if the nutrient
elements are not timely supplemented, it will lead to malnutrition, low immunity,
and an infection that is difficult to control. Since patients with chronic wounds
are often accompanied by pantatrophia, such as diabetes, radioactive
damages or long-term loss of proteins, the supplementation of nutrients is
particularly important. While being supplemented by diet and intravenous
infusion, nutrients can be supplemented directly at a portion of the wound so
as to supply high nutrients to cells at the portion of the wound to accelerate the
proliferation of fibroblasts and increase collagen deposition, to support rapid
healing of the wound.
   6. The above four methods are all used alone clinically, there is no combined
therapy device product on the market, and some patients need to be treated
using several methods and devices alternately, and need to use several
products with a single function separately, which not only increases the pain of
the patients, but also increases the workload of medical staffs.
