                                             ABSTRACT
           The present disclosure relates to manipulating a user interface on a wearable
  electronic device using a mechanical crown. In some examples, the user interface can be
  scaled in response to a rotation of the crown. The direction of the scaling and the amount of
5 scaling can depend on the direction and amount of rotation of the crown, respectively. In
  some examples, the amount of scaling can be proportional to the change in rotation angle of
  the crown. In other examples, a speed of scaling can depend on a speed of angular rotation of
  the crown. In these examples, a greater speed of rotation can cause a greater speed of scaling
  to be performed on the displayed view.

30  [0003]     The following disclosure relates generally to wearable electronic devices and, more
    specifically, to interfaces for wearable electronic devices.
                                                Background
    [0004]      Advanced personal electronic devices can have small form factors. These
    personal electronic devices can include, but are not limited to, tablets and smart phones. Use
                                                      1

    1002050207
    of such personal electronic devices involves manipulation of user interface objects on display
    screens that also have small form factors to complement the design of the personal electronic
    devices.
    [0005]       Exemplary manipulations that users can perform on personal electronic devices
 5  can include navigating a hierarchy, selecting a user interface object, adjusting the position,
    size, and zoom of user interface objects, or otherwise manipulating the user interfaces.
    Exemplary user interface objects can include digital images, video, text, icons, maps, control
    elements, such as buttons, and other graphics. A user can perform such manipulations in
    image management software, video editing software, word processing software, software
 0  execution platforms, such as an operating system's desktop, website browsing software, and
    other environments.
    [0006]       Existing methods for manipulating user interface objects on reduced-size touch
    sensitive displays can be inefficient. Further, existing methods generally provide less
    precision than is preferable.
 5  [0006a]      Reference to any prior art in the specification is not, and should not be taken as,
    an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common
    general knowledge in any jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be
    understood, regarded as relevant and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a person
    skilled in the art.
 0O                                              Summary
    [0006b] According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a computer
    implemented method comprising: receiving crown position information associated with a
    physical crown of an electronic device; determining whether a rotation of the physical crown
    has occurred based on the received crown position information; and in response to
25  determining that the rotation of the physical crown has occurred, causing a view displayed on
    a touch-sensitive display of the electronic device to be scaled.
    [0006c] According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a non-transitory
    computer-readable storage medium comprising instructions for: receiving crown position
    information associated with a physical crown of an electronic device; determining whether a
30  rotation of the physical crown has occurred based on the received crown position
    information; and in response to determining that the rotation of the physical crown has
    occurred, causing a view displayed on a touch-sensitive display of the electronic device to be
    scaled.
                                                     2

   1002050207
   [0006d] According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided an electronic device
   comprising: one or more processors; a physical crown operatively coupled to the one or more
   processors; and a touch-sensitive display operatively coupled to the one or more processors,
   the one or more processors configured to: receive crown position information associated with
 5 the physical crown; determine whether a rotation of the physical crown has occurred based on
   the received crown position information; and in response to determining that the rotation of
   the physical crown has occurred, cause a view displayed on the touch-sensitive display to be
   scaled.
   [0007]     The present disclosure relates to manipulating a user interface on a wearable
 0 electronic device using a mechanical crown. In some examples, the user interface can be
   scrolled or scaled in response to a rotation of the crown. The direction of the scrolling or
   scaling and the amount of scrolling or scaling can depend on the direction and amount of
   rotation of the crown, respectively. In some examples, the amount of scrolling or scaling can
   be proportional to the change in rotation angle of the crown. In other examples, a velocity of
 5 scrolling or a velocity of scaling can depend on a velocity of angular rotation of the crown.
   In these examples, a greater velocity of rotation can cause a greater velocity of scrolling or
   scaling to be performed on the displayed view.

   and variations of the term, such as "comprising", "comprises" and "comprised", are not
 O intended to exclude further additives, components, integers or steps.

                                           Detailed Description
 0 [0021]     In the following description of the disclosure and examples, reference is made to the
   accompanying drawings in which it is shown by way of illustration specific examples that can be
   practiced. It is to be understood that other examples can be practiced and structural changes can
   be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
   [0022]     The present disclosure relates to manipulating a user interface on a wearable electronic
25 device using a mechanical crown. In some examples, the user interface can be scrolled or scaled
   in response to a rotation of the crown. The direction of the scrolling or scaling and the amount
   of scrolling or scaling can depend on the direction and amount of rotation of the crown,
   respectively. In some examples, the amount of scrolling or scaling can be proportional to the
   change in rotation angle of the crown. In other examples, a velocity of scrolling or a velocity of
30 scaling can depend on a velocity of angular rotation of the crown. In these examples, a greater
   velocity of rotation can cause a greater velocity of scrolling or scaling to be performed on the
   displayed view.

       WO 2015/034960                                                          PCT/US2014/053951
   [0023]    FIG. 1 illustrates exemplary personal electronic device 100. In the illustrated example,
   device 100 is a watch that generally includes body 102 and strap 104 for affixing device 100 to
   the body of a user. That is, device 100 is wearable. Body 102 can be designed to couple with
   straps 104. Device 100 can have touch-sensitive display screen (hereafter touchscreen) 106 and
 5 crown 108. Device 100 can also have buttons 110, 112, and 114.
   [0024]    Conventionally, the term 'crown,' in the context of a watch, refers to the cap atop a
   stem for winding the watch. In the context of a personal electronic device, the crown can be a
   physical component of the electronic device, rather than a virtual crown on a touch sensitive
   display. Crown 108 can be mechanical meaning that it can be connected to a sensor for
 0 converting physical movement of the crown into electrical signals. Crown 108 can rotate in two
   directions of rotation (e.g., forward and backward). Crown 108 can also be pushed in towards
   the body of device 100 and/or be pulled away from device 100. Crown 108 can be touch
   sensitive, for example, using capacitive touch technologies that can detect whether a user is
   touching the crown. Moreover, crown 108 can further be rocked in one or more directions or
 5 translated along a track along an edge or at least partially around a perimeter of body 102. In
   some examples, more than one crown 108 can be used. The visual appearance of crown 108 can,
   but need not, resemble crowns of conventional watches. Buttons 110, 112, and 114, if included,
   can each be a physical or a touch-sensitive button. That is, the buttons may be, for example,
   physical buttons or capacitive buttons. Further, body 102, which can include a bezel, may have
 0 predetermined regions on the bezel that act as buttons.
   [0025]    Display 106 can include a display device, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), light
   emitting diode (LED) display, organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, or the like,
   positioned partially or fully behind or in front of a touch sensor panel implemented using any
   desired touch sensing technology, such as mutual-capacitance touch sensing, self-capacitance
25 touch sensing, resistive touch sensing, projection scan touch sensing, or the like. Display 106
   can allow a user to perform various functions by touching over hovering near the touch sensor
   panel using one or more fingers or other object.
   [0026]    In some examples, device 100 can further include one or more pressure sensors (not
   shown) for detecting an amount of force or pressure applied to the display. The amount of force
30 or pressure applied to display 106 can be used as an input to device 100 to perform any desired
   operation, such as making a selection, entering or exiting a menu, causing the display of
   additional options/actions, or the like. In some examples, different operations can be performed
                                                      4

       WO 2015/034960                                                            PCT/US2014/053951
   based on the amount of force or pressure being applied to display 106. The one or more pressure
   sensors can further be used to determine a position that the force is being applied to display 106.
   [0027]     FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of some of the components of device 100. As shown,
   crown 108 can be coupled to encoder 204, which can be configured to monitor a physical state or
 5 change of physical state of crown 108 (e.g., the position of the crown), convert it to an electrical
   signal (e.g., convert it to an analog or digital signal representation of the position or change in
   position of crown 108), and provide the signal to processor 202. For instance, in some examples,
   encoder 204 can be configured to sense the absolute rotational position (e.g., an angle between 0
   3600) of crown 108 and output an analog or digital representation of this position to processor
 0 202. Alternatively, in other examples, encoder 204 can be configured to sense a change in
   rotational position (e.g., a change in rotational angle) of crown 108 over some sampling period
   and to output an analog or digital representation of the sensed change to processor 202. In these
   examples, the crown position information can further indicate a direction of rotation of the crown
   (e.g., a positive value can correspond to one direction and a negative value can correspond to the
 5 other). In yet other examples, encoder 204 can be configured to detect a rotation of crown 108 in
   any desired manner (e.g., velocity, acceleration, or the like) and can provide the crown rotational
   information to processor 202. The rotational velocity can be expressed in numerous ways. For
   example, the rotational velocity can be expressed in a direction and a speed of rotation, such as
   hertz, as rotations per unit of time, as rotations per frame, as revolutions per unit of time, as
 0 revolutions per frame, as a change in angle per unit of time, and the like. In alternative
   examples, instead of providing information to processor 202, this information can be provided to
   other components of device 100. While the examples described herein refer to the use of
   rotational position of crown 108 to control scrolling or scaling of a view, it should be appreciated
   that any other physical state of crown 108 can be used.
25 [0028]     In some examples, the physical state of the crown can control physical attributes of
   display 106. For example, if crown 108 is in a particular position (e.g., rotated forward), display
   106 can have limited z-axis traversal ability. In other words, the physical state of the crown can
   represent physical modal functionality of display 106. In some examples, a temporal attribute of
   the physical state of crown 108 can be used as an input to device 100. For example, a fast
30 change in physical state can be interpreted differently than a slow change in physical state.
   [0029]     Processor 202 can be further coupled to receive input signals from buttons 110, 112,
   and 114, along with touch signals from touch-sensitive display 106. Processor 202 can be
                                                       5

       WO 2015/034960                                                          PCT/US2014/053951
   configured to interpret these input signals and output appropriate display signals to cause an
   image to be produced by touch-sensitive display 106. While a single processor 202 is shown, it
   should be appreciated that any number of processors or other computational devices can be used
   to perform the general functions discussed above.
 5 [0030]    FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary process 300 for scrolling through a set of displayed
   applications using a crown according to various examples. In some examples, process 300 can
   be performed by a wearable electronic device similar to device 100. In these examples, a visual
   representation (e.g., icons, graphical images, textual images, and the like) of one or more
   applications of a set of applications can be displayed on display 106 of device 100 and process
 0 300 can be performed to visually scroll through the set of applications by sequentially displaying
   the applications in response to a turning of crown 108. In some examples, the scrolling can be
   performed by translating the displayed contents along a fixed axis.
   [0031]    At block 302, crown position information can be received. In some examples, the
   crown position information can include an analog or digital representation of the absolute
 5 position of the crown, such as an angle between 0-360'. In other examples, the crown position
   information can include an analog or digital representation of a change in rotational position of
   the crown, such as a change in rotational angle. For example, an encoder similar to encoder 204
   can be coupled to a crown similar to crown 108 to monitor and measure its position. The
   encoder can convert the position of crown 108 into crown position information that can be
 0 transmitted to a processor similar to processor 202.
   [0032]    At block 304, it can be determined if a change in position has been detected. In some
   examples, where the crown position information includes an absolute position of the crown,
   determining whether a change in position has occurred can be performed by comparing the
   position of the crown at two different instances in time. For example, the processor (e.g.,
25 processor 202) can compare the most recent position of the crown (e.g., crown 108) as indicated
   by the crown position information to an earlier (e.g., immediately preceding) position of the
   crown as indicated by previously received crown position information. If the positions are the
   same or within a threshold value (e.g., a value corresponding to a tolerance of the encoder), it
   can be determined that no change in position has occurred. If, however, the positions are not the
30 same or are different by at least the threshold value, it can be determined that a change in
   position has occurred. In other examples, where the crown position information includes a
   change in position over some length of time, determining whether a change in position has
                                                     6

       WO 2015/034960                                                           PCT/US2014/053951
   occurred can be performed by determining whether the absolute value of the change in position
   is equal to zero or is less than a threshold value (e.g., a value corresponding to a tolerance of the
   encoder). If the absolute value of the change in position is equal to zero or is less than the
   threshold value, it can be determined that no change in position has occurred. If, however, the
 5 absolute value of the change in position is greater than zero or the threshold value, it can be
   determined that a change in position has occurred.
   [0033]    If it is determined at block 304 that no change in position of the crown has been
   detected, the process can return to block 302 where new crown position information can be
   received. If, however, it is instead determined at block 304 that that a change in position of the
 0 crown has been detected, the process can proceed to block 306. As described herein, a positive
   determination at block 304 can cause the process to proceed to block 306, while a negative
   determination can cause the process to return to block 302. However, it should be appreciated
   that the determination performed at block 304 can be reversed such that a positive determination
   can cause the process to return to block 302, while a negative determination can cause the
 5 process to proceed to block 306. For example, block 304 can alternatively determine if no
   change in position is detected.
   [0034]    At block 306, at least a portion of a set of applications can be scrolled through based on
   the detected change in position. The set of applications can include any ordered or unordered set
   of applications. For example, the set of applications can include all applications stored on the
 0 wearable electronic device, all open applications on the wearable electronic device, a user
   selected set of applications, or the like. Additionally, the applications can be ordered based on
   frequency of use, a user-defined ordering, relevance, or any other desired ordering.
   [0035]    In some examples, block 306 can include visually scrolling through the set of
   applications by sequentially displaying the applications in response to the detected change in
25 position of the crown. For example, the display (e.g., display 106) can be displaying one or
   more applications of the set of applications. In response to detecting a change in position of the
   crown (e.g., crown 108), the currently displayed one or more applications can be translated off
   the display to make room for one or more other applications to be translated onto the display. In
   some examples, the one or more other applications being translated onto the display can be
30 selected for display based on their relative ordering within the set of applications corresponding
   to the direction opposite the direction of translation. The direction of the translation can depend
   on the direction of the change in position of the crown. For example, turning the crown
                                                      7

       WO 2015/034960                                                            PCT/US2014/053951
   clockwise can cause a scrolling of the display in one direction, while turning the crown counter
   clockwise can cause a scrolling of the display in a second (e.g., opposite) direction.
   Additionally, the distance or speed of scrolling can depend on the amount of detected change in
   the position of the crown. The distance of scrolling can refer to the on-screen distance that the
 5 content is scrolled. The speed of scrolling can refer to the distance that the content is scrolled
   over a length of time. In some examples, the distance or speed of the scrolling can be
   proportional to the amount of detected rotation. For instance, the amount of scroll corresponding
   to a half-turn of the crown can be equal to 50% of the amount of scroll corresponding to a full
   turn of the crown. In some examples where the set of applications includes an ordered list of
 0 applications, the scrolling can stop in response to reaching the end of the list. In other examples,
   the scrolling can continue by looping around to the opposite end of the list of applications. The
   process can then return to block 302 where new crown position information can be received.
   [0036]     It should be appreciated that the actual values used to linearly map the change in crown
   position to the distance or speed of scrolling can be varied depending on the desired functionality
 5 of the device. Moreover, it should be appreciated that other mappings between the scroll amount
   or speed and the change in the position of the crown can be used. For example, acceleration,
   velocity (described in greater detail below with respect to FIGs. 21-44), or the like, can be used
   to determine the distance or speed of scrolling. Additionally, non-linear mappings between the
   crown characteristic (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration, etc.) and the scroll amount or scroll
 0 speed can be used.
   [0037]     To further illustrate the operation of process 300, FIG. 4 depicts an example interface
   of device 100 having a visual representation (e.g., icons, graphical images, textual images, and
   the like) of application 406 and portions of the visual representations of applications 404 and
   408. Applications 404, 406, and 408 can be part of a set of applications that includes any group
25 of any number of ordered or unordered applications (e.g., all applications on device 100, all open
   applications on device 100, user favorites, or the like). At block 302 of process 300, processor
   202 of device 100 can receive crown position information from encoder 204. Since crown 108 is
   not being rotated in FIG. 4, a negative determination can be made by processor 202 at block 304,
   causing the process to return to block 302.
30 [0038]     Referring now to FIG. 5, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward direction as
   indicated by rotation direction 502. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information
   that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at block 302 of process 300. Thus, processor 202 can
                                                       8

       WO 2015/034960                                                           PCT/US2014/053951
   make a positive determination at block 304, causing the process to proceed to block 306. At
   block 306, processor 202 can cause display 106 to scroll through at least a portion of the set of
   applications on device 100. The scrolling can have a scroll direction 504 corresponding to the
   rotation direction 502 of crown 108 and a scroll amount or speed based on a characteristic (e.g.,
 5 distance, velocity, acceleration, or the like) of the rotation of crown 108. In the illustrated
   example, the scroll distance can be proportional to the amount of rotation of crown 108. As
   shown, display 106 can scroll through the set of applications by causing the visual
   representations of the applications to translate in scroll direction 504. As a result, application
   408 has been completely removed from display 106, a portion of application 406 has been
 0 removed from display 106, and a greater portion of application 404 is displayed on display 106.
   As the user continues to rotate crown 108 in rotation direction 502, processor 202 can continue
   to cause display 106 to scroll the view of the set of applications in scroll direction 504, as shown
   in FIG. 6. In FIG. 6, application 406 is barely visible on the right side of display 106,
   application 404 is centered within display 106, and a newly displayed application 402 is
 5 displayed on the left side of display 106. In this example, application 402 can be another
   application within the set of applications and can have an ordered position to the left or previous
   to application 404. In some examples, if application 402 is the first application in the list of
   applications and the user continues to rotate crown 108 in rotation direction 502, processor 202
   can limit the scrolling of display 106 to stop scrolling once application 402 is centered within the
 0 display. Alternatively, in other examples, processor 202 can continue the scrolling of display
   106 by looping to the end of the set of applications to cause the last application (e.g., application
   408) of the set of applications to be displayed to the left of application 402.
   [0039]    Referring now to FIG. 7, crown 108 is being rotated in the downward rotation direction
   506. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from
25 encoder 204 at block 302 of process 300. Thus, processor 202 can make a positive
   determination at block 304, causing the process to proceed to block 306. At block 306,
   processor 202 can cause display 106 to scroll the view of applications in scroll direction 508
   corresponding to rotation direction 506. In this example, scroll direction 508 is in the opposite
   direction of scroll direction 504. However, it should be appreciated that scroll direction 508 can
30 be in any desired direction. Similar to the scrolling performed in response to rotation of crown
   108 in rotation direction 502, the scrolling performed in response to the rotation of crown 108 in
   rotation direction 506 can depend on a characteristic (e.g., distance, velocity, acceleration, or the
                                                       9

   like) of the rotation of crown 108. In the illustrated example, the scroll distance can be
   proportional to the amount of rotation of crown 108. As shown, display 106 can scroll through
   the set of applications by causing the visual representations of the applications to translate in
   scroll direction 508. As a result, application 402 has been completely removed from display
 5 106, a portion of application 404 has been removed from display 106, and a greater portion of
   application 406 is displayed on display 106. As the user continues to rotate crown 108 in
   rotation direction 506, processor 202 can continue to cause display 106 to scroll the view of the
   set of applications in scroll direction 508, as shown in FIG. 8. In FIG.8, application 404 is barely
   visible on the left side of display 106, application 406 is centered within display 106, and
 0 application 408 is again displayed on the right side of display 106. In some examples, if
   application 408 is the last application in the list of applications and the user were to continue to
   rotate crown 108 in rotation direction 508, processor 202 can limit the scrolling of display 106 to
   stop scrolling once application 408 is centered within the display. Alternatively, in other
   examples, processor 202 can continue the scrolling of display 106 by looping to the start of the
 5 set of applications to cause the first application (e.g., application 402) of the set of applications to
   be displayed to the right of application 408.
   [0040]     While a specific scrolling example is provided, it should be appreciated that other
   displays of applications can similarly be scrolled using a mechanical crown of a wearable
   electronic device in a similar manner. Additionally, the distance or speed of scrolling can be
 0 configured to depend on any characteristic of the crown.
   [0041]     FIG. 9 illustrates an exemplary process 900 for scrolling a view of a display using a
   crown according to various examples. The view can include a visual representation of any type
   of data being displayed. For example, the view can include a display of a text, a media item, a
   webpage, a map, or the like. Process 900 can be similar to process 300, except that it can be
25 more generally applied to any type of content or view being displayed on the display of a device.
   In some examples, process 900 can be performed by a wearable electronic device similar to
   device 100. In these examples, content or any other view can be displayed on display 106 of
   device 100 and process 900 can be performed to visually scroll the view in response to a turning
   of crown 108. In some examples, the scrolling can be performed by translating the displayed
30 contents along a fixed axis.
   [0042]     At block 902, crown position information can be received in a manner similar or
   identical to that described above with respect to block 302. For instance, the crown position
                                                       10

       WO 2015/034960                                                          PCT/US2014/053951
   information can be received by a processor (e.g., processor 202) from an encoder (e.g., encoder
   204) and can include an analog or digital representation of the absolute position of the crown, a
   change in rotational position of the crown, or other positional information of the crown.
   [0043]    At block 904, it can be determined if a change in position has been detected in a
 5 manner similar or identical to that described above with respect to block 304. For instance,
   block 904 can include comparing the position of the crown at two different instances in time, or
   can include determining if an absolute value of a change in crown position is equal to zero or
   below a threshold value. If no change in position is detected, the process can return to block
   902. Alternatively, if a change in position is detected, the process can proceed to block 906. As
 0 described herein, a positive determination at block 904 can cause the process to proceed to block
   906, while a negative determination can cause the process to return to block 902. However, it
   should be appreciated that the determination performed at block 904 can be reversed such that a
   positive determination can cause the process to return to block 902, while a negative
   determination can cause the process to proceed to block 906. For example, block 904 can
 5 alternatively determine if no change in position is detected.
   [0044]    At block 906, a view of a display can be scrolled based on the detected change in
   position. Similar to block 306 of process 300, block 906 can include visually scrolling a view by
   translating the view of the display in response to the detected change in position of the crown.
   For example, the display (e.g., display 106) can be displaying a portion of some content. In
 0 response to detecting a change in position of the crown (e.g., crown 108), the currently displayed
   portion of the content can be translated off the display to make room for other portions of the
   content that were not previously displayed. The direction of the translation can depend on the
   direction of the change in position of the crown. For example, turning the crown clockwise can
   cause a scrolling of the display in one direction, while turning the crown counter-clockwise can
25 cause a scrolling of the display in a second (e.g., opposite) direction. Additionally, the distance
   or speed of scrolling can depend on the amount of detected change in the position of the crown.
   In some examples, the distance or speed of the scrolling can be proportional to the amount of
   detected rotation. For instance, the amount of scroll corresponding to a half-turn of the crown
   can be equal to 50% of the amount of scroll corresponding to a full turn of the crown. The
30 process can then return to block 902 where new crown position information can be received.
   [0045]    It should be appreciated that the actual values used to linearly map the change in crown
   position to the distance or speed of scrolling can be varied depending on the desired functionality
                                                     11

   of the device. Moreover, it should be appreciated that other mappings between the scroll amount
   and change in position can be used. For example, acceleration, velocity (described in greater
   detail below with respect to FIGs. 21-44), or the like, can be used to determine the distance or
   speed of scrolling. Additionally, non-linear mappings between the crown characteristic (e.g.,
 5 position, velocity, acceleration, etc.) and the scroll amount or scroll speed can be used.
   [0046]     To further illustrate the operation of process 900, FIG. 10 depicts an example interface
   of device 100 having a visual representation of lines of text containing numbers 1-9. At block
   902 of process 900, processor 202 of device 100 can receive crown position information from
   encoder 204. Since crown 108 is not being rotated in FIG. 10, a negative determination can be
 0 made by processor 202 at block 904, causing the process to return to block 902.
   [0047]      Referring now to FIG. 11, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
   1102. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from
   encoder 204 at block 902 of process 900. Thus, processor 202 can make a positive
   determination at block 904, causing the process to proceed to block 906. At block 906,
 5 processor 202 can cause display 106 to scroll through the lines of text being displayed on display
   106. The scrolling can have a scroll direction 1104 corresponding to the rotation direction 1102
   of crown 108 and a scroll amount or speed based on a characteristic (e.g., distance, velocity,
   acceleration, or the like) of the rotation of crown 108. In the illustrated example, the scroll
   distance can be proportional to the amount of rotation of crown 108. As shown, display 106 can
 0 scroll through the lines of text by causing the text to translate in scroll direction 1104. As a
   result, a portion of line 1002 has been removed from display 106, while a portion of line 1004 is
   newly displayed on the bottom of display 106. The lines of text between lines 1002 and 1004
   have similarly been translated in scroll direction 1104. As the user continues to rotate crown 108
   in rotation direction 1102, processor 202 can continue to cause display 106 to scroll the lines of
25 text in scroll direction 1104, as shown in FIG. 12. In FIG. 12, line 1002 is no longer visible
   within display 106 and line 1004 is now completely in view of display 106. In some examples,
   if line 1004 is the last line of text and the user continues to rotate crown 108 in rotation direction
   1102, processor 202 can limit the scrolling of display 106 to stop scrolling once line 1004 is fully
   displayed within display 106. In other examples, processor 202 can continue the scrolling of
30 display 106 by looping to the start of the lines of text to cause the first line of text (e.g., line
   1002) to be displayed below line 1004. In yet other examples, a rubberbanding effect can be
   performed by displaying a blank space below line 1004, and snapping the lines of text back to

   align line 1004 with the bottom of display 106 in response to a stop in rotation of crown 108. It
   should be appreciated that the action performed in response to reaching the end of content
   displayed within display 106 can be selected based on the type of data being displayed.
   [0048]     Referring now to FIG. 13, crown 108 is being rotated in the downward rotation
 5 direction 1106. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this
   rotation from encoder 204 at block 902 of process 900. Thus, processor 202 can make a positive
   determination at block 904, causing the process to proceed to block 906. At block 906,
   processor 202 can cause display 106 to scroll the lines of text in scroll direction 1108
   corresponding to rotation direction 1106. In this example, scroll direction 1108 is in the opposite
 0 direction of scroll direction 1104. However, it should be appreciated that scroll direction 1108
   can be in any desired direction. Similar to the scrolling performed in response to rotation of
   crown 108 in rotation direction 1102, the scrolling performed in response to the rotation of
   crown 108 in rotation direction 1106 can depend on a characteristic (e.g., distance, velocity,
   acceleration, or the like) of the rotation of crown 108. In the illustrated example, the scroll
 5 distance can be proportional to the amount of rotation of crown 108. As shown, display 106 can
   scroll through the lines of text by causing the lines of text to translate in scroll direction 1108.
   As a result, a portion of line 1004 can be removed from display 106, while a portion of line 1002
   can again be displayed at the top of display 106. As the user continues to rotate crown 108 in
   rotation direction 1106, processor 202 can continue to cause display 106 to scroll the lines of text
 0 in scroll direction 1108, as shown in FIG. 14. As shown in FIG.14, line 1004 has been translated
   off of display 106, while line 1002 is now fully visible. In some examples, if line 1002 is the
   first line of text and the user continues to rotate crown 108 in rotation direction 1106, processor
   202 can limit the scrolling of display 106 to stop scrolling once line 1002 is at the top of display
   106. In other examples, processor 202 can continue the scrolling of display 106 by looping to
25 the end of the lines of text to cause the last line of text (e.g., line 1004) to be displayed above line
   1002. In yet other examples, a rubberbanding effect can be performed by displaying a blank
   space above line 1002, and snapping the lines of text back to align line 1002 with the top of
   display 106 in response to a stop in rotation of crown 108. It should be appreciated that the
   action performed in response to reaching the end of content displayed within display 106 can be
30 selected based on the type of data being displayed.
   [0049]     While a specific scrolling example is provided, it should be appreciated that other types
   of data, such as media items, webpages, or the like, can similarly be scrolled using a mechanical

   scrolling can be configured to depend on any characteristic of the crown.
   [0050]     FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary process 1500 for scaling a view (e.g., zooming in or
   out) of a display using a crown according to various examples. The view can include a visual
 5 representation of any type of data being displayed. For example, the view can include a display
   of a text, a media item, a webpage, a map, or the like. Process 1500 can be similar to processes
   300 and 900, except that instead of scrolling between applications or scrolling a view of a
   device, the view can be scaled positively or negatively in response to rotation of the crown. In
   some examples, process 1500 can be performed by a wearable electronic device similar to device
 0 100. In these examples, content or any other view can be displayed on display 106 of device 100
   and process 1500 can be performed to visually scale the view in response to a turning of crown
   108.
   [0051]     At block 1502, crown position information can be received in a manner similar or
   identical to that described above with respect to block 302 or 902. For instance, the crown
 5 position information can be received by a processor (e.g., processor 202) from an encoder (e.g.,
   encoder 204) and can include an analog or digital representation of the absolute position of the
   crown, a change in rotational position of the crown, or other positional information of the crown.
   [0052]     At block 1504, it can be determined if a change in position has been detected in a
   manner similar or identical to that described above with respect to block 304 or 904. For
 0 instance, block 1504 can include comparing the position of the crown at two different instances
   in time, or can include determining if an absolute value of a change in crown position is equal to
   zero or below a threshold value. If no change in position is detected, the process can return to
   block 1502. Alternatively, if a change in position is detected, the process can proceed to block
   1506. As described herein, a positive determination at block 1504 can cause the process to
25 proceed to block 1506, while a negative determination can cause the process to return to block
   1502. However, it should be appreciated that the determination performed at block 1504 can be
   reversed such that a positive determination can cause the process to return to block 1502, while a
   negative determination can cause the process to proceed to block 1506. For example, block 1504
   can alternatively determine if no change in position is detected.
30 [0053]     At block 1506, a view of a display can be scaled based on the detected change in
   position. Block 1506 can include visually scaling a view (e.g., zooming in/out) in response to
   the detected change in position of the crown. For example, the display (e.g., display 106) can be
                                                    14

       WO 2015/034960                                                           PCT/US2014/053951
   displaying a portion of some content. In response to detecting a change in position of the crown
   (e.g., crown 108), the view can be scaled by increasing or decreasing the size of the currently
   displayed portion of the content in the view depending on the direction of the change in position
   of the crown. For example, turning the crown clockwise can cause the contents within a view of
 5 the display to increase in size (e.g., zooming in), while turning the crown counter-clockwise can
   cause the contents within the view of the display to decrease in size (e.g., zooming out).
   Additionally, the amount or speed of scaling can depend on the amount of detected change in the
   position of the crown. In some examples, the amount or speed of the scaling can be proportional
   to the amount of detected rotation of the crown. For instance, the amount of scaling
 0 corresponding to a half-turn of the crown can be equal to 50% of the amount of scaling
   corresponding to a full turn of the crown. The process can then return to block 1502 where new
   crown position information can be received.
   [0054]    It should be appreciated that the actual values used to linearly map the change in crown
   position to the amount or speed of scaling can be varied depending on the desired functionality
 5 of the device. Moreover, it should be appreciated that other mappings between the scale amount
   and change in position can be used. For example, acceleration, velocity (described in greater
   detail below with respect to FIGs. 21-44), or the like, can be used to determine the amount or
   speed of scaling. Additionally, non-linear mappings between the crown characteristic (e.g.,
   position, velocity, acceleration, etc.) and the scale amount or scale speed can be used.
 0 [0055]    To further illustrate the operation of process 1500, FIG. 16 depicts an example interface
   of device 100 showing a triangle 1602. At block 1502 of process 1500, processor 202 of device
   100 can receive crown position information from encoder 204. Since crown 108 is not being
   rotated in FIG. 16, a negative determination can be made by processor 202 at block 1504,
   causing the process to return to block 1502.
25 [0056]    Referring now to FIG. 17, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
   1702. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from
   encoder 204 at block 1502 of process 1500. Thus, processor 202 can make a positive
   determination at block 1504, causing the process to proceed to block 1506. At block 1506,
   processor 202 can cause display 106 to scale the view being displayed on display 106. The
30 scaling can increase or decrease the size of the view depending on the rotation direction of crown
   108 and can have a scale amount or speed based on a characteristic (e.g., distance, velocity,
   acceleration, or the like) of the rotation of crown 108. In the illustrated example, the scale

   amount can be proportional to the amount of rotation of crown 108. As shown, display 106 can
   scale the view containing triangle 1602 using a positive scaling factor. As a result, triangle 1602
   in FIG. 17 appears larger than that shown in FIG. 16. As the user continues to rotate crown 108
   in rotation direction 1702, processor 202 can continue to cause display 106 to scaling the view
 5 containing the image of triangle 1602 using a positive scaling factor, as shown in FIG. 18. In
   FIG. 18, triangle 1602 appears larger than those shown in FIGS. 16 and 17. When the rotation of
   crown 108 stops, the scaling of the view containing triangle 1602 can similarly stop. In some
   examples, if the view of triangle 1602 has been scaled to its maximum amount and the user
   continues to rotate crown 108 in rotation direction 1702, processor 202 can limit the scaling of
 0 display 106. In yet other examples, a rubberbanding effect can be performed by allowing the
   view containing triangle 1602 to increase in size to a rubberbanding limit that is greater than the
   maximum scaling amount for the view and then snapping the size of the view back to its
   maximum scaling amount in response to a stop in rotation of crown 108. It should be
   appreciated that the action performed in response to reaching the scaling limit of display 106 can
 5 be configured in any desired manner.
   [0057]     Referring now to FIG. 19, crown 108 is being rotated in the downward rotation
   direction 1704. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this
   rotation from encoder 204 at block 1502 of process 1500. Thus, processor 202 can make a
   positive determination at block 1504, causing the process to proceed to block 1506. At block
 0 1506, processor 202 can cause display 106 to scale the view using a negative scaling factor
   corresponding to rotation direction 1704. Similar to the scaling performed in response to
   rotation of crown 108 in rotation direction 1702, the scaling performed in response to the
   rotation of crown 108 in rotation direction 1704 can depend on a characteristic (e.g., distance,
   velocity, acceleration, or the like) of the rotation of crown 108. In the illustrated example, the
25 scaling amount can be proportional to the amount of rotation of crown 108. As shown, display
   106 can scale the view containing the image of triangle 1602 using a negative scaling factor. As
   a result, triangle 1602 in FIG. 19 is smaller than that shown in FIG. 18. As the user continues to
   rotate crown 108 in rotation direction 1704, processor 202 can continue to cause display 106 to
   scale the view of containing image of triangle 1602 using a negative scaling factor, as shown in
30 FIG. 20. In FIG.20, triangle 1602 is smaller than those shown in FIGs. 18 and 19. When the
   rotation of crown 108 stops, the scaling of the view containing triangle 1602 can similarly stop.
   In some examples, if the view containing triangle 1602 has been scaled to its minimum amount
                                                       16

   and the user continues to rotate crown 108 in rotation direction 1704, processor 202 can limit the
   scaling of display 106. In yet other examples, a rubberbanding effect can be performed by
   allowing the view containing triangle 1602 to decrease in size to a rubberbanding limit that is
   less than the minimum scaling amount for the view, and then snapping the size of the view back
 5 to its minimum scaling amount in response to a stop in rotation of crown 108. It should be
   appreciated that the action performed in response to reaching the scaling limit of display 106 can
   be configured in any desired manner.
   [0058]     While a specific scaling example is provided, it should be appreciated that views of
   other types of data, such as media items, webpages, or the like, can similarly be scaled using a
 0 mechanical crown of a wearable electronic device in a similar manner. Additionally, the amount
   or speed of scaling can be configured to depend on any characteristic of the crown. Moreover, in
   some examples, when reaching a minimum or maximum scaling of a view, continued rotation of
   the crown in the same direction can cause the scaling to reverse direction. For example, an
   upward rotation of the crown can cause a view to zoom-in. However, upon reaching a scaling
 5 limit, the upward rotation of the crown can then cause the view to scale in the opposite direction
   (e.g., zoom-out).
   [0059]     FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary process 2100 for scrolling a view of a display based on
   an angular velocity of rotation of a crown according to various examples. The view can include
   a visual representation of any type of data being displayed. For example, the view can include a
 0 display of a text, a media item, a webpage, or the like. Process 2100 can be similar to process
   900, except that it can scroll the view based on a scrolling velocity that depends on the angular
   velocity of rotation of the crown. In some examples, process 2100 can be performed by a
   wearable electronic device similar to device 100. In these examples, content or any other view
   can be displayed on display 106 of device 100 and process 2100 can be performed to visually
25 scroll the view in response to a turning of crown 108. In some examples, the scrolling can be
   performed by translating the displayed contents along a fixed axis.
   [0060]     At block 2102, a view of the display of the wearable electronic device can be displayed.
   As mentioned above, the view can include any visual representation of any type of data that is
   displayed by a display of the device.
30 [0061]     At block 2104, crown position information can be received in a manner similar or
   identical to that described above with respect to block 902 of process 900. For instance, the
   crown position information can be received by a processor (e.g., processor 202) from an encoder
                                                    17

       WO 2015/034960                                                            PCT/US2014/053951
   (e.g., encoder 204) and can include an analog or digital representation of the absolute position of
   the crown, a change in rotational position of the crown, or other positional information of the
   crown.
   [0062]     At block 2106, the scroll velocity (e.g., speed and scroll direction) can be determined.
 5 In some examples, the scrolling of a view can be determined using a physics-based modeling of
   the motion. For example, the view can be treated as an object having a movement velocity that
   corresponds to the velocity of scrolling across the display of the device. The rotation of the
   crown can be treated as a force being applied to the view in a direction corresponding to the
   direction of rotation of the crown, where the amount of force depends on the speed of angular
 0 rotation of the crown. For example, a greater speed of angular rotation can correspond to a
   greater amount of force being applied to the view. Any desired linear or non-linear mapping
   between the speed of angular rotation of the crown and the force being applied to the view can
   be used. In addition, a drag force can be applied in a direction opposite the direction of scroll.
   This can be used to cause the velocity of scrolling to decay over time, allowing the scrolling to
 5 stop absent additional input from the user. Thus, the velocity of scrolling at discrete moments in
   time can take the general form of:
                                     VT=V(T-1) +  AVCROWN - AVDRAG-                                 (1.1)
   [0063]     In equation 1.1, VT represents the determined scroll velocity (speed and direction) at
   time T, V(T-1) represents the previous scroll velocity (speed and direction) at time T-1,  AVCROWN
 0 represents the change in velocity caused by the force applied to the view in response to the
   rotation of the crown, and  AVDRAG   represents the change in velocity of the view caused by the
   drag force opposing the motion of the view (scrolling of the view). As mentioned above, the
   force applied to the view by the crown can depend on the speed of angular rotation of the crown.
   Thus,   AVCROWN   can also depend on the speed of angular rotation of the crown. Typically, the
25 greater the speed of angular rotation of the crown, the greater the value of AVCROWN will be.
   However, the actual mapping between the speed of angular rotation of the crown and        AVCROWN
   can be varied depending on the desired user feel of the scrolling effect. For example, various
   linear or non-linear mappings between the speed of angular rotation of the crown and       AVCROWN
   can be used. In some examples,     AVDRAG   can depend on the velocity of scrolling such that at
30 greater velocities, a greater opposing change in velocity can be produced. In other examples,
   AVDRAG    can have a constant value. However, it should be appreciated that any constant or
   variable amount of opposing change in velocity can be used to produce a desired scrolling effect.
                                                      18

       WO 2015/034960                                                             PCT/US2014/053951
   Note, typically, in the absence of user input in the form of AVCROWN,     VT  will approach (and
   become) zero based on     AVDRAG    in accordance with equation 1.1, but VT would not change signs
   without user input in the form of crown rotation      (AVCROWN)
   [0064]     As can be seen from equation 1.1, the velocity of scrolling can continue to increase as
 5 long as AVCROWN is greater than      AVDRAG.   Additionally, the velocity of scrolling can have non
   zero values even when no      AVCROWN    input is being received. Thus, if the view is scrolling with a
   non-zero velocity, it can continue to scroll without the user rotating the crown. The scroll
   distance and time until the scrolling stops can depend on the scroll velocity at the time the user
   stops rotating the crown and the     AVDRAG  component.
 0 [0065]     In some examples, when the crown is rotated in a direction corresponding to a scroll
   direction that is opposite the direction that the view is currently being scrolled, the V(T-1)
   component can be reset to a value of zero, allowing the user to quickly change the direction of
   the scrolling without having to provide a force sufficient to offset the current scroll velocity of
   the view.
 5 [0066]     At block 2108, the display can be updated based on the scroll speed and direction
   determined at block 2106. This can include translating the displayed view by an amount
   corresponding to the determined scroll speed and in a direction corresponding to the determined
   scroll direction. The process can then return to block 2104, where additional crown position
   information can be received.
 0 [0067]     It should be appreciated that blocks 2104, 2106, and 2108 can be repeatedly performed
   at any desired frequency to continually determine the velocity of scrolling and to update the
   display accordingly.
   [0068]     To further illustrate the operation of process 2100, FIG. 22 depicts an example interface
   of device 100 having a visual representation of lines of text containing numbers 1-9. At block
25 2102 of process 2100, processor 202 of device 100 can cause display 106 to display the
   illustrated interface. At block 2104, processor 202 can receive crown position information from
   encoder 204. At block 2106, a scroll speed and scroll direction can be determined. Since the
   current scroll speed is zero and since crown 108 is not currently being rotated, it can be
   determined using equation 1.1 that the new velocity of scrolling is zero. At block 2108,
30 processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the display using the speed and direction
   determined at block 2106. However, since the determined velocity was zero, no change to the
   display need be made. For purposes of explanation, FIGs. 23-29 depict subsequent views of the
                                                        19

   interface shown in FIG. 22 at different points of time, where the length of time between each
   view is equal.
   [0069]     Referring now to FIG. 23, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
   with rotation speed 2302. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information that
 5 reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at block 2104. Thus, at block 2106, processor 202 can
   convert this rotation speed into a   AVCROWN    value to determine the new velocity of scrolling  VT
   In this example, rotation of crown 108 in the upward direction corresponds to an upward scroll
   direction. In other examples, other directions can be used. At block 2108, processor 202 can
   cause display 106 to update the display based on the determined scroll speed and direction. As
 0 shown in FIG. 23, this update has caused the lines of text to translate in the upward direction
   with scroll speed 2304. Since crown 108 has only begun to rotate, rotation speed 2302 can be
   relatively low compared to typical rotation speeds of the crown. Thus, scroll speed 2304 can
   similarly have a relatively low value compared to typical or maximum scroll speeds. As a result,
   only a portion of the line of text containing the value "1" has been translated off the display.
 5 [0070]     Referring now to FIG. 24, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
   with rotation speed 2306, which can be greater than rotation speed 2302. Processor 202 can
   again receive crown position information from encoder 204 at block 2104. Thus, at block 2106,
   processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a      AVCROWN   value to determine the new
   velocity of scrolling  VT.  Since the display previously had a non-zero scroll speed value (e.g., as
 0 shown in FIG. 23), the new     AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed 2306 can be added
   to the previous scroll velocity value   V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2304). Thus, as long as the
   new   AVCROWN    value is greater than the AVDRAG value, the new scroll speed 2308 can be greater
   than scroll speed 2304. However, if the      AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed 2306 is
   less than the AVDRAG value, the new scroll speed 2308 can be less than scroll speed 2304. In the
25 illustrated example, the new    AVCROWN    value is assumed to be greater than the   AVDRAG  value. At
   block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the display based on the determined
   scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 24, this update has caused the lines of text to
   translate in the upward direction with scroll speed 2308. Since the      AVCROWN    value
   corresponding to rotation speed 2306 is greater than the      AVDRAG   value, scroll speed 2308 can be
30 greater than scroll speed 2304. As a result, the lines of text have been translated a greater
   distance over the same length of time, causing a full line of text to be translated vertically off the
   display.

   [0071]    Referring now to FIG. 25, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
   with rotation speed 2310, which can be greater than rotation speed 2306. Processor 202 can
   again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at block
   2104. Thus, at block 2106, processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a        AVCROWN    value
 5 to determine the new velocity of scrolling    VT.  Since the display previously had a non-zero scroll
   speed value (e.g., as shown in FIG. 24), the new     AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed
   2310 can be added to the previous scroll velocity value     V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2308).
   Thus, as long as the new    AVCROWN   value is greater than the AVDRAG value, the new scroll speed
   2312 can be greater than scroll speed 2308. However, if the        AVCROWN   value corresponding to
 0 rotation speed 2310 is less than the   AVDRAG   value, the new scroll speed 2312 can be less than
   scroll speed 2308. In the illustrated example, the new     AVCROWN    value is assumed to be greater
   than the AVDRAG   value. At block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the
   display based on the determined scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 25, this update has
   caused the lines of text to translate in the upward direction with scroll speed 2312. Since the
 5 AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed 2310 is greater than the      AVDRAG   value, scroll
   speed 2312 can be greater than scroll speed 2308. As a result, the lines of text have been
   translated a greater distance over the same length of time, causing 1.5 lines of text to be
   translated vertically off the display.
   [0072]    Referring now to FIG. 26, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
 0 with rotation speed 2314, which can be greater than rotation speed 2310. Processor 202 can
   again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at block
   2104. Thus, at block 2110, processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a        AVCROWN    value
   to determine the new velocity of scrolling    VT.  Since the display previously had a non-zero scroll
   speed value (e.g., as shown in FIG. 25), the new     AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed
25 2314 can be added to the previous scroll velocity value     V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2312).
   Thus, as long as the new    AVCROWN   value is greater than the  AVDRAG    value, the new scroll speed
   2316 can be greater than scroll speed 2312. However, if the        AVCROWN   value corresponding to
   rotation speed 2314 is less than the   AVDRAG   value, the new scroll speed 2316 can be less than
   scroll speed 2312. In the illustrated example, the new     AVCROWN     value is assumed to be greater
30 than the AVDRAG   value. At block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the
   display based on the determined scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 26, this update has
   caused the lines of text to translate in the upward direction with scroll speed 2316. Since the

   AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed 2314 is greater than the        AVDRAG   value, scroll

   translated a greater distance over the same length of time, causing two lines of text to be
   translated vertically off the display.
 5 [0073]     Referring now to FIG. 27, crown 108 is not being rotated in any direction. Processor
   202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at
   block 2104. Thus, at block 2110, processor 202 can determine the new velocity of scrolling             VT
   based on the previous scroll velocity     V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2316) and the   AVDRAG
   value. Thus, as long as the previous scroll speed 2316 is greater than the        AVDRAG   value, the
 0 scroll speed can have a non-zero value even when no rotation of the crown is being performed.
   However, if the previous scroll velocity      V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2316) is equal to the
   AVDRAG    value, the scroll speed can have a value of zero. In the illustrated example, the previous
   scroll velocity  V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2316) is assumed to be greater than the AVDRAG
   value. At block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the display based on the
 5 determined scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 27, this update has caused the lines of
   text to translate in the upward direction with scroll speed 2318. Since        AVDRAG  can have a non
   zero value and because the previous scroll velocity V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2316) can be
   greater than the  AVDRAG     value, scroll speed 2318 can have a non-zero value that is less than
   scroll speed 2316. As a result, the lines of text have been translated a shorter distance over the
 0 same length of time, causing 1.5 lines of text to be translated vertically off the display.

   202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at
   block 2104. Thus, at block 2110, processor 202 can determine the new velocity of scrolling             VT
   based on the previous scroll velocity     V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2318) and the   AVDRAG
25 value. Thus, as long as the previous scroll speed 2318 is greater than the        AVDRAG   value, the
   scroll speed can have a non-zero value even when no rotation of the crown is being performed.
   However, if the previous scroll velocity      V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2318) is equal to the

   202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at

   zero value and because the previous scroll velocity V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed 2320) can be
   greater than the  AVDRAG     value, scroll speed 2322 can have a non-zero value that is less than
   scroll speed 2320. As a result, the lines of text have been translated a shorter distance over the
 0 same length of time, causing 0.5 lines of text to be translated vertically off the display. This
   decay in scroll velocity can continue until the previous scroll velocity        V(T-1) is equal to the
   AVDRAG    value, causing the scroll velocity to fall to zero. Alternatively, the decay in scroll
   velocity can continue until the previous scroll velocity       V(T-1) falls below a threshold value, after
   which it can be set to a value of zero.
25 [0076]     To further illustrate the operation of process 2100, FIG. 30 depicts an example interface
   of device 100 having a visual representation of lines of text containing numbers 1-9 similar to
   that shown in FIG. 22. FIGs. 31-36 illustrate the scrolling of the display at scroll speeds 3104,
   3108, 3112, 3116, 3118, and 3120 based on input rotation speeds 3102, 3106, 3110, and 3114, in
   a similar manner as described above with respect to FIGs. 23-28. Thus, the lengths of time
30 between subsequent views shown in FIGs. 31-36 are equal. For purposes of explanation, FIGs.
   37-40 depict subsequent views of the interface shown in FIG. 36 at different points of time,
   where the length of time between each view is equal.

   [0077]     In contrast to FIG. 29 where no rotation input was received, a downward rotation
   having rotation speed 3702 can be performed at FIG. 37. In this instance, processor 202 can
   again receive crown position information from encoder 204 reflecting this downward rotation at
   block 2104. At block 2106, processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a          AVCROWN   value
 5 to determine the new velocity of scrolling     VT. Since the downward rotation of crown 108 is in
   the opposite direction of the scrolling shown in FIG. 36, the AVCROWN value can have a polarity
   that is opposite that of the previous scroll velocity value V(T-1). In some examples, the new
   velocity of scrolling   VT can be calculated by adding the new    AVCROWN     value (having an opposite
   polarity) to the previous scroll velocity value   V(T-1) and subtracting the   AVDRAG    value. In other
 0 examples, such as that shown in FIG. 37, the previous scroll velocity value        V(T-1) can be set to
   zero when rotation of crown 108 is in a direction opposite that of the previous scrolling (e.g., the
   polarity of AVCROWN is opposite that of V(T-1)). This can be performed to allow the user to
   quickly change the direction of scrolling without having to offset the previous velocity of
   scrolling. At block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the display based on the
 5 determined scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 37, this update has caused the lines of
   text to translate in the downward direction with scroll speed 3704. Since crown 108 has only
   begun to rotate, rotation speed 3702 can be relatively low compared to typical rotation speeds of
   the crown. Thus, scroll speed 3704 can similarly have a relatively low value compared to typical
   or maximum scroll speeds. As a result, a relatively slow scrolling can be performed, causing 0.5
 0 lines of text to be translated vertically off the display.
   [0078]     Referring now to FIG. 38, crown 108 is being rotated in the downward rotation
   direction with rotation speed 3706, which can be greater than rotation speed 3702. Processor
   202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at
   block 2104. Thus, at block 2106, processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a          AVCROWN
25 value to determine the new velocity of scrolling     VT.  Since the display previously had a non-zero
   scroll speed value (e.g., as shown in FIG. 37), the new     AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation
   speed 3706 can be added to the previous scroll velocity value      V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed
   3704). Thus, as long as the new     AVCROWN    value is greater than the  AVDRAG   value, the new scroll
   speed 3708 can be greater than scroll speed 3704. However, if the AVCROWN value corresponding
30 to rotation speed 3706 is less than the AVDRAG value, the new scroll speed 3708 can be less than
   scroll speed 3704. In the illustrated example, the new      AVCROWN   value is assumed to be greater
   than the  AVDRAG    value. At block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the
                                                       24

   display based on the determined scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 38, this update has
   caused the lines of text to translate in the downward direction with scroll speed 3708. Since the
   AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed 3706 is greater than the      AVDRAG  value, scroll
   speed 3708 can be greater than scroll speed 3704. As a result, the lines of text have been
 5 translated a greater distance over the same length of time, causing a full line of text to be
   translated vertically off the display.
   [0079]    Referring now to FIG. 39, crown 108 is being rotated in the downward rotation
   direction with rotation speed 3710, which can be greater than rotation speed 3706. Processor
   202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at
 0 block 2104. Thus, at block 2106, processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a        AVCROWN
   value to determine the new velocity of scrolling    VT.  Since the display previously had a non-zero
   scroll speed value (e.g., as shown in FIG. 38), the new    AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation
   speed 3710 can be added to the previous scroll velocity value     V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed
   3708). Thus, as long as the new     AVCROWN   value is greater than the  AVDRAG   value, the new scroll
 5 speed 3712 can be greater than scroll speed 3708. However, if the AVCROWN value corresponding
   to rotation speed 3710 is less than the AVDRAG value, the new scroll speed 3712 can be less than
   scroll speed 3708. In the illustrated example, the new    AVCROWN    value is assumed to be greater
   than the AVDRAG value. At block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the
   display based on the determined scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 39, this update has
 0 caused the lines of text to translate in the downward direction with scroll speed 3712. Since the
   AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation speed 3710 is greater than the      AVDRAG  value, scroll
   speed 3712 can be greater than scroll speed 3708. As a result, the lines of text have been
   translated a greater distance over the same length of time, causing 1.5 lines of text to be
   translated vertically off the display.
25 [0080]     Referring now to FIG. 40, crown 108 is being rotated in the downward rotation
   direction with rotation speed 3714, which can be greater than rotation speed 3710. Processor
   202 can again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at
   block 2104. Thus, at block 2110, processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a        AVCROWN
   value to determine the new velocity of scrolling    VT.  Since the display previously had a non-zero
30 scroll speed value (e.g., as shown in FIG. 39), the new    AVCROWN    value corresponding to rotation
   speed 3714 can be added to the previous scroll velocity value     V(T-1) (e.g., having scroll speed
   3712). Thus, as long as the new     AVCROWN   value is greater than the  AVDRAG   value, the new scroll

   speed 3716 can be greater than scroll speed 3712. However, if the AVCROWN value corresponding
   to rotation speed 3714 is less than the AVDRAG value, the new scroll speed 3716 can be less than
   scroll speed 3712. In the illustrated example, the new    AVCROWN  value is assumed to be greater
   than the AVDRAG value. At block 2108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the
 5 display based on the determined scroll speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 40, this update has
   caused the lines of text to translate in the downward direction with scroll speed 3716. Since the
   AVCROWN     value corresponding to rotation speed 3714 is greater than the AVDRAG   value, scroll
   speed 3716 can be greater than scroll speed 3712. As a result, the lines of text have been
   translated a greater distance over the same length of time, causing two lines of text to be
 0 translated vertically off the display.
   [0081]     While not shown, if the rotation of crown 108 stops, the view can continue to be
   scrolled in a downward direction in a manner similar to that described above with respect to
   FIGs.35 and 36. The speed and amount of scroll that can be performed can depend on the scroll
   speed when the rotation of crown 108 stopped and the value used for     AVDRAG
 5 [0082]     While a specific scrolling example is provided, it should be appreciated that other types
   of data, such as media items, webpages, applications, or the like, can similarly be scrolled using
   process 2100 in a similar manner. For example, process 2100 can be performed to scroll through
   a list of applications in a manner similar to that described above with respect to process 300.
   However, the velocity of scrolling through the applications when using process 2100 can depend
 0 on the velocity of angular rotation of the crown.
   [0083]     FIG. 41 illustrates an exemplary process 4100 for scaling a view of a display based on
   an angular velocity of rotation of a crown according to various examples. The view can include
   a visual representation of any type of data being displayed. For example, the view can include a
   display of a text, a media item, a webpage, or the like. Process 4100 can be similar to process
25 2100, except that process 4100 can determine a scaling velocity (e.g., an amount and direction of
   change in size per unit time) rather than determine a scrolling velocity. While the quantities
   being determined are different, they can be determined in a similar manner. In some examples,
   process 4100 can be performed by a wearable electronic device similar to device 100. In these
   examples, content or any other view can be displayed on display 106 of device 100 and process
30 4100 can be performed to visually scale the view in response to a turning of crown 108.

   [0084]    At block 4102, a view of the display of the wearable electronic device can be displayed.
   As mentioned above, the view can include any visual representation of any type of data that is
   displayed by a display of the device.
   [0085]    At block 4104, crown position information can be received in a manner similar or
 5 identical to that described above with respect to block 902 of process 900. For instance, the
   crown position information can be received by a processor (e.g., processor 202) from an encoder
   (e.g., encoder 204) and can include an analog or digital representation of the absolute position of
   the crown, a change in rotational position of the crown, or other positional information of the
   crown.
 0 [0086]    At block 4106, the scale velocity (e.g., speed and positive/negative scaling direction)
   can be determined. In some examples, the scaling of a view can be determined using a physics
   based modeling of motion. For example, the velocity of scaling can be treated as a velocity of a
   moving object. The rotation of the crown can be treated as a force being applied to the object in
   a direction corresponding to the direction of rotation of the crown, where the amount of force
 5 depends on the speed of angular rotation of the crown. As a result, the scaling velocity can
   increase or decrease and can move in different directions. For example, a greater speed of
   angular rotation can correspond to a greater amount of force being applied to the object. Any
   desired linear or non-linear mapping between speed of angular rotation and force being applied
   to the object can be used. In addition, a drag force can be applied in a direction opposite the
 0 direction of motion (e.g., scaling). This can be used to cause the velocity of scaling to decay
   over time, allowing the scaling to stop absent additional input from the user. Thus, the velocity
   of scaling at discrete moments in time can take the general form of:
                                     VT=V(T-1) + AVCROWN - AVDRAG-                                 (1.2)
   [0087]    In equation 1.2, VT represents the determined scale velocity (speed and direction) at
25 time T, V(T-1) represents the previous scale velocity (speed and direction) at time T-1, AVCROWN
   represents the change in scale velocity caused by the force applied in response to the rotation of
   the crown, and   AVDRAG   represents the change in scale velocity caused by the drag force opposing
   the motion of the scaling. As mentioned above, the force applied to the scaling by the crown can
   depend on the speed of angular rotation of the crown. Thus,     AVCROWN  can also depend on the
30 speed of angular rotation of the crown. Typically, the greater the speed of angular rotation of the
   crown, the greater the value of AVCROWN will be. However, the actual mapping between the
   speed of angular rotation of the crown and   AVCROWN    can be varied depending on the desired user
                                                     27

   feel of the scaling effect. In some examples, the AVDRAG can depend on the velocity of scaling,
   such that at greater velocities, a greater opposing change in scaling can be produced. In other
   examples,   AVDRAG   can have a constant value. However, it should be appreciated that any
   constant or variable amount of opposing change in velocity can be used to produce a desired
 5 scaling effect. Note, typically, in the absence of user input in the form of AVCROWN,    VT  will
   approach (and become) zero based on       AVDRAG   in accordance with equation 1.2, but  VT  would
   not change signs without user input in the form of crown rotation     (AVCROWN)
   [0088]    As can be seen from equation 1.2, the velocity of scaling can continue to increase as
   long as AVCROWN is greater than     AVDRAG.   Additionally, the velocity of scaling can have non
 0 zero values even when no      AVCROWN   input is being received. Thus, if the view is scaling with a
   non-zero velocity, it can continue to scale without the user rotating the crown. The scale amount
   and time until the scaling stops can depend on the scale velocity at the time the user stops
   rotating the crown and the    AVDRAG   component.
   [0089]     In some examples, when the crown is rotated in the opposite direction corresponding to
 5 a scale direction that is opposite the direction that the view is currently being scaled, the V(T-1)
   component can be reset to a value of zero, allowing the user to quickly change the direction of
   the scaling without having to provide a force sufficient to offset the current scale velocity of the
   view.
   [0090]     At block 4108, the display can be updated based on the scale speed and direction
 0 determined at block 4106. This can include scaling the view by an amount corresponding to the
   determined scale speed and in a direction (e.g., larger or smaller) corresponding to the
   determined scale direction. The process can then return to block 4104, where additional crown
   position information can be received.
   [0091]     It should be appreciated that blocks 4104, 4106, and 4108 can be repeatedly performed
25 at any desired frequency to continually determine the speed of scaling and to update the display
   accordingly.
   [0092]     To further illustrate the operation of process 4100, FIG. 42 depicts an example interface
   of device 100 having an image of triangle 4202. At block 4102 of process 4100, processor 202
   of device 100 can cause display 106 to display the illustrated triangle 4202. At block 4104,
30 processor 202 can receive crown position information from encoder 204. At block 4106, a scale
   speed and scale direction can be determined. Since the current scroll velocity is zero and since
   crown 108 is not currently being rotated, it can be determined using equation 1.2 that the new
                                                       28

   velocity of scaling is zero. At block 4108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the
   display using the speed and direction determined at block 4106. However, since the determined
   velocity was zero, no change to the display need be made. For purposes of explanation, FIGs. 43
   and 44 depict subsequent views of the interface shown in FIG. 42 at different points of time,
 5 where the length of time between each view is equal.
   [0093]     Referring now to FIG. 43, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
   with rotation speed 4302. Processor 202 can again receive crown position information that
   reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at block 4104. Thus, at block 4106, processor 202 can
   convert this rotation speed into a   AVCROWN  value to determine the new velocity of scaling VT-   In
 0 this example, rotation of crown in the upward direction equates to a positive scaling direction
   (e.g., increasing the size of the view). In other examples, other directions can be used. At block
   4108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the display based on the determined scale
   speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 43, this update has caused triangle 4202 to increase in
   size with a rate of change corresponding to the determined scale speed. Since crown 108 has
 5 only begun to rotate, rotation speed 4302 can be relatively low compared to typical rotation
   speeds of the crown. Thus, the scale speed can similarly have a relatively low value compared to
   typical or maximum scroll speeds. As a result, only a small change in size of triangle 4202 can
   be observed.
   [0094]     Referring now to FIG. 43, crown 108 is being rotated in the upward rotation direction
 0 with rotation speed 4304, which can be greater than rotation speed 4302. Processor 202 can
   again receive crown position information that reflects this rotation from encoder 204 at block
   4104. Thus, at block 4106, processor 202 can convert this rotation speed into a    AVCROWN   value
   to determine the new velocity of scaling    VT. Since the display previously had a non-zero scale
   velocity value (e.g., as shown in FIG. 43), the new   AVCROWN   value corresponding to rotation
25 speed 4304 can be added to the previous scale velocity value V(T-1). Thus, as long as the new
   AVCROWN     value is greater than the AVDRAG value, the new scale velocity can be greater than the
   previous scale velocity. However, if the    AVCROWN   value corresponding to rotation speed 4304 is
   less than the AVDRAG value, the new scale velocity can be less than the previous scale velocity.
   In the illustrated example, the new    AVCROWN  value is assumed to be greater than the AVDRAG
30 value. At block 4108, processor 202 can cause display 106 to update the display based on the
   determined scale speed and direction. As shown in FIG. 44, this update has caused triangle 4202
   to increase in size with the determined scale velocity. Since the AVCROWN value corresponding to
                                                     29

   rotation speed 4304 is greater than the AVDRAG value, the scale velocity can be greater than the
   previous scale velocity. As a result, a larger change in size of triangle 4202 can be observed than
   that illustrated in FIG. 43.
   [0095]      Similar to the scrolling performed using process 2100, the scaling of the view
 5 containing triangle 4202 can continue after rotation of crown 108 has ceased. However, the rate
   at which the view containing triangle 4202 increases in size can decrease over time due to the
   AVDRAG    value of equation 1.2. Additionally, a similar scaling that decreases the size of the view
   containing triangle 4202 can be performed in response to crown 108 being rotated in the opposite
   direction. The velocity of the scaling can be calculated in a similar manner as that used to
 0 calculate the positive scaling shown in FIGs. 42-44. Moreover, similar to the scrolling
   performed using process 2100, the speed and direction of scaling can be set to zero in response
   to a rotation of crown 108 in a direction opposite the direction of scaling. This can be performed
   to allow the user to quickly change the direction of the scaling.
   [0096]     Moreover, in some examples, when reaching a minimum or maximum scaling of a
 5 view, the velocity scaling can reverse directions. For example, the velocity of scaling can cause
   the view to zoom-in with a non-zero speed. Upon reaching a scaling limit, the direction of the
   scaling can reverse to cause the view to scale in the opposite direction (e.g., zoom-out) with the
   same speed that the view was scaling prior to reaching the scaling limit.
   [0097]     In some examples, the scrolling or scaling performed in any of the processes described
 0 above (e.g., process 300, 900, 1500, 2100, or 4100) can be stopped in response to a change of
   context of the electronic device. A context can represent any condition that makes up the
   environment in which the crown position information is being received. For example, a context
   can include a current application being executed by the device, a type of application or process
   being displayed by the device, a selected object within a view of the device, or the like. To
25 illustrate, if crown position information indicating that a change in position of crown 108 is
   being received while performing process 300, device 100 can scroll through a list of
   applications, as described above. However, in response to a change in context in the form of a
   user selecting one of the displayed applications, which causes device 100 to open the application,
   device 100 can cease to perform the previously occurring scrolling function of block 306 to
30 prevent the scrolling function from being performed within the opened application. In some
   examples, after detecting a change in context, device 100 can also ignore inputs from crown 108
   by ceasing to perform the scrolling function of block 306 even if crown 108 continues to be

   change in context. The threshold length of time can be any desired time, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, or
   more seconds. A similar behavior can also be performed in response to detecting a change in
 5 context while performing process 900 or 1500. For example, device 100 can cease to perform a
   previously occurring scrolling or scaling function in response to detecting a change in context.
   Additionally, in some examples after detecting a change in context, device 100 can also ignore
   inputs from crown 108 by ceasing to scroll or zoom a view in response to changes in position of
   crown 108 for a threshold length of time after detecting the change in context. A similar
 0 behavior can also be performed in response to detecting a change in context while performing
   blocks 2100 or 4100. For example, device 100 can stop a previously occurring scrolling or
   zooming function having a non-zero speed in response to detecting a change in context.
   Additionally, in some examples after detecting a change in context, device 100 can also ignore
   inputs from crown 108 by ceasing to scroll or zoom a view in response to changes in position of
 5 crown 108 for a threshold length of time after detecting the change in context. Stopping a
   scrolling or scaling function and/or ignoring future inputs from crown 108 in response to
   detecting a change in context can advantageously prevent an input entered while operating in one
   context from carrying over to another context in an undesired way. For example, a user can use
   crown 108 to scroll through a list of applications using process 300 and can select a desired
 0 music application while the momentum of crown 108 causes crown 108 to continue to spin.
   Without stopping the scrolling function and without ignoring inputs from crown 108 in response
   to detecting the change in context, device 100 can cause a scrolling function to be performed
   within the selected application or can interpret the input from crown 108 in another manner (e.g.,
   to adjust a volume of the music application) unintended by the user.
25 [0098]    In some examples, changes in certain types of contexts may not result in device 100
   stopping an ongoing scrolling or scaling function and/or causing device 100 to ignore future
   inputs from crown 108. For example, if device 100 is simultaneously displaying multiple views
   or objects within display 106, selection between the displayed views or objects may not cause
   device 100 to stop the scrolling or scaling function and/or may not cause device 100 to ignore
30 future inputs of crown 108, as described above. For example, device 100 can simultaneously
   display two sets of lines of text similar to that shown in FIG. 10. In this example, device 100 can
   scroll through one of the sets using process 900. In response to a user selection of the other set
                                                      31

       WO 2015/034960                                                           PCT/US2014/053951
   of lines of text (e.g., via a tap on the touch-sensitive display of device 100 at a location
   corresponding to the other set of lines of text), device 100 can begin to scroll through the other
   set of lines of text based on the previous scroll speed and/or current detected changes in position
   of crown 108. However, if a different type of change in context occurs (e.g., a new application is
 5 opened, an item not currently being displayed by device 100 is selected, or the like), device 100
   can stop an ongoing scrolling or scaling function and/or can ignore inputs from crown 108 for a
   threshold length of time, as described above. In other examples, rather than begin to scroll
   through the other set of lines of text based on the previous scroll speed and/or the current change
   in position of crown 108 in response to a user selection of the other set of lines of text (e.g., via a
 0 tap on the touch-sensitive display of device 100 at a location corresponding to the other set of
   lines of text), device 100 can stop an ongoing scrolling or scaling function and/or can ignore
   inputs from crown 108 for a threshold length of time. However, the threshold length of time can
   be shorter than the threshold length of time used for changes in other types of changes in context
   (e.g., a new application is opened, an item not currently being displayed by device 100 is
 5 selected, or the like). While specific types of context changes are provided above, it should be
   appreciated that any type of context changes can be selected.
   [0099]     In some examples, device 100 can include a mechanism for detecting physical contact
   with crown 108. For example, device 100 can include a capacitive sensor configured to detect
   changes in capacitance caused by contact with crown 108, a resistive sensor configured to detect
 0 changes in resistance caused by contact with crown 108, a pressure sensor configured to detect a
   depression of crown 108 caused by contact with crown 108, a temperature sensor configured to
   detect a change in temperature of crown 108 caused by contact with crown 108, or the like. It
   should be appreciated that any desired mechanism for detecting contact with crown 108 can be
   used. In these examples, the presence or absence of contact with crown 108 can be used to stop
25 the scrolling or scaling performed in any of the processes described above (e.g., process 300,
   900, 1500, 2100, or 4100). For instance, in some examples, device 100 can be configured to
   perform scrolling or scaling functions as described above with respect to processes 300, 900,
   1500, 2100, or 4100. In response to detecting an abrupt stop in the rotation of crown 108 (e.g., a
   stop or decrease in rotation speed that exceeds a threshold value) while contact with crown 108
30 is detected, device 100 can stop the scrolling or scaling being performed. This occurrence can
   represent the situation where the user quickly rotates crown 108, but intentionally brings it to a
   stop, indicating a desire to halt the scrolling or scaling. However, in response to detecting an
                                                       32

       WO 2015/034960                                                             PCT/US2014/053951
   abrupt stop in the rotation of crown 108 (e.g., a stop or decrease in rotation speed that exceeds a
   threshold value) while contact with crown 108 is not detected, device 100 can continue the
   scrolling or scaling being performed. This occurrence can represent the situation where the user
   quickly rotates crown 108 by performing a forward or backwards flicking gesture, removes their
 5 finger from crown 108, and rotates their wrist back in order to further wind crown 108 using
   another flicking gesture. In this situation, it is likely that the user does not intend for the
   scrolling or scaling to stop.
   [00100] While processes 300, 900, 2100, ad 4100 have been described above as being used to
   perform scrolling or scaling of objects or views of a display, it should be appreciated that they
 0 can more generally be applied to adjust any type of value associated with the electronic device.
   For example, rather than scroll or scale a view in a particular direction in response to a change in
   position of crown 108, device 100 can instead increase a selected value (e.g., a volume, a time
   within a video, or any other value) by an amount or a speed in a manner similar to that described
   above for scrolling or scaling. Additionally, rather than scroll or scale a view in an opposite
 5 direction in response to a change in position of crown 108 in the opposite direction, device 100
   can instead decrease the selected value by an amount or a speed in a manner similar to that
   described above for scrolling or scaling.
   [00101] One or more of the functions relating to scaling or scrolling a user interface can be
   performed by a system similar or identical to system 4500 shown in FIG. 45. System 4500 can
 0 include instructions stored in a non-transitory computer readable storage medium, such as
   memory 4504 or storage device 4502, and executed by processor 4506. The instructions can also
   be stored and/or transported within any non-transitory computer readable storage medium for use
   by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a
   computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the
25 instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the
   instructions. In the context of this document, a "non-transitory computer readable storage
   medium" can be any medium that can contain or store the program for use by or in connection
   with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The non-transitory computer
   readable storage medium can include, but is not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical,
30 electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus or device, a portable computer
   diskette (magnetic), a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable
   programmable read-only memory (EPROM) (magnetic), a portable optical disc such a CD, CD

  R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-R, or DVD-RW, or flash memory such as compact flash cards, secured
  digital cards, USB memory devices, memory sticks, and the like.
  [00102] The instructions can also be propagated within any transport medium for use by or in
  connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based
5 system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the
  instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. In the context of
  this document, a "transport medium" can be any medium that can communicate, propagate or
  transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system,
  apparatus, or device. The transport medium can include, but is not limited to, an electronic,
0 magnetic, optical, electromagnetic or infrared wired or wireless propagation medium.
  [00103] In some examples, system 4500 can be included within device 100. In these examples,
  processor 4506 can be used as processor 202. Processor 4506 can be configured to receive the
  output from encoder 204, buttons 110, 112, and 114, and from touch-sensitive display 106.
  Processor 4506 can process these inputs as described above with respect to FIGs. 3, 9, 15, 21,
5 and 41, and processes 300, 900, 1500, 2100, and 4100. It is to be understood that the system is
  not limited to the components and configuration of FIG. 45, but can include other or additional
  components in multiple configurations according to various examples.
