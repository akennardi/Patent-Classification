DESCRIPTION                         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
1 / Field of the Invention is Household Rubber Gloves
2 / Household Rubber Gloves are used for many different purposes-such as Hand Laundry -Hand
Dish Washing-Cleaning Tiles-- Wiping Bench Tops-White Goods-Washing Motor Cars and
Pets.
3 / The Clean Touch Rubber Glove is intended as an improvement in the Rubber Glove that enables
the above tasks to be performed with more ease because of the finger tip pads that are formed in the
Rubber Glove during production.

                                                 3/5
DESCRIPTION                       BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0001] The Clean Touch Rubber Glove idea was thought of by The Inventor Alan Thomas as a
Rubber Glove with rubber domes built into the Glove on the underside of the fingers and palms of
the hand.The concept idea being that the raised rubber domes would assist with hand laundry by
agitating and rubbing the garments to help clean better.
[0002] Hand prototypes of the Idea were produced by gluing rubber domes to the underside of the
fingers and hand palms of Rubber Gloves-in total 20 domes were spread over the underside of the
fingers and hand palms of each glove.
[0003] As my intention with the idea was to offer it to a Company that produced Household Rubber
Gloves who may have an interest in taking the concept as a new Rubber Glove idea-I showed the
Hand made prototypes to a large Company who produced Rubber Gloves---who after consideration
replied that it was not feasible to produce the Rubber Gloves in the format I had submitted- with as
described above 20 Rubber Domes as the point of difference with existing Rubber Household
Gloves.
[0004] This response left me disappointed and I decided to not pursue it any further at that time and
I put the idea on hold and pursued other interests.
[0005] I still felt that the idea had merit and as there were no similar Rubber Gloves on the market
and after not looking further at the idea for about 12 months or so--I decided to take another look at
the idea from a fresh perspective .
[0006] I had what is called a' light bulb moment ' when I realised that it is only the finger tips that
are used in most cleaning actions and that the Clean Touch Glove idea could be used in various
cleaning tasks as described in Field of the Invention as well as for hand laundry.
[0007] This lead me to produce new hand made prototypes of the idea with rubber domes only on
the fingertips which worked effectively during testing.Having rubber domes only on the fingertips
also makes new Tooling to produce this Glove concept more practical as a new Rubber Glove.
[0008] Taking this information into account and also that no similar Rubber Glove currently exists
in the Australian market [ or I believe Overseas markets ] I have decided to proceed with applying
for an Australian Innovation Patent.
[0009] I believe that an Innovative step has been taken to create a Novel new Rubber Glove
concept by using the existing Rubber Glove design and adding inbuilt rubber fingertip domes to
create an improved Rubber Household Glove.

DESCRIPTION                        SUMMARY OF THR INVENTION
I / Alan Thomas Inventor of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove has undertaken Market Research to
establish viability of the idea as a new Rubber Glove to be sold in Australian and Overseas markets.
2 / Research has been conducted on various fronts as described below which has shown there is not
a similar Rubber Glove product now available on the Australian market to the Clean Touch Rubber
Glove-and also not in Worldwide markets.
3 / A search of World Patents did not show any same or similar Patented concept as the finger tip
domes of the Touch Clean Rubber Glove.
4 / An Internet search did not show any same or similar Patented idea of Household Rubber Gloves
with fingertip domes intended to assist in cleaning tasks.
5 / A search of Trade Magazines did not show any same or similar Rubber Gloves to the Finger Tip
domes concept of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove.
6 / Personal visits by Inventor Alan Thomas in the Australian market place to Supermarket Chains
-Variety Stores -Hardware Stores did not show there is is any same or similar Rubber Glove
available to the Clean Touch Rubber Glove Concept.
7 / Based on the above research of the unique character of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove-this
information has been taken into account in the decision to apply for an Australian Innovation Patent.

                                                 5/5
DESCRIPTION                     EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
1 / The Rubber Domes that are built into the fingertips of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove to assist
with cleaning actions are the unique main embodiment of the Invention.
2 / The materials used in manufacture of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove can be-Rubber -Latex
Nitrile and / or any other materials found to be suitable in the manufacture of Household Rubber
Gloves.These materials can be used in any combination if required.
3 / The shape of the inbuilt rubber domes of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove can be either round or
oblong and of a size not limited to a certain round diameter or oblong length of the fingertip pads
these characteristics can be of dimensions to fit within the confines of the underside width of the
fingertip sections to suit Large-Medium-or Small size Clean Touch Rubber Gloves.
4 / Height of the finger tip domes of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove can range up to 10 mm.
A more likely practical height will be up to 5 mm.
5 / In Drawings 1 to 5 various configurations are shown for placement of both round and oblong
domes ranging from 5 in number per Glove to 17 per Glove.Any variations or' spin offs' of these
configurations are claimed to be within the scope and integrity of the Invention and are intended to
also allow the Owner of the Patent to produce versions of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove that can
comprise different numbers of fingertip domes.

                                                1/l
CLAIMS
 1 / The fingertip pads of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove provide an advantage standard Rubber
Gloves do not have.In a cleaning action energy is transferred from the fingertips of the user to the
fingerpads and for example cleaning a Benchtop is made easier because the protruding hard rubber
surface of the fmgerpads makes it easier to clean the surface with less effort than is required if just
using pressure on the fingertips.This comment applies to using a cleaning cloth or sponge.
2 / The retail cost of the Clean Touch Rubber Glove should not be greatly different to the cost of
standard Rubber Gloves as the cost to produce will only include a relatively small cost for extra
Rubber material required to form the rubber domes.Consumers generally might expect to pay a little
more for a better product.
3 / The Clean Touch Rubber Glove will have many uses for a variety of purposes and apart from
having benefit for hand laundry and hand dish washing and other cleaning tasks versions with the
same fingerpads could also be offered for
A / A shower massage glove using the finger pads to stimulate the skin
B/ A version also with the same fingerpads could be offered for Pet Washing using the fingerpads
to massage and clean.
4 /The Clean Touch Rubber Glove still offers the same protection as standard Rubber Gloves for the
user to protect their hands against water in hand laundry -dish washing and car washing and to
protect against exposure to grease and grime in other cleaning activity such as cleaning stoves
-bench tops etc. when standard Rubber Gloves are mostly worn.
5 / The Clean Touch Rubber Glove could be brought to Consumers attention at Store level by
positioning it as a Speciality Glove and could for example be placed for sale- with the laundry
detergents and dish washing liquids.
