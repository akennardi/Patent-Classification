         A system for transforming solar electromagnetic radiation energy into
electric    energy    comprises    a  dielectric   structure   permeable   to   an
electromagnetic wave of solar electromagnetic radiation.            The structure

SYSTEM FOR TRANSFORMING                  ENERGY OF SOLAR ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION INTO ELECTRIC ENERGY
Technical Field of the Invention
       The   invention    relates  to a    system   for transforming     energy   of solar
electromagnetic radiation into electric energy characterized by a high transformation
efficiency rate. The system includes a structure located between a pair of electrodes
with the aim to utilize the system for high-efficiency transformation of the energy of
light to electric energy.
State of the Art
       In contemporary        photovoltaics,   more   than  fifty-year-old   principles of
transforming solar electromagnetic radiation or waves (wideband electromagnetic
radiation within the wavelength range of 100 nm to 10000 nm) are generally applied.
The solar cells are composed of two semiconductor layers (with silicon being the
typical material) located between two metal electrodes. One of the layers (an N-type
material) comprises a multitude of negatively charged electrons, whereas the other
layer (a P-type material) exhibits a large number of "holes" definable as void spaces
that easily accept electrons. The devices transforming electromagnetic waves to a
lower-frequency electromagnetic wave, or a direct component, are known as
transvertors/converters. For this purpose, semiconductor structures with different
concepts and types of architecture are applied, respecting only experimental results
of the electromagnetic wave transformation effect.
       Antennas, detectors, or structures designed to date are not tuned into
resonance; the applied semiconductor structures face considerable difficulty in
dealing with emerging stationary electromagnetic waves, and the efficiency of energy
transformation has to be increased via additional measures.
       Similar solutions utilize the principles of antennas or the transformation of a
progressive electromagnetic wave to another type of electromagnetic radiation
(namely a progressive electromagnetic wave having a different polarization or a
stationary electromagnetic wave) and its subsequent processing. Certain problems
occur in connection with the incident electromagnetic wave and its reflection as well

                                            2
as in relation to the broad-spectrum character of solar radiation. In general, it is not
easy to construct an antenna capable of maintaining the designed characteristics in
the wide spectrum for the period of several decades.
      A solution has been proposed in which a single-layered system of tuned
structures is applied to exploit the incident solar radiation; the system is based on a
resonant mode semiconductor.
      The    Czech   patent application    CZ20110042      (and the    subsequent PCT
application W02012/100758, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety and for any and all purposes as if fully set forth herein)
comprises the description of a photovoltaic element arranged on a semiconductor
structure, said element including a resonator with a first planar and a second spatial
part and arranged on a semiconductor structure. The structure is formed by a first
layer with minimum electromagnetic damping, whose upper plane constitutes an
incidence plane, and a second layer with electromagnetic damping. The at least one
resonator is surrounded by a dielectric and arranged in the semiconductor structure.
The layer with electromagnetic damping borders on a reference electrode. The
disadvantage of the solution consists in that the semiconducting substrate may
overheat upon the incidence of an electromagnetic wave having high power density
in the infrared radiation spectra A, B, C, and D. This problem then results in the
reduction of operating life or even complete destruction of the element.
      The following definitions were used in CZ20110042 and apply also in this
document.
      A dielectric is characterized in that its area includes moving charge carriers,
whose number is nevertheless very low; these carriers move the resulting electric
charge in the area of the dielectric. The area also includes such electric charge
carriers or conditions which markedly restrict or, in a limit case, wholly impede the
extent or degree of the motion and transfer of a free electric charge. These carriers or
conditions are, from the electrical perspective, non-conductive in the given frequency
bands of the applied electromagnetic wave; thus, there are no free electric charge
carriers (or, if otherwise, they are found only at rates below 1% of the total
concentration).
      In a layer with minimum electromagnetic damping occurs a minimal decrease
(of up to 10%) of the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave entering the specific
volume of the material.

                                               3
        In a layer with electromagnetic damping, the amplitude of the progressive
electromagnetic wave decreases by at least 10 %.
        The planar (here denoted as "first") part of a resonator is characterized by
planar fabrication. In a technical embodiment, this is a fabricated resonator in which
two dimensions markedly (at least tenfold) dominate over the third one.
        The spatial (here denoted as "second") part of a resonator is characterized by
non-planar fabrication. In a technical embodiment, this is a fabricated resonator in
which two dimensions do not markedly (at least tenfold) dominate over the third one.
        A reference electrode is an electrode to which an electrode of an identical
character is connected from the external area; in the internal area, the electrode
assumes the function of a relating electric field, and relative electric potential is
created; in the direct component of an electromagnetic wave, an electric potential will
appear to which other electric potentials in the given structure are related.
        Dopant material is such material which, in the exemplary embodiment with an
inorganic semiconductor, causes a higher concentration of electric charge carriers.
        The patent application US2011156635 Al discloses a reflected energy
management apparatus and a method for resonance power transmission. Described
herein are two resonators in separate structures; however, with no indication of
presence of electromagnetic damping in a dielectric material.
Summary of the Invention
       The invention is aimed to propose a new architecture of a system for
transforming energy of solar electromagnetic radiation into electric energy. Based on
the utilized construction technology, the system resonates and produces high-value
components of the electric and magnetic fields in such a manner that these
components are utilizable and processible by means of the well-known technology
based on classical electronic elements.
       This invention claims a system for transforming energy of solar electromagnetic
radiation into electric energy, wherein the system comprises a dielectric structure, a
first layer of the dielectric structure, a first resonator, a second layer of the dielectric
structure and a second resonator.
       The dielectric structure comprises a plurality of layers and is permeable to an
electromagnetic wave of the solar electromagnetic radiation.

                                               4
       The first layer of the dielectric structure further comprises a first dielectric
material with minimum electromagnetic damping, and the upper plane of the first
layer comprises an incidence plane of the electromagnetic wave onto the dielectric
structure. The first dielectric material is based on ceramic materials of relative
permittivity in the range of      E = 2-6, e.g. N- or P-doped semiconductors, such as
silicon, germanium or arsenic, and dielectric materials, such as aluminium oxide or
silicon dioxide. The first dielectric material induces the damping of incident
electromagnetic wave, i.e. the decrease of the amplitude of the wave, to a minimum
extent (less than 10 %).
       The first resonator is tuned to a first resonance frequency and comprises two
parts; a first part of the first resonator extends along the upper plane of the first layer
of the dielectric structure, and a second part of the first resonator extends within the
first layer of the dielectric structure. The second part of the resonator is inserted
within the dielectric structure by techniques known in microelectronics and microchip
manufacturing, e.g. lift-off, etching, photoresist etch-off, vapour deposition, or powder
deposition.
       The second layer of the dielectric structure is coupled to the first layer of the
dielectric structure in a direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave to
receive at least a portion of the electromagnetic wave having passed through the first
layer of the dielectric structure. The second layer of the dielectric structure comprises
a second dielectric material with minimum electromagnetic damping. The second
dielectric material can have the same structure than the first dielectric material, i.e.
can be based on ceramic materials of relative permittivity in the range of    E=  2-6, e.g.
N- or P-doped semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium or arsenic, and dielectric
materials, such as aluminium oxide or silicon dioxide. The second dielectric material
induces the damping of incident electromagnetic wave, i.e. the decrease of the
amplitude of the wave, to a minimum extent (less than 10 %). The layered structure
of the     system    is   achieved    by   standard  techniques   of layering    used    in
microelectronics, e.g. stacked die package technology.
       The second layer of the dielectric structure comprises two parts; a first part of
the second resonator extends along a plane between the first layer of the dielectric
structure and the second layer of the dielectric structure, and a second part of the
second resonator extends within the second layer of the dielectric structure. The
second part of the resonator is inserted within the dielectric structure by techniques

                                              5
known      in microelectronics and microchip manufacturing,           e.g. lift-off, etching,
photoresist etch-off, vapour deposition, or powder deposition. The second resonator
is further tuned to a second resonance frequency different from the first resonance
frequency. In preferred embodiments, the second resonance frequency is lower than
the first resonance frequency.
       In some embodiments, there is a plurality of second layers of the dielectric
structure, each layer comprising a resonator with a different resonance frequency. In
preferred embodiments, the resonance frequency of each resonator decreases in the
direction of the propagating wave.
       The last layer of the system induces the damping of electromagnetic wave and
thus prevents the formation of a stationary wave. The electromagnetic damping in the
last layer is achieved by either doping the dielectric material with a material of
specific electric conductivity in the range of 1 pS/m to 10 S/m to form a P- or N-doped
material (e.g. doping of silicon with boron or arsenic by diffusion technology, at the
layer length of 10 pm and at specific electric conductivity of 4 S/m), or by depositing a
thin layer (1-10 pm) of such material on the upper plane of the last-in-line second
layer of dielectric structure, e.g. by chemical vapour or plasma deposition on an
A1203-based layer. The technique of inducing the electromagnetic damping in the
material can be powder deposition, vapour deposition, plasma enhanced chemical
vapor deposition, or by diffusion technologies into the material of the layer.
       In a preferred embodiment, the first part of the first resonator is comprised of a
first pair of electrodes in the form of first coupled conductors arranged in the upper
plane on top of the first layer of the dielectric structure. Simultaneously, the second
part of the first resonator is comprised of a first reflector and a dielectric material of
the first resonator, wherein the first reflector is surrounded by the dielectric material of
the first resonator within the first layer of the dielectric structure. Preferably, the first
reflector is arranged orthogonally to the upper plane of the first layer of the dielectric
structure.
       In another preferred embodiment, the first part of the second resonator is
comprised of a second pair of electrodes in the form of second coupled conductors
arranged in the plane between the first layer of the dielectric structure and the
second layer of the dielectric structure. Simultaneously, the second part of the
second resonator is comprised of a second reflector and a dielectric material of the
second resonator, wherein the second reflector is surrounded by the dielectric

                                                6
material of the second resonator within the second layer of the dielectric structure.
Preferably, the second reflector is arranged orthogonally to the plane between the
first layer and the second layer of the dielectric structure.
        In a preferred embodiment, the resonance frequency of the first resonator
corresponds to a first region of high power spectral density (W/Hz) of the solar
electromagnetic radiation, and the second resonance frequency of the second
resonator corresponds to a second region of high power spectral density of the solar
electromagnetic radiation.
       The    invention   utilizes  the    spectrum  of solar    radiation    in  which   the
electromagnetic wave power flux density (W/m 2 ) is high. Within the present invention,
the system for transforming energy of solar electromagnetic radiation into electric
energy comprising the first resonator arranged on the layered dielectric structure is,
for the selected portion of the spectrum, tuned to the first resonance frequency fl of
the incident electromagnetic wave. The system is tuned in such a manner that it
focuses on areas exhibiting high values of power spectral density (such as the
infrared radiation areas A, B, C, D). Simultaneously, the second resonator is tuned to
the second resonance frequency           f2 of the selected region of the spectrum. The
second resonator then follows the first resonator in the direction of propagation of the
incident electromagnetic wave.
       The tuning of resonators can be achieved in essentially two ways. The first
option is to keep the same dielectric material of the resonator in each layer and to
alter the planar and/or spatial parameters of the resonator. The second option is to
keep the dimensions of the resonator(s) unchanged and to alter the dielectric
material of the resonator in subsequent layers in terms of increasing the dielectric
constant, e.g. the dielectric material of the first resonator can have the relative
permittivity E = 2.0, the dielectric of the second resonator E = 2.2 and so forth.
       The dielectric material of the resonator is a different dielectric than the one used
in the first, or alternatively in the second dielectric material of the first, or the second
layer. Nonetheless, the condition of the dielectric constant within the range of E = 2-6
is maintained. An example constitution of the first dielectric material is an N-doped
silicon with parameters as a ceramic material, whereas the dielectric material of the
first resonator(s) is e.g. aluminium oxide or silicon dioxide. A similar distinction
applies to the second dielectric material and the dielectric material of the second
resonator.

                                           7
      Through such inclusion of other resonators arranged in a plurality of second
layers (even though theoretically an infinite number of resonators can be included,
the real number remains within several hundreds of these elements), a set of
resonators could be built depending on the geographical and climatic conditions.
Therefore, it is possible to exploit the incident electromagnetic wave to acquire the
maximum of energy for subsequent conversion into electric energy. In comparison
with the currently applied solar and photovoltaic elements, the manufacturing
technology and design of the resonators described herein provide for long operating
life and allow high thermal differences. The concept realized within the described
invention is characterized by top efficiency achieved in transforming the solar or
thermal energy into electric energy.
      One advantage of the newly constructed system consists in the manner of its
composition, namely in the layered dielectric structure. This structure is formed by
individual layers of the dielectric material, and each of these layers with dielectric
properties comprises at least one resonator. This arrangement of the layered
dielectric structure generates a minimum amplitude size and the phase of the
backward electromagnetic wave propagating in the direction of the incident
electromagnetic wave emitted by a source, such as the Sun. The system for
transforming energy of solar electromagnetic radiation exploits the necessary portion
of energy, and the actual layered dielectric structure will not heat up due to the
effects caused by the incident or the incident and back-reflected electromagnetic
wave. The resonators are designed in such a manner that the electromagnetic wave
passing through the dielectric structure propagates further beyond the resonator to
other layers with resonators and, at the end of the dielectric structure, into the free
space or a solar system capable of harvesting the remaining energy in the form of
residual heat, an electromagnetic wave, or light. Thus, the resonators behave like an
ideal impedance-matched antenna or an ideal energy converter for the proposed
wide and arbitrarily variable frequency spectrum.
      The layered dielectric structure comprises several components described in the
following   section   of the    text.  The  first dielectric material  with   minimum
electromagnetic damping is comprised in the first layer of the dielectric structure,
wherein said layer is intended to harvest a portion (e.g. 20 %) of the energy of the
incident electromagnetic wave. Along the incidence plane of the first layer extends
the first part of the first resonator. The second part of the first resonator extends

                                               8
within the first layer of the dielectric structure. These parts ensure optimal processing
of the electromagnetic wave; the processing results in minimal reflection of the
electromagnetic wave towards the first resonator. The rest of the energy is left to
leave the area with minimum loss towards subsequent layers.
      Beyond the first layer of the dielectric structure follows the second layer of the
dielectric structure comprising the second dielectric material and is arranged in the
direction of the propagation of electromagnetic wave, wherein said layer is intended
to harvest another portion (e.g. 20 % or other) of the energy of the incident
electromagnetic wave. The second dielectric layer comprises the second resonator
tuned to a second resonance frequency, different from the first resonance frequency.
Providing that there is a plurality of second layers of dielectric structure and that each
layer harvests 20 % of the energy, the number of layers needed to harvest the
energy of the electromagnetic wave is 5 - one first layer and four second layers,
each comprising a resonator with a different resonance frequency.
      The system can be then terminated by the last layer of the dielectric structure
and the electromagnetic wave leaves the system into free space. Alternatively, the
last layer of the system may comprise a component of a solar system which
transforms or otherwise exploits the rest of the electromagnetic wave energy by
converting it into another form of energy, e.g. heat, light or electricity.
      Importantly,    the    designed     system    for transforming     energy  of   solar
electromagnetic radiation into electric energy does not utilize the material to generate
electric charge, but rather uses the structure to set suitable conditions for the
incidence of electromagnetic wave and its transformation to a stationary form of
electromagnetic field.
      Due to the composition of selectively tuned periodical structure on layers within
the system, the system exploits with maximum efficiency the incident energy in the
form of an electromagnetic wave according to its representation in the frequency
spectrum (spectral power density distribution) of the wave. This enables us - in
comparison with resonators not modified as described above - to comprise and
exploit the desired frequency spectrum of the incident electromagnetic wave using a
markedly lower number of tuned structures in the system.
      Based on the present invention, the described solution allows the adaptation of
individual layers of dielectric structure arranged in the resulting system to spectral
power density conditions of the incident electromagnetic radiation as present at a

                                           9
concrete location where the system is applied. Consequently, it is possible to harvest
the maximum of incident electromagnetic radiation and to profit from the change of
radiation to the required form of energy that facilitates further application (for
example, as an electric energy source or generator). The designed systems for
transforming energy of solar electromagnetic radiation are embedded in panels
which, when interconnected, create photovoltaic (solar) fields.
      A significant advantage of the introduced solution lies in the fact that the
construction of the system enables us to set up optimal variants of the solar system
according to the climatic conditions or solar activity. While one of the systems for
transforming energy containing several layers of dielectric structures comprising
resonators can be tuned to one set of resonance frequencies corresponding to the
selected power spectral density, another structure of the system can be tuned to a
different set of resonance frequencies corresponding to a given power spectral
density. The structures are arranged one after another in the direction of the
electromagnetic wave progressing from the source. Therefore, it is possible - for a
given geographical area, solar activities, or electromagnetic wave source - to set a
system facilitating maximum exploitation of the electromagnetic wave as a form of
incident energy.
      The thus composed systems for transforming energy of solar electromagnetic
radiation into electric energy can be manufactured or assembled in a factory or can
be set up directly at the proposed location from a supplied kit.

Exemplary Embodiment of the Invention
      The principle of the construction of a system for transforming energy of solar
electromagnetic radiation into electric energy will be clarified by, but not limited to the
examples provided below.
      The basic embodiment of the system, including a layered dielectric structure, is
provided in Fig. 1. This structure is formed by the first layer 5 of the dielectric
structure comprising a first dielectric material with minimum electromagnetic damping
and a periodical structure of resonators 4, exhibiting a first resonance frequency fl,
and by the second layer 20 of the dielectric structure comprising a second dielectric
material with minimum electromagnetic damping and a periodical structure of
resonators 4, exhibiting a second resonance frequency f2. The proposed periodical
structure allows to operate in the resonance mode for frequencies f with the change
Af, while the parameter of Af/f is within the interval of 0.5 to 1.5. Furthermore, the
layer 5 includes at least one first resonator 4, wherein the first part 4a of the first
resonator 4 extends along the incidence plane 3 of the first layer 5, and the second
part 4b of the first resonator 4 extends within the first layer 5. After the first layer 5 in

                                              11
the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave through the dielectric
structure, there is the second layer 20 of the dielectric structure exhibiting a second
resonance frequency of the second resonator 4. The second layer 20 can represent
one layer or a plurality of layers. Following the second layer 20, there is the last layer
11    of the    dielectric structure     comprising  the    last dielectric  material     with
electromagnetic damping. The last layer 11 is optional and can be removed so that
the layer 20 is followed by free space.
       The actual resonator 4 is described in Figs. 4, 6a and 6b. In this embodiment,
the first part 4a of the resonator 4 comprises a first pair of electrodes in the form of
first coupled conductors 8 arranged in the incidence plane 3 on top of the first layer 5,
and the second part 4b of the first resonator 4 is comprised of a first reflector 7 and a
dielectric material 10a of the first resonator 4 within the first layer 5. The first reflector
7 is surrounded by the dielectric material 10a of the first resonator 4 within the first
layer 5 of the dielectric structure. Furthermore, the first reflector 4 is arranged
orthogonally to the incidence plane 3 of the first layer 5 of the dielectric structure. Fig.
5 shows the arrangement of the dielectric material 10 of the resonator 4 within the
layered structure. The resonator 4 produces electric current or voltage, which is
conducted by the help of a nonlinear component 15 to a connecting component 16;
this situation can be seen in Figs. 7a and 7b, where both types of polarization of
nonlinear component 15 are described.
       Fig. 8 shows an electrical equivalent diagram of the system and explains thus
its operation and structure by means of a circuit scheme equivalent to the actual
structure of the system. The variants concerned are principally a one-way or two-way
rectifier, a shaper, or a signal filter. These types of connections are widely known. A
source 19 of alternating current or voltages caused by the induction from an
electromagnetic wave is connected in parallel to a first capacitor 18 and an inductor
14, which in the connection are comprised of a condenser and a coil. These
components then create a tuned alternating circuit, which is tuned to the
characteristics and parameters of the incident electromagnetic wave and which
resonates. The nonlinear component 15 shapes the signal on the resonant circuit;
this signal is then filtered (rectified) to a further utilizable shape. As the next step,
connection to a second capacitor 17 is realized; in the connection, the capacitor is
comprised of a condenser. Also, in the connection, the connecting components 16
are indicated. These components 16 exhibit electric voltage +U, -U. If a selected

                                               12
electric impedance load 13 in the form of impedance Z is connected to the
connecting components 16 (such as clamps), a variation in the resonant circuit
occurs and the resonator may change its characteristics to such an extent that it will
not be in a suitable resonance mode. Therefore, an electric circuit 12 is introduced
before the electric impedance load 13. With any loading by electrical impedance Z on
its output, this circuit will cause the situation when, on the output, the resonator with
the nonlinear component 15 and the second capacitor 17 is loaded by one and the
same value of impedance Zi, which will not change the set mode of the resonator.
       The function of the system, including a layered dielectric structure, is as follows:
An electromagnetic wave 1 within the wavelength range of 100 nm to 100000 nm
impinges at the wave impingement point 2 on the incidence plane 3 of the first layer 5
with minimum electromagnetic damping. The resonator 4 with the first resonance
frequency is comprised in the first layer 5 and is periodically repeated also in
individual second layers 20 with different resonance frequencies (as shown in Fig. 1
and Fig. 2). In the incidence plane 3 of the first layer 5 and within the structure of the
first layer 5, at least one first resonator 4 is arranged. This resonator may operate
individually or as an interconnection between the resonators, thus creating a field of
periodically repeated solar elements. Along the incidence plane 3, the resonators 4
are connected in parallel or in series, with the formation of at least two resonators 4
on one solar element appearing to be an advantageous solution. These resonators
are interconnected by means of a connecting component 9. The first resonator 4 in
the first layer 5 is tuned to the first resonance frequency f1 from the domain of the
incident electromagnetic wave spectrum; following this layer, the second layer 20
with the second resonator 4 having the second resonance frequency f2 is included in
the direction of the propagation of electromagnetic wave. Thus, the progress occurs
of up to hundreds or thousands of second layers 20 exhibiting different resonance
frequencies fn,     thus creating     the   system for transforming     energy of solar
electromagnetic radiation into electric energy. Also, the resonance frequencies of f1 to
fn do not have to be repeated in the layers, and this rule ensures the maximum
exploitation of energy of the incident electromagnetic wave.

       An electromagnetic wave 1 impinges at the wave impingement point 2 on the
incidence    plane   3.    Here,  the   electric  and   magnetic     components      of the
electromagnetic wave 1 decompose and form the maxima of intensities of the electric
and magnetic fields. This process is realized due to the designed shape of the
reflector 7, which may be formed by a thin layer, a cuboid, a pyramid, a cone, a
toroid, or a sphere, or a combination, part or intersection thereof. The surface of the
reflector 7 may be formed by a layer of a dielectric material, metal, or a combination
and shape variety of both (the components being part of the resonator 4). In order for
the above-mentioned maxima of intensities to add up arithmetically (superpose)
when a connection of two periodically repeated resonators 4 is realized, these
resonators are connected via the connecting component 9 (as shown in Fig. 2). This
figure shows an example of the proposed system for transforming energy of solar
electromagnetic radiation into electric energy where two resonators 4 are arranged
along the incidence plane 3 of the first layer 5. These resonators 4 are periodically
repeated and are interconnected by means of the connecting components 9.
       In one embodiment of the system, as shown in Fig. 3, the resonator 4 is
arranged in a layered dielectric structure and the first layer 5 of the dielectric structure
is followed directly by the last layer 11. Mutual arrangement of individual parts of the
system is shown in Fig. 4. The first resonator 4 comprises two parts, wherein the first
part 4a comprises a pair of electrodes in the form of coupled conductors 8 and the
second part 4b comprises the first reflector 7 and the dielectric material 10a of the
first resonator 4. The first resonator 4 is further embedded in the layered dielectric
structure. The geometry of the system is designed in relation to the wavelength of the
incident electromagnetic wave, namely in such a manner that the thickness of the

                                                14
dielectric structure will be at least  1% of the wavelength of the lowest frequency of the
incident electromagnetic radiation. The proposed geometry design will ensure the
resulting resonance characteristic and depends on the shape of resonator (dipole,
split ring circle shape, split ring rectangle shape, patch, spot resonators).
       After impinging on the incidence plane 3, the electromagnetic wave permeates
through the layered dielectric structure. On the upper plane of the first layer 5, at the
location of the incidence plane 3, the first part 4a of the first resonator 4 is arranged,
whereas the second part 4b extends within the first layer 5 with minimum
electromagnetic damping (as illustrated in Figs. 3 or 4). The first layer 5 with
minimum electromagnetic damping is instrumental towards setting the conditions of
the maxima of electric and magnetic components in incidence plane 3 of the
electromagnetic wave and is measurable as the reflection coefficient is less than 0.5
from the interval of <-1,1>. In this respect, the layered dielectric structure is designed
in such a manner that the progressing electromagnetic wave on the layered dielectric
structure could couple and create a resonant area with the maximum resonance on
the incidence plane 3. The first layer 5 with minimum electromagnetic damping may
be equipped with a reference electrode 21. The electromagnetic wave further
progresses behind the first layer 5 with minimum electromagnetic damping; the wave
creates only a minimal reflected wave the reflection coefficient is less than 0.5 from
the interval of <-1,1>.        The    dimensions of the first layer 5 with        minimum
electromagnetic damping are selected to be equal to or greater than one quarter of
the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic wave in relation to the relative
permittivity of dielectric material 10 (for example, both layers may show the thickness
of 10 pm for the selected type of material).
        By achieving the resonant state, there occurs - in the at least one solar element
within the group of periodically repeating elements that are ordered one after another
in the direction of the incident electromagnetic wave - a multiple increase of
amplitudes of the original incident electromagnetic wave; for the assumed
wavelength of the electromagnetic wave 1 impinging on the incidence plane 3 of the
first layer 5 of the dielectric structure, we can obtain an electric voltage applicable for
further processing by the electric circuit 12 that manages the performance and mode
of the layered structure designed for energy harvesting (energy exploitation, "power
management").

                                              15
      A high-quality conductor or dielectric is applied as the material of conductive
paths formed in the incidence plane 3, on which the first part 4a of the resonator 4 is
arranged; the same high-quality conductor is also used for the material of coupled
conductors 8, the connecting component 9, and the nonlinear component 15. The
conductor exhibits different relative permittivity with respect to the relative permittivity
of the first layer 5 with minimum electromagnetic damping. The first layer 5 with
minimum electromagnetic damping is formed by a combination of the dielectric
material 10 and a conductive and/or semi-conductive material. The design of the
resonator, its arrangement, and the selection of the materials were all realized in
such a manner that, in the first layer 5 with minimum electromagnetic damping, the
reflection coefficient is less than 0.5 from the interval of <-1,1>.
      The designed dielectric structure of the system for transforming energy of solar
electromagnetic radiation into electric energy operates in the resonant state, which
enables us to advantageously obtain on the resonator 4 multiple (1-10000) values of
amplitude of the electric component of the incident electromagnetic wave 1. The
proposed periodic arrangement of the solar system facilitates operation in the
resonant mode for frequencies f within the range of 0.1THz to 5000 THz of the
incident electromagnetic wave spectrum.
      The solution known from prior art using antennas and standard resonant circuits
usually achieves only the ratio of selective properties, and it is not possible to design
this solution for the above-stated frequency range of the incident electromagnetic
wave 1. The approach proposed herein, due to the application of a higher number of
tuned elements in the entire photovoltaic/solar system, enables us to achieve energy
transformation in the above-specified frequency range. This condition can be
advantageously utilized for the design of an optimally layered dielectric structure and
for approaching the ideal state of 100% exploitation rate, or transformation of the
electromagnetic wave 1 incident on the elements to the generator output. Thus, the
proposed approach can be applied to facilitate permanent use of the designed
system characterized by high efficiency, operating life, and independence of thermal
parameters of the realized systems.
      A necessary prerequisite for the utilization of the system for transforming energy
of solar electromagnetic radiation into electric energy (at the very minimum) as an
electric energy source consists in connecting the external electric circuit 12, which
enables us to achieve the state that, at any loading (external impedance load 13

                                             16
assumes the values from the interval 0 to - Ohms) of the circuit 12 output, the
variation of external electric impedance load 13 on the input of the circuit 12 will not
manifest itself. Thus, the basic component or group of components will remain in the
resonant state.
