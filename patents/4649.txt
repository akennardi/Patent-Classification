   Field of the Invention
   This invention relates to stable injectable solutions containing diphosphonates.
   Background
15 Various diphosphonic acids can be used as therapeutic active agents for the
   treatment of hypercalcaemia and in medication for the treatment of diseases such as
   osteoporosis and tumor osteolysis. In a prepared solution, the active agent will be
   present as anions and is generally called diphosphonate, bisphosphonate or
   biphosphonate. An injection solution of diphosphonate can be prepared from the
20 diphosphonic acid or one of its salts. A convenient method for administering these
   active agents is by intravenous infusion of prepared solutions into the bloodstream of
   a patient to be treated.
   One diphosphonic acid, pamidronic acid is currently available in the form of a
25 lyophilised product to be reconstituted prior to use. This reconstitution step involves
   not only both time and effort, but also introduces the possibility of adverse
   consequences through, for example improper reconstitution and mixing of the powder
   and contamination prior to administration. Previous efforts to formulate pamidronate
   solutions have suffered from stability problems with the solutions showing turbidity
30 and loss of active product over time.
   Glass has long been the material of choice for containers for pharmaceutical
   products. However, it has been found that diphosphonate solutions left in glass for

                                                  2
   extended periods display unacceptable levels of turbidity despite the good solubility
   and chemical stability of diphosphonates generally.
   It is known that the level of turbidity of diphosphonate solutions in glass is affected by
 5 the pH of the solution, and that the level of turbidity decreases with increased acidity.
   An approach to minimise the problem of reaction between the active substances and
   glass leachates is the use of excipients such as polyethylene glycols or acid buffers
   such as organic acids. Whilst the use of such excipients may assist, it is generally
   preferable to minimise the number of additional constituents of any injectable product
10 solution.
   Summary of the Invention
   Surprisingly, the inventors have found that it is possible to formulate stable
   diphosphonate solutions such as, in particular, pamidronate, which are neither highly
15 acidic nor which involve the use of buffer systems. The inventors have found that
   solutions of diphosphonates of relatively neutral pH values do exhibit satisfactory
   stability provided appropriate containers are used.
   This    invention    provides    a   stable  and   pre-prepared   injectable  solution   of
20 diphosphonate ready to be diluted by a practitioner administering the product to the
   patient. This enables the product to be provided in a consistent quality and avoids the
   need for the practitioner to reconstitute the active agent at the time of administration.
   According to one aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical product
25 comprising a container containing a diphosphonate in solution, wherein the solution:
          (a)   has a pH of between 5 and 8;
          (b)   is free of organic acid buffer and polyethylene glycol;
   and wherein the container consists of at least one component manufactured from
   glass having at least a surface in contact with the solution, at least one said surface
30 having been pre-treated to protect against the leaching of impurities from the glass by
   the solution.

                                                 3
   According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical
   product comprising a container containing a diphosphonate in solution, wherein the
   solution:
          (a)  has a pH of approximately 6.5; and
 5        (b)  is free of organic acid buffer and polyethylene glycol
   and wherein the container consists of at least one component manufactured from
   glass having at least a surface in contact with the solution, at least one said surface
   having been pre-treated so as to protect against the leaching of impurities from the
   glass by the solution.
10
   According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical
   product comprising a container containing a diphosphonate in solution, wherein the
   solution:
          (a)  has a pH of between 5 and 8;
15        (b)  is free of organic acid buffer and polyethylene glycol; and
   wherein the container consists of at least one component manufactured from a
   non-glass material.
   According to a further aspect the present invention provides a method of preparing a
20 pharmaceutical product, said method comprising the steps of:
          (a)  preparing a suspension of pamodronic acid in water;
          (b)  adding sodium hydroxide solution to the suspension to obtain a second
               solution;
          (c)  adjusting the pH of the second solution to between 5 and 8; and
25        (d) transferring the second solution to a container.
   Description
   In order to obtain adequate long-term stability, appropriate containers must be used
   for the solution of diphosphonate. Appropriate containers for this product include
30 ampoules, vials, bottles, ready to use syringes and Shell Glass Vials.
   It is believed that the principal cause of turbidity where glass containers have been
   used in the past is the leaching out from the glass of aluminium and/or other cations
   such as magnesium or calcium, depending upon the glass composition.

                                                4
   Where glass containers are used it is necessary to pre-treat the contact surface of the
   glass with an appropriate method to protect against the leaching of impurities from the
   glass by the solution. Preferably all potential contact surfaces will be appropriately
 5 treated. In this way, the extent to which impurities leach from the glass over time is
   reduced. A preferred method of pre-treatment is a siliconization process using a one
   percent silicone solution to wash the vials, followed by double draining and heating at
   3100C for thirty minutes. Vials pre-treated in this manner are available from the
   French vial manufacturer Saint-Gobain Desjonqueres (SGD).
10
   Other vial pre-treatment techniques include the use of a high purity SiO 2 barrier
   formed on the inside vial surface by a plasma-deposition process. The process
   involves microwave energy being applied to a silicon containing precursor in the
   presence of oxygen. A plasma forms and a SiO 2 layer is formed on the glass surface
15 from the gas phase. Vials pre-treated in this manner are available from Schott.
   In addition to treating the surface of the glass, it is also recommended to use
   containers which are made from glass having a low aluminium content. Glass typically
   used for pharmaceutical vials has in the order of 5 percent aluminium oxide. In order
20 to reduce the problem of aluminium ion leaching, glass with lower aluminium content
   is recommended.
   Where the solution is stored in a stoppered vial, the stopper provides a potential
   source of contamination. Typical elastomeric stoppers are potentially a source of
25 metal ions eg calcium, zinc and magnesium ions which can react with the
   diphosphonate to form insoluble matter. In order to reduce the possibility of
   contamination, stoppers with low levels of these ions and other potential contaminants
   are to be used, preferably coated to form an inert barrier. An example of an
   appropriate stopper is the Daikyo D777-1 stopper. Daikyo D777-3 stoppers may also
30 be used. Preferably the stopper has a low calcium, magnesium and ash content and
   is at least coated on the contact surface (being the surface of the stopper which when
   placed in a vial is exposed to the contents of the vial) with a fluorinated resin such as
   tetrafluoroethylene   polymer,   trifluorochloroethylene polymer,     tetrafluoroethylene
   hexafluoropropylene copolymer, fluorovinylidene polymer, vinylidene fluoride polymer,

                                                    5
   vinyl     fluoride    polymer,     tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene       copolymer,      ethylene
   tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, or perfluoroalkoxy polymer. It is more preferred that
   the stopper is coated with a fluorinated resin selected from a group consisting of
   tetrafluoroethylene     polymer,    trifluorochloroethylene polymer,       tetrafluoroethylene
 5 hexafluoropropylene copolymer, vinylidene fluoride polymer, vinyl fluoride polymer,
   and tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer. For example, the stopper can be a
   FluroTec@ stopper manufactured by Daikyo and distributed by West Pharmaceuticals
   Services.
10 Containers, such as vials, may be constructed from any suitable other materials in
   addition to glass, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polymethylpentene. For
   example, the vial could be constructed from Crystal Zenith@ resin as manufactured by
   West Pharmaceuticals Services.
15 This invention is generally applicable to all diphosphonates. Specifically, this includes
   solutions of pamidronate, zolindronate, chlodronate, etidronate, alendronate and
   tiludronate. These can be prepared from their respective diphosphonic acid form or
   from a therapeutically acceptable salt form. The acids of the above diphosphonates
   are:- pamidronic acid [(3-amino-1 -hydroxypropylidene) diphosphonic acid], zoledronic
20 acid [(1)-hydroxy-2-(1 H-imidazol-1 -yl)ethylidene) diphosphonic acid]; chlodronic acid
   [dichloromethylene      disphosphonic       acid];   etidronic   acid   [(1-hydroxyethylidene)
   diphosphonic acid]; alendronic acid [(4-amino-1-hydroxy-butylidene diphosphonic
   acid]; and tiludronic acid [[((p-chloro-phenyl)thio)methylene] diphosphonic acid]
   respectively.     This   invention     is  particularly   applicable   to   pamidronate     and
25 zolendronate.
   It is preferred to have a product within the biological pH range i.e. of between about 5
   and 8, to reduce the incidence of potential adverse reactions relating to acidic or
   alkaline solutions. Surprisingly it has been found that a stable solution can be
30 produced having a pH of 5 - 8. A pH level of approximately 6.5 is preferred. At pH
   levels below about 5 there is a risk of producing venous type irritations and other
   unwanted side effects, pH levels above about 8 give rise to generally unacceptable
   levels of turbidity.

                                                 6
   Solutions of diphosphonates will generally have a pH above that desired. For
   example, a solution of one percent pamidronate disodium salt in distilled water has a
   pH of approximately 8.3. The pH is adjusted with a suitable acid or alkali. Suitable
   acids include any acid such as hydrochloric or phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is
 5 preferred. Suitable alkalis include sodium hydroxide.
   As the person skilled in the art will appreciate, other standard components, such as
   sugar alcohols and sodium chloride and water may be included in the solution, as
   required. Mannitol is the preferred sugar alcohol.
10
   Pamidronate solutions are preferably prepared by slowly adding sodium hydroxide
   solution to a suspension of pamidronic acid in water in a 2:1 molar ratio of sodium
   hydroxide to pamidronic acid, adding mannitol if desired, mixing by stirring until both
   pamidronic acid and mannitol (if appropriate) are completely dissolved and adjusting
15 the pH with phosphoric acid and if necessary sodium hydroxide solution. Preferably
   the preparation of the solutions is carried out under nitrogen. Other diphosphonate
   solutions can be prepared in analogous fashion.
   Example 1:
20 Preparation of pamidronate solution.
   To a mixing vessel approximately 10% of the required amount of Water for Injection is
   added and then bubbled with nitrogen gas for at least 15 minutes. The sodium
   hydroxide, in an amount to give a 2:1 molar ratio to pamidronic acid is then added
25 with stirring to dissolve and the solution cooled to less than 300C.
   A different closed mixing vessel is flushed with nitrogen gas for at least 15 minutes.
   Approximately 70% of the Water for Injection is added to the closed mixing vessel
   through a port and the mixing bubbled with nitrogen gas for at least 15 minutes.
30 Pamidronic acid is then added to the mixing vessel with stirring and mixed for 5
   minutes giving a suspension. The sodium hydroxide solution is then added over a 5
   minute period with stirring to give a clear solution. Mannitol is then added to the
   solution with stirring for at least 5 minutes until dissolved. The pH is then checked and
   adjusted to a range of between 5 and 8 preferably, between 6.3 and 6.7 by addition of

                                                7
   1.ON phosphoric acid at the rate of approximately 12.1 g/L (calculated on total batch
   size) and if necessary 1.0N sodium hydroxide, whilst keeping the temperature
   between 350C and 450C. The volume is adjusted to the required level with Water for
   Injection and the solution cooled to below 300C. The pH is then rechecked and
 5 adjusted if necessary to between 6.3 and 6.7, with 1.0N phosphoric acid or 1.0N
   sodium hydroxide if and as necessary.
