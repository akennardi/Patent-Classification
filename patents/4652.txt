20 BACKGROUND
            The prime neuropathological event distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is
   deposition of the 40-42 residue amyloid 3-peptide (AP) in brain parenchyma and cerebral
   vessels. A large body of genetic, biochemical and in vivo data support a pivotal role for AP in
   the pathological cascade that eventually leads to AD. Patients usually present early symptoms
25 (commonly memory loss) in their sixth or seventh decades of life. The disease progresses with
   increasing dementia and elevated deposition of Ap. In parallel, a hyperphosphorylated form of
   the microtubule-associated protein tau accumulates within neurons, leading to a plethora of
   deleterious effects on neuronal function. The prevailing working hypothesis regarding the
   temporal relationship between AP and tau pathologies states that AP deposition precedes tau
30 aggregation in humans and animal models of the disease. Within this context, it is worth
   noting that the exact molecular nature of AP, mediating this pathological function is presently
                                                     1

an issue under intense study. Most likely, there is a continuum of toxic species ranging from
lower order AP oligomers to supramolecular assemblies such as AP fibrils.

      WO 2013/190302                                                         PCT/GB2013/051606
           The AP peptide is an integral fragment of the Type I protein APP (AP amyloid
   precursor protein), a protein ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. Since soluble AP can be
   found in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and in the medium from cultured cells,
   APP has to undergo proteolysis. There are three main cleavages of APP that are relevant to the
 5 pathobiology of AD, the so-called a-, P-, and y-cleavages. The a-cleavage, which occurs
   roughly in the middle of the AP domain in APP is executed by the metalloproteases ADAM1O
   or ADAM17 (the latter also known as TACE). The j-cleavage, occurring at the N terminus of
   AP, is generated by the transmembrane aspartyl protease Beta site APP Cleaving Enzymel
   (BACE1). The y-cleavage, generating the AP C termini and subsequent release of the peptide,
10 is effected by a multi-subunit aspartyl protease named y-secretase. ADAMI10/17 cleavage
   followed by y-secretase cleavage results in the release of the soluble p3 peptide, an N
   terminally truncated AP fragment that fails to form amyloid deposits in humans. This
   proteolytic route is commonly referred to as the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Consecutive
   cleavages by BACE1 and y-secretase generates the intact AP peptide, hence this processing
is scheme has been termed the amyloidogenic pathway. With this knowledge at hand, it is
   possible to envision two possible avenues of lowering AP production: stimulating non
   amyloidogenic processing, or inhibit or modulate amyloidogenic processing. This application
   focuses on the latter strategy, inhibition or modulation of amyloidogenic processing.
           Amyloidogenic plaques and vascular amyloid angiopathy also characterize the brains
20 of patients with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome), Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with
   Amyloidosis of the Dutch-type (HCHWA-D), and other neurodegenerative disorders.
   Neurofibrillary tangles also occur in other neurodegenerative disorders including dementia
   inducing disorders (Varghese, J., et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2003, 46, 4625-4630).
   B-amyloid deposits are predominately an aggregate of AB peptide, which in turn is a product
25 of the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). More specifically, AB peptide results
   from the cleavage of APP at the C-terminus by one or more y-secretases, and at the N
   terminus by -secretase enzyme (BACE), also known as aspartyl protease or Asp2 or Beta site
   APP Cleaving Enzyme (BACE), as part of the -amyloidogenic pathway.
           BACE activity is correlated directly to the generation of AB peptide from APP (Sinha,
30 et al, Nature, 1999, 402, 537-540), and studies increasingly indicate that the inhibition of
   BACE inhibits the production of AR peptide (Roberds, S. L., et al, Human Molecular
                                                  2

   Genetics, 2001, 10, 1317-1324). BACE is a membrane bound type 1 protein that is
   synthesized as a partially active proenzyme, and is abundantly expressed in brain tissue. It is
   thought to represent the major -secretase activity, and is considered to be the rate-limiting
   step in the production of amyloid-3-peptide (AP).
 s          Drugs that reduce or block BACE activity should therefore reduce AP levels and levels
   of fragments of AP in the brain, or elsewhere where AP or fragments thereof deposit, and thus
   slow the formation of amyloid plaques and the progression of AD or other maladies involving
   deposition of AP or fragments thereof. BACE is therefore an important candidate for the
   development of drugs as a treatment and/or prophylaxis of A-related pathologies such as
10 Down's syndrome, 3-amyloid angiopathy such as but not limited to cerebral amyloid
   angiopathy or hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, disorders associated with cognitive impairment
   such as but not limited to MCI ("mild cognitive impairment"), Alzheimer's Disease, memory
   loss, attention deficit symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease, neurodegeneration
   associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or dementia including dementia of mixed
is vascular and degenerative origin, pre-senile dementia, senile dementia and dementia
   associated with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or cortical basal
   degeneration.
            It would therefore be useful to inhibit the deposition of AP and portions thereof by
   inhibiting BACE through inhibitors such as the compounds provided herein.
20          The therapeutic potential of inhibiting the deposition of AP has motivated many groups
   to isolate and characterize secretase enzymes and to identify their potential inhibitors.

   yn-1-yl)pyridin-3-yl]-3'H-dispiro[cyclohexane-1,2'-inden-1'2'-imidazole]-4"-amine         may be
   obtained by starting from a solution of (1r,1'R,4R)- 4-methoxy-5'" -methyl-6'-[5-(prop- 1-yn- 1
   yl)pyridin-3-yl]-3'H-dispiro[cyclohexane-1,2'-inden-1'2'-imidazole]-4"-amine in a suitable
30 solvent, for example 2-propanol, acetonitrile, or acetone or mixtures of these with water,
   followed by mixing the obtained solution with (1 S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid directly or
                                                   13

   dissolved in a suitable solvent for example 2-propanol or water, at a temperature between
   room temperature and 80 'C. Crystallization may be obtained by evaporation of solvent and/or
   by cooling the solution or directly as a salt reaction crystallization. Seed crystals may be used
   to start the crystallization. Seeds may be prepared from the batch itself by sampling a small
 5 volume of the solution and then rapidly cooling it to induce crystallization. Crystals are then
   added to the batch as seeds.
   XRPD Analysis:
            X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD) was performed on samples prepared
   according to standard methods, for example those described in Giacovazzo, C. et al (1995),
10 Fundamentals of Crystallography, Oxford University Press; Jenkins, R. and Snyder, R. L.
   (1996), Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry, John Wiley & Sons, New York; Bunn,
   C. W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; or Klug, H. P. &
   Alexander, L. E. (1974), X-ray Diffraction Procedures, John Wiley and Sons, New York. X
   ray diffraction analyses were performed using a PANanlytical X'Pert PRO MPD
15 diffractometer for 96 minutes from 1 to 600 20. XRPD distance values may vary in the range
   ±2 on the last decimal place.
            The relative intensities are derived from diffractograms measured with variable slits.
            The measured relative intensities vs. the strongest peak are given as very strong (vs)
   above 50%, as strong (s) between 25 and 50%, as medium (m) between 10 and 2 5%, as weak
20 (w) between 5 and 10% and as very weak (vw) under 5% relative peak height. It will be
   appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the XRPD intensities may vary between different
   samples and different sample preparations for a variety of reasons including preferred
   orientation. It will also be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that smaller shifts in the
   measured Angle and hence the d-spacing may occur for a variety of reasons including
25 variation of sample surface level in the diffractometer.
