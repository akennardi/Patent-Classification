                     BIODEGRADABLE DRUG DELIVERY COMPOSITION
                         CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]      This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>
   which is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2011336896, the entire contents of
   which are herein incorporated by reference. The present application also claims the benefit of
   and expressly incorporates by reference herein the entire disclosure of U.S. Provisional
   Application No. 61/417,126, filed November 24, 2010; and U.S. Provisional Application No.
   61/563,469, entitled "Radiation- Sterilized Biodegradable Drug Delivery Composition,"
   Attorney Docket No. DURE-079PRV, filed on November 23, 2011.
[0002]       A variety of compositions designed for the delivery of beneficial agent, such as depot
   compositions, are available which utilize various combinations of polymers, solvents and other
   components. However, many of these compositions require multiple components and/or
   preparation steps which serve to complicate the formulation process. In addition, various
   additives may be required in order to provide a composition suited to the desired mode of
   administration or to provide the desired release kinetics. For example, currently available
   formulations designed to provide extended release of beneficial agents often rely on high
   viscosity vehicles which have poor syringeability and injectability and are therefore unsuitable for
   use with narrow gauge needles or needless injectors. Alternatively, existing low-viscosity
   formulations which may be suitable for injection often lack desired release kinetics, showing
   significant initial burst, followed by an exponentially declining release profile. The present
   disclosure addresses these issues and provides related advantages.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0003]       The present disclosure provides biodegradable drug delivery compositions including a
   vehicle, e.g., a single phase vehicle, and an insoluble component comprising a beneficial agent in
   the vehicle. In some embodiments, the composition is not an emulsion, but has a low viscosity
   which can provide good injectability and syringeability and further provides for sustained release
   of the beneficial agent over time, and minimized initial burst. Also provided, are kits including
   the biodegradable drug delivery composition or components thereof, as well as methods of
   making and using the biodegradable drug delivery composition.
[0004]       A surprising aspect of the biodegradable drug delivery compositions disclosed herein is
   that they typically maintain a low viscosity both at room temperature prior to
                                                   1

       insoluble beneficial agent is a beneficial agent which may be dispersed in a vehicle and
       which is not significantly dissolved in the vehicle. An insoluble beneficial agent may
       include, e.g., a molecule which is substantially insoluble in a vehicle composition as
       described herein. An insoluble beneficial agent may include, for example, a beneficial
       agent having a solubility of less than 1 mg/mL in the vehicle at 25 GC.

       "substantially insoluble" as used in this context means that at least 90%, e.g., at least
       95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5% of the beneficial agent complex is
       insoluble in the vehicle at 25 'C. For instance, an insoluble beneficial agent complex is a
       complex which may be dispersed in a vehicle and which is not significantly dissolved in
       the vehicle. An insoluble beneficial agent complex may include, e.g., a charge
       neutralized complex. An insoluble beneficial agent complex may include, for example, a
       beneficial agent having a solubility of less than 1 mg/mL in the vehicle at 25 'C.

       analogues and prodrugs of beneficial agents.
[0045]          As used herein, the term "non-aqueous" refers to a substance that is substantially
       free of water. Non-aqueous compositions have a water content of less than about 5%,
       such as less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than 0.5%, or less than 0.1%, by
       weight. The present compositions are typically non-aqueous.
[0046]          As used herein, the terms "burst effect" and "burst" are used interchangeably to

       Syringeability may be quantified, for example, by measuring the force required to move
       a known amount of a composition through a syringe and needle, per unit time.
[0048]          As used herein the term "injectability" refers to the performance of a composition
       during injection and includes factors such as pressure or force required for injection,
       evenness of flow, aspiration qualities, and freedom from clogging. Injectability may be
       quantified e.g., by measuring the force required to move a known amount of a
       composition through a syringe and needle, per unit time.
[0049]          The terms "polypeptide" and "protein", used interchangeably herein, refer to a
       polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which can include coded and non-coded
       amino acids, chemically or biochemically modified or derivatized amino acids, and
       polypeptides having modified peptide backbones. The term includes fusion proteins,
       including, but not limited to, fusion proteins with a heterologous amino acid sequence,
       fusions with heterologous and native leader sequences, with or without N-terminal
       methionine residues; immunologically tagged proteins; fusion proteins with detectable
       fusion partners, e.g., fusion proteins including as a fusion partner a fluorescent protein,

       environment. Unlike polymeric matrices that are formed by a phase inversion, phase
       separation, or gelation process in an aqueous environment, the rate controlling cloud or
       film does not have appreciable physical strength or mechanical structure.
[0052]          As used herein "bioavailability" refers to the fraction of the beneficial agent dose
       that enters the systemic circulation following administration.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0065]          As discussed above, the present disclosure provides a biodegradable drug
       delivery composition, e.g., an injectable biodegradable drug delivery depot composition,
       including a vehicle, e.g., a single phase vehicle, and an insoluble component comprising
       beneficial agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent complex, dispersed in the vehicle. In
       some embodiments, the vehicle includes a biodegradable polymer present in an amount
       of from about 5% to about 40% by weight of the vehicle and a hydrophobic solvent (or
       mixture of hydrophobic solvents) present in an amount of from about 95% to about 60%
       by weight of the vehicle. In addition to the vehicle, the composition includes an insoluble
       component comprising beneficial agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent complex,
       dispersed in the vehicle. In some embodiments, the biodegradable composition has a
       zero shear viscosity less than 1,200 centipoise at 25 'C and is not an emulsion or gel.
       Biocompatible-Biodegradable Polymers
[0066]          A variety of polymers may be suitable for use in the compositions of the present
       disclosure provided that they are both biocompatible and biodegradable. For example,
                                                  39

  WO 2012/074883                                                             PCT/US2011/062139
       suitable polymers may include, but are not limited to, homopolymers, block-copolymers
       and random copolymers. Suitable polymers include those polymers or combinations of
       polymers which have solubility of at least about 20 weight %, 30 weight %, or 40 weight
       % in the selected solvent or solvent combination. In some embodiments, suitable
       polymers include polymers having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, e.g., an
       AB-type block copolymer composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. Such
       polymers may have a tendency to form micelles when exposed to an aqueous
       environment as a result of the amphiphilic character of the polymer. Suitable polymers
       may include, but are not limited to, polylactides, polyglycolides, polycaprolactones,
       copolymers including any combination of two or more monomers involved in the above,
       e.g., terpolymers of lactide, glycolide and e-caprolactone, and mixtures including any
       combination of two or more of the above. In other words, suitable polymers may also
       include, for example, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polycaprolactones, copolymers
       including any combination of two or more monomers involved in the above, e.g.,
       terpolymers of lactic acid, glycolic acid and e-caprolactone, and mixtures including any
       combination of two or more of the above.
[0067]          In some embodiments, the biodegradable polymer is polylactic acid (PLA), e.g., a
       PLA including an ionizable end-group (e.g., an acid end-group, e.g., in an acid
       terminated PLA). Acid end-group PLAs include, e.g., lactate initiated PLAs described
       herein. In some embodiments, the PLA includes an unionizable end-group (e.g., an ester
       end-group, e.g., in an ester terminated PLA). Ester end-group PLAs include, but are not
       limited to, dodecanol-initiated (dd) PLAs described herein. In some embodiments, the
       PLA is dl-PLA. In other embodiments, the biodegradable polymer is poly(lactic-co
       glycolic acid) (PLGA), e.g., dl-PLGA. In some embodiments, the PLGA includes an
       ionizable end-group, e.g., an acid end-group. Acid end-group PLGAs include, but are not
       limited to, the glycolate initiated (ga) PLGAs described herein. In some embodiments,
       the PLGA includes an unionizable end-group, e.g., an ester end group. Ester end-group
       PLGAs include, but are not limited to, dodecanol initiated PLGAs described herein. In
       one embodiment, where the polymer is a polycaprolactone, the polycaprolactone is
       poly(s)caprolactone.
[0068]          The biocompatible, biodegradable polymer is present in the vehicle in an amount
       ranging from about 5% to about 40% by weight of the vehicle, for example, from about
       6% to about 35%, from about 7% to about 30%, from about 8% to about 27%, from
       about 9% to about 26%, from about 10% to about 25%, from about 11% to about 24%,
       from about 12% to about 23%, from about 13% to about 22%, from about 14% to about
                                                 40

  WO 2012/074883                                                                PCT/US2011/062139
       21%, from about 15% to about 20%, from about 16% to about 19%, or at about 17% by
       weight of the vehicle. In some embodiments, the polymer is present in an amount of
       about 20% by weight of the vehicle.
[0069]          In some embodiments, the biocompatible, biodegradable polymer has a weight
       average molecular weight of from about 2kD to about 20kD, e.g., from about 2kD to
       about 5kD, from about 2kD to about 1OkD, or from about 2kD to about 15kD. Additional
       embodiments include a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer having a weight average
       molecular weight of from about 5kD to about 15kD, e.g., about 1OkD.
       Solvents
[0070]          Hydrophobic solvents suitable for use in the compositions of the present
       disclosure are hydrophobic solvents which are capable of solubilizing a polymer
       component of the vehicles described herein. Hydrophobic solvents can be characterized
       as being insoluble or substantially insoluble in water. For example, suitable hydrophobic
       solvents have solubility in water of less than 5% by weight, less than 4% by weight, less
       than 3% by weight, less than 2% by weight or less than 1% by weight, e.g. as measured
       at 25 'C. A suitable hydrophobic solvent may also be characterized as one which has a
       solubility in water of about 5% or less, about 4% or less, about 3% or less, about 2% or
       less, or about 1% or less, at 25 GC. For example, in some embodiments, a suitable
       hydrophobic solvent has a solubility in water of from about 1% to about 7%, from about
       1%to about 6%, from about 1% to about 5%, from about 1% to about 4%, from about
       1%to about 3%, and from about 1% to about 2%, at 25 GC. A suitable hydrophobic
       solvent may also be characterized as a solvent in which water has limited solubility, e.g.,
       a solvent in which water has solubility of less than 10% by weight, less than 5% by
       weight, or less than 1% by weight, at 25 'C. In some embodiments, a suitable
       hydrophobic solvent is one which solubilizes the polymer component of the vehicle and
       which when combined with the polymer component in a suitable amount as described
       herein results in a vehicle having a low viscosity, i.e., a zero shear viscosity less than
       1,200 centipoise at 25 C.
[0071]          In some embodiments, suitable solvents include derivatives of benzoic acid
       including, but not limited to, benzyl alcohol, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, n-propyl
       benzoate, isopropyl benzoate, butyl benzoate, isobutyl benzoate, sec-butyl benzoate, tert
       butyl benzoate, isoamyl benzoate and benzyl benzoate.
[0072]          In some embodiments, benzyl benzoate is selected as the hydrophobic solvent for
       use in the biodegradable delivery compositions of the present disclosure.

  WO 2012/074883                                                               PCT/US2011/062139
[0073]          A suitable solvent may be a single solvent selected from among the following or
       a combination of two or more of the following: benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, ethyl
       benzoate, and ethanol.
[0074]         Where the solvent is a hydrophobic solvent, it may be used in combination with
       one or more additional solvents, e.g., one or more hydrophobic solvents and/or one or
       more polar/hydrophilic solvents.
[0075]          In some embodiments, the compositions include a single hydrophobic solvent as
       described herein without including any additional solvents. In some embodiments, the
       single hydrophobic solvent is benzyl benzoate, in other embodiments the single
       hydrophobic solvent is other than benzyl alcohol.
[0076]         Where the solvent is a polar/hydrophilic solvent, it is used in the disclosed
       compositions only in combination with a hydrophobic solvent and is present in a
       relatively small amount relative to the hydrophobic solvent, e.g., less than 5% (e.g., less
       than 4%, less than 3%, less than 2%, or less than 1%) by weight of the vehicle. For
       example, a polar/hydrophilic solvent may be present in the vehicle in an amount of from
       about 5% to about 1% (e.g., from about 4% to about 1%, from about 3% to about 1%, or
       from about 2% to about 1%) by weight of the vehicle. Without wishing to be bound by
       any particular theory, it is believed that the addition of relatively small amounts of
       polar/hydrophilic solvent, e.g., ethanol, to the vehicle composition may broaden the
       range of polymers in terms of polymer type, molecular weight, and relative
       hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity which may be utilized in the disclosed compositions.
[0077]          The hydrophobic solvent (or combination of hydrophobic solvents) is present in
       the vehicle from about 95% to about 60% by weight of the vehicle, for example, from
       about 94% to about 61%, from about 93% to about 62%, from about 92% to about 63%,
       from about 91% to about 64%, from about 90% to about 65%, from about 89% to about
       66%, from about 88% to about 67%, from about 87% to about 68%, from about 86% to
       about 69%, from about 85% to about 70%, from about 84% to about 71%, from about
       83% to about 72%, from about 82% to about 73%, from about 81% to about 74%, from
       about 80% to about 75%, from about 79% to about 76%, or from about 78% to about
       77% by weight of the vehicle. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic solvent (or
       combination of hydrophobic solvents) is present in the vehicle from about 95% to about
       90%, from about 95% to about 85%, from about 95% to about 80%, from about 95% to
       about 75%, from about 95% to about 70%, from about 95% to about 65%, or from about
       95% to about 60% by weight of the vehicle. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic
       solvent is present in an amount of about 80% by weight of the vehicle. In other

       of the vehicle.
[0078]          In some embodiments, the biodegradable drug delivery compositions disclosed
       herein are free of hydrophilic solvent. In some embodiments, the biodegradable delivery
       compositions disclosed herein do not include a thixotropic agent, e.g., a lower alkanol
       containing 2-6 carbon atoms.
       Beneficial Agents
[0079]          A variety of beneficial agents may be delivered using the biodegradable delivery
       compositions disclosed herein. General classes of beneficial agents which may be
       delivered include, for example, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, nucleotides, nucleosides
       and analogues thereof, antigens, antibodies, and vaccines; as well as low molecular
       weight compounds.
[0080]          In some embodiments, the beneficial agent is at least substantially insoluble in
       the vehicle, e.g., solubility in the vehicle less than 10 mg/mL, less than 5 mg/mL, less
       than 1 mg/mL, less than 0.5 mg/mL, less than 0.3 mg/mL, less than 0.2 mg/mL, or less
       than 0.1 mg/mL.
[0081]          Beneficial agents which may be delivered using the biodegradable delivery
       compositions disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, agents which act on the
       peripheral nerves, adrenergic receptors, cholinergic receptors, the skeletal muscles, the
       cardiovascular system, smooth muscles, the blood circulatory system, synaptic sites,
       neuroeffector junction sites, endocrine and hormone systems, the immunological system,

       e.g., a compound having a molecular weight of less than or equal to about 800 Daltons.
       In some embodiments, where the beneficial agent is a low molecular weight compound,

       mg/mL, less than 1 mg/mL, less than 0.5 mg/mL, less than 0.3 mg/mL, less than 0.2
       mg/mL, or less than 0.1 mg/mL.
[0098]          The beneficial agent or beneficial agent complex may be present in any suitable
       concentration in the biodegradable compositions disclosed herein. Suitable
       concentrations may vary depending on the potency of the beneficial agent, beneficial
       agent pharmacokinetic half-life, etc. For example, the insoluble component comprising
       beneficial agent, e.g., insoluble beneficial agent complex, may be present in a range of
       from about 1% to about 50% by weight of the composition, e.g., from about 5% to about
       45%, from about 10% to about 40%, from about 15% to about 35%, or from about 20%
       to about 30% by weight of the composition. The insoluble component comprising
       beneficial agent, e.g., insoluble beneficial agent complex, may be present at a
       concentration ranging from about 10 mg/mL to about 500 mg/mL, such as from about 50
       mg/mL to about 450 mg/mL, about 100 mg/mL to about 400 mg/mL, about 150 mg/mL
       to about 350 mg/mL, or about 200 mg/mL to about 300 mg/mL.
[0099]          In some embodiments, the beneficial agent is an insoluble beneficial agent as
       defined herein, i.e., a beneficial agent which is completely or substantially insoluble in
       the vehicle chosen for use in connection with the biodegradable drug delivery
       compositions described herein. In other words, at least 90%, e.g., at least 95%, at least
       98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5% of the beneficial agent is insoluble in the vehicle at
       25 'C. An insoluble beneficial agent is a beneficial agent which may be dispersed in a
       vehicle and which is not significantly dissolved in the vehicle. An insoluble beneficial
       agent may include, e.g., a molecule which is substantially insoluble in a vehicle
       composition as described herein.
       Insoluble Complex
[00100]         The beneficial agent may be provided as an insoluble beneficial agent complex,
       e.g., an electrostatic complex, which is dispersed in the vehicle. Complexing may be
       used to reduce the solubility of beneficial agents. As defined previously herein, the term
       "insoluble beneficial agent complex", includes beneficial agent complexes which are
       completely or substantially insoluble in the vehicle chosen for use in connection with the
                                                  48

  WO 2012/074883                                                                PCT/US2011/062139
       biodegradable drug delivery compositions described herein. The term "substantially
        insoluble" as used in this context means that at least 90%, e.g., at least 95%, at least
        98%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5%, of the beneficial agent complex is insoluble in the
        vehicle at 25 'C. In other words, an insoluble beneficial agent complex is a complex
        which may be dispersed in a vehicle and which is not significantly dissolved in the
        vehicle. An insoluble beneficial agent complex may include, e.g., a charge-neutralized
        complex. The term "charge-neutralized complex" is used herein to refer to a complex
        formed as a result of a non-covalent charge-based interaction between a beneficial agent
        and an associated molecule, metal, counter ion, etc., and having no net charge or
        substantially no net charge. Included within this definition are charge neutralized
       beneficial agents including salts of the beneficial agents.
[00101]          This complexation contributes to the beneficial release characteristics of the
        disclosed compositions as discussed herein, e.g., by contributing to the chemical and
       physical stability of the beneficial agent in the composition, e.g., by reducing
        degradation of the beneficial agent or providing a complex, which exhibits reduced
        settling due to gravitational force. In some embodiments, the insoluble beneficial agent
        complex is formed by including a precipitating and/or stabilizing agent which when
        combined with the beneficial agent induces formation of an insoluble complex. The
        insoluble beneficial agent complex may result, for example, from an electrostatic
        interaction which takes place between the beneficial agent and one or more precipitating
        and/or stabilizing agents. In some embodiments, the insoluble beneficial agent complex
        is charge neutralized. Complexation may also reduce a level of chemical conjugation
        which may occur between the beneficial agent and other components of the formulation,
        e.g., polymer, in the absence of the complexation.
[00102]          The insoluble beneficial agent complex according to the present disclosure may
       be characterized as follows: when 10 mg of the insoluble beneficial agent complex is
        dispersed and left to stand in 1 mL of a test solution of phosphate buffered saline at pH
        7.4 at 37 0 C for 24 hours, the amount of beneficial agent dissolved in the test solution is
        less than 60% of the beneficial agent in the 10 mg of insoluble beneficial agent complex,
        e.g., less than 50% of the beneficial agent in the 5 mg of insoluble beneficial agent
        complex, less than 40% of the beneficial agent in the 5 mg of insoluble beneficial agent
        complex, less than 30% of the beneficial agent in the 5 mg of insoluble beneficial agent
        complex, or less than 20% of the beneficial agent in the 5 mg of insoluble beneficial
        agent complex.

  WO 2012/074883                                                                   PCT/US2011/062139
[00103]          In some embodiments, the precipitating or stabilizing agent is a charged species,
        e.g. a charged molecule, a metal ion or a salt form of a metal ion. Persons having
        ordinary skill in the art will understand that the salt forms of metal ions are not
        themselves charged species, but rather provide the source, upon dissociation, of the
        charged species. For example, in some embodiments, the precipitating agent and/or
        stabilizing agent is protamine, or a divalent metal ion such as Ni 2 +, Cu 2 +, Zn2+, Mg2+
        and/or Ca 2 +. The divalent metal may be present in the composition as e.g., zinc acetate,
        zinc carbonate, zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, magnesium acetate, magnesium carbonate,
        magnesium chloride, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium sulfate,
        calcium acetate, calcium carbonate, calcium chloride, calcium sulfate and the like. That
        is, the divalent metal salt may be included during preparation of the composition such
        that a divalent metal salt of the beneficial agent is formed. These precipitating agents
        and/or stabilizing agents find particular use when the selected beneficial agent is a
        negatively charged protein or peptide.
[00104]           It should be noted that the net charge of the beneficial agent may also be
        adjusted, for example by adjusting the pH. Accordingly, a suitably charged precipitating
        agent and/or stabilizing agent may be selected based on the net charge of the protein or
        peptide which may be adjusted. For example, where the beneficial agent has a net
        positive charge, e.g., as a result of pH adjustment, a negatively charged molecule such as
        carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) may be utilized as the precipitating agent and/or
        stabilizing agent.
[00105]          Thus, some embodiments involve a method of making a complex involving
        contacting at least one of a protein and peptide with a cationic complexing agent at a pH
        greater than 8, e.g., greater than 8.5 or greater than 9, such as 8 to 10, or 8 to 9, to form a
        complex. Examples of the cationic complexing agent include, but are not limited to,
        protamine, poly-lysine, poly-arginine, polymyxin, and combinations thereof.
[00106]          Other embodiments involve a method of making a complex involving contacting
        at least one of a protein and peptide with an anionic complexing agent at a pH less than
        3, e.g., less than 2.5 or less than 2, such as I to 3 or 2 to 3, to form a complex. Examples
        of the anionic complexing agent include, but are not limited to, carboxy-methyl

[00107]          In some embodiments, following complexing at a specified pH as discussed
        above, e.g., at a pH greater than 8 or less than 3, it may be beneficial to remove
        supernatant from the mixture formed by contacting the beneficial agent with the
        complexing agent so at to remove non-complexed, e.g., non-charge-neutralized,

       beneficial agent, prior to use of the beneficial agent complex in the compositions
        disclosed herein.
[00108]          In some embodiments, a cationic agent is complexed with the beneficial agent to
        form the insoluble beneficial agent complex. Suitable cationic agents may include, but
        are not limited to, protamine, poly-lysine, poly-arginine, polymyxin, Ca2+ and Mg 2 +.
        Anionic agents may also be utilized as appropriate to form the insoluble beneficial agent
        complex. Suitable anionic agents may include, but are not limited to, CMC as mentioned
        above as well as poly-adenosine and poly-thymine. Where the anionic agent is poly
        adenosine, the poly-adenosine may be, for example, a 10mer to a 150mer. Where the
        anionic agent is poly-thymine, the poly-thymine may be, for example, a 10mer to a
        1500mer.
[00109]          Two or more precipitating agents and/or stabilizing agents may be utilized in
        combination to facilitate formation of the insoluble beneficial agent complexes described
       herein, e.g., for improved chemical or physical stability of the beneficial agent in the
        complex and/or improved drug release kinetics, e.g., reduced burst effect and/or a
        sustained delivery profile. For example, the combination of protamine and a divalent
        metal or salt thereof with a protein beneficial agent may form an insoluble complex
        which when dispersed in the vehicle of the disclosed compositions provides a
        composition having a desired beneficial agent release profile in vivo. In addition, such
        combinations of precipitating and/or stabilizing agents may improve the chemical and
       physical stability of the beneficial agent complex and render the complex more resistant
        to sterilization conditions, e.g., radiation sterilization, including electron beam
        sterilization and gamma radiation sterilization.
[00110]          Accordingly, in some embodiments the insoluble beneficial agent complex
        includes beneficial agent in combination with both protamine and a divalent metal or salt
        thereof (e.g. Zn2+ or Zinc acetate). The molar ratio of beneficial agent:divalent metal or
        salt:protamine (e.g., beneficial agent:zinc:protamine) may be in the range of 1: 0.5 to 2.0:
        0.3 to 0.5.
[00111]          Protamine may be used alone or in combination with one of the precipitating
        agents and/or stabilizing agents described above to form an insoluble beneficial agent
        complex according to the present disclosure. In some embodiments, e.g., where the
        composition is to be administered to a human or non-human animal, it may be desirable
        to include an additive such as methionine in order to provide a radiation-stable
        composition. This may be useful for example, where the beneficial agent is a protein or a
       peptide. Methionine may be added, e.g., to the composition prior to lyophilization or
                                                    51

  WO 2012/074883                                                                PCT/US2011/062139

        sterilized, e.g., via gamma irradiation, either before or after combining the powder with a
        vehicle as described herein.
[00112]          In some embodiments, the composition maintains a purity of at least 90% or
        greater (e.g., 95%) for a period of at least 24 hours following exposure to gamma
        irradiation at a dose of 25 kGy. In some embodiments, a purity of at least 90% or greater
        (e.g., 95%) is maintained for a period of at least one month.
[00113]          The insoluble beneficial agent complexes are present in the composition in the
        form of insoluble particles. The size of these particles may differ depending on the
        methods used to prepare the beneficial agent complex. Typically, the particles are small
        enough to pass through a small needle, such as a 25 gauge needle. In some embodiments
        the insoluble beneficial agent complex is dispersed in the vehicle in the form of particles
       having an average size ranging from about 1pm to about 400pm in diameter or in largest
        dimension, e.g., from about 1pm to about 300pm, from about 1pm to about 200pm, from
        about 1pm to about 100pm, from about 1pm to about 90pm, from about 1pm to about
        80pm, from about 1pm to about 70pm, from about 1pm to about 60pm, from about 1pm
        to about 50pm, from about 1pm to about 40pm, from about 1pm to about 30pm, from
        about 1pm to about 20pm, or from about 1pm to about 10pm in diameter or in largest
        dimension. In some embodiments, the insoluble beneficial agent complex is dispersed in
        the vehicle in the form of particles having an average size ranging from about 10 pm to
        about 100 pm in diameter or in largest dimension. Particles sizes in this range in
        combination with density matching, e.g., wherein the density of the particles is the same
        or similar to the density of the vehicle, contribute to the improved syringeability and
        injectability of the compositions disclosed herein.
[00114]          In some embodiments, the density of the insoluble particles is approximately the
        same as the density of the vehicle in which the particles are dispersed. This provides for
        increased physical stability of the particles in the vehicle and improved dispersion of the
       particles in the vehicle particularly during storage of the compositions, e.g., at low
        temperatures such as 2-8'C. For example, in some embodiments, both the particles and
        the vehicle have a density of between about 0.9 and 1.2g/cm 3 . In some embodiments, the
        average density of the particles does not differ from that of the vehicle by more than
        0.25g/cm 3, e.g., by more than 0.20g/cm 3, by more than 0.15g/cm 3 , or by more than 0.05
        g/cm 3. In some cases, the apparent density of the vehicle is within 10%, e.g., within 8%,
        within 5%, or within 3%, of the apparent density of the particles.

        Additional Components
[00115]          A variety of additional components may be added to the disclosed compositions
        provided they do not substantially disrupt the beneficial characteristics of the
        compositions as discussed herein, e.g., viscosity, etc. Suitable components may include,
        but are not limited to, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, e.g.,
        stabilizers, dyes, fillers, preservatives, buffering agents, antioxidants, wetting agents,
        anti-foaming agents and the like. Additional components may include, e.g., sucrose,
        polysorbate, methionine, etc.
[00116]          For example, methionine may be included in a composition of the present
        disclosure as an antioxidant, and in some embodiments sucrose is included as a
        stabilizer. As discussed above, methionine may be combined with an insoluble beneficial
        agent complex as described herein to form a radiation stable powder or a radiation stable
        composition as described herein.
[00117]          In some embodiments, a high-viscosity carrier such as sucrose acetate isobutyrate
        (SAIB) may be included in a composition of the present disclosure. For example, SAIB
        may be included in an amount ranging from about 5% to about 20%, such as about 5% to
        about 10%, by weight of the vehicle.
[00118]          In some embodiments, the vehicle comprises about 5% to 10% SAIB, about 70%
        to about 75% of the hydrophobic solvent, and about 15% to 25% of the biodegradable
        polymer, wherein each % is % by weight of the vehicle. In one or more embodiments,
        the vehicle comprises about 5 to about 10% SAIB, about 65% to about 70% benzyl
        benzoate, about 3% to about 7% ethanol, and about 15% to about 25% poly(lactic-co
        glycolic acid) (PLGA), wherein each % is % by weight of the vehicle. In some
        embodiments, the vehicle comprises about 15% to about 25% SAIB, about 55% to about
        65% benzyl benzoate, about 5% to about 15% benzyl alcohol, and about 5% to about
        15% polylactic acid (PLA), wherein each % is % by weight of the vehicle. In one or
        more embodiments, the vehicle comprises about 65% to about 75% benzyl benzoate,
        about 5% to about 15% benzyl alcohol, and about 15% to about 25% polylactic acid
        (PLA), wherein each % is % by weight of the vehicle.
[00119]          In one or more embodiments, inclusion of SAIB at 8% by weight of the vehicle,
        allows for inclusion of the hydrophobic solvent at 72%, by weight of the vehicle and
        inclusion of the biocompatible, biodegradable polymer at 20% by weight of the vehicle.
        In some embodiments, the amount of SAIB in the composition may be adjusted provided
        that the weight % of the hydrophobic solvent is maintained between about 60 and about
                                                    53

  WO 2012/074883                                                                PCT/US2011/062139
        95% by weight of the vehicle and the weight % of the biocompatible, biodegradable
        polymer is maintained between about 5 and about 40% by weight of the vehicle.
[00120]          For instance, the amount of SAIB may be adjusted from 0 to 35% by weight of
        the vehicle, e.g., in 1% intervals, provided that the percentages of the hydrophobic
        solvent and the biocompatible, biodegradable polymer are adjusted accordingly,
        preferably provided that the zero shear viscosity of the resulting composition does not
        exceed 1,200 cP at 25 'C. Without reciting each combination of the above three
        components that fall within the specified ranges, it is to be understood that all such
        combinations are within the scope of the present disclosure and further that this is
        intended to provide antecedent basis for specific recitations of any combination of the
        above three components that meet the above range and viscosity recitations.
        Methods of Preparation
[00121]          In general, the present compositions may be made by any of the various methods
        and techniques known and available to those skilled in the art.
[00122]          The compositions of the present disclosure may be prepared generally by
        combining a biodegradable polymer as described herein and a hydrophobic solvent as
        described herein to form a vehicle of the composition. The biodegradable polymer is
        typically provided in an amount of from about 5% to about 40% by weight of the
        vehicle, and the hydrophobic solvent is typically provided in an amount of from about
        95% to about 60% by weight of the vehicle. The insoluble component comprising
        beneficial agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent complex, is dispersed in the vehicle.
        Such dispersion may occur following one or more milling or sieving steps to obtain
        particles of a desired size. One or more homogenization steps may be utilized following
        dispersion of the insoluble beneficial agent or insoluble beneficial agent complex in the
        vehicle. It should be noted that within the above ranges the % by weight of the
        biodegradable polymer and the hydrophobic solvent may be adjusted while maintaining a
        desired viscosity range, e.g., a zero shear viscosity less than 1,200 centipoise (cP), e.g.,
        less than 1000cP, less than 500cP or less than 100cP at 25 'C. In addition, one or more
        additional components may be included in the vehicle as described previously herein.
[00123]          Insoluble beneficial agent complex particles may be prepared, for example, by
        dissolving the beneficial agent in a suitable buffer and subsequently adding a suitable
        amount of a stabilizing/precipitating agent until a precipitate is formed at a temperature
        greater than the freezing point but less than the boiling point of the buffer. The suitable
        buffer with dispersed precipitate is then subjected to a suitable drying process, e.g., spray
                                                  54

  WO 2012/074883                                                               PCT/US2011/062139
       drying or lyophilization, to provide a powder comprising insoluble beneficial agent
       complex. Alternatively, the precipitate can be recovered by centrifugation and removal
       of the resulting supernatant. It can then be re-suspended in aqueous medium for spray
       drying or lyophilized directly. One or more size reduction and sieving steps may be
       utilized to adjust the particle size of the beneficial agent complex. The complexed
       powder is mixed with a suitable amount of the prepared vehicle to disperse the beneficial
       agent complex particles in the vehicle. In some embodiments, where the beneficial agent
       is a low molecular weight compound, the beneficial agent complex may include only the
       salt form of the beneficial agent, provided that the salt form of the beneficial agent is at
       least substantially insoluble in the vehicle. The formulation may be sterilized prior to use
       using any suitable method known in the art, e.g., gamma sterilization at a dose of 10 kGy
       or greater. Alternatively, the beneficial agent complex and the vehicle may be sterilized
       separately and then combined prior to use.
       Biodegradable Formulations
[00124]        As discussed previously herein, in some embodiments, the biodegradable
       compositions of the present disclosure include A) a single phase vehicle including i) a
       biodegradable polymer present in an amount of from about 5% to about 40% (e.g., from
       about 6% to about 29%, from about 7% to about 28%, from about 8% to about 27%,
       from about 9% to about 26%, from about 10% to about 25%, from about 11% to about
       24%, from about 12% to about 23%, from about 13% to about 22%, from about 14% to
       about 21%, from about 15% to about 20%, from about 16% to about 19%, or from about
        17% to about 18%) by weight of the vehicle, and ii) a hydrophobic solvent present in an
       amount of from about 95% to about 60% (e.g., from about 94% to about 61%, from
       about 93% to about 62%, from about 92% to about 63%, from about 91% to about 64%,
       from about 90% to about 65%, from about 89% to about 66%, from about 88% to about
       67%, from about 87% to about 68%, from about 86% to about 69%, from about 85% to
       about 70%, from about 84% to about 71%, from about 83% to about 72%, from about
       82% to about 73%, from about 81% to about 74%, from about 80% to about 75%, from
       about 79% to about 76%, or from about 78% to about 77%) by weight of the vehicle; and
       B) an insoluble component comprising beneficial agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial
       agent complex, dispersed in the vehicle, wherein the biodegradable composition has a
       zero shear viscosity less than 1,200 centipoise (cP) (e.g., less than 1100cP, less than
        1000cP, less than 900cP, less than 800cP, less than 700cP, less than 600cP, less than
                                                   55

  WO 2012/074883                                                                 PCT/US2011/062139
        500cP, less than 400cP, less than 300cP, less than 200cP, or less than 1OOcP) at 25 'C, is
        injectable through a small gauge needle and is not an emulsion or gel.
[00125]          In some embodiments, a biodegradable composition of the present disclosure has
        a zero shear viscosity less than 1,200cP (e.g., less than 11OOcP, less than 1000cP, less
        than 900cP, less than 800cP, less than 700cP, less than 600cP, less than 500cP, less than
        400cP, less than 300cP, less than 200cP, or less than 1OOcP) at 25 'C.
[00126]          It should be noted that the amount of the biodegradable polymer and the amount
        of the hydrophobic solvent may be varied, for example, to achieve a desired viscosity,
        e.g., in 1% by weight increments, provided that they are typically maintained within
        about 5% to about 40% by weight of the vehicle and about 95% to about 60% by weight
        of the vehicle, respectively. Accordingly, without reciting every possible combination
        falling within the above ranges, this is intended to provide antecedent basis for such
        combinations.
[00127]          In some embodiments, the zero shear viscosity of the biodegradable composition
        is from about 1OOOcP to about 1OOcP, e.g., about 900cP to about 1OOcP, about 800cP to
        about 1OOcP, about 700cP to about 1OOcP, about 600cP to about 1OOcP, about 500cP to
        about 1OOcP, about 400cP to about 1OOcP, about 300cP to about 1OOcP, or about 200cP
        to about 1OOcP at 25 -C.
[00128]          In some embodiments, in addition to a relatively low viscosity at 25 'C, the
        disclosed biodegradable compositions also exhibit relatively low viscosity at 37 GC., e.g.,
        a zero shear viscosity less than 500cP, less than 400cP, less than 300cP, less than 200cP,
        or less than 1OOcP. In some embodiments, the zero shear viscosity of the biodegradable
        composition is from about 500cP to about 1OOcP, from about 400cP to about 200cP, or
        about 300cP at 37 C. The viscosity of these formulations declines with increasing
        temperature; frequently in exponential fashion.
[00129]          The disclosed biodegradable compositions also typically exhibit relatively low
        viscosity (e.g., a zero shear viscosity less than 500cP, less than 400cP, less than 300cP,
        less than 200cP, or less than 1OOcP) at 37 'C after being exposed to phosphate-buffered
        saline in vitro, and maintain this low viscosity over time, e.g., for at least Shrs, at least
        24hrs, at least 48hrs, at least 72hrs, or at least 168hrs, of exposure to phosphate-buffered
        saline.
[00130]          Surprisingly, the disclosed biodegradable depot compositions typically
        demonstrate good syringeability and injectability while providing for sustained release of
        the beneficial agent in-vivo with minimal burst. Syringeability and injectability may be
        characterized by the time it takes to inject a known volume of the biodegradable depot
                                                    56

  WO 2012/074883                                                                  PCT/US2011/062139
        composition through a syringe of known size fitted with a relatively small gauge needle,
        e.g., a 1-5 mL syringe fitted with a needle having a gauge of about 21 to about 27. In
        some embodiments, the biodegradable depot compositions of the present disclosure may
        be characterized as having good syringeability and injectability based on their ability to
        be injected through a lml syringe fitted with an approximately 0.5in needle having a
        gauge of about 21 to about 27, wherein a 0.5ml volume of the biodegradable depot can
        be injected in less than 25 sec (e.g., less than 20 sec., less than 15 sec, less than 10 sec, or
        less than 5 sec) at 25 'C with the application of a 5 to 101b force. In some embodiments,
        under the above conditions, the biodegradable depot can be injected in a range of from
        about 25 sec to about 1.5 sec, e.g., from about 20 sec to about 1.5 sec, from about 15 sec
        to about 1.5 sec, from about 10 sec to about 1.5 sec, or from about 5 sec to about 1.5 sec.
[00131]           In addition to good injectability and syringeability as described herein, in some
        embodiments, the biodegradable compositions of the present disclosure demonstrate
        minimal burst and sustained delivery of beneficial agent over time. "Minimal burst" may
        be characterized in terms of Cmax/Cmin, wherein the acceptable      Cmax/Cmin  upper limit may
        vary depending on the beneficial agent to be delivered. In some embodiments, the weight
        % of beneficial agent released as burst over the first 24 hours is less than 30% of the total
        amount released over one week, e.g., less than 20% or less than 10%, of the total amount
        released over one week. In some embodiments, the weight % of beneficial agent released
        as burst over the first 24 hours is less than 10% of the total amount released over one
        month, e.g., less than 8% or less than 5%, of the total amount released over one month.
        As used herein, "sustained delivery" refers to durations which are at least several fold,
        e.g., at least 5 fold to at least 10 fold, longer than the duration obtained from a single
        dose of an immediate-release (IR) formulation of the same beneficial agent (determined
        by Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) characteristics of the
        beneficial agent itself).
[00132]           As mentioned above, the disclosed biodegradable compositions provide for
        sustained release of the beneficial agent in-vivo with minimal burst effect in addition to
        possessing good injectability, syringeability and chemical stability as discussed above.
        This is an unexpected and surprising result as currently available formulations generally
        provide either controlled release or injectability/syringeability but not both. For example,
        commercially available depot formulations may rely on the formation of an extremely
        viscous polymer matrix to provide controlled release of a beneficial agent. However,
        such formulations have poor injectability/syringeability due to the viscous nature of the
        depot. Alternatively, other commercially available formulations utilize vehicles which
                                                     57

  WO 2012/074883                                                               PCT/US2011/062139
        may have good injectability/syringeability due to a high-solvent content but poor control
        over release of the beneficial agent. Moreover, one would expect a low viscosity liquid
        composition such as those disclosed herein to have poor release kinetics in the form of a
        substantial burst effect and an exponentially declining delivery profile. Contrary to this
        expectation, the present compositions demonstrate low burst effect and good control over
       release of the beneficial agent over a period of one day to one month or longer.
[00133]          Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the
       beneficial release characteristics of the compositions of the present disclosure are due at
        least in part to the formation of a fluid, non-structured (without any appreciable
        mechanical integrity), "rate-controlling cloud" or "rate-controlling film" at the surface of
        the composition in vivo. The rate-controlling cloud or film can be characterized as
        occurring at the surface of the composition in the aqueous environment. The desirable
        controlled delivery characteristic of the disclosed compositions may result from the rate
        controlling contributions of both the insoluble component comprising beneficial agent,
        e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent complex, dispersed in the liquid core of the
        composition and the polymer cloud or film on the surface of the composition. In
        addition, in some embodiments, a synergistic effect with respect to release rate control,
        e.g., as demonstrated by MRT, is seen as an apparent result of interaction between the
       beneficial agent complex and the rate controlling cloud or film. While the rate
        controlling cloud or film lacks appreciable mechanical integrity, it has a measureable
        thickness less than 10 pm.
[00134]          In some embodiments, the compositions of the present disclosure lack of gel
        forming or gelling characteristics. For example, many prior art vehicle compositions
        exhibit gel formation when aged at 37'C which can be characterized by an increase in
        the storage modulus relative to the loss modulus. In contrast, the compositions of the
       present disclosure can be characterized by a relatively large G"/G' ratio, e.g., a G"/G'
       ratio of greater than or equal to 10, such as greater than or equal to 15 or greater than or
        equal to 20, following aging at 37'C for a period of 14 days, wherein G" is the loss
        modulus and G' is the storage modulus.
[00135]          In certain embodiments, the compositions are Newtonian. For instance, in some
        cases, the viscosity of the composition at 25'C varies less than 7%, less than 6%, less
        than 5%, less than 4%, or less than 3%, when measured at a shear rate ranging from 7
        sec-1 to 500 sec- 1.

       representation of a composition comprising a charge-neutralized complex of a beneficial

  WO 2012/074883                                                                 PCT/US2011/062139
       agent containing acid groups such as a peptide or protein. During the event of charge
       neutralization, either peptide or protein or any acid terminated molecule can become
       negatively charged at basic pH (pH>8) in the presence of buffer. The charged beneficial
       molecule in aqueous solution will be neutralized with solution of positively charged
       counter-ion such as protamine or Zn      ion at an optimal molar ratio. This molar
       concentration of either protamine or zinc ion is obtained by titration of protamine or zinc
       ion against the fixed concentration of negatively charged peptide or protein. The molar
       concentration of either protamine or zinc ion will also depend on the net charge on the
       protein or peptide and its molar concentration. The aqueous solubility of charge
       neutralized complex (peptide or protein plus counter-ion) is dramatically reduced and it
       will precipitate out of solution. Any charged species of protein or peptide and counter
       ion remain in the solution. The dried powder of insoluble beneficial agent - counter-ion
       complex can be uniformly dispersed in a polymer solution (vehicle) either by hand or
       mechanical mixing (e.g. homogenization). The resultant formulation controls the release
       of the beneficial agent via solubility, dissolution rate, and diffusivity. Electrostatic,
       hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions may also occur between the dispersed
       particles of charge-neutralized beneficial agent and polymer, and these may also
       modulate the release kinetics as manifested by the surprising contribution by the
       polymer-complex interaction to MRT of the beneficial agent in vivo.
[00137]         In some embodiments, the disclosed compositions are suspensions that remain
       substantially homogenous for about 3 months, even more preferably for about 6 months,
       and yet even more preferably, for about 1 year. In one or more embodiments, the
       insoluble beneficial agent complex remains physically and chemically stable in the
       suspension vehicle for about 3 months, even more preferably for about 6 months, and yet
       even more preferably, for about 1 year.
       Administration of Biodegradable Formulations
[00138]         As discussed previously herein, the disclosed biodegradable formulations possess
       low viscosity along with good injectability and syringeability making them well suited
       for delivery via a syringe (e.g., a 1-5 mL syringe) with a narrow gauge needle, e.g., 21 to
       27 gauge. In addition, the injectable depot formulations may also be delivered via one or
       more needless injectors known in the art.
[00139]         Suitable routes of administration include, but are not limited to, subcutaneous
       injection and intramuscular injection. Suitable routes of administration also include, for
                                                  59

  WO 2012/074883                                                                 PCT/US2011/062139
        example, intra-articular and intra-ocular, e.g., intra-vitreal, administration for local
        delivery.
[00140]          The formulations disclosed herein may also find use in oral formulations, e.g.,
        formulations delivered in a gel-cap (soft or hard) or as a mouthwash.
[00141]          The formulations disclosed herein may also find use as coatings for medical
        devices, e.g., implantable medical devices. Such coatings may be applied, e.g., by dip
        coating the medical device prior to implantation.
[00142]          The formulations of the present disclosure may be formulated such that a desired
        pharmacological effect is achieved via administration on a periodic basis. For example,
        the formulations may be formulated for administration on a daily, weekly or monthly
        basis.
[00143]          The actual dose of the beneficial agent or insoluble beneficial agent complex to
        be administered will vary depending on the beneficial agent, the condition being treated,
        as well as the age, weight, and general condition of the subject as well as the severity of
        the condition being treated, and the judgment of the health care professional.
        Therapeutically effective amounts are known to those skilled in the art and/or are
        described in the pertinent reference texts and literature.
[00144]          For example, in the case of proteins and peptides beneficial agents, the beneficial
        agent will typically be delivered such that plasma levels of the beneficial agent are within
        a range of about 5 picomoles/liter to about 200 picomoles/liter. On a weight basis, a
        therapeutically effective dosage amount of protein or peptide will typically range from
        about 0.01 mg per day to about 1000 mg per day for an adult. For example, peptide or
        protein dosages may range from about 0.1 mg per day to about 100 mg per day, or from
        about 1.0 mg per day to about 10 mg/day.
[00145]          In some embodiments, a suitable low molecular weight compound may be
        characterized as one which can provide the desired therapeutic effect with a dose of less
        than or equal to about 30mg/day as delivered from a depot administered once a week, or
        a dose of less than or equal to about 10mg/day as delivered from a depot administered
        once a month. For example, a suitable low molecular weight compound may be one
        which can provide the desired therapeutic effect with a dose of less than about 30mg/day,
        e.g., less than about 25mg/day, less than about 20mg/day, less than about 15mg/day, less
        than about 10mg/day, less than about 5mg/day or less than about 1mg/day as delivered
        from a depot administered once a week. In some embodiments, a suitable low molecular
        weight compound is one which can provide the desired therapeutic effect with a dose of
        from about 30mg/day to about 1mg/day, e.g., from about 25mg/day to about 5mg/day, or
                                                  60

  WO 2012/074883                                                               PCT/US2011/062139
        from about 20mg/day to about 10mg/day as delivered from a depot administered once a
        week.
[00146]         Similarly, a suitable low molecular weight compound may be one which can
       provide the desired therapeutic effect with a dose of less than about 10mg/day, less than
        about 9mg/day, less than about 8mg/day, less than about 7mg/day, less than about
        6mg/day, less than about 5mg/day, less than about 4mg/day, less than about 3mg/day,
        less than about 2mg/day or less than about 1mg/day as delivered from a depot
        administered once a month. In some embodiments, a suitable low molecular weight
        compound may be one which can provide the desired therapeutic effect with a dose of
        from about 10mg/day to about 1mg/day, e.g., from about 9mg/day to about 2mg/day,
        from about 8mg/day to about 3mg/day, from about 7mg/day to about 4mg/day, or from
        about 6mg/day to about 5mg/day as delivered from a depot administered once a month.
[00147]         In some embodiments, e.g., where the formulation may have been in storage for a
       period of time prior to injection, the formulation may be mixed, e.g., via shaking, prior to
        administration to ensure that the insoluble component comprising beneficial agent, e.g.,
        an insoluble beneficial agent complex, is sufficiently dispersed in the vehicle carrier.
        Kits
[00148]         A variety of kits may be provided which include one or more components of the
       biodegradable formulations disclosed herein along with instructions for preparing and/or
       using the same. For example, in one embodiment, a suitable kit may include a vehicle as
        described herein in a first container and an insoluble component comprising beneficial
        agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent complex, as described herein in a second
        container, e.g., in powder form. These components may then be mixed together prior to
        injection to form a biodegradable formulation according to the present disclosure. In
        some embodiments, the first container is a syringe which may be coupled to the second
        container, e.g., a vial with a luer lock, to provide a mechanism for mixing the vehicle and
        the insoluble component comprising beneficial agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent
        complex. In other embodiments, both the first and second containers are syringes which
        may be coupled, e.g., via a luer lock, to provide a mechanism for mixing the vehicle and
        the insoluble component comprising beneficial agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent
        complex.
[00149]         In another embodiment, the biodegradable formulation may be provided pre
        mixed in a single container, e.g., a single syringe.

        agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent complex. The syringe may be provided such
        that a user can initiate contact and subsequent mixing of the vehicle and the insoluble
        component comprising beneficial agent, e.g., an insoluble beneficial agent complex.
[00151]          The instructions for use of the kit and/or kit components may be provided as
        complete written instructions along with the kit, e.g., as an insert card or printed on the
        kit packaging; or stored on a computer readable memory device provided with the kit.
        Alternatively, the kit may include instructions which provide a brief instruction to the
        user and direct the user to an alternate source for more complete use instructions. For
        example, the kit may include a reference to an internet site where the complete
        instructions for use may be accessed and/or downloaded.

[00152]          The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in

        Example 1: Preparation of rhGH-Protamine Complex
                Spray Drying
[00153]          A spray dried powder formulation of hGH (BresaGen) complexed with protamine
        sulfate was prepared as follows. 1.00g of BresaGen rhGH powder was placed in a
        150mL wide-mouth glass jar. 55mL of a 25mM NH 4HCO3 (pH -7.5) solution was added
        and the compound was stirred for 30min at room temperature, 400rpm until it became
                                                   62

  WO 2012/074883                                                               PCT/US2011/062139
        clear. 1.9mL of a 290mM sucrose solution was then added while stirring at 400rpm.
        When the solution was clear 152pL of a 10% polysorbate 20 solution was added.
         12.9mL of protamine sulfate solution (conc. 10mg/mL) was then added slowly to form a
        white precipitate. The mixture was stirred for 30min before spray drying to complete the
        complexation reaction.
[00154]         For formulations including a divalent metal or salt thereof (e.g., zinc acetate) in
        addition to protamine, such components may be added to the desired ratio prior to the
        addition of protamine. For example, a 100mM stock solution of zinc acetate may be
        utilized to add zinc acetate to the desired ratio.
[00155]         The spray dry conditions were as follows:
                        Inlet temperature set up: 140'C,
                        Aspirator 100%,
                        Pump: 13%,
                        Nozzle Cleaner: 2 pulses per min.
[00156]         Following spray drying, the yield of the complexed powder was 1.1066g. The
        rhGH content in the complexed powder was determined via HPLC as follows. The
        powder was dissolved in 2% phosphoric acid and the clear solution was run on an HPLC
        system. The rhGH content of the powder was found to be 75% by weight. The
        complexed powder was subsequently transferred to 3mL glass syringes, sealed and
        stored in foil pouches under refrigeration.
                Lyophilization
[00157]         As an alternative to the spray drying process described above, the insoluble
        beneficial agent complex of the present disclosure may be provided using a
        lyophilization process. An exemplary lyophilization process is described below.
[00158]          1.00g of BresaGen hGH powder was placed in a 150mL wide-mouth glass jar.
        55mL of 25mM NH 4HCO 3 (pH -7.5) solution was added and the compound was stirred
        for 30min at room temperature, 400rpm until it became clear. 1.9mL of 290mM sucrose
        solution was then added while stirring at 400rpm. When the solution was clear, 152pL of
         10% polysorbate 20 solution was added. Then, 12.9mL of protamine sulfate solution
        (conc. 1Omg/mL) was slowly added to form a white precipitate. The resulting suspension
        was stirred for 30min to complete the complexation reaction.
[00159]         Aliquots of 3 mL each of the bulk suspension from the above step were
        transferred into 5mL type-Hypak BD glass syringes and lyophilized using the
        lyophilization cycle provided in Table 1 and a program P90 (optimized for hGH) to fit
        the steps provided with an FTS lyophilizer, Dura Stop, MP Stoppering Tray Dryer, Stone

        Example 2: Preparation and In-vivo Evaluation of rhGH Biodegradable Drug Delivery
        Depot Formulation
                Preparation
[00160]         Five different formulations of rhGH-Protamine complex and vehicle were
       prepared and tested. The formulations were prepared as indicated below using the
        following materials: Benzyl benzoate, Spectrum; SAIB, Pharmaceutical grade,
        DURECT; and PLA, Poly (DL-Lactide), MW 1510ODa, DURECT Corporation. The five
        formulations included:
                1) rhGH-Protamine (1:0.5 molar ratio) suspended in phosphate buffered saline
        (PBS),
                2) rhGH-Protamine suspended in Benzyl benzoate (BB),
                3) rhGH-Protamine suspended in SAIB/BB 8/92 % w/w (stock vehicle prepared
       by mixing 4.002 g of SAIB with 46.017 g of Benzyl benzoate in a 100 mL glass jar and
        sonicating at RT for 30 minutes),
                4) rhGH-Protamine suspended in BB/PLA (DURECT) 80/20 % w/w (stock
        vehicle prepared by mixing 20.015 g of Benzyl benzoate with 5.007 g of PLA in a 100

                5) rhGH-Protamine suspended in SAIB/BB/PLA (DURECT) 8/72/20 % w/w
       (stock vehicle prepared by weighing 20.014 g of PLA in a 100 mL glass jar and mixing
       with 72.309 g of Benzyl benzoate and 8.147 g of SAIB, followed by sonication for 30
       minutes at RT).
[00161]         Injectable formulations having components as indicated in 1-5 above were
       prepared as follows:
                A) The foil pouches with the syringes containing the complexed powder were
       removed from refrigeration and placed in a clean, dry area at room temperature for a
       minimum of 60 minutes prior to opening;
                B) Vials containing the vehicle were also placed in a clean, dry area at room
       temperature for at least 60 minutes prior to opening;
                C) After the foil pouches were allowed to equilibrate, each pouch was opened
       with clean scissors and the syringes were removed while being careful not to cut any of
       the pouch contents;
                D) For each test article, lmL of vehicle was withdrawn from a stock solution
       with a 1 mL syringe (Excel or equivalent) fitted with a 16Ga, 1 inch needle (BD
       PN305197 or equivalent);
                E) The plastic tip was removed from the 3mL glass syringe containing the test
       article powder;
                F) One side of a sterile female-female luer adaptor was fixed to the syringe of
       Step E;
                G) The lmL syringe containing vehicle (Step D) was connected to the other side
       of the sterile female-female luer;
                H) The entire liquid contents of the lmL syringe were pushed through the
       female-female luer into the powder contents of the 3mL glass syringe;
                I) The syringes were left connected for at least 10-15 minutes to allow the vehicle
       to wet the powder;
                J) The vehicle was mixed with the powder by passing the mixture between the
       two syringes until a uniform suspension was produced (at least 20 passes between the
       syringes);
                K) The required volume contents were pushed (animal dose + 50uL for dead
       space) into the lmL Excel syringe and the 3mL glass syringe was uncoupled;
                L) The female-female luer was then removed from imLExcel syringe;

                 M) A 21 Ga, 1 inch needle (Terumo, UTW or equivalent) was then placed into the
        luer lock of the 1 mL syringe with volume markings and the needle was primed with test
        article suspension. The syringe was then ready for dosing animal 1.
                 N) To prepare additional animal dosages, the female-female luer was attached to
        the 3 mL glass syringe and a new 1mL Excel syringe was attached. The required volume
        (2   animal dose +50uL for dead space) was then pushed into a 1mL Excel syringe and
        the 3 mL glass syringe was uncoupled. The female-female luer was then removed from
        the 1mL Excel syringe;
                 0) A 21 Ga, 1 inch needle (Terumo, UTW or equivalent) was then placed into the
        luer lock of the 1 mL syringe with volume markings and the needle was primed with test
        article suspension. The syringe was then ready for dosing animal 2. This process was
        continued as needed until all animals were dosed.
                 In-vivo Administration and Monitoring
[00162]          In-vivo experiments were conducted as follows. Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed
        via subcutaneous bolus injection and monitored for a one week period. Six experimental
        treatment groups were utilized with six animals per group. These groups utilized the five
        formulations described above and a reference formulation, rhGH in PBS without
        protamine (Aq. Soln.). For both the rhGH in PBS and the rhGH-protamine formulation
        (Aq. complex), delivery was via 300pl injection of a 10mg/ml formulation to achieve a
        3mg dose. For each of rhGH-protamine in benzyl benzoate (BB) 100% w/w, rhGH
        Protamine in SAIB/BB (8/92) % w/w, rhGH-Protamine in BB/PLA (80/20) % w/w, and
        rhGH-Protamine in SAIB/BB/PLA (8/72/20) % w/w, delivery was via 100pl injection of
        a 50mg/ml formulation to achieve a 5mg dose.
[00163]          Blood samples were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hrs following dosing
        for the rhGH (PBS) formulation while samples for each of the rhGH-protamine
        formulations were taken at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 hrs. Serum rhGH profiles
        were determined via ELISA.
                 Results
[00164]          FIG. 1 shows the dose-normalized, group-average serum rhGH profiles, for the
        reference and the five test formulations following subcutaneous dosing. FIG. 2 plots
        serum rhGH concentrations over time for each animal in each test group. These plots
        allow one to discern readily the effects of complexation and the vehicles, and also show
        the inter-animal variability. (Note: all non-zero concentrations were plotted).
[00165]          Relative to the aqueous solution (rhGH in PBS without protamine), serum levels
        from the complex suspended in PBS were maintained for an additional 24 hrs.
                                                  66

  WO 2012/074883                                                              PCT/US2011/062139
        Suspending the rhGH complex in BB reduced 0-24 hr plasma levels 6-8 fold, but did not
        prolong protein delivery relative to the complex suspended in PBS. Addition of SAIB to
        BB extended delivery by about 48h. Adding 20% (w/w) acid-initiated PLA (M,
        14.5kDa) to BB extended rhGH delivery to beyond 168 hrs., but substitution of 8% w/w
        SAIB for BB in BB:PLA 80:20 % w/w had no significant effect on rhGH delivery.
[00166]         These results indicate that, in-vivo, the protamine complex reduced initial serum
        levels and prolonged delivery relative to a s.c. aqueous bolus of rhGH in solution.
        Dispersing the complex in BB reduced initial release relative to the protamine complex
        without vehicle, but did not extend the overall duration of delivery. Addition of 8%
        SAIB to BB provided a modest extension of release relative to BB alone, but addition of
        20% PLA to BB greatly extended delivery of protein. Lastly, addition of 8% SAIB to
        BB:PLA provided no further extension of delivery.
        Example 3: In-vivo Evaluation in Rat for IFNa2a Biodegradable Drug Delivery Depot
        Formulation
[00167]         The following formulations were administered subcutaneously to rats, and
        IFNa2a serum concentration was monitored over time:
                A) 2.5mg/ml IFNa2a formulation with 1% sucrose and protamine-zinc (spray
        dried), dispersed in a SAIB/BB/PLA (8:72:20, % w/w) vehicle; and
                B) 2.5mg/ml IFNa2a formulation with 1% sucrose and protamine-zinc (spray
        dried), dispersed in a SAIB/BB/PLGA (8:72:20, % w/w) vehicle.
[00168]         For each formulation the ratio of IFNx2a to Zn2 to protamine in the complex
        was (1:1:0.3 m/m). The protein dose was 0.5mg for each formulation. Methionine was
        added to each formulation to prevent oxidation of protein. Rats were immune suppressed
        with cyclosporine and methyl-prednisolone. Injections were via Excel 1ml syringes using
        23 gauge 5/8 inch Terumo needles.
[00169]         Serum concentrations for each rat in both formulation groups A) and B) were
        plotted versus time up to 96 hours as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 respectively. The profiles
        are similar across formulations. Average serum profiles for the two formulations were
        nearly identical out to 11 days as depicted in FIG. 5. On average tmax was 8h (range 1
        24h) for both formulations, and Cmax ranged from 40-60x10 4 pg/mL. Serum levels fell
        50-fold over 11 days and Cmax/Ciast   - 500. The formulations studied were similar in their
        bioavailability (BA) profiles, with BA up to 28 days ranging from 20 to 50%.

        Example 4: Further In-vivo Evaluation in Rat for IFNa2a Biodegradable Drug Delivery
        Depot Formulation
[00170]         The following formulations were administered via subcutaneous bolus to rats and
        IFNa2a serum concentration was monitored over time:
                C) 20mg/ml IFNa2a formulation with 1% sucrose and protamine
        (IFNa2a:protamine 1:0.3 m/m), dispersed in a SAIB/BB/PLA (8:72:20) vehicle; and
                D) 20mg/ml IFNa2a formulation with 1% CMC and 1% sucrose, dispersed in a
        SAIB/BB/PLA (8:72:20, % w/w) vehicle.
[00171]         The protein dose was 1mg for each formulation (50pl of 20mg/ml formulation).
        Injections were via Excel 1ml syringes using 23 gauge 5/8 inch Terumo needles.
[00172]         Serum concentrations (as determined by ELISA) for each rat in each formulation
        group were plotted versus time. The results for formulations C) and D) are provided in
        FIGS. 6 and 7 respectively. Both formulations demonstrated desirable release kinetics for
        an injectable depot formulation.
        Example 5: In-vivo Analysis in Primate for IFNa2a Biodegradable Drug Delivery Depot
        Formulation
[00173]         Using depot compositions similar to those above for Example 4, a
        pharmacokinetic study was performed in primates (cynomolgus monkeys - Macaca
       fascicularis).Specifically, 2mg/kg of a 40mg/ml IFNa2a formulation with 1% sucrose
        and protamine (IFNa2a:protamine 1:0.3 m/m), dispersed in a SAIB/BB/PLA (8:72:20, %
        w/w) vehicle was administered to a first group. Another experimental group received
        2mg/kg of a second formulation, 40mg/ml IFNa2a formulation with 1% CMC and 1%
        sucrose, dispersed in a SAIB/BB/PLA (8:72:20, % w/w) vehicle. Injections were
        subcutaneous via Excel 1ml syringes using 23 gauge 5/8 in Terumo needles.
[00174]         The serum profiles for the individual animals in each group are shown in FIGS. 8
        and 9 respectively. As shown, greater serum levels were achieved over the initial 10-12
        days with protamine-IFNa2a complex than with CMC- IFNa2a complex.
[00175]         Serum samples from individual animals in each treatment group were analyzed
        by ELISA and pooled serum samples from each treatment group were analyzed by Anti
        Viral Assay (AVA). A comparision of group average serum profiles for the experimental
        groups as determined by ELISA and AVA is provided in FIG. 10, which reveals that the
        CMC-complex provided for longer duration of delivery than the protamine complex

        Example 6: Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of an Anti-Cancer Nucleoside Analogue
        Delivered from a SAIB/BB/EtOH/PLGA (8/67/5/20) Vehicle
[00176]          An injectable depot composition was prepared using a protamine complex of an
        anti-cancer nucleoside analogue pro-drug and SAIB/BB/EtOH/PLGA (8/67/5/20, %
        w/w) as the vehicle, prepared as follows: 3.3180g of the nucleoside analogue pro-drug
        was weighed in a 500mL glass container. 166mL of water was added to the glass
        container and stirred at 400rpm for 1 hour until all the powder dissolved. The solubility
        of the nucleoside analogue in water was about 20mg/mL. The resulting clear aqueous
        solution was added to 430mL of a 1Omg/ml protamine sulfate solution. The mixture was
        stirred again for 1 hour at room temperature for the reaction to complete after which time
        a white fluffy suspension was formed. The white suspension was distributed in 50mL
        plastic tubes. The glass container was rinsed with 65mL of water and the remaining
        mixture was transferred to the 50mL tubes. The tubes containing the suspension were
        centrifuged at 2500rpm for 12min. Following centrifugation, the tubes yielded a total of
        547mL of supernatant and 117mL of white precipitate.
[00177]          The supernatant was analyzed via HPLC for free beneficial agent content. The
        target dosage was 150mg of beneficial agent. Accordingly, the suspension was aliquoted
        into 20 10mL glass vials, each containing 5.8mL of the white precipitate. The vials
        containing the precipitate were then lyophilized using an FTS freeze dryer.
[00178]          The stabilized-beneficial agent complex powder from the 1OmL vials was
        transferred into 2mL vials and weighed. Vehicle (SAIB/BB/EtOH/PLGA) (8/67/5/20)
        was added to the weighed powder to obtain a target concentration of 120mg/mL of
        beneficial agent. The mixture was wetted for 1.5 hours with the vehicle, and the wetted
        mixture was then homogenized for 10min on a PowerGen 1000 (Fisher Scientific), with
        probe 5 X 95mm to obtain a homogeneous milky white suspension. This suspension was
        dosed into primates and blood samples were monitored up to 168 hours for both the
        beneficial agent and a metabolite thereof. Injections were subcutaneous via Excel 1ml
        syringes using 23 gauge 5/8 inch Terumo needles. The following dosages were
        monitored: immediate release formulation (without SAIB/BB/EtOH/PLGA vehicle) at 3
        mg/kg; and pro-drug-vehicle compositions at 9 mg/kg, 13.5 mg/kg, and 18 mg/kg.

        its active metabolite (the beneficial agent) are provided in FIGS. 11 and 12 respectively.
        These curves show a desirable delivery profile with low burst effect and sustained
        release out to 168hrs.

        Example 8: Vehicle Viscosity
[00183]          In vitro vehicle viscosity was determined for the following vehicle material
        combinations: BB (alone), BB:PLA, SAIB:BB:PLA, SAIB:BB. For each combination of
        materials, the % w/w of the materials was varied as shown in Table 4 below. Table 4
       provides viscosity values in centipoise (cP) for each of the various combinations at 25

[00186]           The inclusion of some ethanol in the vehicles containing LA-initiated PLA is
         believed to be responsible for the increase in viscosity after the exposure to PBS buffer at
         37'C observed for some of the vehicles. However, the viscosity of individual vehicles
         after exposure to water remained relatively constant over the test period up to 168 hours

        regardless of the composition of the vehicles, confirming that any rate controlling surface
         "cloud" layer, formed upon exposure of the formulations to PBS buffer, at the surface of
         the formulation and PBS buffer does not have physical strength or appreciable
         mechanical structures resisting the applied shear stress at the range of shear rates
         indicated in Table 5. This may be contrasted with gel forming vehicles which exhibit a
         substantial increase in viscosity over time when exposed to an aqueous environment.
[00187]             Additional in-situ viscosity measurements are provided in Table 6 below.
         Depending on the observed viscosity of the formulations, an appropriate Brookfield
         viscometer model was selected in order to match the required (or optimum) range of
         torque. For example, a Brookfield viscometer model DV-1II + ULTRA (HA) model was
        used to provide low shear rates of 140-320 sec-1 at 25 'C and high shear rates of 500 sec

        rates of 7-28 sec-' at 25 'C and high shear rates of 40-200 sec-' at 25 'C; a Brookfield
         DV-1I + (HB) model was used to provide low shear rates of 370-500 sec- at 37 'C and
        high shear rates of 500 sec- at 37 'C; and a Brookfield DV-1II + (LV) model was used to
        provide low shear rates of 20-46 sec-' at 37 'C and high shear rates of 90-350 sec-' at 37

         vehicles do not exhibit this level of viscosity increase and instead exhibit relatively stable
         viscosity over time.
[00189]           Additional in-situ viscosity measurements are provided in Table 7 below which
         compares carriers having only BB as the solvent with carriers including BB and a
         secondary hydrophobic solvent, e.g., BA (benzyl alcohol) or TA (triacetin). In situ
         viscosity was measured as described above for Table 6.

[00190]           Generally the vehicles containing only BB as the solvent showed relatively stable

        Finally, the vehicle containing BB and TA showed a slight increase in viscosity (about
        50%) over the 120 hour time period at 37 'C. However, even for those vehicles showing
        an increase in viscosity, viscosity remained relatively low, e.g., less than 500 cP over the
         120 hour time period.

[00196]         Injectability data and test conditions are presented in Table 10. The formulation
        was made up of the 120mg/ml load of nucleoside analogue pro-drug lyophilized with
        protamine complex which was dispersed in a SAIB/BB/EtOH/PLGA (8/67/5/20, % w/w)
        vehicle. The injectable depot composition was prepared as described previously in
        Example 6.
[00197]         The suspension was tested for injectability by backfilling 100pL suspension into
        1mL syringe with permanently attached needle 21G or 23G X           " (Terumo REF
        SS01D2313). A force of l0lbs was applied to the syringe and injection times were
        monitored both with and without a delay following mixing. Temperature was 25 'C.
[00198]         The injection times (less than 2 seconds for 0.21-0.25ml) were deemed
        acceptable for the nucleoside analogue complex formulation using both 21G and 23G x 1
        inch needles.

[00213]          Foil pouches containing 5 mL glass syringes containing the rhGH or rhGH
        complex in dry form were placed in a clean, dry area at room temperature for a minimum
        of 60 minutes prior to opening. Diluent vials containing the vehicle were placed in a
        clean, dry area at room temperature prior to opening. After the foil pouches were allowed
        to equilibrate at room temperature for 60 minutes, each pouch was opened with a pair of
        clean scissors. The correct volume of diluent for each formulation (1.0 mL) was
        withdrawn with a 3 mL syringe (BD PN309585 or equivalent) fitted with a 16 Ga 1 inch
        needle (BD PN305197 or equivalent). The plastic tip was removed from each 5 mL glass
        syringe containing the test article powder. One side of a sterile female-female luer
        adaptor was affixed to each glass syringe. The 3 mL syringe containing the diluent was
        then connected to the other side of the sterile female-female luer. The total liquid
        contents of the 3 mL syringe were pushed into the powder contents of the 5 mL glass
        syringe through the female-female luer. The connected syringes were then left for at least
        15 min to wet the powder with the liquid. The liquid was then mixed with the powder by
       passing the mixture between the two syringes until a uniform suspension was produced
        (approximately 50 passes between syringes). The total contents of both syringes were
        then pushed into the 1 mL plastic syringe, and the 1 mL plastic syringe was labeled to
        identify the lot # and solution. The female-female luer was then removed from the 1 mL
       plastic syringe. Finally, a 21 Ga 1 inch needle was placed into the luer lock of the 1 mL
        syringe and the needle was primed with test article suspension.

        post dose.
                Results
[00215]          Serum profiles for the above study are provided in FIG. 14 panels A and B. Panel
        A shows the serum concentration over a 5 day period for free rhGH in the 5 vehicles
        tested. Panel B shows the serum concentration over a 7 day period for the
        rhGH:Protamine 0.5:1 (m/m) complex in the 5 vehicles tested. As shown in panel A, for
        free rhGH, the dodecanol-initiated polymers showed little difference in PK
        characteristics relative to BB alone. The lactic acid- and glycolic acid-initiated polymers
        showed lower initial burst and extended delivery relative to BB alone, with the glycolic
        acid-initiated PLGA providing greater control over release than the lactic acid-initiated
        PLA.
[00216]          As shown in panel B for the rhGH:protamine formulations, each of the test
        vehicles displayed reduced initial release and prolonged duration of delivery relative to
        the formulations in which free rhGH was dispersed. In particular, delivery was extended
        even further in the two formulations utilizing the acid-initiated polymers. Note that the
        use of the rhGH:protamine complex largely compensated for the poorer intrinsic release
        control demonstrated by the dodecanol-initiated polymers in panel A.
[00217]          FIG. 15, panels A-E show within formulation comparisons of serum profiles with
        free vs. complexed rhGH. As shown, complexation with protamine reduced 1h serum
        levels -2.5 to 8 fold and extended delivery in all cases.
[00218]          Mean residence time (MRT) is indicative of the duration of delivery. Several
        processes contribute to MRT including dissolution, transport, absorption and PK. Using
        the data derived from the above experiment, the separate contributions of polymer and
        complex to MRT were extracted in order to determine whether the individual effects of
        protamine complex and polymer on the MRT of free rhGH in BB alone (AMRTcomplex
        and AMRTpolymer, respectively) predict their combined effect. An additive model for
        MRT would be as follows:
                         MRTcomplex+polymer = MRTBB   + AMRTcomplex +    AMRTpolymer

[00219]            As shown in Table 13, the additive model does not generally predict the observed
         MRTs. Accordingly, there appears to have been some interaction (synergy) between
         polymer and protein complex which contributes to MRT. The fractional contribution of
         this interaction is listed in the last column of the table.
[00220]            In summary, clear differences were observed between acid end group polymers
         (e.g., acid-initiated polymers) and ester-end group polymers (e.g., dodecanol-initiated)
         polymers in the delivery of free rhGH suspended in BB:polymer vehicles. The addition
         of dodecanol-initiated polymers provided no more control of rhGH delivery than did BB
         alone. This was the case for polymers having M,       -   6.5-14kDa, and for both PLA and
         65:35 PLGA (65:35 refers to the respective fractions or percents of lactide and glycolide
         residues in the polymer). rhGH release from suspensions of rhGH:protamine complex in
         BB alone was extended relative to suspension of free protein. The protamine complex
         and polymer apparently worked synergistically to control protein release (extend MRT),
         and this synergy accounted for 40-70% of the observed MRT.

        articles #1-9, approximately 1 mL of test article was withdrawn, and 0.1 mL of the test
        article was back-filled into a 1 mL Terumo Sursaver syringe: 23G       " inch pre-attached
        for test articles; by removing the plunger from back end. The syringe was then primed to
        deliver for each animal. To avoid needle clogging, the syringe was not primed to 0. 1mL
        until immediately before administration. The weight of the syringes before and after
        injection was measured and recorded.

        Results
[00233]          The results of the above experiment are provided in FIG. 16, panels A-C, in
        which they have been combined with results from Example 11. Plotting dose-normalized
        serum profiles (ng/mL serum concentration per mg/kg of protein dosed) for each form of
        rhGH in each vehicle shows that in these formulations complexation reduced serum
        levels -  10-fold and extended release independent of polymer content and type.
        Complexation alone (no polymer, Panel A) extended delivery, with protamine apparently
        more effective than Zn2 , but the combination of the two was no more effective than
        protamine alone. Addition of la-PLA alone (no complex) also extended delivery, but the
        effect of dd-PLA alone was equivocal (compare free rhGH in Panels A-C and note that
        the graphs use different time scales).
[00234]          MRTs were calculated for each animal for each formulation and averaged. These
        results are summarized in FIG. 17. The effects of polymer and complex alone can be
        discerned by looking along the horizontal axes. Also apparent is the variation in the
        combined effects of polymer and complex.
[00235]          As in Example 11, the separate contributions of the complexes and polymers to
        extending MRT were calculated and an additive model was used to predict MRT for the
        combined formulations. These results are provided below in Table 15.

[00236]           Again, the additive model did not adequately predict the observed MRTs (except
        for the Zn 2+ complex in la-PLA) indicating that there is a synergistic effect of polymer
        and complex for some formulations.
[00237]           The fractional contributions of BB alone, polymer and complex to MRT were
        similar across Examples 11 and 12, but the synergistic contributions were somewhat
                                                   86

        greater in Example 12. The fractional contribution of polymer-complex interaction for
        Examples 11 and 12 to MRT is provided in FIG. 18. The following combinations were
        not tested and accordingly the interaction contributions were not determined: la
        PLGA:Zn2 +:protamine; dd-PLGA: Zn2 +:protamine; la-PLGA:Zn2 +; and dd-PLGA: Zn2 +
[00238]          In summary, the results of Example 12 corroborate and extend those of Example
         11. The effects, individual and synergistic, of the rhGH:protamine complex were also
        observed with rhGH:Zn2 + and the complex formed with both Zn 2 +and protamine.
        Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, formulating with a complex of
        rhGH may afford latitude in the choice of polymer, compensating for intrinsic
        differences in the capacity of acid- and ester-terminated polymers to control protein
        release.
        Example 13: FurtherIn- Vivo Depot Characterization
[00239]          Additional experiments were conducted to determine the suitability of additional
        solvent-polymer combinations. The tested formulations were as follows: BA:dd-PLGA
        (6.7kDa, dodecanol-initiated, 65:35 L:G); BA:ga-PLGA (11.5kDa, glycolate-initiated,
        64:36 L:G); EB:dd-PLGA (ethyl benzoate); EB:ga-PLGA. All vehicles contained 80:20
        (% w/w) solvent:polymer ratio. Native rhGH (freeze dried) was used as the beneficial
        agent (both free and complexed with protamine) except where noted. PK was monitored
        over a period of 7 days, with samples taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168
        hours. Group mean dose-normalized serum profiles for the above formulations are
        provided in FIGS. 24 (BA:dd-PLGA and BA:ga-PLGA) and 25 (EB: dd-PLGA and EB:
        ga-PLGA). All non-zero values are shown.
[00240]          Unexpectedly, delivery from BA:PLGA vehicles was extremely low, with
        bioavailability < 0.2 and 2%, respectively. Delivery from the EB:PLGA was comparable
        to what has been shown previously herein for BB:PLGA. Peak serum concentrations for
        the dd-polymers appeared to be lower, possible due to assay saturation. Differences in
        MRT between ester- and acid-terminated polymers were less pronounced than in BB
        PLGA vehicles. MRT was calculated for each of the above formulations and the results
        are provided below in Table 16.

[00241]         The duration of rhGH delivery from suspensions of free rhGH in EB:dd-PLGA

       rhGH delivery from suspensions of free rhGH in EB:ga-PLGA was < that from
        comparable BB-based vehicles tested previously herein. The very low rhGH delivery
        from the BA formulations was unexpected, in light of its structural similarity to EB and
        BB.
[00242]          Release of rhGH in vitro from the BA formulations was quite low, < 1% over
        almost 11 days. Moreover, recovery of intact protein from these depots into PBS
        extraction medium at the end of the release experiment was < 1%, but greatly improved
       by addition of 6N guanidine, suggesting extensive protein aggregation in the
        formulation. Recovery of rhGH from the EB-based formulations was nearly complete
        and unaffected by addition of 6N guanidine to the extraction medium.
[00243]          The observations in vitro and in vivo suggest some specific interaction between
        BA and rhGH, although formulations of rhGH with 10% BA have performed as well in
        vivo as formulations containing BB alone. There is also the possibility that delivery of
       rhGH from the BA:PLGA formulations occurs over much longer times than observed
       here.

  WO 2012/074883                                                                 PCT/US2011/062139
[00244]          These results may suggest the utility of BA and EB for injectable depots
        formulations designed for shorter durations of delivery - several days to one week.
        Example 14: "Cloud" Characterization
[00245]          As discussed previously herein, it is believed that the beneficial release
        characteristics of the injectable, biodegradable depot compositions of the present
        disclosure are due at least in part to the formation of a very fluid, non-structured (without
        any appreciable mechanical integrity), "rate-controlling cloud" or "rate-controlling film"
        on the surface of the depot in vivo. The desirable controlled delivery characteristic of the
        disclosed depot compositions may result from the rate-controlling contributions of both
        the insoluble beneficial agent complex dispersed in the liquid core of the depot and the
       polymer cloud or film on the surface of the depot.
[00246]          The physical development of this rate controlling cloud can be seen visually in
        situ as demonstrated in FIGs. 19 and 20. A 23 Gauge regular needle was used to inject
        approximately 0.5 mL of a SAIB/BB/PLA (LA-initiated) (8:72:20) vehicle into PBS
       buffer at pH 7.4 and 37 'C. A first picture (FIG. 19) was taken at about 10 sec following
        initiation of injection and a second picture (FIG. 20) was taken about 60 seconds
        following the completion of the 0.5 mL injection. FIG. 19 shows a slight development of
        opacity in the center of the vehicle which is likely due to the initial contact of the vehicle
        with the PBS and is considered an artifact of the procedure. A nearly opaque white cloud
        is formed over the entire surface of the vehicle by the 60 second time point as shown in
        FIG. 20.
[00247]          Cloud formation kinetics are described for a variety of hydrophobic solvent:PLA
        combinations in Table 17 below, wherein one of index numbers 0-4 is selected based on
        a visual characterization of the transmittance of the vehicle, where 0 indicates
        approximately100% transmittance, 1 indicates greater than approximately 80%
        transmittance, 2 indicates greater than approximately 50% transmittance, 3 indicates less
        than approximately 50% transmittance, and 4 indicates approximately 0% transmittance.
        Sample Preparation
[00248]          Test samples were prepared at three concentration levels of PLA (10%, 20% and
        30% w/w) for each solvent by mixing on a rotator until the polymer was completely
        dissolved.

[00251]           The rate-controlling, cloud forming vehicles of the present disclosure can also be
        characterized by their lack of gel-forming characteristics when aged at          037 C. This can
        be demonstrated by monitoring viscosity stability over time at the selected temperatures.
        Vehicle compositions were prepared as indicated in Table 18 below.

[00252]           The 4 vehicles were placed in glass vials and incubated at 37 0 C for 14 days.
        Dynamic viscosity was measured using an Anton Paar MCR301 rheometer at constant
        strain of 10% and an angular frequency range of 0.1-100 s-1 at 25'C. The other test
        conditions were: Quantity of test material: 100        1tland the gap distance between the
        stationary and rotating conical plate: 0.05 mm.
[00253]           The results for the vehicles aged at 37 0 C are shown in FIG. 21. Stability as a

[00255]         In the presence of SAIB, the PLA (15.2KD) vehicles show moderate viscosity
        decrease @ 37'C (2-3 cP/week decrease). Without intending to be bound by any
        particular theory, this may be the result of slow polymer degradation. The polymer
        degradation was shown to be significantly increased (3-5 fold increase) for the vehicle
        without SAIB (shielding effect).
[00256]         The only vehicle prepared with PLGA 65/35 (6.2KD), on the other hand, shows
        viscosity increase overtime (11 cP/week increase). Again, without intending to be bound
        by any particular theory, this is presumably due to gradual polymer chain rearrangement
        resulting in enhanced van der walls interaction. There is, however, no indication of gel

        Example 16: Characterization of Additional Complexation Agents
[00257]         Additional complexation agents were tested in vitro for their ability to precipitate
        rhGH. The results of this experiment are provided below in Table 28.
[00258]          Human growth hormone (purchased from Hospira, Adelaide) was complexed
        with poly lysine, poly arginine, poly adenylic acid (poly-A), or poly thymine (poly-T) in
        appropriate ratios (as specified in Table 28) to form suspensions. Supernatant was
        separated from precipitate (ppt) by centrifugation of the complexed material suspensions.
        The supernatant solution was analyzed for non-complexed hGH by reverse phase liquid
        chromatography (RPLC).

[00259]         As indicated Table 28, each of the listed complexation agents (with the exception
        of Hyaluronic acid) was capable of at least partially precipitating the rhGH beneficial
        agent. For the cationic agents, poly-lysine was more effective than poly-arginine at

        slightly more effective at the 10mer length than at the 150 mer length.
[00260]         Additional experiments were conducted to characterize the dissolution rates of a
        hGH beneficial agent complexed with various complexing agents. Solutions of hGH and
        the different complexing agents were provided in the following ratios to yield an
        insoluble beneficial agent complex: hGH + Poly-Lysine (1:1), hGH + Poly Adenylic
        Acid + Protamine (1:0.2:0.3), hGH + Zn +Protamine (1:2:0.3), hGH + Zn (1:10). Free
        hGH was provided as a control. Dissolution rate was then monitored by reverse phase
        liquid chromatography (RPLC). The results of these dissolution experiments are
        provided in FIGS. 26 and 27. Of the above complexes, the Zn/protamine complex
        provided a more controlled dissolution rate, which will result in a desired release profile.
        Example 17: Dissolution Rates for Various hGH Complexs
[00261]         The following powder formulations were prepared and analyzed to determine the
        effect of various complexing agents on dissolution of hGH in vitro.
                Preparationof hGH Powder:
[00262]         Aliquots of 3 mL each of the bulk hGH solution in buffer from BresaGen were
        transferred into 5mL type-Hypak BD glass syringes and lyophilized using the
        lyophilization cycle provided in Table 1 and a program P90 (optimized for hGH) to fit
        the steps provided with an FTS lyophilizer, Dura Stop, MP Stoppering Tray Dryer, Stone
        Ridge, NY. Release from this powder was only 40% of the initial hGH content. The
        balance of the protein denatured or aggregated in the release medium.
                Preparationof hGH:Zn Powder:
[00263]         100 mg of BresaGen hGH powder was placed in a l5mL wide-mouth glass jar.
        5.5mL of 25mM NH 4HCO 3 (pH -7.5) solution was added and the compound was stirred
        for 30min at room temperature, 400rpm until it became clear. Then, 0.45mL of 100mM
        Zinc acetate solution was slowly added to form a white precipitate. The resulting
        suspension was stirred for 30min to complete the complexation reaction. 0.19 mL of
        290mM sucrose solution was then added while stirring at 400rpm. When the solution
        was clear, 15.2pL of 10% polysorbate 20 solution was added. Aliquots of 3 mL each of
        the bulk suspension from the above step were transferred into 5mL type-Hypak BD glass
        syringes and lyophilized using the lyophilization cycle provided in Table 1 and a
        program P90 (optimized for hGH) to fit the steps provided with an FTS lyophilizer, Dura
        Stop, MP Stoppering Tray Dryer, Stone Ridge, NY. From this powder, the released
        protein is more (>70%) but all the release takes place in less than 48 hrs.

        suspension was stirred for 30min to complete the complexation reaction. 0.19 mL of
        290mM sucrose solution was then added while stirring at 400rpm. When the solution
        was clear, 15.2pL of 10% polysorbate 20 solution was added. Aliquots of 3 mL each of
        the bulk suspension from the above step were transferred into 5mL type-Hypak BD glass
        syringes and lyophilized using the lyophilization cycle provided in Table 1 and a
        program P90 (optimized for hGH) to fit the steps provided with an FTS lyophilizer, Dura
        Stop, MP Stoppering Tray Dryer, Stone Ridge, NY. From this complexed powder of
        protamine and zinc, the dissolution is slower than either free hGH or Zinc only complex
        powder.

        Example 18: Additional Beneficial Agents
[00266]         Exenatide (purchased from Bachem, Inc.) was complexed with Zinc as Zinc
        acetate (1:0.4 molar ratio) and with protamine as protamine sulphate (1: 0.3) by buffering
        in to ammonium bicarbonate (50 mM). The resultant suspension containing precipitate
        was spray-dried using Buchi 329 spray-dryer.
[00267]         The peptide beneficial agent (Exenatide) was tested in injectable depot
        compositions according to the present disclosure in order to determine the effect of the
        depot formulations on release of the beneficial agent in-vivo (rat). The following
        formulations were tested: Exenatide:protamine 1:2 (m/m), lyophilized, 9.5mg dose, in
        SAIB/BB/la-PLA (8/72/20) and Exenatide:protamine 1:2 (m/m), spray dried, 9.5mg
        dose, SAIB/BB/la-PLA (8/72/20) methionine & polysorbate 80. These formulations were
        compared with SC aqueous doses of 2.1 pg, 21 pg and 210 pg. Serum concentration was
        monitored over time. The results for this experiment are provided in FIG. 29 and
        demonstrate improved controlled release relative to aqueous bolus.

        Formulations
[00271]         Additional in vivo experiments were performed using the GLP- 1 analog
        formulations described above for Example 19. The sustained release, initial burst and
        bioavailability characteristics of each of the formulations were determined.
[00272]         The above formulations were injected subcutaneously into Sprague Dawley rats
        following removal of the hair at the local injection site. The formulations were
        administered in a volume of approximately 100ul with dosages ranging from 7.3 to 9.5
        mg/rat with 3 rats per treatment group. These formulations were compared with the
        administration of API alone at a dose of 2mg/rat. The average PK profiles for each of the
        above treatment conditions are shown in FIG. 23.
[00273]         Based on the above data, it was determined that the drug release rates
        AUC(Dayl)/AUC(Dayl4) (a measure of initial burst) for each of the above formulations
        was less than 10%. Some of the formulations (001, 004 and 007) showed a small initial
