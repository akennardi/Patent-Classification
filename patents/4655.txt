                                        BACKGROUND
[0002] Small Unmanned Vehicle Systems, such as UAVs, can accomplish their missions
using Digital Data Link (DDL) communications. For example, an unmanned aerial vehicle
or UAV transmits via the DDL a large amount of data (video) to a ground controller, with a
small amount of data being transmitted to the UAV.           Since the unmanned vehicles are
typically power constrained, the bulk of the DDL data, video data from the UAV, is
transmitted by the power constrained UAV.
[0003] Moreover, it is critical that many of the DDL signals be real time.         To control a
remotely piloted vehicle, the operator receives, views, and mentally processes real time
video, and then physically responds, i.e. moves a control stick, to transmit control signals to
P032371D2_14904744_1

                                                  2
the vehicle, which are acted upon by the vehicle. It requires full motion real time data in both
directions.
[0004]    Traditional systems, WiMax, cellular phone, are optimized without regard to power
constraints, and without regard to critical timing constraints based on the nature of the
information within the signal. With traditional systems, for high quality video, time is not
critical, so it is typically buffered, to take advantage of time gaps. In a UAV, such buffering
is not possible due to the critical nature of the response to the video signal. With packet
voice or video telephony, the data is heavily compressed, with lower data rates, and not full
motion high quality real time data. With UAVs, however, the data needs to be transmitted to
the operator quickly, when ready, and not buffered for when it is convenient for the medium
or the protocol.
[0005] In addition, for UAVs, the DDL must satisfy a number of operational scenarios not
present in traditional system.
[0006] What is needed are planned DDL services and features that enable aircraft and
ground devices to fulfill their missions.

                                        DESCRIPTION
[0018] In various embodiments, a wireless network has multiple nodes (transmitters/receivers
controlled by an operating system) where one of the nodes functions as an arbiter to control
operation of the other nodes. The arbiter defines operation cycles which are each divided up
into a set of time segments.       The arbiter also assigns to each node in the network a
transmission start time (a time segment) and transmission duration for each cycle (number of
time segments). The transmission start time and the duration can be changed for each node
and for each cycle (thus dynamic) by the arbiter. The nodes can be ground control stations
GCUs, unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, or the like. In some
embodiments, the ground station may operate as the arbiter and the UAVs will be the nodes
being given varying transmission times.        Since small UAVs require very scarce radio
spectrum, this allows the allocated radio spectrum to be efficiently shared by multiple nodes
(potentially multiple UAVs and ground systems) by adjusting the bandwidth allocated to each
node depending on the instantaneous demand by the node as well as the need of the operator.
This allows the operator to control whether each UAV either, transmits full video, transmit
degraded video or still pictures, or does not transmit any imagery, maximizing the bandwidth
available for the most desired transmission purpose, and reducing the bandwidth for the less
desired purposes.
[0019] FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating an example DDL environment 10. In one DDL
session 15 in a frequency band x, the DDL environment 10 incorporates unmanned vehicles
UAV1 and UAV2, such as aerial vehicles, each containing a DDL node 100 and 300,
respectively.    The DDL environment 10 may further incorporate manned ground stations
GCU1 and GCU2, each containing a DDL node 200 and 400, respectively.                Handheld
controllers 205 and 405 connected to GCU1 and GCU2, respectively, are used by the
operator (not shown) to generate control signals for UAV1 or UAV2. Optionally, the DDL
environment 10 may also incorporate external devices 210 and 410, such as laptops,
physically connected to a DDL node 200 and 400, respectively, such as via Ethernet
connections 215 and 415. Moreover, one or more optional remote viewing terminal(s) RVT
P032371D2     14904744 1

                                                 6
containing a DDL node 500 may be included. The remote viewing terminal(s) and/or ground
stations may optionally contain push-to-talk or PTT voice communications capability (not
illustrated) in FIG. 1. In addition to the DDL session 15, other DDL sessions 25, operating in
other operating frequency bands, also may be present in the DDL environment 10.
[0020] The DDL environment 10 and associated architecture show in FIG. 1 is for
illustration purposes and allows multiple devices, components, or items of the various types
discussed above, or other device or item types.          Furthermore, several of the devices,
components, or items may be combined or omitted as desired. For example, the ground
station GCU1 and the handheld controller 205 may be combined into a single device. Or, for
example the external device 210 may be omitted, or may be a device other than a laptop
computer device.
[0021] The DDL system may contain various functional and design constraints, depending on
the embodiment. In various embodiments, the DDL system should provide some or all of the
following functions:
*        DDL Nodes should be able to address each other.
*        Laptops (or Hand Controllers) should be able to address their local DDL Node. This
is the node within the ground station that the laptop plugs into.
*        Laptops (or Hand Controllers) should be able to address all DDL Nodes (not just the
local DDL Node).
*        Laptops should be able to address other Laptops (which are plugged in to other DDL
Nodes).
*        The DDL LAN should support a router connected to a local DDL Node and also to a
Wide-Area-Network to provide connectivity between the two.

                                              7
Moreover, in various embodiments, the DDL system design my conform to some or all of the
following constraints:
*       The Hand Controller is optional. The local DDL Node should be capable of
connecting to a DDL network without a Hand Controller.
*       The Laptop is optional. The local DDL Node should be capable of connecting to a
DDL network without a Laptop.
*       Operator setup should not be required. Basic DDL scenarios can be satisfied without
requiring an Operator to pre-configure DDL Nodes. Advanced scenarios may require
minimal Operator setup.
*       Non-standard laptop software should not be required. Normal operating system
software is sufficient to connect a Laptop to the DDL network. Controlling aircraft requires
special software.
*       Introduction of DDL Nodes or attachment of external devices should not cause
service disruptions.
                                  Example DDL Scenarios
[0022] The list of example scenarios in Table 1 below represent the various missions, and
portions of missions, for which DDL may operate, in various UAV embodiments.          Other
embodiments and scenarios are possible. The scenarios that are portions of missions can
occur as part of multiple other missions. For example, the GCS Handoff Scenario may occur
during the mission represented by the Classic Scenario, in which case both scenarios impose
requirements on the DDL design.
[0023] As shown in Table 1, there are multiple scenarios envisioned for operating a DDL
network.    Some scenarios comprise an entire mission, and other scenarios consist of one

                                   Network Protocol Layers
[0024] Network architectures are comprised of a number of protocol layers as shown in FIG.
2.   As illustrated in FIG. 2, the DDL network can be viewed as a vertical stack from the
lowest physical layer up to the standard network layer. The layers are:
Network Layer- The highest layer transfers Ethernet packets between external devices
connected to DDL nodes.        Packets have MAC addresses which are used by the external
devices to communicate with each other. Normal internet traffic enters the DDL network via
one edge DDL node, and exits from all other edge DDL nodes, providing a channel for those
external devices to communicate with each other. In the network layer, external devices
communicate with other external devices.
Link Layer- This middle layer transfers DDL packets between DDL nodes. These packets
have DDL addresses, consisting of a DDL RUID (Random Unit Identifier), sometimes
alternatively referred to as a SUID (Session User Identifier), that identifies the DDL node,
and a DDL port which identifies a particular input/output port of that DDL node.
Physical Layer- The lowest layer handles timing of transmissions and preparing the data for
modulating into RF energy radiated by a transmitter and intercepted and processed by
multiple receivers.
                                            Arbiter
[0025] Referring to FIG. 1, each DDL network session 15 is coordinated by one of the DDL
nodes 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500, operating in the role of "arbiter."     This arbiter node is
usually onboard an aircraft UAV1 or UAV2 to benefit from the advantaged position up in the
air.  In various other network environments (not shown), for example in a totally ground
based network environment, the arbiter may be in a node that is advantageously positioned to,
capable of, or particularly effective at communicating with the other nodes. Or, it may be in
a node in secure location, if desired. In FIG. 1, DDL node 100 in UAV1 is illustrated in the
role of arbiter. The primary duty of the arbiter is to schedule time slots during which each
P032371D2     14904744 1

                                               12
node is allowed to transmit. Sharing of a communications channel by time scheduling is
known as "Time Division Multiple Access" (TDMA).
[0026] The arbiter 100 controls the bandwidth for each of the client nodes 200, 300, 400, and
500.   The arbiter 100 sets the bandwidth for each node 200, 300, 400, and 500.          If the
bandwidth allocated by the arbiter 100 is not required by any of the nodes 200, 300, 400, and
500, the arbiter gives the bandwidth to another of the nodes 200, 300, 400, or 500.        The
arbiter moves the bandwidth allocation around. This allows the arbiter 100 to allocate to one
node a large bandwidth, and to another node a small bandwidth, based on the needs of each
of the nodes 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500. Thus, the arbiter 100 controls all communication
in the network session 15.
[0027] Further, all communication is between a DDL node 200, 300, 400, or 500, and the
arbiter 100. Generally the arbiter 100 is in an airplane, but anyone of the nodes 200, 300,
400, or 500 could be the arbiter. The arbiter 100 could be on the ground, but generally it is
placed in an aircraft because an aircraft has the best line of sight for transmitting wireless
signals. As shown in FIG. 1, a node 300 in another airplane UAV2 may relay through the
arbiter 100 in airplane UAV1 to the other nodes 200, 400, or 500. In this embodiment, in
addition to being the arbiter, DDL node 100 may also have its own session video, vehicle
control data, or other data to communicate. Thus, the DDL node 100 also participates in the
allocation of bandwidth at the arbiter 100.
[0028] In conventional TDMA applications, a predetermined cycle is used.            In various
embodiments of the present application, the arbiter 100 can set up a regular cycle for
transmission, but it is able to vary bandwidth allocated to each node 200, 300, 400, or 500
based on the session 15 bandwidth needs. The arbiter 100 is not locked into a predetermined
cycle.   The bandwidth for each node 200, 300, 400, or 500 can change from burst to burst.
The decision making on how to allocate bandwidth is by the arbiter 100.        If there is low
bandwidth data, such as only voice data, the arbiter could set up a more structured network
analogous to a TDMA. If the data requirements change the arbiter 100 can change bandwidth
allocation. For example, sometimes the arbiter 100 may require high bandwidth to send a
whole new full frame of new video to a ground station GCU1, or and thereafter it may just

                                                13
need to send low bandwidth incremental video to the ground station GCU1. As the amount
of data changes, the arbiter 100 can vary the allocation to each node 200, 300, 400 and 500.
The arbiter 100 can be reactive to the data transmission needs within the session 15.
                                       Node Addressing
[0029] FIGS. 3A and 3B show block diagrams of node addressing for a sample DDL session
16, from the perspective of LAPTOP1 connected to ground control station GCU1. FIG. 3A
shows a block diagram of illustrating the Random Unit Identifiers (RUID) and the specific
input/output channels or ports of the DDL nodes 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500.              For
communication between the DDL nodes 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500, the Random Unit
Identifiers (RUID) (sometimes alternatively referred to as Session User Identifiers (SUID))
and the specific input/output channels are designated by DDL port numbers: 01 for DDL
Control, 11 for Ethernet, 21 for Serial communications, 31 for LVDS or Low Voltage
Differential Signals, and 02 for the Arbiter are used.
[0030] For communication, the ground control station DDL node to which a laptop is
connected maps known DDL nodes into IP port number ranges to allow software on the
laptop to address the DDL nodes using conventional IP address and port number pairs. FIG.
3B shows a block diagram illustrating an example of mapping of know network nodes 100,
200, 300, 400, and 500 within a network session 16 by the ground control station DDL node
200. LAPTOPI 210 is connected, into IP port number ranges for use by LAPTOPI 210.
This allows software on the LAPTOP1 210 to address the DDL nodes using conventional IP
address and port number pairs. The conventional IP address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) and the base
port addresses are generated by the GCL1 DDL node 200 to provide to the LAPTOP1 210.
The DDL Network Table 202 show and example of the conventional IP addresses
(xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) with the base port addresses, i.e. 5000, 50100, 5200, 5300, and 50400, that
are assigned by the GCL1 DDL node 200 to provide to the LAPTOP 1 210 for the session 16.
The DDL node 200 uses the RUID addresses and port numbers shown in FIG. 3A to
communicate with the other DDL nodes 100, 300, 400, and 500.
P032371D2    14904744 1

                                                14
[0031] Referring to FIG. 3A, the Arbiter 101 and the UAV1 systems 102 have separate
RUID addresses, 0 and 47034, respectively, in this example. Thus, the Arbiter 101 and the
UAV systems 102 are assigned distinct base ports 50000 and 50100.
[0032] Note that in the example of FIG. 3B, DDL node 500 is a passive listener so is note
addressable by LAPTOP1 210, so does not appear in the DDL Network Table 201. In other
embodiments, RTV 500 may be addressable. Similarly, LAPTOP2 410 is not addressable in
this example, but may be in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, RTV
500, or LAPTOP2 410 may be addressable to communicate text or other messages.
[0033] Referring to FIG. 3B, each DDL node that has a laptop attached generates its own
DDL Network Table (not show) for its respective laptop. As such, a different DDL Network
Table (not shown) would be generated by the GCU2 DDL node 400 for laptop 410.
                                     Messages and Packets
[0034] DDL Messages convey commands between DDL nodes. Bandwidth allocation
strategies govern how DDL nodes share the RF channel to communicate with other DDL
nodes, and support connections to and between external devices. Communication between
DDL nodes is conveyed in a small set of packets with specific header information and
message content. DDL nodes communicate with each other via messages described in Table
2. Note that data from an external device is carried in one of these messages.
[0035] Referring to FIG. 1, in various implementations, each node 200, 300, 400, and 500
requests from the arbiter 100 the amount of bandwidth it needs. As shown below in Table 2,
the nodes 200, 300, 400, and 500 request a desired amount of bandwidth that it would like or
Desired BW, and also a minimum amount of bandwidth that it requires or Required BW.
Further, in various embodiments, the nodes 200, 300, 400, and 500 may request a service
interval, the longest time to wait before sending more data using Slot start and Slot duration,
and request a preferred allocation size or Allocated BW, because some data may have an
inherent size associated with it. Based on these requests, the arbiter 100 controls the
bandwidth with each of the nodes 200, 300, 400, and 500.

                                   One Aircraft and One GCS
                                        (FIGS. 4A and 4B)
[0037] FIGS. 4A and 4B show a block diagram showing transmit slot allocations of arbiter
cycles over a mission lifetime for one aircraft being controlled by one GCU. In this example
communications in a simple mission scenario 600 where an operator powers up one UAV and
one GCU, preflights the aircraft, launches and flies it to the area of interest, observes those
areas, flies back home, and lands.
[0038] In this scenario 600, the aircraft listens to determine if there is a session in progress at
block 610, and upon hearing no existing session in progress, initiates its own session by
taking on the role of arbiter for this channel, in this geographic area of reception. The arbiter
session is ready to accept any UAVs and GCUs which might check in, at any time. The
arbiter will allocate in frame 620 (Frame No. 1), the maximum bandwidth to block 624 for
the UAV downlink video stream. This is because initially, the only other demands on the
channel are relatively low: flight commands uplink from the GCU 1 to the aircraft, and
contention slots 625 allocated by the arbiter for new nodes to check in and request bandwidth.
[0039] The GCU 1 hears the arbiter, and in frame 630 (Frame M), joins the session to obtain
a bandwidth allocation.      In frame 630 (Frame M), the GCU1 issues a request 636 in
contention slot 635 and takes control of the UAV in frame 640 (Frame M+1), which it will
retain for the duration of the mission.
[0040] The request 636 by the GCU1 is granted slot 646 in frame 640 (Frame M+1) and the
GCU1 issues a command 647 in contention slot 645. The command 647 is granted slot 657
in frame 650 (Frame M+2). The GCU1 issues a command 648 in contention slot 655. The
GCU1 transmits the command data 657 but does not need the entire slot 657 so the arbiter
ends frame 650 at 650e and starts the next frame 660 (Frame M+3), where the command 658
is granted slot 667. The arbiter offers contention slot 665 for new requesters.

                            Video Relay: Two Aircraft and one GCS
                                         (FIGS. 5A and 5B)
[0042] FIGS. 5A and 5B is a block diagram illustrating transmit slot allocations of arbiter
cycles over a mission lifetime for an example video relay scenario 700. In this example, an
operator uses one UAVI as a "relay" to communicate with a second remote "sensor" UAV2.
The sensor UAV2 cannot communicate with the GCU1 directly because it is either beyond
radio range of the GCU1, or not in line-of-sight of the GCU1. The operator first powers up
the GCU1 and the relay UAV1, and flies it to a relay station from which it can communicate
with both the GCU1 and with the sensor UAV2 when it arrives in its planned area of
operation. The operator then powers up the sensor UAV2, flies it to its area of operation, and
operates it. Upon completion of the mission, the sensor UAV2 is recovered first, followed by
the relay UAV1. Extended relay mission durations can be achieved by relieving the relay
UAV1 when it approaches battery exhaustion: this is described below in the Relay Relief
scenario FIGS. 6A and 6B.
[0043] Upon first powering up, the relay UAV2 hears no existing session in progress and
initiates its own session by taking on the role of arbiter for this channel, within this
geographic area of reception. The arbiter session is ready to accept additional UAVs and
additional GCUs that might check in at any time. Shown in frame 710 (Frame M), GCU1 is
controlling UAV1, while UAV1 is transmitting high bandwidth video in slot 714. The arbiter
will initially allocate maximum bandwidth to video slot 714 to the downlink video stream
from its own UAV1, since the only other demands on the channel are the flight command 716
uplink from the GCU1 to the UAV1 and contention slot 725 opportunities allocated by the
arbiter for new nodes to check in and request bandwidth, shown in frame 720 (Frame M+1).
This allocation continues while the relay UAV1 is flown to its relay station.
[0044] When the relay UAV1 is airborne, the operator can power up the sensor UAV2,
preflight it, launch it, and fly it out to its area of operations. Upon powering up, the sensor
UAV2 hears the existing session conducted by the relay UAV1, and checks in with a request

                                                19
726 for high bandwidth to support its video stream.       In this example, in frame 720 (Frame
M+1), the arbiter invites new requests in slot 725 and UAV2 request moderate bandwidth
video 726, but it exceeds capacity. Having previously granted maximum bandwidth to the
relay UAV1 video at 724, the arbiter must now adjust the bandwidth allocations to satisfy the
sensor UAV2 request. The arbiter adjusts the bandwidth allocations based on the bandwidth
policy in effect at that time, typically reducing the allocation of current streams and granting
an allocation to the sensor UAV2. The allocation for the sensor UAV2 video stream will be
set cognizant of the need for the relay UAV1 to receive the sensor UAV1 stream and
retransmit it.
[0045] In frame 730 (Frame M+2), GCU1 controls UAV2 and sends pilot commands in slot
737. In frame 740 (Frame M+3), UAV2 transmits telemetry and very low bandwidth video
in slots 748 and 749, respectively. In frame 750 (M+4), GCU1 commands UAV1 to reduce
to minimum bandwidth in slot 757. In frame 760 (Frame M+5), UAV2 transmits telemetry
and moderate bandwidth video in slot 768 and 769, respectively. In frame 770 (Frame M+6),
UAV2 transmits telemetry 778 and video 779 but does not need entire slot 775 so the frame
770 (Frame M+6) ends at 770e. The arbiter starts the next frame 780 (Frame M+7) early. In
frame 780 (Frame M+7), GCU1 sends pilot commands in slot 787 to UAV2. In frame 790
(Frame M+8), UAV2 transmits telemetry and moderate bandwidth video in slots 798 and
799, respectively.
[0046] The arbiter controls the session, thus, the arbiter grants GCU1 bandwidth in frame
710. The arbiter invites new requests in frame 720. In frame 730, the arbiter grants GCU1
bandwidth. In frame 740, the arbiter grants UAV2 available bandwidth. At frame 750, the
arbiter grants GCU1 bandwidth. The arbiter grants UAV2 moderate bandwidth in frames 760
and 770. Then, at frame 780, the arbiter grants the GCU1 bandwidth. Thereafter, the arbiter
again grants UAV2 moderate bandwidth at frame 790.
[0047]    RVTs which tune to this channel and have the correct encryption key for this session
can view the video transmitted down from the Relay aircraft.

[0048] FIGS. 6A and 6B is a block diagram illustrating transmit slot allocations of arbiter
cycles over a portion of a mission for an example video relay scenario 800. In this example,
transmit slot allocations of arbiter cycles over the portion of mission when a new aircraft
UAV2 relieves a relay aircraft UAV1. An operator is using one aircraft as a "Relay" to
communicate with other aircraft or GCUs, and that Relay aircraft reaches its limit of
endurance. The operator powers up the relief UAV2 and flies it to the relay station, where it
downloads the session information from the relay UAV 1, and assumes the duties of arbiter.
[0049] In frame 810 (Frame M), the arbiter grants GCU1 bandwidth in slot 816 and GCU1
forwards data at 816 from its external client to GCU2 for its external client. In frame 820
(Frame M+1), the arbiter grants GCU2 bandwidth in slot 826. GCU2 is forwarding data 826
from it external client to GCU1 for its external client. In frame 830 (Frame M+2), the arbiter
invites new requests, so UAV2 having turned on and detected the session in progress, UAV2
waits for a contention slot 835 and then requests in slot 836, bandwidth for transmitting its
telemetry. In frame 840 (Frame M+3), the arbiter grants UAV2 bandwidth and UAV2
transmits its telemetry in slot 846.
[0050] Prior to frame 850 (Frame N), UAV2 launches and climbs to station. At frame 850
(Frame N), the arbiter grants GCU1 bandwidth and GCU1 commands UAV2 to assume
arbiter at 856. In frame 860 (Frame N+1), the arbiter in UAV1 grants UAV2 bandwidth and
UAV2 requests the arbiter in UAV1 to relinquish the role of session arbiter at 866. In frame
870 (Frame N+2) there is no grant of allocation slots by the arbiter in UAV 1 as the arbiter in
UAV1 transmits its arbiter table in slot 876 to allow UAV2 to assume the role of arbiter
without forcing clients to check-in again. In frame 880 (Frame N+3), UAV2 has assumed the
role of arbiter and grants GCU2 bandwidth and GCU2 forwards data at 896 from its external
client to GCU1 for its external client. At frame 890 (Frame N+4), the arbiter in UAV2 grants
GCU1 bandwidth and GCU1 forwards data at 896 from its external client to GCU2, for it
external client.
