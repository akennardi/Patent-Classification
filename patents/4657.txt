         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The present invention relates to a method for preparing a pharmaceutical
 5 intermediate which belongs to the field of organic synthesis, more particularly, relates
   to fenner dew drug intermediates 4-chlorobenzaldehyde synthesis method.
         GENERAL BACKGROUND
         4-chlorobenzaldehyde is mainly used in the manufacture of sedative drugs fenna
10 dew, aminobenzoic acid and other pharmaceutical raw materials and intermediates, it
   is used in the manufacture of pesticides such as cinnamaldehyde aldehyde, herbicide
   and so on. Fenna dew can be used as a weak stabilizer with sedative, stable and
   central muscle relaxation. It can also be used for mental stress, chronic fatigue,
   anxiety, excitement, and irritability caused by some diseases and so on. Because of
15 muscle relaxation, it can be used for back acid, neck hard, bone pain, spine and limb
   pain and rheumatoid arthritis and so on with analgesic drugs. 4-chlorobenzaldehyde as
   a pharmaceutical intermediates of fenner dew, its synthesis method of great
   significance. Most of the existing synthetic methods are using the method that obtained
   by hydrolysis of p-chlorotoluene: the p-chlorotoluene and phosphorus trichloride are
20 added to the reaction pot, raise the temperature to 155 'C in the light, the mixture is
   passed through the chlorine, control the temperature at 160-170 'C, pass through the
   chlorine to the calculation amount, get the chlorinated liquid. Add it into stirring
   concentrated sulfuric acid, and stir it at room temperature for 5h. Standing for
   stratification, take the lower layer of liquid into the ice water for crystallization, after
25 the follow-up steps, get the final product. However, it is complicated and the chlorine
   is toxic, the risk coefficient of operation is higher, and the reaction temperature is
   higher, mostly above 150 0C, the required energy consumption is higher. Therefore, it
   is necessary to propose a new synthetic method.
