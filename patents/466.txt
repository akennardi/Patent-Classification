   RELATED APPLICATIONS
   This application is a divisional application pursuant to Section 79B of the Patents Act 1990 of
   Australian Patent Application No. 2013351182 which corresponds to International Application No.
 5 PCT/EP2013/074864 filed on 27 November 2013 in the Australian national phase, which claims
   priority to GB Provisional Application No. 1221638.8, filed 30 November 2012, the contents of
   which are incorporated herein in their entirety.
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   This invention relates to antigens derived from P. aeruginosa and to their use in immunisation.
 0 BACKGROUNDART
   Pseudomonasaeruginosa, an opportunistic gram-negative bacterial pathogen found in most environments
   including water reservoirs and soil, is one of the leading nosocomial pathogen worldwide. This Gram
   negative bacterium is best known for being the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis
   (CF) patients, with 80% of adult CF patients carrying P. aeruginosa in their lungs [1], and has recently
 5 gained notoriety by being classified as a 'superbug' by the media. The latter emanates from the intrinsic
   resistance that this opportunistic pathogen has against antibiotics [2],. and its prominence as a cause of
   nosocomial infections (i.e. there are an estimated 10,000 cases each year in UK hospitals) [3].
   Despite considerable advances in antimicrobial therapy, effective treatment and control of P. aeruginosa
   infections remains a persistent problem, primarily because of the natural resistance of the organism and
 0 its remarkable ability to acquire resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents by various mechanisms.
   A vaccine against P. aeruginosa has long been sought after, but is so far not available. Several vaccine
   candidates have been assessed in experimental animals and humans, which include sub-cellular fractions.,
   capsule components, purified and recombinant proteins.
   Unique characteristics of the host and the pathogen have complicated the vaccine development.
25 Reference 4 reports a recombinant protein based vaccine approach on a single fusion polypeptide
   obtained by the fusion of two fragments of two outer membrane derived proteins, namely OprF and Opri.
   This vaccine is undergoing clinical trials [5], and further details are disclosed in ref. 6.
   Thus there remains a need to identify further and improved antigens for use as single antigens or in
   combinations in P. aeruginosa vaccines, and in particular for vaccines which are useful against multiple
30 P. aeruginosa pathologies, comprising e.g. cystic fibrosis. Summing up, there is still the need to obtain an
   effective vaccine against P. aeruginosa.
   Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which has been included in the
   present specification is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters form part of the

   prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure as it
   existed before the priority date of each of the appended claims.
   Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising",
   will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements,
 5 integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements,

   Thus the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising one or more (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or
   more) antigens selected from the first antigen group.
                                                         3

   Within the first antigen group, antigens are preferably selected from the list of a PSE54 (PA5340)
   antigen, PSE21-5 (PA5112) antigen; a PSE27-1 (PA0328) antigen; a PSE41-5 (PA2407) antigen; a
   PSE44-4 (PA3526) antigen; a PSE47A-2 (PA4082) antigen; and/or a PSE53-1 (PA5047) antigen.
   Within the 'first antigen group', antigens are preferably selected from a subset of 5 polypeptides, and
 5 particularly useful in producing a protective immunogenic response in vivo if used as single antigens or in
   combinations are: a PSE54 (PA5340) antigen; a PSE44-4 (PA3526) antigen; a PSE21-5 (PA5112)
   antigen; a PSE53-1 (PA5047) antigen; PSE42-1 (PA2793).
   Within the first antigen group, all the listed antigens can be selected as single antigens for use against P.
   aeruginosa, with the proviso that the PSE27-1 (PA0328) antigen can be usefully omitted from this list
 0 ('first antigen group ).
   A "second antigen group" is defined as a group of identified antigens which has already been proposed as
   possible immunogenic stand-alone vaccine antigen but never considered in combination of at least two
   (i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) antigens in in vivo experiments. A subset of the "second antigen group" is
   defined as the "further antigenic polypeptides" group and comprises those antigenic polypeptides that
 5 have been extensively tested as vaccine antigens in vivo.
   The second antigen group comprises the following list of antigens: PSE10-1 (PA1 178) antigen; PSE1 1-3
   (PA1248) antigen; PSE52-1 (PA4765) antigen; PSE19-1 (PA4710) antigen; and PSE38-1 (PA1777)
   antigen.
   The subset of the second antigen group defined as "further antigenic polypetides" group comprises the
 0 following list of antigens: PilA (PA4524), OprF-OprI, FliC (PA1092), FliD (PA1094) and/or Exoprotein
   A (PA1 148). Hence, the "second antigen group" comprises 10 polypeptides in total.
   Thus the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a combination of antigens, said
   combination comprising two or more (i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) antigens selected from the group
   consisting of: a PSE54 (PA5340) antigen; a PSE44-4 (PA3526) antigen; a PSE10-1 (PA1178) antigen; a
25 PSE21-5 (PA5112) antigen; a PSE27-1 (PA0328) antigen; a PSE52-1 (PA4765) antigen a PSE53-1
   (PA5047) antigen; PSEI1-3 (PA1248) antigen; a PSE41 (PA2407) antigen; a PSE47A-2 (PA4082);
   PSE5-1 (PA0595); PSE13-2 (PA1954); PSE17-1 (PA3692); PSE18-2 (PA4370); PSE20-1 (PA4735);
   PSE23-1 (PA3647); PSE24-1 (PA0126); PSE25-1 (PA0189); PSE26-1 (PA0274); PSE28-2 (PA0537);
   PSE31-2 (PA0737); PSE33-2 (PA1086); PSE42-1 (PA2793); PSE45-2 (PA3535); PSE50-1 (PA4578);
30 PSE51-4 (PA4667); PSE19-1 (PA4710); PSE34-1 (PA1106); PSE36-3 (PA1324); PSE38-1 (PA1777).
   Within the first antigen group, antigens are preferably selected from a subset of 7 of 30 polypeptides,
   namely: PSE54 (PA5340), PSE47A-2 (PA4082). PSE41-5 (PA2407), PSE53-1 (PA5047), PSE21-5
   (PA5112), PSE27-1 (PA0328) or PSE44-4 (PA3526) antigens and a subset of the "second antigen group",
   namely: PSE52-1 (PA4765), PSEIO-1 (PA1178), PSE11-3 (PA1248) and the OprF-OprI which is
35 selected from the subset of the 'second antigen group' defined as "further antigenic polypeptides" group.
   Thus the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a combination of antigens, said
                                                          4

   combination comprising two or more (i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) antigens selected from the group
   consisting of these eleven antigens.
   Within the 11 antigens selected from the first, the second and the further antigenic polypeptides group
   there are 55 possible pairs of antigen combinations.
 5 Within the 'second antigen group', comprising the subset of 5 polypeptides referred to herein as 'the
   further antigenic polypeptides",      there are in total 10 polypeptides. The invention provides an
   immunogenic composition comprising a combination of antigens, said combination comprising a mixture
   of two or more (i.e. 2, 3. 4, 5, 6 or more) antigens selected from any of the preferred antigens of the "first
   antigen group" with anyone of the "second antigen group" or "further antigenic polypeptides" group.
 0 The invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a combination of antigens, said
   combination comprising a mixture of two or more (i.e. 2, 3. 4, 5, 6 or more) antigens selected from any
   antigens from the first antigen group and the second antigen group.
   Within the 30 antigens of the mixture of the first antigen group and second antigen group there are 435
   possible pairs of different antigens. All such pairs are disclosed herein and are part of the invention. Thus
 5 the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a pair of antigens, wherein said pair is
   one of said 435 pairs.
   Within the 35 antigens of the mixture of the first antigen group and second antigen group there are 595
   possible pairs of different antigens. All such pairs are disclosed herein and are part of the invention. Thus
   the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a pair of antigens, wherein said pair is
 0 one of said 595 pairs.
   In one embodiment, a composition includes at least one antigen (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) selected from
   the first antigen group and at least one antigen (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more) selected from the second
   antigen group. Antigens from the first antigen group may be selected from the preferred subset of PSE54
   (PA5340). PSE47A-2 (PA4082), PSE41-5 (PA2407), PSE53-1 (PA5047), PSE21-5 (PA5112), or PSE44
25 4 (PA3526) antigens, and antigens from the second antigen group can be selected from PSE52-1
   (PA4765), PSE1O-1 (PA1178) or from any of the further antigenic polypeptide sub-set of the second
   antigen group, preferring the fusion OprF-OprI. .
   The invention also provides an immunogenic composition comprising a combination of antigens, said
   combination comprising two or more (i.e. 2, 3, 4 or 5) antigens selected from the group consisting of: (1)
30 a PSE54 antigen; (2) a PSE1O-1 antigen; (3) a PSE44-4 antigen; (4) a PSE52-lantigen; (5) a PSE53-1
   antigen; (6) a PSE21-5 antigen; (7) a PSE27-1 antigen; (8) a PSE47A-2 antigen; and/or (9) an OprF-OprI
   antigen.
   Within the preferred 9 antigens selected from the first antigen group, the second antigen group and/or the
   further antigen group there are 36 possible pairs of different antigens. All such pairs are disclosed herein
35 and are part of the invention. Thus the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a pair
   of antigens, wherein said pair is one of said 36 pairs.
                                                           5

   The composition may also include an adjuvant e.g. an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant.
   Advantageous combinations of the invention are those in which two or more antigens act synergistically.
   Thus the protection against P. aeruginosa disease achieved by their combined administration exceeds that
   expected by mere addition of their individual protective efficacy.
 5 Specific combinations of interest include, but are not limited to:
   (1)     An immunogenic composition comprising a PSE54 antigen, a PSE27 antigen
   (2)     An immunogenic composition comprising a PSE54 antigen and OprF-OprI antigen

   In some embodiments, any of these immunogenic and protective compositions may include additional
25 pseudomonas antigens, and these further antigens can be polypeptides and/or saccharides. For example,
   they can useful also include one or more Pseudomonas antigens belonging to the "second antigen group"
   which includes the "further antigenic polypeptides" group, which include the fusion polypeptide OprF
   OprI in a synergistic manner.
   The immunogenic composition may also include an adjuvant.

   Furtherpolypeptide antigens group
   In additions to antigens from the various antigen groups of the invention, immunogenic compositions
   may include one or more of the following P. aeruginosa antigens (or antigens comprising immunogenic
   fragment(s) thereof to enhance the efficacy against P. aeruginosa of an immune response elicited by the
 5 composition:
        e    OprF-OprI [4]
        *    PA4525, known also as PilA
        *    PA 1092, known also as FliC
        *    PA1094, known also as FliD
 0      0    PAl 148, Exoprotein A or Exotoxin A
   The "further antigenic polypeptides" group is defined as a subgroup of the second antigen group. This
   group of known antigens can be useful used in combination with 1, 2 or more other useful antigens of the
   first antigen group or the second antigen group.
   Combinations with other P. aeruginosa derived antigens
 5 The individual antigens identified in the antigen groups of the invention may be used in combination with
   other antigens from P.aeruginosa.In some embodiments the other antigens from P. aeruginosa can be in
   the form of saccharides conjugated with a carrier protein. Thus the invention provides an immunogenic
   composition comprising a combination of:
         (1) one or more antigen(s) selected from the first, second, or further antigen groups (as defined
 0       above); and/or their combination or admixture and
         (2) one or more conjugates of a saccharide moiety, and a carrier protein.
   A conjugate used in component (2) of this combination includes a saccharide moiety and a carrier moiety.
   In embodiments of the invention, the composition further comprises the P. aeruginosa 5-hexose Psl
   polysaccharide., which can be present as free polysaccharide and/or conjugated to a carrier protein.
25 Optionally, one or more flagellin adjuvants and/or fusion proteins of the invention act as the carrier
   protein and have Psl polysaccharide conjugated thereto. For example, monomers and/or dimers of the P.
   aeruginosa polysaccharide can be conjugated to one or more of the flagellin adjuvants and/or fusion
   proteins. See reference 7.
   A conjugate used in component (2) of this combination includes a saccharide moiety and a carrier moiety.
30 The saccharide moiety is from the exopolysaccharide of a P. aeruginosa. The saccharide may be a
   polysaccharide having the size that arises during purification from bacteria, or it may be an
   oligosaccharide achieved by fragmentation of such a polysaccharide.
   The invention also provides an immunogenic composition comprising a combination of:
         (1) one or more antigen(s) selected from the first, second. or further antigen groups;
35       (2) one or more conjugates of a P. aeruginosaexopolysaccharide and a carrier protein.
                                                          7

   The carrier moiety in these conjugates will usually be a protein, but usually not one of the antigens of (1).
   Typical carrier proteins are bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria or tetanus toxins, or toxoids or mutants or
   fragments thereof. The CRM197 diphtheria toxin mutant [8] is useful. Other suitable carrier proteins
   include the N.meningitidis outer membrane protein complex [9], synthetic peptides [10]. heat shock
 5 proteins [11], pertussis proteins [12], cytokines [13], lymphokines [13], growth factors [13], artificial
   proteins comprising multiple human CD4* T cell epitopes from various pathogen-derived antigens [14]
   such as N19 [15], protein D from Hinfluenzae 16, pneumolysin [17] or its non-toxic derivatives [18],
   pneumococcal surface protein PspA [19], iron-uptake proteins [20], toxin A or B from C.difficile [21],
   recombinant P.aeruginosaexoprotein A (rEPA) [22], etc. In some embodiments the carrier protein is a P.
 0 aeruginosaprotein, such as an antigen selected from the first, second, or further antigen groups.
   Where a composition includes more than one conjugate., each conjugate may use the same carrier protein
   or a different carrier protein.
   Conjugates may have excess carrier (w/w) or excess saccharide (w/w). In some embodiments, a conjugate
   may include substantially equal weights of each.
 5 The carrier molecule may be covalently conjugated to the carrier directly or via a linker. Direct linkages
   to the protein may be achieved by, for instance, reductive amination between the saccharide and the
   carrier, as described in, for example, references 23 and 24. The saccharide may first need to be activated
   e.g. by oxidation. Linkages via a linker group may be made using any known procedure, for example, the
   procedures described in references 25 and 26. A preferred type of linkage is an adipic acid linker, which
 0 may be formed by coupling a free -NH     2 group (e.g. introduced to a glucan by amination) with adipic acid
   (using, for example, diimide activation), and then coupling a protein to the resulting saccharide-adipic
   acid intermediate [27]. Another preferred type of linkage is a carbonyl linker, which may be formed by
   reaction of a free hydroxyl group of a saccharide CDI [28] followed by reaction with a protein to form a
   carbamate linkage. Other linkers include       -propionamido [29], nitrophenyl-ethylamine [30], haloacyl
25 halides [31], glycosidic linkages [32], 6-aminocaproic acid [33], ADH [34], C 4 to C12 moieties [35], etc.
   Carbodiimide condensation can also be used [36].
   The individual antigens identified in the antigen groups of the invention may be used as carrier proteins
   for exopolysaccharides, to form a covalent conjugate. Thus the invention provides an immunogenic
   composition comprising a conjugate of (1) an antigen selected from the first, second, and further antigen
30 groups and (2) a P. aeruginosa exopolysaccharide. These conjugates may be combined with any of the
   antigens disclosed herein.
   Combinations with other pathogens derived (non-pseudomonas) antigens
   The individual antigens identified in the antigen groups of the invention may be used also in combination
   with other pathogens derived antigens, i.e. non-pseudomonas antigens, and in particular with antigens
35 from bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. Thus the invention provides an immunogenic
   composition comprising a combination of:
                                                          8

         (1) one or more antigen(s) selected from the first, second, and further antigen groups (as defined
         above); and
         (2) one or more antigen(s) selected from the pathogen group consisting of: S. aureus (including one
         or more conjugates of (i) a S.aureus exopolysaccharide; and/or one or more protein antigens of
 5       S.aureus); Burkholderia cenocepacia (e.g. 0 antigen lipopolysaccharide), Clostridium difficile;
         Candida albicans; and/or extraintestinal pathogenicEscherichia coli.
   First antigen group
   PA 0328 or PSE2 7-1
   The 'PA0328' antigen is annotated as 'outer membrane autotransporter'. In the PAOI strain is annotated
 0 as 'hypothetical protein' and has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: I and described as PA0328 in
   reference 37. This sequence is annotated in NCBI as GI: 15595525. It has been recently demonstrated to
   be an autotransporter protein relevant in the virulence strategy adopted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   through its arginine-specific aminopeptidase activity, as in reference 38. Sometimes, PA0328 is referred
   to herein as 'PSE27-1' or as 'PSE27'.

   SEQ ID NO: 50 is a useful fragment of SEQ ID NO: 15 ('PSE19-1               26-764'). This fragment includes the
30 most exposed domain of PSE19-1 and is more easily used at an industrial scale.
   PA1777 or PSE38-1
   The PSE38-1 antigen is annotated as 'Major porin and structural outer membrane porin OprF precursor'.
   In the PAO1 strain PSE38-1 is PA1777 and has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 26 (GI: 15596974).
   See Ref. 37 and 48. EP0297291 described for the first time this protein as useful antigen. Sometimes,
35 PA1777 is referred to herein as 'PSE38-1' or 'PSE38'.
   Useful PSE38-1 antigens can elicit an antibody (e.g. when administered to a human) that recognises SEQ
   ID NO: 26 and/or may comprise an amino acid sequence: (a) having 50% or more identity (e.g. 60%,
                                                          24

   65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%. 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 970, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or more) to
   SEQ ID NO: 26; and/or (b) comprising a fragment of at least 'n' consecutive amino acids of SEQ ID NO:
   26, wherein 'n' is 7 or more (e.g. 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35. 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150. 200,
   250 or more). These PSE38-1 proteins include variants of SEQ ID NO: 26. Preferred fragments of (b)
 5 comprise an epitope from SEQ ID NO: 26. Other preferred fragments lack one or more amino acids (e.g.
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25 or more) from the C-terminus and/or one or more amino acids (e.g.
   1. 2, 3, 4. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25 or more) from the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 26 while retaining at
   least one epitope of SEQ ID NO: 26. The first 24 N-terminal amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 26 can usefully
   be omitted. Other fragments omit one or more protein domains. PSE38-1 is naturally a long protein and
 0 so the use of fragments is helpful e.g. for purification, handling, fusion, expression, etc.
   SEQ ID NO: 61 is a useful fragment of SEQ ID NO: 26 ('PSE38-1               25-350). This fragment includes the
   most exposed domain of PSE3 8-1 and is more easily used at an industrial scale.
   Further antigenic polypeptides
   PA4525 or PHA
 5 The PilA antigen is annotated as' type 4 fimbrial precursor PilA'. In the PAO1 strain PilA is PA4525 and
   has amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 31 (GI: 15599721). See Ref. 37. Useful PilA antigens can elicit an
   antibody (e.g. when administered to a human) that recognises SEQ ID NO: 31 and/or may comprise an
   amino acid sequence: (a) having 50% or more identity (e.g. 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%,
   92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or more) to SEQ ID NO: 31; and/or (b) comprising
 0 a fragment of at least 'n consecutive amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 31, wherein n' is 7 or more (e.g. 8. 10,
   12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60. 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250 or more). These PilA proteins
   include variants of SEQ ID NO: 31. Preferred fragments of (b) comprise an epitope from SEQ ID NO: 31.
   Other preferred fragments lack one or more amino acids (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25 or
   more) from the C-terminus and/or one or more amino acids (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25 or
 5 more) from the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 31 while retaining at least one epitope of SEQ ID NO: 31.
   Other fragments omit one or more protein domains. PilA is naturally a long protein and so the use of
   fragments is helpful e.g. for purification, handling, fusion, expression, etc.
   Useful fragment include the most exposed domain of PilA and is more easily used at an industrial scale. It
   also reduces the antigen's similarity with human proteins. Vaccines and immunotherapy using this
30 antigen have been attempted as shown in reference 49, and in reference 50.
   OprF-OprI
   The OmpF/I antigen is a fusion protein consisting of a hybrid protein [Met-Ala-(His) 6 OprF (190-342)
   OprI (21-83)], ("(His)6" disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 70), resulting by the fusion of the mature outer
   membrane protein I (OprI) and amino acids 190 to 342 of OprF of Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressed
35 in Escherichiacoli and purified.
   The fusion protein has been described in reference 4 as SEQ ID NO 006. For reference purposes, a full
   length amino acid sequence of the fusion protein described herein is given as SEQ ID NO: 32. This
                                                          25

   antigen can be usefully used as positive control as single antigen, or showing a surprising positive effect
   increasing vaccine efficacy in in vivo experiments when used in combination with specific pseudomonas
   antigens.
   PA1092 or F/iC (Flagellarprotein)
 5 Flagella and main flagella proteins like FliC (PA1092) or FliD (PA1094) have been extensively
   characterized and used as single vaccine antigens in the past as shown in reference 51. For reference
   purposes, a full-length amino acid sequence of FliC is given as SEQ ID NO: 33 herein.
   PA1092 antigen and/or PA1094 antigen may be usefully combined with any of the "first antigen group"
   or the "second antigen group".
 0 PA1094 or F/iD (Flagellarprotein)
   Flagella and main flagella proteins like FliD (PA1094) have been extensively characterized and used as
   vaccine antigens in the past as shown in reference 51. For reference purposes, a full-length amino acid
   sequence of FliD is given as SEQ ID NO: 34 herein.
   PA1094 may be usefully combined with any of the "first antigen group" or any of the "second antigen
 5 group".
   PA1148 or Exoprotein A or Exotoxin A
   The Exoprotein A known also as Exotoxin A is an exoprotein which has been extensively characterized
   and used primarily as carrier protein in polysaccharide conjugate vaccine approach, e.g. reference 22. It is
   known as PA1148 in the PAOIPAOI strain. See Ref. 37.
 o PAl 148 antigen may be usefully combined with any of the "first antigen group" or any of the "second
   antigen group".
   Hybrid polypeptides
   Antigens used in the invention may be present in the composition as individual separate polypeptides.
   Where more than one antigen is used, however, they do not have to be present as separate polypeptides.
25 Instead, at least two (e.g. 2, 3. 4, 5, or more) antigens can be expressed as a single polypeptide chain (a
   'hybrid' polypeptide). Hybrid polypeptides offer two main advantages: first, a polypeptide that may be
   unstable or poorly expressed on its own can be assisted by adding a suitable hybrid partner that
   overcomes the problem; second, commercial manufacture is simplified as only one expression and
   purification need be employed in order to produce two polypeptides which are both antigenically useful.
30 The hybrid polypeptide may comprise two or more polypeptide sequences from the first antigen group.
   The hybrid polypeptide may comprise one or more polypeptide sequences from the first antigen group
   and one or more polypeptide sequences from the second antigen group. Moreover, the hybrid polypeptide
   may comprise two or more polypeptide sequences from each of the antigens listed above, or two or more
   variants of the same antigen in the cases in which the sequence has partial variability across strains.
                                                         26

   Hybrids consisting of amino acid sequences from two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten
   antigens are useful. In particular, hybrids consisting of amino acid sequences from two, three, four, or five
   antigens are preferred, such as two or three antigens.
   Different hybrid polypeptides may be mixed together in a single formulation. Hybrids may be combined
 5 with non-hybrid antigens selected from the first, second or third antigen groups. Within such
   combinations, an antigen may be present in more than one hybrid polypeptide and/or as a non-hybrid
   polypeptide. It is preferred, however, that an antigen is present either as a hybrid or as a non-hybrid, but
   not as both.
   The hybrid polypeptides can also be combined with conjugates or non-P.aeruginosaantigens as described
 0 above.
   Hybrid polypeptides can be represented by the formula NH2-A-{-X-L-}n-B-COOH,                    wherein: X is an
   amino acid sequence of a P. aeruginosa antigen, as described above; L is an optional linker amino acid
   sequence; A is an optional N-terminal amino acid sequence; B is an optional C-terminal amino acid
   sequence; n is an integer of 2 or more (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.). Usually n is 2 or 3.
 5 If a -X- moiety has a leader peptide sequence in its wild-type form, this may be included or omitted in the
   hybrid protein. In some embodiments, the leader peptides will be deleted except for that of the -X- moiety
   located at the N-terminus of the hybrid protein i.e. the leader peptide of X1 will be retained, but the leader
   peptides of X 2 ... X. will be omitted. This is equivalent to deleting all leader peptides and using the leader
   peptide of X1 as moiety -A-.
 0 For each n instances of {-X-L-}, linker amino acid sequence -L- may be present or absent. For instance,
   when n=2 the hybrid may be NH2 -X1-L 1 -X 2 -L 2-COOH, NH2 -X 1 -X 2 -COOH, NH 2-X 1 -L 1 -X 2 -COOH, NH 2
   XI-X 2-L 2-COOH, etc. Linker amino acid sequence(s) -L- will typically be short (e.g. 20 or fewer amino
   acids i.e. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). Examples comprise short
   peptide sequences which facilitate cloning, poly-glycine linkers (i.e. comprising Gly, where n = 2, 3, 4, 5,
25 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more) (SEQ ID NO: 71), and histidine tags (i.e. His, where n         = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 10 or
   more) (SEQ ID NO: 72). Other suitable linker amino acid sequences will be apparent to those skilled in
   the art. A useful linker is GSGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 67) or GSGSGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 68), with the
   Gly-Ser dipeptide being formed from a BamHI restriction site, thus aiding cloning and manipulation, and
   the (Gly) 4 (SEQ ID NO: 73) tetrapeptide being a typical poly-glycine linker. Other suitable linkers,
30 particularly for use as the final La are ASGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 69) or a Leu-Glu dipeptide.
   -A- is an optional N-terminal amino acid sequence. This will typically be short (e.g. 40 or fewer amino
   acids i.e. 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35. 34. 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16,
   15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. 1). Examples include leader sequences to direct protein
   trafficking, or short peptide sequences which facilitate cloning or purification (e.g. histidine tags i.e. His,
35 where n = 3, 4, 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more) (SEQ ID NO: 72). A useful tag contains a sequence of 6
   consecutive Histidine (SEQ ID NO: 70), having at its start a homologue or heterologous start Methionine
   and/or an Alanine, i.e. SEQ ID NO 66. Other suitable N-terminal amino acid sequences will be apparent
                                                          27

   to those skilled in the art. If X 1 lacks its own N-terminus methionine, -A- is preferably an oligopeptide
   (e.g. with 1, 2. 3, 4. 5, 6. 7 or 8 amino acids) which provides a N-terminus methionine e.g. Met-Ala-Ser,
   or a single Met residue.
   -B- is an optional C-terminal amino acid sequence. This will typically be short (e.g. 40 or fewer amino
 5 acids i.e. 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28. 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16. 15,
   14, 13, 12, 11, 10. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. 2, 1).
   Polypeptides used with the invention
   Polypeptides used with the invention can take various forms (e.g. native, fusions, glycosylated,
   non-glycosylated,      lipidated,    non-lipidated, phosphorylated.,   non-phosphorylated,      myristoylated,
 0 non-myristoylated, monomeric., multimeric, particulate, denatured, etc.).
   Polypeptides used with the invention can be prepared by various means (e.g. recombinant expression,
   purification from cell culture, chemical synthesis, isolated from a natural biological source etc.).
   Recombinantly-expressed proteins are preferred, particularly for hybrid polypeptides.
   Polypeptides used with the invention are preferably provided in purified or substantially purified form i.e.
 5 substantially free from other polypeptides (e.g. free from naturally-occurring polypeptides), particularly
   from other pseudomonas or host cell polypeptides, and are generally at least about 50% pure (by weight),
   and usually at least about 90% pure i.e. less than about 50%, and more preferably less than about 10%
   (e.g. 5%) of a composition is made up of other expressed polypeptides. Thus the antigens in the
   compositions are separated from the whole organism with which the molecule is expressed.
 0 Polypeptides used with the invention are preferably pseudomonas polypeptides.
   The term polypeptidee" refers to amino acid polymers of any length. The polymer may be linear or
   branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The
   terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for
   example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other
25 manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labelling component. Also included are. for
   example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example,
   unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. Polypeptides can occur as
   single chains or associated chains.
   The invention provides polypeptides comprising a sequence -P-Q- or -Q-P-, wherein: -P- is an amino acid
30 sequence as defined above and -Q- is not a sequence as defined above i.e. the invention provides fusion
   proteins. Where the N-terminus codon of -P- is not ATG, but this codon is not present at the N-terminus
   of a polypeptide., it will be translated as the standard amino acid for that codon rather than as a Met.
   Where this codon is at the N-terminus of a polypeptide, however, it will be translated as Met. Examples
   of -Q- moieties include, but are not limited to, histidine tags (i.e. His, where n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or
35 more) (SEQ ID NO: 72), maltose-binding protein, or glutathione-S-transferase (GST).
                                                         28

   The invention also provides a process for producing a polypeptide of the invention, comprising the step of
   culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid of the invention under conditions which induce
   polypeptide expression.
   Although expression of the polypeptides of the invention may take place in a Pseudomonas,the invention
 5 will usually use a heterologous host for expression (recombinant expression). The heterologous host may
   be prokaiyotic (e.g. a bacterium) or eukaryotic. It may be Ecoli, but other suitable hosts include Bacillus
   subtilis, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria
   cinerea, Mycobacteria (e.g. M.tuberculosis).,yeasts, etc. Compared to the wild-type P. aeruginosa genes
   encoding polypeptides of the invention, it is helpful to change codons to optimise expression efficiency in
 0 such hosts without affecting the encoded amino acids.
   The invention provides a process for producing a polypeptide of the invention, comprising the step of
   synthesising at least part of the polypeptide by chemical means.
   Nucleic acids
   The invention also provides nucleic acid encoding polypeptides and hybrid polypeptides of the invention.
 5 It also provides nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes one or more polypeptides or
   hybrid polypeptides of the invention.
   The invention also provides nucleic acid comprising nucleotide sequences having sequence identity to
   such nucleotide sequences. Identity between sequences is preferably determined by the Smith-Waterman
   homology search algorithm as described above. Such nucleic acids include those using alternative codons
 0 to encode the same amino acid.
   The invention also provides nucleic acid which can hybridize to these nucleic acids. Hybridization
   reactions can be performed under conditions of different "stringency". Conditions that increase stringency
   of a hybridization reaction are widely known and published in the art. Examples of relevant conditions
   include (in order of increasing stringency): incubation temperatures of 25'C, 37 0 C, 50'C, 55'C and 68'C:
25 buffer concentrations of 10 x SSC, 6 x SSC, 1 x SSC, 0.1 x SSC (where SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 15 mM
   citrate buffer) and their equivalents using other buffer systems; formamide concentrations of 0%, 25%,
   50%, and 75%; incubation times from 5 minutes to 24 hours; 1, 2, or more washing steps; wash
   incubation times of 1, 2, or 15 minutes; and wash solutions of 6 x SSC, 1 x SSC, 0.1 x SSC. or de-ionized
   water. Hybridization techniques and their optimization are well known in the art.
30 In some embodiments, nucleic acid of the invention hybridizes to a target under low stringency
   conditions; in other embodiments it hybridizes under intermediate stringency conditions; in preferred
   embodiments, it hybridizes under high stringency conditions. An exemplary set of low stringency
   hybridization conditions is 50'C and 10 x SSC. An exemplary               set of intermediate    stringency
   hybridization conditions is 55'C and 1 x SSC. An exemplary set of high stringency hybridization
35 conditions is 68'C and 0.1 x SSC.
                                                        29

   The invention includes nucleic acid comprising sequences complementary to these sequences (e.g. for
   antisense or probing, or for use as primers).
   Nucleic acids of the invention can be used in hybridisation reactions (e.g. Northern or Southern blots, or
   in nucleic acid microarrays or 'gene chips') and amplification reactions (e.g. PCR, SDA, SSSR, LCR,
 5 TMA, NASBA, etc.) and other nucleic acid techniques.
   Nucleic acid according to the invention can take various forms (e.g. single-stranded, double-stranded,
   vectors, primers, probes, labelled etc.). Nucleic acids of the invention may be circular or branched, but
   will generally be linear. Unless otherwise specified or required, any embodiment of the invention that
   utilizes a nucleic acid may utilize both the double-stranded form and each of two complementary single
 0 stranded forms which make up the double-stranded form. Primers and probes are generally single
   stranded, as are antisense nucleic acids.
   Nucleic acids of the invention are preferably provided in purified or substantially purified form i.e.
   substantially free from other nucleic acids (e.g. free from naturally-occurring nucleic acids), particularly
   from other pseudomonas or host cell nucleic acids, generally being at least about 50% pure (by weight),
 5 and usually at least about 90% pure. Nucleic acids of the invention are preferably pseudomonas nucleic
   acids.
   Nucleic acids of the invention may be prepared in many ways e.g. by chemical synthesis (e.g.
   phosphoramidite synthesis of DNA) in whole or in part, by digesting longer nucleic acids using nucleases
   (e.g. restriction enzymes), by joining shorter nucleic acids or nucleotides (e.g. using ligases or
 0 polymerases), from genomic or cDNA libraries, etc.
   Nucleic acid of the invention may be attached to a solid support (e.g. a bead, plate, filter, film, slide,
   microarray support, resin, etc.). Nucleic acid of the invention may be labelled e.g. with a radioactive or
   fluorescent label, or a biotin label. This is particularly useful where the nucleic acid is to be used in
   detection techniques e.g. where the nucleic acid is a primer or as a probe.
25 The term "nucleic acid" includes in general means a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, which
   contain deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or their analogs. It includes DNA, RNA, DNA/RNA
   hybrids. It also includes DNA or RNA analogs, such as those containing modified backbones (e.g.
   peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) or phosphorothioates) or modified bases. Thus the invention includes
   mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, ribozymes, DNA, cDNA, recombinant nucleic acids, branched nucleic acids,
30 plasmids, vectors, probes, primers, etc. Where nucleic acid of the invention takes the form of RNA, it
   may or may not have a 5' cap.
   Nucleic acids of the invention may be part of a vector i.e. part of a nucleic acid construct designed for
   transduction/transfection of one or more cell types. Vectors may be, for example, "cloning vectors" which
   are designed for isolation, propagation and replication of inserted nucleotides, "expression vectors" which
35 are designed for expression of a nucleotide sequence in a host cell, "viral vectors" which is designed to
   result in the production of a recombinant virus or virus-like particle, or "shuttle vectors", which comprise
                                                         30

   the attributes of more than one type of vector. Preferred vectors are plasmids. A "host cell" includes an
   individual cell or cell culture which can be or has been a recipient of exogenous nucleic acid. Host cells
   include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in
   morphology or in total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or
 5 deliberate mutation and/or change. Host cells include cells transfected or infected in vivo or in vitro with
   nucleic acid of the invention.
   Where a nucleic acid is DNA, it will be appreciated that "U" in a RNA sequence will be replaced by "T"
   in the DNA. Similarly, where a nucleic acid is RNA, it will be appreciated that "T" in a DNA sequence
   will be replaced by "U" in the RNA.
 0 The term "complement" or "complementary" when used in relation to nucleic acids refers to Watson
   Crick base pairing. Thus the complement of C is G, the complement of G is C, the complement of A is T
   (or U), and the complement of T (or U) is A. It is also possible to use bases such as I (the purine inosine)
   e.g. to complement pyrimidines (C or T).
   Nucleic acids of the invention can be used, for example: to produce polypeptides; as hybridization probes
 5 for the detection of nucleic acid in biological samples; to generate additional copies of the nucleic acids;
   to generate ribozymes or antisense oligonucleotides; as single-stranded DNA primers or probes; or as
   triple-strand forming oligonucleotides.
   The invention provides a process for producing nucleic acid of the invention, wherein the nucleic acid is
   synthesised in part or in whole using chemical means.
 0 The invention provides vectors comprising nucleotide sequences of the invention (e.g. cloning or
   expression vectors) and host cells transformed with such vectors.
   Nucleic acid amplification according to the invention may be quantitative and/or real-time.
   For certain embodiments of the invention, nucleic acids are preferably at least 7 nucleotides in length (e.g.
   8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. 36,

   225. 250, 275, 300 nucleotides or longer).
   For certain embodiments of the invention, nucleic acids are preferably at most 500 nucleotides in length
   (e.g. 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 39,
   38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30. 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 nucleotides or
30 shorter).
   Primers and probes of the invention, and other nucleic acids used for hybridization, are preferably
   between 10 and 30 nucleotides in length (e.g. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 22, 23, 24, 25,
   26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40 or more nucleotides).
                                                          31

   Strains and variants
   Antigens are defined above by reference to existing nomenclature (e.g. "PA0328"), to "PSE52" or to
   "PSE followed by a natural number, indicating the clone number, i.e. PSE52-1, etc" or to the respective
   SEQ ID NOs numbers.
 5 Table 1 below associates these three naming/numbering systems to existing PAOI public available
   numbering.
   PAO1 numbering refers to the genome of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 which is extensively described in
   terms of genomic analysis in reference 37.
   Functional annotations for each antigen are also given in the databases.
 0 Thus an exemplary amino acid and nucleotide sequence for any of these antigens can easily be found in
   public sequence databases from the PA0I strain, but the invention is not limited to sequences from the
   PAO1 strains. Standard search and alignment techniques can be used to identify in any of these (or other)
   further genome sequences the homolog of any particular sequence from the PAOI strain. Moreover, the
   available sequences from the PAOI strain can be used to design primers for amplification of homologous
 5 sequences from other strains. Thus the invention is not limited to this strain, but rather encompasses such
   variants and homologs from other strains of P. aeruginosa, as well as non-natural variants. In general,
   suitable variants of a particular SEQ ID NO include its allelic variants, its polymorphic forms, its
   homologs, its orthologs, its paralogs, its mutants., etc.
   Thus, for instance, polypeptides used with the invention may, compared to the SEQ ID NO herein,
 0 include one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.) amino acid substitutions, such as conservative
   substitutions (i.e. substitutions of one amino acid with another which has a related side chain).
   Genetically-encoded amino acids are generally divided into four families: (1) acidic i.e. aspartate,
   glutamate; (2) basic i.e. lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar i.e. alanine. valine, leucine, isoleucine,
   proline., phenylalanine., methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar i.e. glycine, asparagine,
25 glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes
   classified jointly as aromatic amino acids. In general,. substitution of single amino acids within these
   families does not have a major effect on the biological activity. The polypeptides may also include one or
   more (e.g. 1, 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.) single amino acid deletions relative to the SEQ ID NO sequences.
   The polypeptides may also include one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc.) insertions (e.g. each of 1,
30 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acids) relative to the SEQ ID NO sequences.
   Similarly, a polypeptide used with the invention may comprise an amino acid sequence that:
        *   is identical (i.e. 100% identical) to a sequence disclosed in the sequence listing;
        *   shares sequence identity (e.g. 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%. 92%. 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%. 98%,
            99%, 99.5% or more) with a sequence disclosed in the sequence listing;
                                                           32

         *   has 1, 2. 3, 4, 5. 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 (or more) single amino acid alterations (deletions, insertions,
             substitutions), which may be at separate locations or may be contiguous, as compared to the
             sequences of (a) or (b);
         *   when aligned with a particular sequence from the sequence listing using a pairwise alignment
  5          algorithm, each moving window of x amino acids from N-tenninus to C-terminus (such that for
             an alignment that extends to p amino acids, where p>x, there are p-x+1 such windows) has at
             least xy identical aligned amino acids, where: x is selected from 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70,
             80, 90, 100, 150, 200; y is selected from 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, 0.93,
             0.94, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.99; and if x-y is not an integer then it is rounded up to the nearest
  0          integer. The preferred pairwise alignment algorithm is the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment
             algorithm [52], using default parameters (e.g. with Gap opening penalty = 10.0, and with Gap
             extension penalty = 0.5, using the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix). This algorithm is conveniently
             implemented in the needle tool in the EMBOSS package [53].
    Where hybrid polypeptides are used, the individual antigens within the hybrid (i.e. individual -X
  5 moieties) may be from one or more strains. Where n=2, for instance, X2 may be from the same strain as
    Xi or from a different strain. Where n=3. the strains might be (i) X1 =X2 =X 3 (ii) X1=X 2/X (iii) X1'X 2=X 3
    (iv) XI/X 24X 3 or (v) X 1=X 3/X 2 , etc.
    Within group (c), deletions or substitutions may be at the N-terminus and/or C-terminus, or may be
    between the two termini. Thus a truncation is an example of a deletion. Truncations may involve deletion
  0 of up to 40 (or more) amino acids at the N-terminus and/or C-terminus. N-terminus truncation can remove
    leader peptides e.g. to facilitate recombinant expression in a heterologous host. C-terminus truncation can
    remove anchor sequences e.g. to facilitate recombinant expression in a heterologous host.
    In general, when an antigen comprises a sequence that is not identical to a complete P. aeruginosa
    sequence from the sequence listing (e.g. when it comprises a sequence listing with <100% sequence
-5  identity thereto, or when it comprises a fragment thereof) it is preferred in each individual instance that
    the antigen can elicit an antibody which recognises the respective complete P. aeruginosa sequence.
    Mutant bacteria
    Present invention, also provides a P. aeruginosa bacterium in which one or more of the antigens from the
    various antigen groups of the invention has/have been knocked out (see Ref. 46). Techniques for
30  producing knockout bacteria are well known, and knockout of genes from P. aeruginosa strains have
    been reported i.e. in Ref. 54. A knockout mutation may be situated in the coding region of the gene or
    may lie within its transcriptional control regions (e.g. within its promoter). A knockout mutation will
    reduce the level of mRNA encoding the antigen to <1% of that produced by the wild-type bacterium,
    preferably <0.5%, more preferably <0.1%, and most preferably to 0%.
35  The invention also provides a P. aeruginosa in which one or more of the antigens from the various
    antigen groups of the invention has a mutation which inhibits its activity. The gene encoding the antigen
                                                           33

   will have a mutation that changes the encoded amino acid sequence. Mutation may involve deletion,
   substitution, and/or insertion, any of which may be involve one or more amino acids.
   The invention also provides a bacterium, such as a P. aeruginosa bacterium, which hyper-expresses an
   antigen of the invention.
 5 The invention also provides a bacterium, such as a P. aeruginosabacterium, that constitutively expresses
   an antigen of the invention. The invention also provides a E coli comprising a gene encoding an antigen
   of the invention, wherein the gene is under the control of an inducible promoter.
   Mutant bacteria are particularly useful for preparing bacterial outer membrane vesicles which include
   P. aeruginosa antigens (e.g. antigens of the invention), which can be used as immunogens [55-57].
 0 Immunogenic compositions and medicaments
   Immunogenic compositions of the invention may be useful as vaccines. Vaccines according to the
   invention may either be prophylactic (i.e. to prevent infection) or therapeutic (i.e. to treat infection), but
   will typically be prophylactic.
   Compositions may thus be pharmaceutically acceptable. They will usually include components in
 5 addition to the antigens e.g. they typically include one or more pharmaceutical carrier(s) and/or
   excipient(s).
   Compositions will generally be administered to a mammal in aqueous form. Prior to administration,
   however, the composition may have been in a non-aqueous form. For instance, although some vaccines
   are manufactured in aqueous form, then filled and distributed and administered also in aqueous form,
 0 other vaccines are lyophilised during manufacture and are reconstituted into an aqueous form at the time
   of use. Thus a composition of the invention may be dried, such as a lyophilised formulation.
   The composition may include preservatives such as thiomersal or 2-phenoxyethanol. It is preferred,
   however, that the vaccine should be substantially free from (i.e. less than 5pg/ml) mercurial material e.g.
   thiomersal-free. Vaccines containing no mercury are more preferred. Preservative-free vaccines are
25 particularly preferred.
   To improve thermal stability, a composition may include a temperature protective agent. Further details
   of such agents are provided below.
   To control tonicity, it is preferred to include a physiological salt, such as a sodium salt. Sodium chloride
   (NaCI) is preferred, which may be present at between 1 and 20 mg/ml e.g. about 10+2mg/ml NaCl. Other
30 salts that may be present include potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium
   phosphate dehydrate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride. etc.
   Compositions will generally have an osmolality of between 200 mOsm/kg and 400 mOsm/kg, preferably
   between 240-360 mOsm/kg, and will more preferably fall within the range of 290-310 mOsm/kg.
                                                         34

   Compositions may include one or more buffers. Typical buffers include: a phosphate buffer; a Tris buffer;
   a borate buffer; a succinate buffer; a histidine buffer (particularly with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant);
   or a citrate buffer. Buffers will typically be included in the 5-20mM range.
   The pH of a composition will generally be between 5.0 and 8.1,. and more typically between 6.0 and 8.0
 5 e.g. 6.5 and 7.5, or between 7.0 and 7.8.
   The composition is preferably sterile. The composition is preferably non-pyrogenic e.g. containing <1 EU
   (endotoxin unit, a standard measure) per dose, and preferably <0.1 EU per dose. The composition is
   preferably gluten free.
   The composition may include material for a single immunisation, or may include material for multiple
 0 immunisations (i.e. a 'multidose' kit). The inclusion of a preservative is preferred in multidose
   arrangements. As an alternative (or in addition) to including a preservative in multidose compositions, the
   compositions may be contained in a container having an aseptic adaptor for removal of material.
   Human vaccines are typically administered in a dosage volume of about 0.5ml, although a half dose (i.e.
   about 0.25ml) may be administered to children.
 5 Immunogenic compositions of the invention may also comprise one or more immunoregulatory agents.
   Preferably, one or more of the immunoregulatory agents include one or more adjuvants. The adjuvants
   may include a THI adjuvant and/or a TH2 adjuvant, or a TLR7 agonist further discussed below.
   Thus the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a combination of:
         (1) one or more antigen(s) selected from the first, second, and further antigen group (as defined
 0       above): and
         (2) an adjuvant, such as an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant (for example, one or more antigens may
         be adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide).
   For instance, the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a combination of a sta006
   antigen and an adjuvant, such as an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. Similarly, the invention provides an
25 immunogenic composition comprising a combination of a sta0 11 antigen and an adjuvant. such as an
   aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. These compositions are ideally buffered e.g. with a histidine buffer.
   Adjuvants which may be used in compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to:
   A.        Mineral-containingcompositions
   Mineral containing compositions suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include mineral salts, such
30 as aluminium salts and calcium salts (or mixtures thereof). Calcium salts include calcium phosphate (e.g.
   the "CAP" particles disclosed in ref. 58). Aluminum salts include hydroxides, phosphates, sulfates, etc.,
   with the salts taking any suitable form (e.g. gel, crystalline, amorphous., etc.). Adsorption to these salts is
   preferred (e.g. all antigens may be adsorbed). The mineral containing compositions may also be
   formulated as a particle of metal salt [59].
                                                          35

   The adjuvants known as aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate may be used. The invention can
   use any of the "hydroxide" or "phosphate" adjuvants that are in general use as adjuvants. The adjuvants
   known as "aluminium hydroxide" are typically aluminium oxyhydroxide salts, which are usually at least
   partially crystalline.  The adjuvants     known as "aluminium phosphate"          are typically   aluminium
 5 hydroxyphosphates, often also containing a small amount of sulfate (i.e. aluminium hydroxyphosphate
   sulfate). They may be obtained by precipitation, and the reaction conditions and concentrations during
   precipitation influence the degree of substitution of phosphate for hydroxyl in the salt.
   A fibrous morphology (e.g. as seen in transmission electron micrographs) is typical for aluminium
   hydroxide adjuvants. The pI of aluminium hydroxide adjuvants is typically about 11 i.e. the adjuvant
 0 itself has a positive surface charge at physiological pH. Adsorptive capacities of between 1.8-2.6 mg
   protein per mg Al+* at pH 7.4 have been reported for aluminium hydroxide adjuvants.
   Aluminium phosphate adjuvants generally have a P0 4/Al molar ratio between 0.3 and 1.2, preferably
   between 0.8 and 1.2, and more preferably 0.950.1. The aluminium phosphate will generally be
   amorphous, particularly for hydroxyphosphate salts. A typical adjuvant is amorphous aluminium
 5 hydroxyphosphate with P0 4/Al molar ratio between 0.84 and 0.92, included at 0.6mg A1/ml. The
   aluminium phosphate will generally be particulate (e.g. plate-like morphology as seen in transmission
   electron micrographs). Typical diameters of the particles are in the range 0.5-20ptm (e.g. about 5-10ptm)
   after any antigen adsorption. Adsorptive capacities of between 0.7-1.5 mg protein per mg Al + at pH 7.4
   have been reported for aluminium phosphate adjuvants.
 0 The point of zero charge (PZC) of aluminium phosphate is inversely related to the degree of substitution
   of phosphate for hydroxyl, and this degree of substitution can vary depending on reaction conditions and
   concentration of reactants used for preparing the salt by precipitation. PZC is also altered by changing the
   concentration of free phosphate ions in solution (more phosphate = more acidic PZC) or by adding a
   buffer such as a histidine buffer (makes PZC more basic). Aluminium phosphates used according to the
z5 invention will generally have a PZC of between 4.0 and 7.0, more preferably between 5.0 and 6.5 e.g.
   about 5.7.
   Suspensions of aluminium salts used to prepare compositions of the invention may contain a buffer (e.g. a
   phosphate or a histidine or a Tris buffer), but this is not always necessary. The suspensions are preferably
   sterile and pyrogen-free. A suspension may include free aqueous phosphate ions e.g. present at a
30 concentration between 1.0 and 20 mM, preferably between 5 and 15 mM, and more preferably about 10
   mM. The suspensions may also comprise sodium chloride.
   The invention can use a mixture of both an aluminium hydroxide and an aluminium phosphate. In this
   case there may be more aluminium phosphate than hydroxide e.g. a weight ratio of at least 2:1 e.g. >5:1,
   >6:1, >7:1, >8:1, >9:1, etc.
35 The concentration of Al'* in a composition for administration to a patient is preferably less than
   l0mg/ml e.g. <5 mg/ml, <4 mg/ml, <3 mg/ml, <2 mg/ml, <1 mg/ml, etc. A preferred range is between 0.3
   and 1mg/ml. A maximum of 0.85mg/dose is preferred.
                                                          36

   B.        Oil Emulsions
   Oil emulsion compositions suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include squalene-water
   emulsions, such as MF59 [Chapter 10 of ref. 63; see also ref. 60] (5% Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and
   0.5% Span 85, formulated into submicron particles using a microfluidizer). Complete Freund's adjuvant
 5 (CFA) and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) may also be used.
   Various oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants are known, and they typically include at least one oil and at least
   one surfactant, with the oil(s) and surfactant(s) being biodegradable (metabolizable) and biocompatible.
   The oil droplets in the emulsion are generally less than 5pin in diameter, and ideally have a sub-micron
   diameter, with these small sizes being achieved with a microfluidiser to provide stable emulsions.
 0 Droplets with a size less than 220nm are preferred as they can be subjected to filter sterilization.
   The emulsion can comprise oils such as those from an animal (such as fish) or vegetable source. Sources
   for vegetable oils include nuts, seeds and grains. Peanut oil, soybean oil, coconut oil, and olive oil, the
   most commonly available, exemplify the nut oils. Jojoba oil can be used e.g. obtained from the jojoba
   bean. Seed oils include safflower oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower seed oil, sesame seed oil and the like. In
 5 the grain group. corn oil is the most readily available, but the oil of other cereal grains such as wheat,
   oats, rye, rice, teff, triticale and the like may also be used. 6-10 carbon fatty acid esters of glycerol and
   1,2-propanediol, while not occurring naturally in seed oils, may be prepared by hydrolysis, separation and
   esterification of the appropriate materials starting from the nut and seed oils. Fats and oils from
   mammalian milk are metabolizable and may therefore be used in the practice of this invention. The
 0 procedures for separation, purification, saponification and other means necessary for obtaining pure oils
   from animal sources are well known in the art. Most fish contain metabolizable oils which may be readily
   recovered. For example, cod liver oil, shark liver oils, and whale oil such as spermaceti exemplify several
   of the fish oils which may be used herein. A number of branched chain oils are synthesized biochemically
   in 5-carbon isoprene units and are generally referred to as terpenoids. Shark liver oil contains a branched,
 5 unsaturated       terpenoids      known       as   squalene,    2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyl-2,6, 10,14,18,22
   tetracosahexaene, which is particularly preferred herein. Squalane, the saturated analog to squalene, is
   also a preferred oil. Fish oils, including squalene and squalane, are readily available from commercial
   sources or may be obtained by methods known in the art. Other preferred oils are the tocopherols (see
   below). Mixtures of oils can be used.
30 Surfactants can be classified by their 'HLB' (hydrophile/lipophile balance). Preferred surfactants of the
   invention have a HLB of at least 10, preferably at least 15, and more preferably at least 16. The invention
   can be used with surfactants including, but not limited to: the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters surfactants
   (commonly referred to as the Tweens), especially polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80; copolymers of
   ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO), and/or butylene oxide (BO), sold under the DOWFAXTM
35 tradename, such as linear EO/PO block copolymers; octoxynols, which can vary in the number of
   repeating      ethoxy       (oxy-1,2-ethanediyl)   groups,    with     octoxynol-9      (Triton   X-100,    or
   t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol)         being   of particular   interest;  (octy lphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol
   (IGEPAL       CA-630/NP-40);       phospholipids   such as phosphatidylcholine        (lecithin); nonylphenol
                                                          37

   ethoxylates, such as the TergitolTM NP series; polyoxyethylene fatty ethers derived from lauryl, cetyl,
   stearyl and oleyl alcohols (known as Brij surfactants), such as triethyleneglycol monolauryl ether (Brij
   30); and sorbitan esters (commonly known as the SPANs), such as sorbitan trioleate (Span 85) and
   sorbitan monolaurate. Non-ionic surfactants are preferred. Preferred surfactants for including in the
 5 emulsion are Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate), Span 85 (sorbitan trioleate), lecithin and
   Triton X-100.
   Mixtures of surfactants can be used e.g. Tween 80/Span 85 mixtures. A combination of a
   polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) and an
   octoxynol such as t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol         (Triton X-100) is also suitable. Another useful
 0 combination comprises laureth 9 plus a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester and/or an octoxynol.
   Preferred amounts of surfactants (% by weight) are: polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters (such as Tween 80)
   0.01 to 1%, in particular about 0.1 %; octyl- or nonylphenoxy polyoxyethanols (such as Triton X-100, or
   other detergents in the Triton series) 0.001 to 0.1 %, in particular 0.005 to 0.02%; polyoxyethylene ethers
   (such as laureth 9) 0.1 to 20 %, preferably 0.1 to 10 % and in particular 0.1 to 1 % or about 0.5%.
 5 Preferred emulsion adjuvants have an average droplets size of <1pm e.g. <750nm, <500nm, <400nm,
   <300nm, <250nm, <220nm, <200nm, or smaller. These droplet sizes can conveniently be achieved by
   techniques such as microfluidisation.
   Specific oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants useful with the invention include, but are not limited to:
      e   A submicron emulsion of squalene, Tween 80, and Span 85. The composition of the emulsion by
 0        volume can be about 5% squalene, about 0.5% polysorbate 80 and about 0.5% Span 85. In weight
          terms, these ratios become 4.3% squalene, 0.5% polysorbate 80 and 0.48% Span 85. This adjuvant
          is known as 'MF59' [61-], as described in more detail in Chapter 10 of ref. 63 and chapter 12 of
          ref. 64. The MF59 emulsion advantageously includes citrate ions e.g. 10mM sodium citrate buffer.
      *   An emulsion of squalene, a tocopherol. and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80). The emulsion may include
25        phosphate buffered saline. It may also include Span 85 (e.g. at 1%) and/or lecithin. These
          emulsions may have from 2 to 10% squalene, from 2 to 10% tocopherol and from 0.3 to 3% Tween
          80, and the weight ratio of squalene:tocopherol is preferably <1 as this provides a more stable
          emulsion. Squalene and Tween 80 may be present volume ratio of about 5:2 or at a weight ratio of
          about 11:5. One such emulsion can be made by dissolving Tween 80 in PBS to give a 2% solution,
30        then mixing 90ml of this solution with a mixture of (5g of DL-a-tocopherol and 5ml squalene),
          then microfluidising the mixture. The resulting emulsion may have submicron oil droplets e.g. with
          an average diameter of between 100 and 250nm, preferably about 180nm. The emulsion may also
          include a 3-de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A (3d-MPL). Another useful emulsion of this type
          may comprise, per human dose, 0.5-10 mg squalene, 0.5-11 mg tocopherol, and 0.1-4 mg
35        polysorbate 80 [65].
      *   An emulsion of squalene, a tocopherol, and a Triton detergent (e.g. Triton X-100). The emulsion
          may also include a 3d-MPL (see below). The emulsion may contain a phosphate buffer.
                                                         38

   * An emulsion comprising a polysorbate (e.g. polysorbate 80), a Triton detergent (e.g. Triton X-100)
     and a tocopherol (e.g. an u-tocopherol succinate). The emulsion may include these three
     components at a mass ratio of about 75:11:10 (e.g. 750tg/ml polysorbate 80, 110tg/ml Triton X
      100 and    100pg/ml   a-tocopherol succinate),   and these concentrations   should include any
 5   contribution of these components from antigens. The emulsion may also include squalene. The
     emulsion may also include a 3d-MPL (see below). The aqueous phase may contain a phosphate
     buffer.
   " An emulsion of squalane, polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 401 ("PluronicTM L121"). The emulsion
     can be formulated in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. This emulsion is a useful delivery vehicle
 0   for muramyl dipeptides, and has been used with threonyl-MDP in the "SAF-1" adjuvant [66] (0.05
     1% Thr-MDP, 5% squalane, 2.5% Pluronic L121 and 0.2% polysorbate 80). It can also be used
     without the Thr-MDP, as in the "AF"' adjuvant [67] (5% squalane, 1.25% Pluronic L121 and 0.2%
     polysorbate 80). Microfluidisation is preferred.
   * An emulsion comprising squalene, an aqueous solvent, a polyoxyethylene alkyl ether hydrophilic
 5   nonionic surfactant (e.g. polyoxyethylene (12) cetostearyl ether) and a hydrophobic nonionic
     surfactant (e.g. a sorbitan ester or mannide ester, such as sorbitan monoleate or 'Span 80'). The
     emulsion is preferably thermoreversible and/or has at least 90% of the oil droplets (by volume)
     with a size less than 200 nm [68]. The emulsion may also include one or more of: alditol; a
     cryoprotective agent (e.g. a sugar, such as dodecylmaltoside          and/or sucrose); and/or an
 0   alkylpolyglycoside. The emulsion may include a TLR4 agonist [69]. Such emulsions may be
     lyophilized.
   * An emulsion of squalene, poloxamer 105 and Abil-Care [70]. The final concentration (weight) of
     these components in adjuvanted vaccines are 5% squalene, 4% poloxamer 105 (pluronic polyol)
     and 2% Abil-Care        85   (Bis-PEG/PPG-16/16     PEG/PPG-16/16    dimethicone;   caprylic/capric
 5   triglyceride).
   * An emulsion having from 0.5-50% of an oil, 0.1-10% of a phospholipid, and 0.05-5% of a
     non-ionic surfactant. As described in reference 71, preferred phospholipid components are
     phosphatidylcholine,      phosphatidylethanolamine,    phosphatidylserine,   phosphatidylinositol,
     phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, sphingomyelin and cardiolipin. Submicron droplet sizes
30   are advantageous.
   * A submicron oil-in-water emulsion of a non-metabolizable oil (such as light mineral oil) and at
     least one surfactant (such as lecithin, Tween 80 or Span 80). Additives may be included, such as
     QuilA saponin, cholesterol, a saponin-lipophile conjugate (such as GPI-0100, described in
     reference 72, produced by addition of aliphatic amine to desacylsaponin via the carboxyl group of
35   glucuronic acid), dimethyidioctadecylammonium bromide and/or N.N-dioctadecyl-N.N-bis (2
     hydroxyethyl)propanediamine.
   * An emulsion in which a saponin (e.g. QuilA or QS21) and a sterol (e.g. a cholesterol) are
     associated as helical micelles [73].
                                                   39

      *   An emulsion comprising a mineral oil, a non-ionic lipophilic ethoxylated fatty alcohol, and a
          non-ionic hydrophilic surfactant (e.g. an ethoxylated fatty alcohol and/or polyoxyethy lene
          polyoxypropylene block copolymer) [74].
   In some embodiments an emulsion may be mixed with antigen extemporaneously, at the time of delivery,
 5 and thus the adjuvant and antigen may be kept separately in a packaged or distributed vaccine, ready for
   final formulation at the time of use. In other embodiments an emulsion is mixed with antigen during
   manufacture, and thus the composition is packaged in a liquid adjuvanted form,. The antigen will
   generally be in an aqueous form, such that the vaccine is finally prepared by mixing two liquids. The
   volume ratio of the two liquids for mixing can vary (e.g. between 5:1 and 1:5) but is generally about 1:1.
 0 Where concentrations of components are given in the above descriptions of specific emulsions, these
   concentrations are typically for an undiluted composition, and the concentration after mixing with an
   antigen solution will thus decrease.
   Where a composition includes a tocopherol, any of the a, P,     p,   6, e or  4 tocopherols can be used., but
   a-tocopherols are preferred. The tocopherol can take several forms e.g. different salts and/or isomers.
 5 Salts   include   organic   salts,   such  as   succinate, acetate,  nicotinate,   etc. D-a-tocopherol    and
   DL-a-tocopherol can both be used. Tocopherols are advantageously included in vaccines for use in
   elderly patients (e.g. aged 60 years or older) because vitamin E has been reported to have a positive effect
   on the immune response in this patient group [75]. They also have antioxidant properties that may help to
   stabilize the emulsions [76]. A preferred a-tocopherol is DL-a-tocopherol, and the preferred salt of this
 0 tocopherol is the succinate. The succinate salt has been found to cooperate with TNF-related ligands in
   vivo.
   C.       Saponinformulations
   Saponin formulations may also be used as adjuvants in the invention. Saponins are a heterogeneous group
   of sterol glycosides and triterpenoid glycosides that are found in the bark, leaves, stems, roots and even
 5 flowers of a wide range of plant species. Saponin from the bark of the QuillaiasaponariaMolina tree has
   been widely studied as adjuvant. Saponin can also be commercially obtained from Smilax ornata
   (sarsaprilla), Gypsophilla paniculata (brides veil), and Saponaria officianalis (soap root). Saponin
   adjuvant formulations include purified formulations, such as QS21, as well as lipid formulations, such as
   ISCOMs. QS21 is marketed as StimulonTM.
30 Saponin compositions have been purified using HPLC and RP-HPLC. Specific purified fractions using
   these techniques have been identified, including QS7, QS17, QS18, QS21, QH-A, QH-B and QH-C.
   Preferably, the saponin is QS21. A method of production of QS21 is disclosed in ref. 77. Saponin
   formulations may also comprise a sterol, such as cholesterol [78].
   Combinations     of saponins       and   cholesterols  can  be   used   to   form   unique  particles  called
35 immunostimulating complexs (ISCOMs) [chapter 23 of ref. 63]. ISCOMs typically also include a
   phospholipid such as phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine. Any known saponin can be used
                                                          40

   in ISCOMs. Preferably. the ISCOM includes one or more of QuilA, QHA & QHC. ISCOMs are further
   described in refs. 78-. Optionally, the ISCOMS may be devoid of additional detergent [80].
   A review of the development of saponin based adjuvants can be found in ref. 81.
     .      Bacterialor microbial derivatives
 5 Adjuvants suitable for use in the invention include bacterial or microbial derivatives such as non-toxic
   derivatives of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Lipid A derivatives, immunostimulatory
   oligonucleotides and ADP-ribosylating toxins and detoxified derivatives thereof.
   Non-toxic derivatives of LPS include monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and 3-0-deacylated MPL
   (3dMPL). 3dMPL is a mixture of 3 de-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A with 4, 5 or 6 acylated chains.
 0 A preferred "small particle" form of 3 De-O-acylated monophosphoryl lipid A is disclosed in ref. 82.
   Such "small particles" of 3dMPL are small enough to be sterile filtered through a 0.22pim membrane [82].
   Other non-toxic LPS derivatives include monophosphoryl lipid A mimics, such as aminoalkyl
   glucosaminide phosphate derivatives e.g. RC-529 [83].
   Lipid A derivatives include derivatives of lipid A from Escherichia coli such as OM-174. OM-174 is
 5 described for example in refs. 84 & 85.
   Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include nucleotide
   sequences containing a CpG motif (a dinucleotide sequence containing an unmethylated cytosine linked
   by a phosphate bond to a guanosine). Double-stranded RNAs and oligonucleotides containing
   palindromic or poly(dG) sequences have also been shown to be immunostimulatory.
 0 The CpG's can include nucleotide modifications/analogs such as phosphorothioate modifications and can
   be double-stranded or single-stranded. References 86 and 87 disclose possible analog substitutions e.g.
   replacement of guanosine with 2'-deoxy-7-deazaguanosine. The adjuvant effect of CpG oligonucleotides
   is further discussed in refs. 88.
   The CpG sequence may be directed to TLR9, such as the motif GTCGTT or TTCGTT [89]. The CpG
25 sequence may be specific for inducing a Thl immune response, such as a CpG-A ODN, or it may be more
   specific for inducing a B cell response, such a CpG-B ODN. CpG-A and CpG-B ODNs are discussed in
   refs. 90-. Preferably, the CpG is a CpG-A ODN.
   Preferably, the CpG oligonucleotide is constructed so that the 5' end is accessible for receptor recognition.
   Optionally, two CpG oligonucleotide sequences may be attached at their 3' ends to form "immunomers".
30 See, for example, refs. 92-.
   A useful CpG adjuvant is CpG7909, also known as ProMuneTM (Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc.).
   Another is CpG1826. As an alternative, or in addition, to using CpG sequences, TpG sequences can be
   used    [94],  and these      oligonucleotides may   be  free from      unmethylated CpG motifs.         The
   immunostimulatory oligonucleotide may be pyrimidine-rich. For example, it may comprise more than one
35 consecutive thymidine nucleotide (e.g. TTTT, as disclosed in ref. 94), and/or it may have a nucleotide
                                                       41

   composition with >25% thymidine (e.g. >35%, >40%, >50%, >60%, >80%, etc.). For example, it may
   comprise more than one consecutive cytosine nucleotide (e.g. CCCC, as disclosed in ref. 94), and/or it
   may have a nucleotide composition with >25% cytosine (e.g. >35%, >40%, >50%, >60%, >80%, etc.).
   These oligonucleotides may be free from unmethylated CpG motifs. Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides
 5 will typically comprise at least 20 nucleotides. They may comprise fewer than 100 nucleotides.
   A particularly useful adjuvant based around immunostimulatory oligonucleotides is known as           IC-31TM
   [951. Thus an adjuvant used with the invention may comprise a mixture of (i) an oligonucleotide (e.g.
   between 15-40 nucleotides) including at least one (and preferably multiple) Cpl motifs (i.e. a cytosine
   linked to an inosine to form a dinucleotide), and (ii) a polycationic polymer, such as an oligopeptide (e.g.
 0 between 5-20 amino acids) including at least one (and preferably multiple) Lys-Arg-Lys tripeptide
   sequence(s). The oligonucleotide may be a deoxynucleotide comprising 26-mer sequence 5'-(IC)3 I-3.
   Bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins and detoxified derivatives thereof may be used as adjuvants in the
   invention. Preferably, the protein is derived from FKcoli (F coli heat labile enterotoxin "LT"), cholera
   ("CT"), or pertussis ("PT"). The use of detoxified ADP-ribosylating toxins as mucosal adjuvants is
 5 described in ref. 96 and as parenteral adjuvants in ref. 97. The toxin or toxoid is preferably in the form of
   a holotoxin, comprising both A and B subunits. Preferably, the A subunit contains a detoxifying mutation;
   preferably the B subunit is not mutated. Preferably, the adjuvant is a detoxified LT mutant such as LT
   K63, LT-R72, and LT-G192. The use of ADP-ribosylating toxins and detoxified derivatives thereof,
   particularly LT-K63 and LT-R72, as adjuvants can be found in refs. 98-101. A useful CT mutant is or
 0 CT-E29H [102]. Numerical reference for amino acid substitutions is preferably based on the alignments
   of the A and B subunits of ADP-ribosylating toxins set forth in ref. 103, specifically incorporated herein
   by reference in its entirety.
   F.       Human immunomodulators
   Human immunomodulators suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include cytokines, such as
:5 interleukins (e.g. IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12 [104], etc.), interferons (e.g. interferon-7),
   macrophage colony stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor. A preferred immunomodulator is IL-12.
   G.       Bioadhesives and Mucoadhesives
   Bioadhesives and mucoadhesives may also be used as adjuvants in the invention. Suitable bioadhesives
   include esterified hyaluronic acid microspheres [105] or mucoadhesives such as cross-linked derivatives
30 of    poly(acrylic    acid),    polyvinyl    alcohol,    polyvinyl    pyrollidone,    polysaccharides     and
   carboxymethylcellulose. Chitosan and derivatives thereof may also be used as adjuvants in the invention
   [106].
   H.       Microparticles
   Microparticles may also be used as adjuvants in the invention. Microparticles (i.e. a particle of-100nm to
35  ~150pm in diameter, more preferably -200nm to -30pim in diameter, and most preferably -500nm to
    ~10pm in diameter) formed from materials that are biodegradable and non-toxic (e.g. a poly(a-hydroxy
   acid), a polyhydroxybutyric acid, a polyorthoester, a polyanhydride, a polycaprolactone, etc.), with
                                                         42

   poly(lactide-co-glycolide) are preferred, optionally treated to have a negatively-charged surface (e.g. with
   SDS) or a positively-charged surface (e.g. with a cationic detergent, such as CTAB).
   I.       Liposomes
   Examples of liposome formulations suitable for use as adjuvants are described in refs. 107-.
 5 J.       Polyoxyethylene ether andpolyoxyethylene esterformulations
   Adjuvants suitable for use in the invention include polyoxyethylene ethers and polyoxyethylene esters
   [109]. Such formulations further include polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester surfactants in combination with
   an octoxynol [110] as well as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or ester surfactants in combination with at
   least one additional non-ionic surfactant such as an octoxynol [111]. Preferred polyoxyethylene ethers are
 0 selected from the following group: polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (laureth 9), polyoxyethylene-9-steoryl
   ether, polyoxytheylene-8-steoryl ether, polyoxyethylene-4-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-35-lauryl ether,
   and polyoxyethylene-23-lauryl ether.
   K.       Phosphazenes
   A phosphazene, such as poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene] ("PCPP") as described, for example,
 5 in references 112 and 113, may be used.
   L.       Muramyl peptides
   Examples of muramyl peptides suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include N-acetyl-muramyl
   L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP), N-acetyl-normuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine            (nor-MDP), and
   N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(1'-2'-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3
 0 hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine MTP-PE).

 5 Adjuvant combinations
   The invention may also comprise combinations of one or more of the adjuvants identified above. For
   example, the following adjuvant compositions may be used in the invention: (1) a saponin and an oil-in
   water emulsion [134]; (2) a saponin (e.g. QS21) + a non-toxic LPS derivative (e.g. 3dMPL); (3) a saponin
   (e.g. QS21) + a non-toxic LPS derivative (e.g. 3dMPL) + a cholesterol; (4) a saponin (e.g. QS21) +
 0 3dMPL + IL-12 (optionally + a sterol); (5) combinations of 3dMPL with, for example, QS21 and/or oil
   in-water emulsions [135]; (6) SAF, containing 10% squalane, 0.4% Tween               80TM,   5% pluronic-block
   polymer L121, and thr-MDP, either microfluidized into a submicron emulsion or vortexed to generate a
   larger particle size emulsion. (7) RibiTM adjuvant system (RAS), (Ribi Immunochem) containing 2%
   squalene, 0.2% Tween 80, and one or more bacterial cell wall components from the group consisting of
 5 monophosphorylipid A (MPL), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and cell wall skeleton (CWS), preferably
   MPL + CWS (DetoxTM); and (8) one or more mineral salts (such as an aluminum salt) + a non-toxic
   derivative of LPS (such as 3dMPL).
   The use of an aluminium hydroxide and/or aluminium phosphate adjuvant is particularly preferred, and
   antigens are generally adsorbed to these salts. Calcium phosphate is another preferred adjuvant. Other
20 preferred adjuvant combinations include combinations of Th1 and Th2 adjuvants such as CpG & alum or
   resiquimod & alum. A combination of aluminium phosphate and 3dMPL may be used.
   The compositions of the invention may elicit both a cell mediated immune response as well as a humoral
   immune response. This immune response will preferably induce long lasting (e.g. neutralising) antibodies
   and a cell mediated immunity that can quickly respond upon exposure to pseudomonas.
25 Two types of T cells, CD4 and CD8 cells, are generally thought necessary to initiate and/or enhance cell
   mediated immunity and humoral immunity. CD8 T cells can express a CD8 co-receptor and are
   commonly referred to as Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CD8 T cells are able to recognized or interact
   with antigens displayed on MHC Class I molecules.
   CD4 T cells can express a CD4 co-receptor and are commonly referred to as T helper cells. CD4 T cells
30 are able to recognize antigenic peptides bound to MHC class II molecules. Upon interaction with a MHC
                                                       46

   class I molecule, the CD4 cells can secrete factors such as cytokines. These secreted cytokines can
   activate B cells, cytotoxic T cells., macrophages, and other cells that participate in an immune response.
   Helper T cells or CD4+ cells can be further divided into two functionally distinct subsets: TH1 phenotype
   and TH2 phenotypes which differ in their cytokine and effector function.
 5 Activated THI      cells enhance cellular immunity (including an increase in antigen-specific CTL
   production) and are therefore of particular value in responding to intracellular infections. Activated THI
   cells may secrete one or more of IL-2, IFN-7,. and TNF-P. A TH1 immune response may result in local
   inflammatory reactions by activating macrophages, NK (natural killer) cells, and CD8 cytotoxic T cells
   (CTLs). A TH1 immune response may also act to expand the immune response by stimulating growth of
 0 B and T cells with IL-12. TH1 stimulated B cells may secrete IgG2a.
   Activated TH2 cells enhance antibody production and are therefore of value in responding to extracellular
   infections. Activated TH2 cells may secrete one or more of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10. A TH2 immune
   response may result in the production of IgG1, IgE, IgA and memory B cells for future protection.
   An enhanced immune response may include one or more of an enhanced THI immune response and a
 5 TH2 immune response.
   A TH1 immune response may include one or more of an increase in CTLs, an increase in one or more of
   the cytokines associated with a TH1 immune response (such as IL-2, IFN-y, and TNF-p), an increase in
   activated macrophages, an increase in NK activity, or an increase in the production of IgG2a. Preferably,
   the enhanced TH1 immune response will include an increase in IgG2a production.
 0 A THI immune response may be elicited using a TH1 adjuvant. A THI adjuvant will generally elicit
   increased levels of IgG2a production relative to immunization of the antigen without adjuvant. THI
   adjuvants suitable for use in the invention may include for example saponin fonnulations, virosomes and
   virus like particles, non-toxic derivatives of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), immunostimulatory
   oligonucleotides. Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides, such as oligonucleotides containing a CpG motif,
25 are preferred THI adjuvants for use in the invention.
   A TH2 immune response may include one or more of an increase in one or more of the cytokines
   associated with a TH2 immune response (such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10), or an increase in the
   production of IgG1, IgE, IgA and memory B cells. Preferably, the enhanced TH2 immune resonse will
   include an increase in IgGI production.
30 A TH2 immune response may be elicited using a TH2 adjuvant. A TH2 adjuvant will generally elicit
   increased levels of IgGI production relative to immunization of the antigen without adjuvant. TH2
   adjuvants suitable for use in the invention include, for example, mineral containing compositions, oil
   emulsions,    and ADP-ribosylating      toxins and detoxified derivatives      thereof. Mineral  containing
   compositions, such as aluminium salts are preferred TH2 adjuvants for use in the invention.
35 Preferably, the invention includes a composition comprising a combination of a THI adjuvant and a TH2
   adjuvant. Preferably, such a composition elicits an enhanced TH1 and an enhanced TH2 response, i.e., an
                                                         47

   increase in the production of both IgGI and IgG2a production relative to immunization without an
   adjuvant. Still more preferably, the composition comprising a combination of a THI and a TH2 adjuvant
   elicits an increased THI and/or an increased TH2 immune response relative to immunization with a single
   adjuvant (i.e., relative to immunization with a THI adjuvant alone or immunization with a TH2 adjuvant
 5 alone).
   The immune response may be one or both of a THI immune response and a TH2 response. Preferably,
   immune response provides for one or both of an enhanced THI response and an enhanced TH2 response.
   The enhanced immune response may be one or both of a systemic and a mucosal immune response.
   Preferably, the immune response provides for one or both of an enhanced systemic and an enhanced
 0 mucosal immune response. Preferably the mucosal immune response is a TH2 immune response.
   Preferably, the mucosal immune response includes an increase in the production of IgA.
   P. aeruginosa infections can affect various areas of the body and so the compositions of the invention
   may be prepared in various forms. For example, the compositions may be prepared as injectables, either
   as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles
 5 prior to injection can also be prepared (e.g. a lyophilised composition or a spray-freeze dried
   composition). The composition may be prepared for topical administration e.g. as an ointment, cream or
   powder. The composition may be prepared for oral administration e.g. as a tablet or capsule, as a spray, or
   as a syrup (optionally flavoured). The composition may be prepared for pulmonary administration e.g. as
   an inhaler, using a fine powder or a spray. The composition may be prepared as a suppository or pessary.
 0 The composition may be prepared for nasal, aural or ocular administration e.g. as drops. The composition
   may be in kit form, designed such that a combined composition is reconstituted just prior to
   administration to a patient. Such kits may comprise one or more antigens in liquid form and one or more
   lyophilised antigens.
   Where a composition is to be prepared extemporaneously prior to use (e.g. where a component is
25 presented in lyophilised form) and is presented as a kit, the kit may comprise two vials, or it may
   comprise one ready-filled syringe and one vial, with the contents of the syringe being used to reactivate
   the contents of the vial prior to injection.
   Immunogenic compositions used as vaccines comprise an immunologically effective amount of
   antigen(s), as well as any other components, as needed. By immunologicallyy effective amount', it is
30 meant that the administration of that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series,
   is effective for treatment or prevention. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical
   condition of the individual to be treated, age, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated (e.g. non
   human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesise antibodies,
   the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the
35 medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad
   range that can be determined through routine trials. Where more than one antigen is included in a
   composition then two antigens may be present at the same dose as each other or at different doses.
                                                         48

   As mentioned above, a composition may include a temperature protective agent, and this component may
   be particularly useful in adjuvanted compositions (particularly those containing a mineral adjuvant, such
   as an aluminium salt). As described in reference 136, a liquid temperature protective agent may be added
   to an aqueous vaccine composition to lower its freezing point e.g. to reduce the freezing point to below
 5 00 C. Thus the composition can be stored below 00 C, but above its freezing point, to inhibit thermal
   breakdown. The temperature protective agent also permits freezing of the composition while protecting
   mineral salt adjuvants against agglomeration or sedimentation after freezing and thawing, and may also
   protect the composition at elevated temperatures e.g. above 40'C. A starting aqueous vaccine and the
   liquid temperature protective agent may be mixed such that the liquid temperature protective agent forms
 0 from 1-80% by volume of the final mixture. Suitable temperature protective agents should be safe for
   human administration, readily miscible/soluble in water, and should not damage other components (e.g.
   antigen and adjuvant) in the composition. Examples include glycerin, propylene glycol. and/or
   polyethylene glycol (PEG). Suitable PEGs may have an average molecular weight ranging from 200
   20,000 Da. In a preferred embodiment, the polyethylene glycol can have an average molecular weight of
 5 about 300 Da ('PEG-300').
   The invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising: (i) one or more antigen(s) selected
   from the first, second, third or fourth antigen groups; and (ii) a temperature protective agent. This
   composition may be formed by mixing (i) an aqueous composition comprising one or more antigen(s)
   selected from the first., second, third or fourth antigen groups, with (ii) a temperature protective agent.
 0 The mixture may then be stored e.g. below 00 C, from 0-20'C, from 20-35'C, from 35-55'C, or higher. It
   may be stored in liquid or frozen form. The mixture may be lyophilised. The composition may
   alternatively be formed by mixing (i) a dried composition comprising one or more antigen(s) selected
   from the first, second, third or fourth antigen groups, with (ii) a liquid composition comprising the
   temperature protective agent. Thus component (ii) can be used to reconstitute component (i).
 5 Methods of treatment, and administration of the vaccine
   The invention also provides a method for raising an immune response in a mammal comprising the step
   of administering an effective amount of a composition of the invention. The immune response is
   preferably protective and preferably involves antibodies and/or cell-mediated immunity. The method may
   raise a booster response.
30 The invention also provides at least two antigens of the invention for combined use as a medicament e.g.
   for use in raising an immune response in a mammal.
   The invention also provides the use of at least two antigens of the invention in the manufacture of a
   medicament for raising an immune response in a mammal.
   By raising an immune response in the mammal by these uses and methods, the mammal can be protected
35 against P. aeruginosa infection, including a nosocomial infection. More particularly, the mammal may be
   protected against a skin infection, including those of burns, trauma wounds and the eyes as shown in
                                                        49

   reference 137. pneumonia, meningitis and neonatal meningitis, osteomyelitis endocarditis, pseudomonas
   folliculitis, toxic shock syndrome, and/or septicaemia and cystic fibrosis.
   The invention also provides a kit comprising a first component and a second component wherein neither
   the first component nor the second component is a composition of the invention as described above, but
 5 wherein the first component and the second component can be combined to provide a composition of the
   invention as described above. The kit may further include a third component comprising one or more of
   the following: instructions, syringe or other delivery device, adjuvant, or pharmaceutically acceptable
   formulating solution.
   The invention also provides a delivery device pre-filled with an immunogenic composition of the
 0 invention.
   The mammal is preferably a human. Where the vaccine is for prophylactic use, the human is preferably a
   child (e.g. a toddler or infant) or a teenager; where the vaccine is for therapeutic use, the human is
   preferably a teenager or an adult. A vaccine intended for children may also be administered to adults e.g.
   to assess safety, dosage, immunogenicity, etc. Other mammals which can usefully be immunised
 5 according to the invention are cows, dogs, horses, and pigs.
   One way of checking efficacy of therapeutic treatment involves monitoring P. aeruginosa infection after
   administration of the compositions of the invention. One way of checking efficacy of prophylactic
   treatment involves monitoring immune responses, systemically (such as monitoring the level of IgGI and
   IgG2a production) and/or mucosally (such as monitoring the level of IgA production), against the
 0 antigens in the compositions of the invention after administration of the composition. Typically, antigen
   specific serum antibody responses are determined post-immunisation but pre-challenge whereas antigen
   specific mucosal antibody responses are determined post-immunisation and post-challenge.
   Another way of assessing the immunogenicity of the compositions of the present invention is to express
   the proteins recombinantly for screening patient sera or mucosal secretions by immunoblot and/or
25 microarrays. A positive reaction between the protein and the patient sample indicates that the patient has
   mounted an immune response to the protein in question. This method may also be used to identify
   immunodominant antigens and/or epitopes within antigens.
   The efficacy of vaccine compositions can also be determined in vivo by challenging animal models of P.
   aeruginosa infection, e.g., guinea pigs or mice, with the vaccine compositions. In particular. there one
30 useful animal model for the study of P. aeruginosa infectious disease, described in details in the chapter
   entitled "efficacy testing" The lethal infection model looks at the number of mice which survive after
   being infected by a normally-lethal dose of P. aeruginosa via intra-tracheal route. Different antigens, and
   different antigen combinations, may contribute to different aspects of an effective vaccine.
   Compositions of the invention will generally be administered directly to a patient. Direct delivery may be
35 accomplished       by   parenteral   injection  (e.g.   subcutaneously.    intraperitoneally,  intravenously,
   intramuscularly, or to the interstitial space of a tissue), or mucosally, such as by rectal, oral (e.g. tablet,
                                                          50

   spray), vaginal, topical, transdermal or transcutaneous, intranasal, ocular., aural, pulmonary or other
   mucosal administration.
   The invention may be used to elicit systemic and/or mucosal immunity, preferably to elicit an enhanced
   systemic and/or mucosal immunity.
 5 Preferably the enhanced systemic and/or mucosal immunity is reflected in an enhanced TH1 and/or TH2
   immune response. Preferably, the enhanced immune response includes an increase in the production of
   IgGI and/or IgG2a and/or IgA.
   Thl7 cells are a recently described lineage of helper T cells that can enhance antibacterial mucosal
   defenses and can potentially mediate protective vaccine-induced response. See reference 138
 0 Dosage can be by a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Multiple doses may be used in a
   primary immunisation schedule and/or in a booster immunisation schedule. In a multiple dose schedule
   the various doses may be given by the same or different routes e.g. a parenteral prime and mucosal boost,
   a mucosal prime and parenteral boost, etc. Multiple doses will typically be administered at least 1 week
   apart (e.g. about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 6 weeks, about 8 weeks, about 10 weeks,
 5 about 12 weeks, about 16 weeks, etc.).
   Vaccines prepared according to the invention may be used to treat both children and adults. Thus a human
   patient may be less than 1 year old, 1-5 years old, 5-15 years old, 15-55 years old, or at least 55 years old.
   Preferred patients for receiving the vaccines are the elderly (e.g. >50 years old, >60 years old, and
   preferably >65 years), the young (e.g. <5 years old), hospitalised patients, healthcare workers, armed
 0 service and military personnel, pregnant women, the chronically ill, or immunodeficient patients. The
   vaccines are not suitable solely for these groups, however, and may be used more generally in a
   population.
   Vaccines produced by the invention may be administered to patients at substantially the same time as
   (e.g. during the same medical consultation or visit to a healthcare professional or vaccination centre) other
25 vaccines e.g. at substantially the same time as an influenza vaccine, a measles vaccine, a mumps vaccine,
   a rubella vaccine, a MMR vaccine, a varicella vaccine, a MMRV vaccine, a diphtheria vaccine, a tetanus
   vaccine, a pertussis vaccine, a DTP vaccine, a conjugated H influenzae type b vaccine, an inactivated
   poliovirus vaccine, a hepatitis B virus vaccine, a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (such as a tetravalent
   A-C-W135-Y vaccine), a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, etc. Further non-pseudomonas vaccines
30 suitable for co-administration may include one or more antigens.
   Nucleic acid immunisation
   The immunogenic compositions described above include polypeptide antigens from P. aeruginosa. In all
   cases, however, the polypeptide antigens can be replaced by nucleic acids (typically DNA) encoding
   those polypeptides, to give compositions, methods and uses based on nucleic acid immunisation. Nucleic
35 acid immunisation is now a developed field.
                                                         51

   The nucleic acid encoding the immunogen is expressed in vivo after delivery to a patient and the
   expressed immunogen then stimulates the immune system. The active ingredient will typically take the
   form of a nucleic acid vector comprising: (i) a promoter; (ii) a sequence encoding the immunogen,
   operably linked to the promoter; and optionally (iii) a selectable marker. Preferred vectors may further
 5 comprise (iv) an origin of replication; and (v) a transcription terminator downstream of and operably
   linked to (ii). In general. (i) & (v) will be eukaryotic and (iii) & (iv) will be prokaryotic.
   Preferred promoters are viral promoters e.g. from cytomegalovirus (CMV). The vector may also include
   transcriptional regulatory sequences (e.g. enhancers) in addition to the promoter and which interact
   functionally with the promoter. Preferred vectors include the immediate-early CMV enhancer/promoter,
 0 and more preferred vectors also include CMV intron A. The promoter is operably linked to a downstream
   sequence encoding an immunogen, such that expression of the immunogen-encoding sequence is under
   the promoter's control.
   Where a marker is used, it preferably functions in a microbial host (e.g. in a prokaryote, in a bacteria, in a
   yeast). The marker is preferably a prokaryotic selectable marker (e.g. transcribed under the control of a
 5 prokaryotic promoter). For convenience, typical markers are antibiotic resistance genes.
   The vector of the invention is preferably an autonomously replicating episomal or extrachromosomal
   vector, such as a plasmid.
   The vector of the invention preferably comprises an origin of replication. It is preferred that the origin of
   replication is active in prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes.
 0 Preferred vectors thus include a prokaryotic marker for selection of the vector, a prokaryotic origin of
   replication, but a eukaryotic promoter for driving transcription of the immunogen-encoding sequence.
   The vectors will therefore (a) be amplified and selected in prokaryotic hosts without polypeptide
   expression, but (b) be expressed in eukaryotic hosts without being amplified. This arrangement is ideal
   for nucleic acid immunization vectors.
25 The vector of the invention may comprise a eukaryotic transcriptional terminator sequence downstream of
   the coding sequence. This can enhance transcription levels. Where the coding sequence does not have its
   own, the vector of the invention preferably comprises a polyadenylation sequence. A preferred
   polyadenylation sequence is from bovine growth hormone.
   The vector of the invention may comprise a multiple cloning site
30 In addition to sequences encoding the immunogen and a marker, the vector may comprise a second
   eukaryotic coding sequence. The vector may also comprise an IRES upstream of said second sequence in
   order to permit translation of a second eukaryotic polypeptide from the same transcript as the
   immunogen. Alternatively, the immunogen-coding sequence may be downstream of an IRES.
   The vector of the invention may comprise unmethylated CpG motifs e.g. unmethylated DNA sequences
35 which have in common a cytosine preceding a guanosine, flanked by two 5' purines and two 3'
                                                           52

   pyrimidines. In their unmethylated form these DNA motifs have been demonstrated to be potent
   stimulators of several types of immune cell.
   Vectors may be delivered in a targeted way. Receptor-mediated DNA delivery techniques are described in
   the known art. Therapeutic compositions containing a nucleic acid are administered in a range of about
 5 100ng to about 200mg of DNA for local administration in a gene therapy protocol. Concentration ranges
   of about 500 ng to about 50 mg, about 1ptg to about 2 mg, about 5pLg to about 500[Ig, and about 20plg to
   about 100pjg of DNA can also be used during a gene therapy protocol. Factors such as method of action
   (e.g. for enhancing or inhibiting levels of the encoded gene product) and efficacy of transformation and
   expression are considerations which will affect the dosage required for ultimate efficacy. Where greater
 0 expression is desired over a larger area of tissue, larger amounts of vector or the same amounts re
   administered in a successive protocol of administrations, or several administrations to different adjacent
   or close tissue portions may be required to effect a positive therapeutic outcome. In all cases, routine
   experimentation in clinical trials will determine specific ranges for optimal therapeutic effect.
   Vectors can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non
 5 viral origin (see generally reference 139).
   Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired nucleic acid and expression in a desired cell are well known
   in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited to., recombinant retroviruses (e.g.
   references 140 to ), alphavirus-based vectors (e.g. Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus (ATCC VR
   67; ATCC VR-1247), Ross River virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC VR-1246) and Venezuelan equine
 0 encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC VR 1249; ATCC VR-532); hybrids or
   chimeras of these viruses may also be used), poxvirus vectors (e.g. vaccinia, fowlpox, canarypox,
   modified vaccinia Ankara, etc.), adenovirus vectors, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (e.g. see
   refs. 142 to ). Administration of DNA linked to killed adenovirus [144] can also be employed.
   Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including, but not limited to, polycationic
25 condensed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus alone [e.g. 144], ligand-linked DNA [145],
   eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells [e.g. refs. 146 to ] and nucleic charge neutralization or fusion with
   cell membranes. Naked DNA can also be employed. Exemplary naked DNA introduction methods are
   described in ref. 148. Liposomes (e.g. immunoliposomes) that can act as gene delivery vehicles are
   described in refs. 149 to . Additional approaches are described in references 151-152.
30 Further non-viral delivery suitable for use includes mechanical delivery systems such as the approach
   described in ref. 152. Moreover, the coding sequence and the product of expression of such can be
   delivered through deposition of photopolymerized hydrogel materials or use of ionizing radiation (e.g.
   refs. 153). Other conventional methods for gene delivery that can be used for delivery of the coding
   sequence include, for example, use of hand-held gene transfer particle gun [154] or use of ionizing
35 radiation for activating transferred genes.
   Delivery DNA using PLG {poly(lactide-co-glycolide)} microparticles is a particularly preferred method
   e.g. by adsorption to the microparticles, which are optionally treated to have a negatively-charged surface
                                                         53

   (e.g. treated with SDS) or a positively-charged surface (e.g. treated with a cationic detergent, such as
   CTAB).
   Antibodies
   Antibodies against P. aeruginosa antigens can be used for passive immunisation. Thus the invention
 5 provides an antibody which is specific for an antigen in the first, second, third or fourth antigen groups.
   The invention also provides the use of such antibodies in therapy. The invention also provides the use of
   such antibodies in the manufacture of a medicament. The invention also provides a method for treating a
   mammal comprising the step of administering an effective amount of an antibody of the invention. As
   described above for immunogenic compositions, these methods and uses allow a mammal to be protected
 0 against P. aeruginosa infection.
   The term "antibody" includes intact immunoglobulin molecules, as well as fragments thereof which are
   capable of binding an antigen. These include hybrid (chimeric) antibody molecules; F(ab')2 and F(ab)
   fragments and Fv molecules; non-covalent heterodimers; single-chain Fv molecules (sFv); dimeric and
   trimeric antibody fragment constructs: minibodies; humanized antibody molecules; and any functional
 5 fragments obtained from such molecules, as well as antibodies obtained through non-conventional
   processes such as phage display. Preferably, the antibodies are monoclonal antibodies. Methods of
   obtaining monoclonal antibodies are well known in the art. Humanised or fully-human antibodies are
   preferred.
   General
 0 The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of
   chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology and pharmacology, within the skill of the art.
   Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.
   "GI" numbering is used above. A GI number, or "Genlnfo Identifier". is a series of digits assigned
   consecutively to each sequence record processed by NCBI when sequences are added to its databases.
25 The GI number bears no resemblance to the accession number of the sequence record. When a sequence
   is updated (e.g. for correction, or to add more annotation or information) then it receives a new GI
   number. Thus the sequence associated with a given GI number is never changed. See also reference 37.
   Where the invention concerns an "epitope",, this epitope may be a B-cell epitope and/or a T-cell epitope.
   Such epitopes can be identified empirically (e.g. using PEPSCAN [155] or similar methods), or they can
30 be predicted (e.g. using the Jameson-Wolf antigenic index [156]. matrix-based approaches [157],
   MAPITOPE [158], TEPITOPE [159], OptiMer & EpiMer [160]. ADEPT [161], Tsites, hydrophilicity,
   antigenic index or the methods known in the art. Epitopes are the parts of an antigen that are recognised
   by and bind to the antigen binding sites of antibodies or T-cell receptors, and they may also be referred to
   as "antigenic determinants".
35 Where an antigen "domain" is omitted, this may involve omission of a signal peptide, of a cytoplasmic
   domain, of a transmembrane domain, of an extracellular domain, etc.
                                                          54

   The term "comprising" encompasses "including" as well as "consisting" e.g. a composition "comprising"
   X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X + Y.
   The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x is optional and means, for example., x+10%.
   References to a percentage sequence identity between two amino acid sequences means that, when
 5 aligned, that percentage of amino acids are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment and
   the percent homology or sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in the art,
   for example those described in section 7.7.18 of ref. 162. A preferred alignment is determined by the
   Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm using an affine gap search with a gap open penalty of 12
   and a gap extension penalty of 2, BLOSUM matrix of 62. The Smith-Waterman homology search
 0 algorithm is disclosed in ref. 163.
   MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
   Antigen selection
   P. aeruginosa proteins have been selected for use as vaccine components based on the combination of
   various criteria which include the following ones:
 5      *   Cellular localization prediction, through which priority was attributed to proteins predicted as
            "outer membrane", "periplasmic", extracellular" and "unknown". In relation to the latest
            definition proteins predicted as having an "unknown" cellular localization which are often
            composed of multiple domains, of which one could actually be surface exposed.
        *   Significant homology to known virulence factors, vaccine candidates from other species
 0      *   Lack of significant homology to human proteins encoded by the sequenced human genome, in
            order to limit the probability of generation of autoimmune response or vaccine induced
            autoimmunity.
        *   Lack of significant homology to E. coli proteins, considering that proteins having counterparts in
            many bacterial species, either pathogenic or non-pathogenic have higher probability to have
25          house-keeping functions and therefore are less likely to be good antigens
        *   Conservation over a panel of at least 5 out of 7 fully sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes.
       *    Useful aminoacid sequence length which is considered to be of at least 150 aa
       *    Microarray data. In vitro expression of P. aeruginosa PA0I derived proteins repertoire was
            tested to analyse changes in gene expression under anaerobic conditions as those found in the
30          mucus of CF (cystic fibrosis) patients compared with aerobic conditions found in the
            environment. Priority was assigned to proteins whose expression was maintained in both aerobic
            and anaerobic cell culture conditions.
   The protein can also adsorb reasonably well to aluminium hydroxide (see also below), which is useful for
   stable formulation for delivery to humans.
                                                         55

   Strain coverage
   In order to evaluate the conservation of the antigens selected, various P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were
   used. P. aeruginosa clinical strains were isolated from eight pancreatic-insufficient CF patients attending
   the CF clinic of the Medizinische Hochschule Hannover. P. aeruginosa strains from the first positive
 5 cultures are designated as "early" isolates, whereas intermediate isolates were collected 1 to 5 years
   thereafter and late isolates were collected 7 to 16 years after colonization or prior to death or lung
   transplantation. Strains tested are listed in the following Table.

   present in all tested strains as confirmed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction).
   Thus, considering the vaccine efficacy in terms of a broader cross-strain protection a vaccine based on
   any of the best combinations/cocktails as tested in table 2, can be a valid solution in order to extend
   vaccine coverage against pseudomonas derived infections.
15 Cloning and expression of P. aeruginosa recombinant proteins
   Cloning and expression of antigens can be performed by standard methods.
   Polypeptides antigens from PA strain PAO 1 were PCR-amplified using specific oligonucleotides and PA
   chromosomal DNA as template. Resulting PCR products were cloned in pET15b (Novagen) using the
   PIPE method [164], consisting in the PCR amplification of the cloning vector (V-PCR) and in the PCR
20 amplification of the insert (I-PCR). Then, 1 pl of V-PCR and 1 pl of I-PCR are mixed and transformed in
   chemically competent HK100 cells [165]. I-PCR reactions were set up containing I pM each of the
   forward and reverse primers, Ix Cloned Pfu DNA Polymerase Reaction Buffer., 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo
   DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 200 p.M of each dNTP (Invitrogen) and 50 ng of genomic DNA template.
                                                           56

   The reactions were conducted as follows: initial denaturation for 2 min at 95 'C, then 25 cycles of 95 'C
   for 30 s, 55 'C for 45 s, and 68 'C for 3 min followed by a final cool down to 4 'C. V-PCR reactions
   were identical to the I-PCR reactions but the steps at 68 'C were lasting 14 min and 2 ng of pET15b
   plasmid were used as DNA template. Correct transformants where selected by PCR screening and DNA
 5 plasmid sequencing of the vector-insert junctions. The correct plasmid were then prepared from selected
   HKI00 clones and used to transform BL21(DE3)T1r cells (Sigma) in order to allow protein expression.
   To express cloned proteins, BL21(DE3)Tlr clones containing pET15b constructs were grown in LB
   medium containing 100 tg/ml Ampicillin at 37 'C until OD600 = 0.5. Protein expression was then induced
   by adding 1 mM IPTG and growing at the same temperature for additional 3 hrs. Conventional protein
 0 extractions and SDS-Page were performed to check protein expression. Western blot techniques known in
   the art were used to confirm proper expression of tested P. aeruginosa antigens. Specific antisera from
   immunized mice were used confirm protein expression. Immunofluorescence techniques known in the art
   were used to confirm surface localization of tested P. aeruginosa antigens using anti-cell wall antibodies
   as co-localizator and/or a specific anti-antigen serum obtained after mice immunization.
 5 Adjuvant formulation
   Selected P. aeruginosa protein antigen candidates have been formulated with aluminium hydroxide,
   either individually or as a combination of proteins. The formulations have been optimized for pH and
   osmolarity.
   The antigens were formulated as monovalent antigen or multivalent antigens combinations in Aluminium
 0 Hydroxide. Each antigen was used at 10 pg/formulation/animal. Aluminium hydroxide was used at 2
   mg/ml final concentration, in a 10mM histidine buffer (pH 6.5). Sodium chloride was used to adjust
   osmolality   to physiologic conditions.      Formulations were given intratracheal    in a final vaccine
   composition volume of 200 pl/animal.
   All monovalent and combination formulations, could be adjusted with respect to a desired pH and
25 osmolality. The formulations had pH in the range 6.2-7.3, and osmolality in the range 248-360 mOsm/kg.
   Most of the proteins tested, in various monovalent and combination formulations, adsorbed well to the
   aluminium hydroxide adjuvant.
   The individual PSE54, PSEIO-1, PSE21-5, PSE27-1, PSE44-4, PSE52-1, PSE53-1 proteins were
   completely adsorbed, and could be desorbed without altering their pre-adsorption electrophoretic profile.
30 Each antigen in a combination of was completely adsorbed, with no inter-antigen competition for the
   adjuvant. The antigens in a combination of PSE25+PSE54, PSE27-1+PSE44, PSE38-1+PSE1 1-3, PSE38
   1+PSEll-3, PSE41-5+PSE47A-2, PSE41-5+PSE53-1, PSE47A-2+PSE53-1, PSE47A-2+PSE52-1, were
   also completely adsorbed.
   All tested formulations were stable for their pH and osmolality. All antigens remained completely
35 adsorbed to the adjuvant. All antigens maintained their desorption characteristics. There was no evidence
   of increased degradation or aggregation of antigens after desorption.
                                                         57

   Efficacy testing
   Individual antigens as listed in Table 2 were tested for their ability to protect against intra-tracheal (IT)
   lethal infection challenge by 5x10 6 cfu of planktonic PAOI strain. Results are shown in Figure 1.
   Recombinant proteins were used to immunize mice for protection studies against P. aeruginosa,using
 5 as reference strain PAO1. Groups of 10 mice (C57BL/6NCrlBR male 5 weeks old, Charles River
   Laboratories, Italy) were immunized at day 0, 21 and 35 with different antigens and at day 50
   challenged with the homologous P. aeruginosaPAOI referent strain by acute infection. In each boost
   every mouse received 10 ptg or 20 ig of recombinant protein/s adsorbed with alum alone or with 107
   cfu of heat inactivated PAOl. To obtain antisera mice of all groups were bleeding at day -1, day 34,
 0 and day 49. As negative control 10 mice per immunization round were injected with alum alone,
   while as positive control 10 mice per immunization round were boosted with 107 cfu of heat
   inactivated PAOI strain. On day 50, mice were infected with 5x10 6 cfu (first lethal dose) of
   planktonic P. aeruginosa PAOI via intra-tracheal (IT) route. Mice were anesthetized and the trachea
   directly visualized by a ventral midline incision, exposed and intubated with a sterile, flexible 22-g
 5 cannula attached to a 1 ml syringe. A 60 pl inoculum of planktonic bacteria were implanted via the
   cannula into the lung. Mice were monitored for survival for 120 hrs at intervals of twelve hours and
   compared with un-vaccinated and PAOI vaccinated control groups.
   Antigens showed to be able to give an incremental shift in the survival curves compared with the
   control were listed in table 2, and the best results were seen with PSE21-5, PSE47A-2, PSE52-1,
 0 PSE53-1 or PSE54, PSE10, PSE 11-3, PSE 27-1, PSE44-4 and PSE 41-5.
   Further, individual antigens were tested in combination as reported in Table 2.
   Table 2 gives a summary of results obtained with various antigens used alone or in combinations in vivo
   in the animal mouse model. Survival data are shown in Table 2. In the statistical significance column, the
   p value in Mantel-Cox test is calculated against negative control group. Survival curve of each protein
25 was compared with the survival curve of the negative control of the same round in which the protein was
   tested. Survival was measured for 120 hrs at intervals of twelve hours and compared with un-vaccinated
   and PA0I vaccinated control groups. Percentage of mice survival after the 36 hours was evidence of
   positive immunization results in vivo.
   Among the different rounds considering the 30 tested recombinant proteins (Table 2), three proteins
30 (PSE10-1    (PA1178), PSE47A-2        (PA4082), and PSE52-1      (PA4765) had also a highly statistical
   significance different survival curves when compared with the negative control group (p value in Mantel
   Cox test against negative control group 0,0261, 0,0364 and 0,0275 respectively).
   On the basis of the analysis of the survival curves of seven additional recombinant proteins it can be
   predicted that results may also be significantly corroborated by increasing the numbers of animal tested in
35 vivo further confirming the preliminary positive and surprising data of PSE1I-3 (PA1248), PSE41-5
                                                         58

   (PA2407), PSE44-4 (PA3526), PSE53-1 (PA5047), PSE21-5 (PA5112), PSE-54 (PA5340), PSE-27-1
   (PA0328).
   In addition when a known antigen, namely OprF-OprI, was used alone to immunize mice in the present
   animal model a 20% of survival, with a statistical significance of 0,0446 was obtained.
 5 In order to further improve the survival in this in vivo model, specific combinations were also tested by
   combining together the most promising proteins in order to further increase vaccine efficacy.
   Comparison of Combinations versus its individual polypeptides
   Combinations alias known as cocktails of antigens in a single formulation were also used to immunise
   mice. The combinations were typically adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide (see chapter "Adjuvant
 0 Formulation) and were administered on days 0, 21 and 35. The immunisations were in C57BL/6NCrIBR
   male 5 weeks old mice, 10 per group. On day 50 the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of heat
   inactivated bacteria and survival was then followed for 120 hrs. For comparison, PBS was used as a
   negative control and PA0I heat-inactivated as a positive control.
   The increase in survival, during monitoring for 120 hrs after the immunization schedule and further
 5 infection with lethal dose of the Pseudomonas homologous strain, when compared to the negative control
   group, was surprisingly showing best result when the following combinations were tested (Table 2):
   PSE47A-2+PSE53-1,         PSE47A-2+PSE53-1,      PSE54+PSE44-4 and PSE54+PSE21-5          being the most
   promising; whereas PSE47A-2+PSE52-1 combination was less promising.
   Various tests were performed to compare various combinations to its seven individual polypeptides (i.e
 0 PSE54 or PSE21-5 or PSE27-1, PSE44-4, PSE52-1. PSE53-1, PSE47A-2), as well as OprF/1 as further
   positive control or to an antigen-free negative control.
   Mice were immunized with cocktails of two different proteins. Eight cocktails had statistically different
   survival curves when compared to the negative control group (considering also the PSE54+0prF-OprI
   composition).
25 In the sixth round, different cocktails of proteins combined with the PSE47A-2 were tested: PSE47A
   2+PSE52-1 and PSE47A-2+PSE53-1            were showing a surprising statistical difference respect to the
   negative control group (p value in Mantel-Cox test against negative control group 0,0374 and 0,0373
   respectively).
   In particular,. vaccination with the cocktail PSE47A-2+PSE53-1 resulted surprisingly in 30% of survival,
30 maintain a good statistical significance.
   In the tenth round, different cocktails of proteins combined with the PSE54 were tested. Five cocktails out
   of eight gave a significantly different mortality curve when compared with negative control group as
   reported in the Table 2. In particular, vaccination         with the cocktails of PSE54+PSE44-4 and
                                                                                   4          33
   PSE54+PSE52-1 antigens gave a very good animal protection resulting in            0% and      % of animal
35 survival respectively (p value in Mantel-Cox test against negative control group 0,0076 and 0,0142
                                                         59

   respectively). When re-tested in the eleventh round, the PSE54+PSE44-4 confirmed the positive result
   showing an increase of animal survival of 57%. Other cocktails showing better vaccine efficacy when
   used in combination were: PSE54+PSE21-5, PSE54+PSE53-1 and PSE54+PSE1O-1 (p value in Mantel
   Cox test against negative control group 0,0332, 0,0085 and 0,0025 respectively).
 5 Furthermore, this last cocktail, PSE54+PSE10-i, had comparable results in two different rounds of
   immunization corroborating the positive and surprising result, resulting in the same survival rate of
   animals (20%) in both rounds.
   Finally four additional cocktails of different proteins (PSE27-1+PSE44-4, PSE53-1+PSE41-5 and PSE53
   1+PSE52-1 and PSE54+PSE27-1) may become even more significant further repeating the experiments
 0 in further confirmatory experiments increasing the number of animals.
   In order to even further improve the capacity of protection and ultimately the vaccine efficacy of selected
   antigens, combination of three proteins were tested. Seven groups were tested maintaining two fixed
   proteins PSE54+PSE44-4 plus one variable protein, while others groups tested were with PSE47A
   2+PSE52-1+PSE53-1,         PSE54+PSE52-1+PSE53-1        and PSE54+PSE53-1+PSE       27-1.  Some of these
 5 combination did not gave significant animal protection when compared with negative control group
   whereas when considering e.g. the PSE54+PSE44-4+PSE47A-2 or PSE54+PSE53-1+PSE 27-1 they may
   provide significant protection simply through confirmatory experiments, obtained by increasing the
   number of animals (See table 2). Thus, some of the combination of three proteins did not improve
   protection rather it seemed worse when considering two proteins.
 0 However, when considering a further combination adding in the cocktail of antigens also the positive
   control OprF-Opr1 fusion was included in the further combinations.
   When OprF-OprI was used as single fusion protein antigen it showed 20% of survival with a statistical
   significance of 0.0446, similarly to other single immunization with single promising antigens, whereas
   when used in combination with PSE54 surprisingly the survival percentage increased to 50% with a
25 similar statistical significance. In addition, the immunization with the following antigens in combination
   PSE54+PSE27+OprF-OprI showed surprisingly even 60% of survival with a comparable statistical
   significance, while considering the other combination, namely PSE54+PSE53+OprF-OprI did not show
   any additive effect or significant immunogenic vaccine efficacy than the single antigens immunization,
   even in one single immunization using a decrease amount of each single antigen (Table 2). It is
30 reasonable to expect that by increasing the number of animal tested also this specific combination might
   provide significative increase in immunological protection.
   It will be understood that the invention has been described by way of example only and modifications
   may be made whilst remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.
