 5  The latentiating groups G are selected to allow its removal by one or a combination of
    biochemical, chemical or physical processes to afford compounds of formula (1)where G
    is hydrogen before, during or following application to the treated area or plants.
    Examples of these processes include enzymatic cleavage, chemical hydrolysis and
    photoloysis. Compounds bearing such groups G may offer certain advantages, such as
10  improved penetration of the cuticula of the plants treated, increased tolerance of crops,
    improved compatibility or stability in formulated mixtures containing other herbicides,
    herbicide safeners, plant growth regulators, fungicides or insecticides, or reduced
    leaching in soils.

    C(=O)-O-Rb; wherein Ra is selected from hydrogen, C1-C12 alkyl, C2-C 12alkenyl, C2
    C12alkynyl, C1-C1ohaloalkyl and Rb is selected from C1-C12 alkyl, C2-C 12alkenyl, C2
20  C12alkynyl and C1-C 1ohaloalkyl. In particular, R" and Rb are selected from the group
    consisting of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl,
    ethenyl and propenyl, e.g. 2-propen-1-yl.
    It is preferred that G is hydrogen, a metal, preferably an alkali metal or alkaline earth
25  metal, or an ammonium or sulfonium group, where hydrogen is especially preferred.
    Depending on the nature of the substituents, compounds of formula (1) may exist in
    different isomeric forms. When G is hydrogen, for example, compounds of formula (1)

    The compounds of formula (1), including formula (Ia), (Ib) and (Ic), and their

 5          Any one of the above compounds from T1.001 to T44.107, Tlii.001 to T38ii.107
    and T1iii.to T5iii.087 can be selected as component A to mix with a component B
    selected from at least one of the following:
            a). pymetrozine;
            b). a pyrethroid selected from the group consisting of cyhalothrin,

            c). a macrolide selected from the group consisting of abamectin, emamectin
    benzoate, and spinetoram;
            d). a diamide selected from the group consisting of chlorantraniliprole
    (Rynaxypyr@) and cyantraniliprole (Cyazypyr@);
15          e). thiamethoxam;
            f). sulfoxaflor;
            g). cyenopyrafen;
    The present invention includes all isomers of compounds of formula (1), salts and N
20  oxides thereof, including enantiomers, diastereomers and tautomers. Component A may
    be a mixture of any type of isomer of a compound of formula (1), or may be substantially
    a single type of isomer.
    Preferably, component B is a compound selected from only one of a). to g). above. In
25  other words, preferably the invention provides a two component pesticidal mixture
    comprising as active ingredient a mixture of component A of formula (1), including
    formula (Ia), (Ib) and (Ic) and component B selected from one of a). to g).
    Preferably, component B is a compound selected from the group consisting of
30  abamectin, cyantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, cyhalothrin, lambda cyhalothrin,
    gamma cyhalothrin, pymetrozine, thiamethoxam, and chlorantraniliprole. More preferably
    component B is a compound selected from the group consisting of abamectin,
    cyantraniliprole, chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, lambda cyhalothrin, gamma
    cyhalothrin, pymetrozine, spinetoram, thiamethoxam, sulfoxaflor, and cyenopyrafen.
35
    In one embodiment, component B is a compound selected from the group consisting of

   WO 2013/079564                                    27                     PCT/EP2012/073890
    abamectin, cyantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, lambda cyhalothrin, pymetrozine,
    thiamethoxam, and chlorantraniliprole.
    In another preferred embodiment, component B is a compound selected from the group
 5  consisting of thiamethoxam, lambda cyhalothrin, gamma cyhalothrin, and sulfoxaflor.
    Many sucking pests are known to be vectors of plant diseases caused by
    microorganisms like bacteria, viruses or phytoplasms. The combination of the compound
    according to formula (1)for component A and at least one of these compounds for
10  component B has the added advantage of a knock-down effect on various pests that
    may act as disease vectors, such as for example whiteflies, scales, psyllids, aphids/plant
    slices and mites. With "knock-down effect", it is meant that the pest to be controlled is
    rapidly stopped from feeding, quickly totally immobilized or even speedily killed (e.g. at
    least 80% mortality after 24 hours or 80% mortality after 24 hours), thereby also
15  reducing the risk of infection of the plant exposed to the specified diseases (e.g. viruses)
    spread by such pests. Preferably, the active ingredient is a mixture of component A as
    described above and component B selected from at least one, preferably only one of,
    thiamethoxam, lambda cyhalothrin, gamma cyhalothrin, and sulfoxaflor.
20  All of the components B from a) to g) are known, e.g. from "The Pesticide Manual",
    Fifteenth Edition, Edited by Clive Tomlin, British Crop Protection Council.
    Reference to the above components B includes reference to their salts and any usual
    derivatives, such as ester derivatives and isomers.
25
    It has now been found, surprisingly, that the active ingredient mixture according to the
    invention not only delivers about the additive enhancement of the spectrum of action
    with respect to the pest to be controlled but achieves a synergistic effect which can
    extend the range of action of the component A and of the component B in two ways.
30  Firstly, the rates of application of the component A and of the component B are lowered
    whilst the action remains equally good. Secondly, the active ingredient mixture still
    achieves a high degree of pest control, sometimes even where the two individual
    components have become totally ineffective in such a low application rate range. This
    allows increased safety in use.
35
    However, besides the actual synergistic action with respect to pest control, the pesticidal
    compositions according to the invention can have further surprising advantageous
    properties which can also be described, in a wider sense, as synergistic activity.

   WO 2013/079564                                    28                       PCT/EP2012/073890
    Examples of such advantageous properties that may be mentioned are: a broadening of
    the spectrum of pest control to other pests, for example to resistant strains; a reduction
    in the rate of application of the active ingredients; adequate pest control with the aid of
    the compositions according to the invention, even at a rate of application at which the
 5  individual compounds are totally ineffective; advantageous behaviour during formulation
    and/or upon application, for example upon grinding, sieving, emulsifying, dissolving or
    dispensing; increased storage stability; improved stability to light; more advantageuos
    degradability; improved toxicological and/or ecotoxicological behaviour; improved
    characteristics of the useful plants including: emergence, crop yields, more developed
10  root system, tillering increase, increase in plant height, bigger leaf blade, less dead basal
    leaves, stronger tillers, greener leaf colour, less fertilizers needed, less seeds needed,
    more productive tillers, earlier flowering, early grain maturity, less plant verse (lodging),
    increased shoot growth, improved plant vigor, and early germination; or any other
    advantages familiar to a person skilled in the art.
15
    The combinations according to the invention may also comprise more than one of the
    active components B, if, for example, a broadening of the spectrum of pest control is
    desired. For instance, it may be advantageous in the agricultural practice to combine two
    or three components B with any of the compounds of formula (1), or with any preferred
20  member of the group of compounds of formula (1). The mixtures of the invention may
    also comprise other active ingredients in addition to components A and B.
    In other preferred embodiments, the active ingredient is a mixture of only component A
    and a single active component as component B from the list of a). to g). In other words
25  the pesticidal composition has preferably no more than two pesticidally active
    components.
    Each substituent definition in each preferred group of compounds of formula (1)may be
    juxtaposed with any substituent definition in any other preferred group of compounds, in
30  any combination.
    The weight ratio of A to B is generally between 1000:1 and 1:100, more preferably
    between 500:1 and 1:100. In other embodiments that weight ratio of A to B may be
    between 250:1 to 1:66, for example between 125:1 to 1:33, for example between 100:1
35  to 1:25, for example between 66:1 to 1:10, for example between 33:1 to 1:5 etc. Such
    weight ratios lead to synergistic mixtures.

    The invention also provides pesticidal mixtures comprising a combination of components
    A and B as mentioned above in a synergistically effective amount, together with an
    agriculturally acceptable carrier, and optionally a surfactant.

15
    The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants that have
    been rendered tolerant to herbicides like bromoxynil or classes of herbicides (such as,
    for example, HPPD inhibitors, ACCase inhibitors, ALS inhibitors, for example
    primisulfuron, prosulfuron and trifloxysulfuron, EPSPS (5-enol-pyrovyl-shikimate-3
20  phosphate-synthase) inhibitors, GS (glutamine synthetase) inhibitors) as a result of
    conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. An example of a crop that has
    been rendered tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox, by conventional methods of
    breeding (mutagenesis) is Clearfield@ summer rape (Canola). Examples of crops that
    have been rendered tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides by genetic
25  engineering methods include glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant maize varieties
    commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady@, Herculex lo and
    LibertyLink@.
    The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants which have
30  been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are capable of
    synthesising one or more selectively acting toxins, such as are known, for example, from
    toxin-producing bacteria, especially those of the genus Bacillus.
    Toxins that can be expressed by such transgenic plants include, for example,
35  insecticidal proteins, for example insecticidal proteins from Bacillus cereus or Bacillus
    popilliae; or insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as 6-endotoxins, e.g.
    CrylAb, CrylAc, Cryl F, Cryl Fa2, Cry2Ab, Cry3A, Cry3Bb1 or Cry9c, or vegetative

   WO 2013/079564                                    33                     PCT/EP2012/073890
    insecticidal proteins (Vip), e.g. Vip1, Vip2, Vip3 or Vip3A; or insecticidal proteins of
    bacteria colonising nematodes, for example Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp.,
    such as Photorhabdus luminescens, Xenorhabdus nematophilus; toxins produced by
    animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins and other insect-specific
 5  neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such as Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins,
    such as pea lectins, barley lectins or snowdrop lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors,
    such as trypsine inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin, papain inhibitors;
    ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or
    bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroidoxidase, ecdysteroid
10  UDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors, HMG-COA
    reductase, ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels,
    juvenile hormone esterase, diuretic hormone receptors, stilbene synthase, bibenzyl
    synthase, chitinases and glucanases.
15  In the context of the present invention there are to be understood by 6-endotoxins, for
    example CrylAb, CrylAc, Cryl F, Cryl Fa2, Cry2Ab, Cry3A, Cry3Bb1 or Cry9C, or
    vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip), for example Vip1, Vip2, Vip3 or Vip3A, expressly
    also hybrid toxins, truncated toxins and modified toxins. Hybrid toxins are produced
    recombinantly by a new combination of different domains of those proteins (see, for
20  example, WO 02/15701). An example for a truncated toxin is a truncated CrylAb, which
    is expressed in the Bt1 1 maize from Syngenta Seed SAS, as described below. In the
    case of modified toxins, one or more amino acids of the naturally occurring toxin are
    replaced. In such amino acid replacements, preferably non-naturally present protease
    recognition sequences are inserted into the toxin, such as, for example, in the case of
25  Cry3A055, a cathepsin-G-recognition sequence is inserted into a Cry3A toxin (see WO
    03/018810)
    Examples of such toxins or transgenic plants capable of synthesising such toxins are
    disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 374 753, WO 93/07278, WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 427
30  529, EP-A-451 878 and WO 03/052073.
    The processes for the preparation of such transgenic plants are generally known to the
    person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned
    above. Cryl-type deoxyribonucleic acids and their preparation are known, for example,
35  from WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 367 474, EP-A-0 401 979 and WO 90/13651.

   WO 2013/079564                                  34                     PCT/EP2012/073890
    The toxin contained in the transgenic plants imparts to the plants tolerance to harmful
    insects. Such insects can occur in any taxonomic group of insects, but are especially
    commonly found in the beetles (Coleoptera), two-winged insects (Diptera) and butterflies
    (Lepidoptera).
 5
    Transgenic plants containing one or more genes that code for an insecticidal resistance
    and express one or more toxins are known and some of them are commercially
    available. Examples of such plants are: YieldGardo (maize variety that expresses a
    CrylAb toxin); YieldGard Rootwormo (maize variety that expresses a Cry3Bbl toxin);
10  YieldGard Plus@ (maize variety that expresses a CrylAb and a Cry3Bbl toxin); Starlink
    @ (maize variety that expresses a Cry9c toxin); Herculex lo (maize variety that
    expresses a Cryl Fa2 toxin and the enzyme phosphinothricine N-acetyltransferase (PAT)
    to achieve tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium); NuCOTN 33B@ (cotton
    variety that expresses a CrylAc toxin); Bollgard 1@ (cotton variety that expresses a
15  CrylAc toxin); Bollgard |1@ (cotton variety that expresses a CrylAc and a Cry2Ab toxin);

    The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants which have
    been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are capable of
    synthesising antipathogenic substances having a selective action, such as, for example,
    the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PRPs, see e.g. EP-A-0 392 225).
25  Examples of such antipathogenic substances and transgenic plants capable of
    synthesising such antipathogenic substances are known, for example, from EP-A-0 392
    225, WO 95/33818, and EP-A-0 353 191. The methods of producing such transgenic
    plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for
    example, in the publications mentioned above.
30  Antipathogenic substances which can be expressed by such transgenic plants include,
    for example, ion channel blockers, such as blockers for sodium and calcium channels,
    for example the viral KP1, KP4 or KP6 toxins; stilbene synthases; bibenzyl synthases;
    chitinases; glucanases; the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PRPs; see e.g.

    polypeptide factors involved in plant pathogen defence (so-called "plant disease resist
    ance genes", as described in WO 03/000906).

    vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucurbits and lettuce.
    The term "locus" of a useful plant as used herein is intended to embrace the place on
    which the useful plants are growing, where the plant propagation materials of the useful
10  plants are sown or where the plant propagation materials of the useful plants will be
    placed into the soil. An example for such a locus is a field, on which crop plants are
    growing.
    The term "plant propagation material" is understood to denote generative parts of a
15  plant, such as seeds, which can be used for the multiplication of the latter, and
    vegetative material, such as cuttings or tubers, for example potatoes. There may be
    mentioned for example seeds (in the strict sense), roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes
    and parts of plants. Germinated plants and young plants which are to be transplanted
    after germination or after emergence from the soil, may also be mentioned. These young
20  plants may be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by
    immersion. Preferably "plant propagation material" is understood to denote seeds.
    Insecticides that are of particular interest for treating seeds include thiamethoxam,
    imidacloprid and clothianidin.
25  A further aspect of the instant invention is a method of protecting natural substances of
    plant and/or animal origin, which have been taken from the natural life cycle, and/or their
    processed forms against attack of pests, which comprises applying to said natural
    substances of plant and/or animal origin or their processed forms a combination of
    components A and B in a synergistically effective amount.

    According to the instant invention, the term "natural substances of plant origin, which
    have been taken from the natural life cycle" denotes plants or parts thereof which have
    been harvested from the natural life cycle and which are in the freshly harvested form.
    Examples of such natural substances of plant origin are stalks, leafs, tubers, seeds,
35  fruits or grains. According to the instant invention, the term "processed form of a natural
    substance of plant origin" is understood to denote a form of a natural substance of plant
    origin that is the result of a modification process. Such modification processes can be

   WO 2013/079564                                      37                    PCT/EP2012/073890
    used to transform the natural substance of plant origin in a more storable form of such a
    substance (a storage good). Examples of such modification processes are pre-drying,
    moistening, crushing, comminuting, grounding, compressing or roasting. Also falling
    under the definition of a processed form of a natural substance of plant origin is timber,
 5  whether in the form of crude timber, such as construction timber, electricity pylons and
    barriers, or in the form of finished articles, such as furniture or objects made from wood.
    According to the instant invention, the term "natural substances of animal origin, which
    have been taken from the natural life cycle and/or their processed forms" is understood
10  to denote material of animal origin such as skin, hides, leather, furs, hairs and the like.
    A preferred embodiment is a method of protecting natural substances of plant origin,
    which have been taken from the natural life cycle, and/or their processed forms against
    attack of pests, which comprises applying to said natural substances of plant and/or
15  animal origin or their processed forms a combination of components A and B in a
    synergistically effective amount.
    A further preferred embodiment is a method of protecting fruits, preferably pomes, stone
    fruits, soft fruits and citrus fruits, which have been taken from the natural life cycle,
20  and/or their processed forms, which comprises applying to said fruits and/or their
    processed forms a combination of components A and B in a synergistically effective
    amount.

20  The mixtures comprising a compound of formula (1), e.g. those selected from the tables
    above, and one or more active ingredients as described above can be applied, for
    example, in a single "ready-mix" form, in a combined spray mixture composed from
    separate formulations of the single active ingredient components, such as a "tank-mix",
    and in a combined use of the single active ingredients when applied in a sequential
25  manner, i.e. one after the other with a reasonably short period, such as a few hours or
    days. The order of applying the compounds of formula (1)e.g. those selected from the
    tables above and the active ingredients as described above is not essential for working
    the present invention.
30  The synergistic activity of the combination is apparent from the fact that the pesticidal
    activity of the composition of A + B is greater than the sum of the pesticidal activities of A
    and B.
    The method of the invention comprises applying to the useful plants, the locus thereof or
35  propagation material thereof in admixture or separately, a synergistically effective
    aggregate amount of a component A and a component B.

   WO 2013/079564                                     48                     PCT/EP2012/073890
    Some of said combinations according to the invention have a systemic action and can
    be used as foliar, soil and seed treatment pesticides. The invention also covers a a
    method comprising coating a seed with a mixture of components A and B as defined
    above.
 5
    With the combinations according to the invention it is possible to inhibit or destroy the
    pests which occur in plants or in parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers,
    roots) in different useful plants, while at the same time the parts of plants which grow
    later are also protected from attack by pests.
10
    The combinations of the present invention are of particular interest for controlling pests
    in various useful plants or their seeds, especially in field crops such as potatoes, tobacco
    and sugarbeets, and wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, maize, lawns, cotton, soybeans, oil
    seed rape, pulse crops, sunflower, coffee, sugarcane, fruit and ornamentals in
15  horticulture and viticulture, in vegetables such as cucumbers, beans and cucurbits.
    The combinations according to the invention are applied by treating the pests, the useful
    plants, the locus thereof, the propagation material thereof, the natural substances of
    plant and/or animal origin, which have been taken from the natural life cycle, and/or their
20  processed forms, or the industrial materials threatened by pests, attack with a
    combination of components A and B in a synergistically effective amount.
    The combinations according to the invention may be applied before or after infection or
    contamination of the useful plants, the propagation material thereof, the natural
25  substances of plant and/or animal origin, which have been taken from the natural life
    cycle, and/or their processed forms, or the industrial materials by the pests.
    The combinations according to the invention can be used for controlling, i. e. containing
    or destroying, pests of the abovementioned type which occur on useful plants in
30  agriculture, in horticulture and in forests, or on organs of useful plants, such as fruits,
    flowers, foliage, stalks, tubers or roots, and in some cases even on organs of useful
    plants which are formed at a later point in time remain protected against these pests.
    When applied to the useful plants the compound of formula (1) is generally applied at a
35  rate of 1 to 500 g a.i./ha in association with 1 to 2000 g a.i./ha, of a compound of
    component B, depending on the class of chemical employed as component B.

    Generally for plant propagation material, such as seed treatment, application rates can
    vary from 0.001 to 10g / kg of seeds of active ingredients. When the combinations of the
    present invention are used for treating seed, rates of 0.001 to 5 g of a compound of
    formula (1)per kg of seed, preferably from 0.01 to 1g per kg of seed, and 0.001 to 5 g of
 5  a compound of component B, per kg of seed, preferably from 0.01 to 1g per kg of seed,
    are generally sufficient.
    Spodoptera preferably means Spodoptera littoralis. Heliothis preferably means Heliothis
10  virescens. Tetranychus preferably means Tetranychus urticae.
    The compositions of the invention may be employed in any conventional form, for
    example in the form of a twin pack, a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), an emulsion
    for seed treatment (ES), a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), a solution for
15  seed treatment (LS), a water dispersible powder for seed treatment (WS), a capsule
    suspension for seed treatment (CF), a gel for seed treatment (GF), an emulsion concen
    trate (EC), a suspension concentrate (SC), a suspo-emulsion (SE), a capsule
    suspension (CS), a water dispersible granule (WG), an emulsifiable granule (EG), an
    emulsion, water in oil (EO), an emulsion, oil in water (EW), a micro-emulsion (ME), an oil
20  dispersion (OD), an oil miscible flowable (OF), an oil miscible liquid (OL), a soluble
    concentrate (SL), an ultra-low volume suspension (SU), an ultra-low volume liquid (UL),
    a technical concentrate (TK), a dispersible concentrate (DC), a wettable powder (WP), a
    soluble granule (SG) or any technically feasible formulation in combination with
    agriculturally acceptable adjuvants.
25
    Such compositions may be produced in conventional manner, e.g. by mixing the active
    ingredients with appropriate formulation inerts (diluents, solvents, fillers and optionally
    other formulating ingredients such as surfactants, biocides, anti-freeze, stickers,
    thickeners and compounds that provide adjuvancy effects). Also conventional slow
30  release formulations may be employed where long lasting efficacy is intended.
    Particularly formulations to be applied in spraying forms, such as water dispersible
    concentrates (e.g. EC, SC, DC, OD, SE, EW, EO and the like), wettable powders and
    granules, may contain surfactants such as wetting and dispersing agents and other
    compounds that provide adjuvancy effects, e.g. the condensation product of
35  formaldehyde with naphthalene sulphonate, an alkylarylsulphonate, a lignin sulphonate,
    a fatty alkyl sulphate, and ethoxylated alkylphenol and an ethoxylated fatty alcohol.

   WO 2013/079564                                    50                      PCT/EP2012/073890
    The compositions according to the invention can preferably additionally include an
    additive comprising an oil of vegetable or animal origin, a mineral oil, alkyl esters of such
    oils or mixtures of such oils and oil derivatives. The amount of oil additive used in the
    composition according to the invention is generally from 0.01 to 10 %, based on the
 5  spray mixture. For example, the oil additive can be added to the spray tank in the
    desired concentration after the spray mixture has been prepared. Preferred oil additives
    comprise mineral oils or an oil of vegetable origin, for example rapeseed oil such as
    ADIGOR@ and MERO@, olive oil or sunflower oil, emulsified vegetable oil, such as
    AMIGO (Rh6ne-Poulenc Canada Inc.), alkyl esters of oils of vegetable origin, for
10  example the methyl derivatives, or an oil of animal origin, such as fish oil or beef tallow.
    A preferred additive contains, for example, as active components essentially 80 % by
    weight alkyl esters of fish oils and 15 % by weight methylated rapeseed oil, and also 5 %
    by weight of customary emulsifiers and pH modifiers. Especially preferred oil additives
    comprise alkyl esters of C8-C22 fatty acids, especially the methyl derivatives of C12-C18
15  fatty acids, for example the methyl esters of lauric acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid,
    being important. Those esters are known as methyl laurate (CAS-1 11-82-0), methyl
    palmitate (CAS-1 12-39-0) and methyl oleate (CAS-1 12-62-9). A preferred fatty acid
    methyl ester derivative is Emery@ 2230 and 2231 (Cognis GmbH). Those and other oil
    derivatives are also known from the Compendium of Herbicide Adjuvants, 5th Edition,
20  Southern Illinois University, 2000. Also, alkoxylated fatty acids can be used as additives
    in the inventive compositions as well as polymethylsiloxane based additives, which have
    been described in W008/037373.
    The application and action of the oil additives can be further improved by combining
25  them with surface-active substances, such as non-ionic, anionic or cationic surfactants.
    Examples of suitable anionic, non-ionic and cationic surfactants are listed on pages 7
    and 8 of WO 97/34485. Preferred surface-active substances are anionic surfactants of
    the dodecylbenzylsulfonate type, especially the calcium salts thereof, and also non-ionic
    surfactants of the fatty alcohol ethoxylate type. Special preference is given to
30  ethoxylated C12-C22 fatty alcohols having a degree of ethoxylation of from 5 to 40.
    Examples of commercially available surfactants are the Genapol types (Clariant AG).
    Also preferred are silicone surfactants, especially polyalkyl-oxide-modified
    heptamethyltrisiloxanes, which are commercially available e.g. as Silwet L-77, and also
    perfluorinated surfactants. The concentration of surface-active substances in relation to
35  the total additive is generally from 1 to 30 % by weight. Examples of oil additives that
    consist of mixtures of oils or mineral oils or derivatives thereof with surfactants are

   WO 2013/079564                                      51                    PCT/EP2012/073890
    Edenor ME SU, Turbocharge (Syngenta AG, CH) and Actipron (BP Oil UK Limited,
    GB).
    The said surface-active substances may also be used in the formulations alone, that is
 5  to say without oil additives.
    Furthermore, the addition of an organic solvent to the oil additive/surfactant mixture can
    contribute to a further enhancement of action. Suitable solvents are, for example,
    Solvesso (ESSO) and Aromatic Solvent (Exxon Corporation).The concentration of
10  such solvents can be from 10 to 80 % by weight of the total weight. Such oil additives,
    which may be in admixture with solvents, are described, for example, in US-A
    4 834 908. A commercially available oil additive disclosed therein is known by the name
    MERGE (BASF Corporation). A further oil additive that is preferred according to the
    invention is SCORE (Syngenta Crop Protection Canada.)
15
    In addition to the oil additives listed above, in order to enhance the activity of the
    compositions according to the invention it is also possible for formulations of
    alkylpyrrolidones, (e.g. Agrimax) to be added to the spray mixture. Formulations of
    synthetic latices, such as, for example, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl compounds or poly-1-p
20  menthene (e.g. Bond,      Courier or Emerald) can also be used. Solutions that contain
    propionic acid, for example Eurogkem Pen-e-trate@, can also be mixed into the spray
    mixture as activity-enhancing agents.
    A seed dressing formulation is applied in a manner known per se to the seeds employing
25  the combination of the invention and a diluent in suitable seed dressing formulation form,
    e.g. as an aqueous suspension or in a dry powder form having good adherence to the
    seeds. Such seed dressing formulations are known in the art. Seed dressing
    formulations may contain the single active ingredients or the combination of active
    ingredients in encapsulated form, e.g. as slow release capsules or microcapsules. A
30  typical a tank-mix formulation for seed treatment application comprises 0.25 to 80%,
    especially 1 to 75 %, of the desired ingredients, and 99.75 to 20 %, especially 99 to 25
    %, of a solid or liquid auxiliaries (including, for example, a solvent such as water), where
    the auxiliaries can be a surfactant in an amount of 0 to 40 %, especially 0.5 to 30 %,
    based on the tank-mix formulation. A typical pre-mix formulation for seed treatment
35  application comprises 0.5 to 99.9 %, especially 1 to 95 %, of the desired ingredients, and
    99.5 to 0.1 %, especially 99 to 5 %, of a solid or liquid adjuvant (including, for example, a

   WO 2013/079564                                     52                     PCT/EP2012/073890
    solvent such as water), where the auxiliaries can be a surfactant in an amount of 0 to 50
    %, especially 0.5 to 40 %, based on the pre-mix formulation.
    In general, the formulations include from 0.01 to 90% by weight of active agent, from 0 to
 5  20% agriculturally acceptable surfactant and 10 to 99.99% solid or liquid formulation
    inerts and adjuvant(s), the active agent consisting of at least the compound of formula (1)
    together with a compound of component B, and optionally other active agents,
    particularly microbiocides or conservatives or the like. Concentrated forms of
    compositions generally contain in between about 2 and 80%, preferably between about
10  5 and 70% by weight of active agent. Application forms of formulation may for example
    contain from 0.01 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 5% by weight of active
    agent. Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the
    end user will normally employ diluted formulations.
15  Examples
    A synergistic effect exists whenever the action of an active ingredient combination is
    greater than the sum of the actions of the individual components.
20  The action to be expected E for a given active ingredient combination obeys the so
    called COLBY formula and can be calculated as follows (COLBY, S.R. "Calculating
    synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combination". Weeds, Vol. 15, pages
    20-22; 1967):
    ppm = milligrams of active ingredient (= a.i.) per liter of spray mixture
25  X = % action by active ingredient A) using p ppm of active ingredient
    Y = % action by active ingredient B) using q ppm of active ingredient.
    According to COLBY, the expected (additive) action of active ingredients A)+B) using
    p+q ppm of active ingredient is          E = X +Y-X Y

30  If the action actually observed (0) is greater than the expected action (E), then the
    action of the combination is super-additive, i.e. there is a synergistic effect. In
    mathematical terms the synergism factor SF corresponds to O/E. In the agricultural
    practice an SF of     1.2 indicates significant improvement over the purely complementary
    addition of activities (expected activity), while an SF of s 0.9 in the practical application
35  routine signals a loss of activity compared to the expected activity.

    Tables 45 to 99 show mixtures and compositions including components A as T1.055,
    T1.058 and Tiiii.055 of the present invention demonstrating control on a wide range of
    pests. As the percent of mortality cannot exceed 100 percent, the unexpected increase
    in insecticidal activity can be greatest only when the separate active ingredient
 5  components alone are at application rates providing considerably less than 100 percent
    control. Synergy may not be evident at low application rates where the individual active
    ingredient components alone have little activity. However, in some instances high activity
    was observed for combinations wherein individual active ingredient alone at the same
    application rate had essentially no activity.
