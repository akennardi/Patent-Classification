                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]      Aspects of the present invention relate to financial transaction
cards. More specifically, the embodiments relate to funding technologies for
financial transaction cards as well as the cards themselves.
                         BACKGROUND INFORMATION
[0002]      Customers use pre-funded financial transaction cards for a variety
of purposes. Pre-funded financial transaction cards (also referred to as
"prepaid debit cards") allow for the flexibility of eliminating use of cash with
merchants, coupled with the convenience of ordinary credit card transactions.
Pre-funded financial transaction cards also allow the bearer of the card to
eliminate the potential for overdrafts as the pre-funded transaction card has a
finite amount of funds allocated to the card. Consequently, the bearer will not
have to pay interest fees for the card, as the possibility of overdraft does not
exist.
[0003]      While pre-funded transaction cards have many advantages, there
are significant drawbacks for the cards. In conventional pre-funded
transaction cards, the cards are funded at the time the card is purchased.
The pre-funding of the card necessitates that the money pertaining to the card
value is contained in an account, ready for usage by the bearer.
[0004]      For large purchasers of pre-funded financial transaction cards, such
as for use as a promotional item, the purchaser must purchase each card at
full value. For large purchases, the purchaser must commit significant money
to the card issuer. If the promotional item is not used by a potential customer,
then the purchaser still has paid for the pre-funded transaction card. The
purchaser has spent money on each potential customer, regardless of if the
pre-funded transaction card is actually used by the customer.

                                    SUMMARY
[0005]      An embodiment provides a method of funding a financial
transaction card. In this non-limiting embodiment, the method comprises
providing a financial transaction card to a user, wherein the financial
transaction card has a face value and wherein an amount of funds pertaining
to the face value is placed in a liability account, and wherein the financial
transaction card has an actual value of zero, activating the financial
transaction card by the user, and funding a funds pool for the financial
transaction card with the funds from the liability account after the activation of
the financial transaction card, wherein only funds from the funds pool is
available for conducting a purchase.
[0006]      In another embodiment, the method may further comprise
completing a financial transaction with the financial transaction card. In
another non-limiting embodiment, the method may further comprise for
calculating a periodic fee for the financial transaction card after the providing
of the financial transaction card to the user, the period fee sum totaled in a fee
asset account. The method may further comprise deducting the fee asset
account for the financial transaction card from the funds pool to produce a
new amount in the funds pool. In another embodiment, the periodic fee is a
monthly maintenance fee.
[0007]      In another embodiment, the method may include notifying an issuer
that the financial transaction card is one of lost and stolen by the user, and
inactivating the financial transaction card that has been notified as one of lost
and stolen by the user. In yet another non-limiting embodiment, the method
further comprises ordering a replacement financial transaction card for the
financial transaction card that is one of lost and stolen, and supplying the
replacement financial transaction card to the user.
[0008]      In another embodiment, the method may be performed on a
financial transaction card has an expiration date. The method may further
comprise inactivating the financial transaction card when the expiration date is
                                          2

reached. The method may also be accomplished such that upon inactivating
the financial transaction card when the expiration date is reached, the funds of
the financial transaction card in the liability pool are transferred into an expired
liability pool. In all embodiments, the method may further be accomplished to
refund the financial transaction card with a new amount of funds in the funds
pool upon issuer authorization. The refunding of the financial transaction card
with the new amount of funds may be accomplished up to the face value of
the financial transaction card in another embodiment.
 [0009]     In another embodiment, a financial transaction card is presented.
In this embodiment the financial transaction card is configured to interface
with a computer system, wherein the card has a face value, and wherein an
amount of funds pertaining to the face value is placed in a liability account,
and wherein the financial transaction card has an actual value of zero and
whereupon activation of the financial transaction card by the user, funds from
a funds pool are provided for purchase of items. In an alternative
embodiment, the financial transaction card is configured with at least one of
an expiration date, a unique card identification number, a magnetic stripe and
a hologram. In a still further embodiment, the financial transaction has a
magnetic stripe, wherein the magnetic stripe interacts with the computer
system to identify a unique card identification number.

                             DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0021]      An embodiment provides for an enhanced prepaid financial
transaction card and to a method to provide new functionality for such
financial transaction cards. An embodiment provides for a method herein
referred to as "Fund on Activation" that allows a buyer to fund a financial
transaction card, for instance a prepaid card only after the card has been
activated by the cardholder.
[0022]      Aspects of the present invention include the realization that it is
possible to provide a transaction card and a method for funding a transaction
card that will minimize the amount of money that a purchaser commits when
purchasing the card.
                                         4

WO 2009/152163                                                      PCT/US2009/046768
 [0023]    Other aspects include a transaction card and a method to fund the
card that will provide for the security of the funds during use, while
maintaining the convenience of use of the card.
 [0024]    Aspects further include the understanding that provide a transaction
card and a method to fund the card to minimize overall production and
economic costs for the purchaser of the card.
 [0025]    For the purposes of this application, the terms "prepaid financial
transaction card," "transaction card," "gift card," "prepaid card" and "prepaid
payment card" are synonymous.
 [0026]    Conventional cards, contrary to the invention, are funded at the time
the cards are purchased from a vendor, causing the purchaser to expend
dollars on cards that may not be used or desired by customers. For
conventional cards, many companies that purchase cards only pay for a card
once the consumer shows intent to actually use the card (by activating the
card). For example, a company may order one thousand $25 gift cards that
the company sends to potential customers in a mail/advertising campaign.
Advertising that comes with the cards states that the potential customer may
activate the $25 gift card once they order a specified product or service.
[0027]     In contrast, system 9000, depicted in Figure 9, facilitate the
purchase and creation of a fund-on-activation prepaid financial transaction
card, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention. In this example, the prepaid payment card buyer 900 does
not pay the issuer 950 (the company producing the cards) $25,000 up front
($25 x 1,000 cards) but rather pays for each $25 gift card as they are
activated. Consequently, a small fraction of the potential $25,000 of card
value is incurred by the prepaid financial transaction card buyer 900. Aspects
apply to disposable gift, bulk gift, and reloadable card program types.
[0028]     The prepaid financial transaction card is sent to a consumer 910,
which communicates with issuer 950 to activate the card. The prepaid
                                         5

financial transaction card may then be used at merchant 920 in a standard
debit-gift card transaction, processed by an acquirer 930 and payment
processor 940. Acquirer 930 may be any standard commercial bank, while
payment processor 940 may be any payment network known in the art.
Examples of payment networks include: VisaTM, MasterCard TM, and
                    TM
American Express      .
[0029]      Issuer 950 may be any financial institution that issues the prepaid
financial transaction card.
 [0030]     Examples will be described in which prepaid financial transaction
cards are purchased from, activated by and/or processed by issuer 950. It is
understood by those in the art that prepaid financial transaction cards may
also be purchased from, activated by and/or processed by payment processor
940.
 [0031]     Turning to Figure 10, figure 10 depicts a payment processor or
 issuer prepaid financial transaction card server 940 or 950 configured to fulfill
orders and/or activate the pre-funded payment card, constructed and
operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For the
sake of example, we assume the device is issuer 950. Issuer prepaid financial
transaction card server 950 comprises: a processor 1100, memory 1002,
 storage medium 1200, and network interface 1300. Issuer prepaid financial
transaction card server 950 may also contain one or more of the following:
 display 1004, manual input 1006, and data input port 1008.
 [0032]     Issuer prepaid financial transaction card server 950 may run a
 multi-tasking operating system (OS) and include at least one processor or
 central processing unit (CPU) 1100. Processor 1100 may be any central
 processing unit, microprocessor, micro-controller, computational device or
 circuit known in the art.

manual input of data.
[0036]      Data input port 1008 may be any data port as is known in the art for
interfacing with a consumer 910, such as a telephone, instant messaging,
World-Wide-Web, or electronic-mail interface. In some embodiments, data
input port 1008 an external accessory using a data protocol such as RS-232,
Universal Serial Bus (USB), or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE) Standard No. 1394 ('Firewire').
[0037]      Network interface 1300 may be any data port as is known in the art
for interfacing, communicating or transferring data across a computer
network, examples of such networks include Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data Interface
(FDDI), token bus, or token ring networks. Network interface 1100 allows
issuer prepaid financial transaction card server 950 to communicate with
issuer 1500, and may allow communication with acquirer 1300.
[0038]      Computer-readable storage medium 1200 may be a conventional
read/write memory such as a magnetic disk drive, floppy disk drive, compact
disk read-only-memory (CD-ROM) drive, digital versatile disk (DVD) drive,
high definition digital versatile disk (HD-DVD) drive, magneto-optical drive,

area network (WAN), or the Internet.
[0039]     Figure 11 illustrates a more detailed issuer or payment processing
device 950 that enables the purchase and creation of a fund-on-activation
prepaid financial transaction card.
[0040]     It is well understood by those in the art, that the functional elements
of FIG. 11 may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or as software
instructions and data encoded on a computer-readable storage medium 1200.
As shown in FIG. 11, processor 1100 is functionally comprised of a financial
card ordering system 1410, a financial card activator 1450, and data
processor 1102. Processor 1100 may also include card balance reporter
1420, financial card replacement processor 1430, card expirator 1440, and
application interface 1104. Financial card ordering system 1410 may further
comprise: order intake processor 1412, registration authenticator 1414, and
card issuer-generator 1416. Financial card activator 1450 may also comprise
an activation interface 1452, and financial card funder 1454. These structures
may be implemented as hardware, firmware, or software encoded on a
computer readable medium, such as storage media 1200.
[0041]     Data processor 1102 interfaces with storage medium 1200, display
1004, manual input 1006, data input port 1008, and network interface 5400.
The data processor 1102 enables processor 1100 to locate data on, read data
from, and writes data to, these components.
[0042]     In addition, as shown in Figure 11, storage media 1200 may also
contain cardholder database 1202, liability pool database 1204, and/or fee
revenue account information 1206. Note that in some embodiments,
cardholder database 1202, liability pool database 1204, and/or fee revenue
account information 1206 may be located across a network at an alternate
computer-readable storage medium, payment processor 940, or issuer 950.

[0043]      The function of these structures may best be understood with
respect to Figures 1-8, as described below.
[0044]      Referring to Figure 1, a large prepaid financial transaction card
buyer 900 order process 10 for a financial transaction card is illustrated in an
embodiment, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of
the present invention. In the process 10, debit processing system 1400a is
contacted by prepaid financial transaction card buyer 900, block 20. The
financial card ordering system 1410 presents a large prepaid financial
transaction card buyer 900 order flow 30 to buyer 900. The intake processor
1412 receives all pertinent order information from buyer 900, block 40. At
block 50, the system does not display the "Funding Information" screen(s) (or
collect any additional funding data) because the cards are being purchased
using the Fund on Activation process. The buyer 900 then completes the
order process at block 60. The system does not perform any funding
transaction for the card order as part of the order completion process 70. The
card value for the order is recorded in a Liability Pool database 1204, block
80.
 [0045]     Purchase and order fees are reported in the Fee Revenue Account
1206 for the card program at the time of the purchase.
 [0046]     The cards are issued with a "card issued" status 90 stored in
cardholder database 1202, and the card issuer-generator 1416 records that
the each card has a pending balance (equal to the card value) and a zero
available and ledger balance. The card issuer-generator 1416 then generates
a card order, block 100. A card vendor (either issuer 950 or payment
processor 940), for example, fulfills order and delivers to purchasing prepaid
financial transaction card buyer 900, block 110. The prepaid financial
transaction card buyer 900 then distributes the prepaid cards 120. The
cardholder then activates the financial transaction card 130. If the order is a
large order, the large order may be bulk activated that would be funded as a
result of the activation. The system then activates the card, performs funding
                                         9

WO 2009/152163                                                      PCT/US2009/046768
 for the card value, reports the funding transaction, and moves the funds from
 a "Liability Pool" to a "Funds Pool" 140. The system will perform individual
 funding transactions (so that the cardholder has funds immediately), but the
 system will consolidate the Buyer funding records for each day, for example.
 Once a card is activated and funded, the prepaid system performs all
 subsequent functions for prepaid card systems 150.
 [0047]      Referring to Figure 2, a flowchart for purchase and funding of the
 gift card for corporate gift cards is provided 200, constructed and operative in
 accordance with an embodiment of the present invention... In the non-limiting
embodiment, a prepaid financial transaction card buyer 900 logs into a
financial card ordering system 1410 and completes a registration process 202
 presented by registration authenticator 1414. Registration authenticator 1414
 may query buyer 900 for a password, passkey or other authentication method
 known in the art. The prepaid financial transaction card buyer 900 initiates a
bulk gift order at block 204. The order intake processor 1412 does not display
the funding information pertaining to the financial transaction card as the
cards are being purchased through the Fund on Activation process, block
206. The issuer 950 of the financial transaction card searches for outstanding
bulk gift orders 208. The order has a funding method of "Fund on Activation",
described above, for example, and the order is marked appropriately 210.
The buyer 900 has the ability to change the payment method even though the
Bulk Gift Company did not have a selection during the order process. The
card issuer-generator 1416 does not perform any funding transaction for the
card order as part of the order completion, block 212. The card value for the
order is recorded in a Liability Pool database 1204, block 214. The cards are
issued with a "Card Issued" status and the card issuer-generator 1416 records
that each card has a pending balance (equal to the card value) and a zero
available and ledger balance in the liability pool database 1204, block 216.
The card issuer-generator 1416 then generates a card order, block 218. An
issuer 950 then fulfills the order and delivers it to the purchasing buyer 900,
block 220. Next, the prepaid financial transaction card buyer 900 distributes
                                          10

the financial transaction card at block 222. After receipt of the financial
transaction card, the cardholder/consumer 910 activates the prepaid card at
financial card activator 1450, block 224. In some embodiments, an activation
interface 1452 may be web-enabled, or have a telephone interface. If the
order is bulk activated, all cards are funded by the financial card funder 1454.
The financial card funder 1454 then activates the card, performs funding for
the card value, reports the funding transaction via a card balance reporter
1420, and moves the funds from the Liability Pool database to a "Funds Pool"
within cardholder database 1202, block 226. Once a card is activated and
funded, the debit processing system 1400 performs all subsequent functions
228 based upon transactions received.
[0048]      Figure 3 is a flowchart depicting how the debit processing system
1400 handles a card ordered using the "Fund on Activation" option,
constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention. In this embodiment, the prepaid financial transaction card has not
yet been activated when a posting item is processed for the card 300. This
scenario is defined as a negative balance scenario. A financial transaction
card, in this instance a prepaid card, is ordered, generated, and delivered to
the cardholder 910, block 302. The financial transaction card uses the Fund
on Activation process as described above. Next, the prepaid card has a card
status of "Card Issued" in cardholder database 1202, block 304. In the
embodiment provided, the card has a pending balance equal to the card value
(in this example $50), a zero available balance and a zero ledger balance. A
posting transaction (forced post) comes into and is processed by the debit
processing system 1400 for the card (in this example the transaction amount
is $20), block 306. The forced post item process is not impacted by the Fund
on Activation process. After the posted item has been processed, the
available and ledger balances are both equal to the forced post amount (a
negative balance of $20 in this example) 308. The pending balance is not
affected (it remains $50 in this case). The card is reported on negative
balance reports until the card balance is made positive 310. Once the user
authorizes activation, financial card activator 1450 activates the card 312.

The card balance is affected by the negative card balance (in this example the
card balance would be $50 - $20 = $30). The financial card funder 1454
performs funding for the full card value ($50), reports the funding transaction
(for the $50), and moves the funds ($50) from the Liability Pool database
1204 to the "Funds Pool" in the cardholder database 1202. In the
embodiment, the system will perform a "batch" funding for each order per day.
For example, if five cards were activated from an order on the same day, the
financial card funder 1454 performs one funding transaction for the value of
the five cards combined. Once a card is activated and funded, the debit
processing system 1400 performs all functions required for continued
operation 314.
[0049]       Referring to Figure 4, a flowchart depicts a scenario of how the
debit processing system 1400 treats a financial transaction card that has been
ordered and delivered to the cardholder/consumer 910 using the "Fund on
Activation" option, constructed and operative in accordance with an
embodiment of the present invention. The cardholder/consumer 910 reports
the card as lost or stolen, process 400. A financial transaction card, in this
embodiment a prepaid card, is ordered, generated, and delivered to the
cardholder 910 using the Fund on Activation process, block 402. The
financial transaction card has a card status of "Card Issued," a pending
balance equal to the card value, a zero available balance and a zero ledger
balance, block 404. The cardholder 910 calls into a card holder call center to
 report the card as lost or stolen prior to activating the card 406. In some
embodiments, a card holder call center is replaced by an automated financial
card replacement processor 1430, as is known in the art. The financial card
 replacement processor 1430 queries the cardholder record in the cardholder
database 1202 and identifies the card as a "Fund on Activation" card as a
 result of the Pending Card Balance field and a Card Status of "Card Issued",
 block 408. The financial card replacement processor 1430 validates the
cardholder 910, block 410, marks the original card as lost or stolen and issues
 a replacement card. In the embodiment, the replacement card has the same
 properties as the original card-it has a pending balance and must be
                                          12

WO 2009/152163                                                      PCT/US2009/046768
activated prior to the funding transaction occurring. The financial card
replacement processor 1430 then generates a replacement card order 412. A
card issuer-generator 1416 fulfills the order 416 and delivers to the
cardholder. The cardholder 910 receives 416 and activates the replacement
prepaid card 418. The system activates the card 420, performs funding for
the card value, reports the funding transaction, and moves the funds from the
"Liability Pool" to the "Funds Pool". Once the replacement card is activated
and funded, the system performs all functions necessary for continued
operation of the card within the available fund amount 422.
 [0050]     Referring to Figure 5, a flow chart 500 illustrating how the debit
processing system 1400 for a financial transaction card handles the
 processing and reporting of cardholder fees, such as monthly maintenance
fees, prior to the card's activation and funding, constructed and operative in
 accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In this
embodiment, a financial transaction card, in this instance a prepaid card, is
 ordered, block 502, generated, and delivered to the cardholder using the Fund
 on Activation process. In this embodiment, the financial transaction card,
 such as a prepaid card, has a card status of "card issued," block 504, a
 pending balance equal to the card value, a zero available balance and a zero
 ledger balance. The cardholder 910 does not activate the card prior to the
 assessment of cardholder fees, (such as monthly maintenance fee) 506. The
 debit processing system 1400 will perform a new "Pending Fee" transaction,
 block 508, to remove the fee from the Liability Pool database 1204, and post it
 to a new "Fee Asset Account," block 510. The fee value is removed from the
 card's pending balance (for example: if the card has a Pending Balance of
 $10 and a fee was assessed for $2, the card would then have a Pending
 Balance of $8 and the Fee Asset Account would now hold $2). The card
 balance reporter 1420 will then report the assessed fee on the "Fee Asset
 Account" report. Next, the cardholder activates the prepaid card, block 512.
 The financial card activator 1450 activates the card, block 514, performs
 funding for the full card value ($10 in the example above), reports the funding
 transaction, moves the pending balance (in this case $8) from the Liability
                                         13

WO 2009/152163                                                    PCT/US2009/046768
Pool database 1204 to a "Funds Pool" and moves any assessed fees from the
"Fee Asset Account" to the Fee Revenue Account 1206 ($2 using the above
example). Once the replacement card is activated and funded, the system
performs functions required to enable the user to conduct transactions 516.
[0051]      Referring to Figure 6, a flowchart depicting how the system handles
a card ordered using the "Fund on Activation" option, but expires prior to
activation, process 600, constructed and operative in accordance with an
embodiment of the present invention. A financial transaction card is ordered
602, generated, and delivered to the cardholder using the Fund on Activation
process. The financial transaction card, in this case a prepaid card, has a
card status of "Card Issued," block 604, a pending balance equal to the card
value, a zero available balance and a zero ledger balance. In this scenario,
the cardholder never activates the prepaid card, block 606. The card reaches
its expiration date and the card expirator 1440 changes the card's status to
"Expired," block 608. The financial transaction card system removes the card
balance from the Liability Pool database 1204 (using a new recorded
transaction that removes the balance from the Liability Pool but does not add
the funds to the Funds Pool), the pending card balance is now zero and the
transaction is reported on an "Expired Liability Pool" report, block 610. The
card expirator 1440 removes any assessed cardholder fees from the "Fee
Asset Account" but does not transfer those funds to the fee revenue account
 1206, and reports this value on the new "Expired Liability Report," block 612.
Once the card is changed to "Expired", the system performs all subsequent
actions accordingly, block 614.
 [0052]     Referring to Figure 7 a financial transaction card workflow diagram
700 is presented using a typical pre-funding model 702 or a fund on activation
model 714, constructed and operative in accordance with an embodiment of
the present invention. In the conventional prefunding model, a prepaid
financial transaction card buyer 900 purchases one hundred cards 704. The
cards have a status as "Issued". The card is funded and reported 706. A
funds pool 708 is created and monthly maintenance and/or card expiration
                                         14

WO 2009/152163                                                     PCT/US2009/046768
fees are taken out of the outstanding balance of the funds pool. A fee
revenue account 712 is also created to account for changes in revenue over
time. Under the fund on activation model 714, in a non-limiting embodiment,
a hypothetical purchase of five (5) ten dollar ($10) cards is made. The cards
at this point are provided with a "Card Issued" status 716. The cards are not
funded, but are rather funded during the Funding on Activation principle
described above 718. The cards are reported on a liability report. The cards
generated are then recorded in a liability pool 720. A card holder/consumer
910 then activates the card 722. The card is funded, after activation by the
system, and monies are provided into a funds pool, at block 708.
[0053]      Referring to Figure 8, a financial transaction card workflow diagram
dealing with cardholder fees is presented 800, constructed and operative in
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Client A 802
presents a typical prefunding model for a financial transaction card. A
hypothetical purchaser of the card purchases a one hundred ($100) card.
The card is provided with a card issued status 804. The card is immediately
funded and reported at block 806. The funds for the card(s) are placed within
a funds pool 808. Monthly maintenance fees and/or card expiration fees are
withdrawn, as necessary, at block 810. A fee revenue account is also
maintained for the transactions provided to maintain track of activities within
the prefunding model 812.
 [0054]     For client B in Figure 8, a fund on activation model 814 is
conducted. The client purchases a hypothetical ten ($10) dollar card 816.
The card is generated with a "card issued" status. The card is not funded
818, as in the typical pre-funding model, but rather is reported in a liability
pool 820. Card holder fees are assessed, in the embodiment, on a monthly
basis 824. The monthly fees can be, for example, two dollars per period. A
fee asset account is created where the fees are tracked 826. A card holder
then activates the card 828 for use. After activation by the card holder, the
system then activates the card for use up to the amount of money for the
value of the card. The amount of funding is reported minus the assessed fee
                                          15

 WO 2009/152163                                                      PCT/US2009/046768
presented at block 830. The amount of funds that are contained at block 830
are provided to a funds pool 808, as in the conventional pre-funding method.
Assessed fees are moved and reported in a fee revenue account to provide
for accurate tracking of fees 832. Such assessed fees are tracked by a fee
revenue account 812.
 [0055]      The debit processing system 1400 may also be configured to
perform a "bulk close" of cards that have been purchased, but not yet
activated, that use the Fund on Activation method. As such, a list of the bulk
cards ordered or that are linked is maintained by the system 1400. These
 cards that are linked may then be closed as desired. Cards that have been
 identified as a "Fund on Activation method" may also be replaced, in bulk, as
 necessary.
 [0056]      The debit processing system 1400 may also provide for detailed
 reports on bulk batches or individual cards. Detailed reports of liability pool
 funds for each individual card, liability pool summary reports for the entire
 pool, fee asset account reports, expired liability pool card reports, expired
 liability pool card reports (individual or batch), payment/funding transaction
 activity reports, totals for fund on activation reports, outstanding liability pool
 reports, expired card reports, and remaining balance reports may be
 generated.
  [0057]      Embodiments provide a transaction card and a method for funding
 the transaction card that will minimize the amount of money that a purchaser
  commits when purchasing the card.
  [0058]      Embodiments further provide a transaction card and a method to
  fund the card that will provide for the security of the funds during use, while
  maintaining the convenience of use of the card.
  [0059]      In the foregoing specification, the aspects have been described with
  reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that
  various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing
