   Field of the Invention
 5
   [001]   The present invention relates to a process for removing sulphur dioxide from
   the gaseous effluent of a smelter furnace and, in particular, to the thermal reduction to
   produce sulphur, a smelting process, effluent from a smelter furnace, and a smelter
   furnace.
10
   Background to the Invention
   [002]   Sulphur dioxide is a typical by-product of industrial processes such as the
   smelting of sulphide ores or burning of sulphur containing fuels. If vented to the
   atmosphere without treatment, it can cause environmental problems such as acid rain.
15 [003]   The treatment of sulphur dioxide by thermal reduction to sulphur using
   methane, or a gas containing predominantly methane, such as natural gas, is known.
   However, in practice, such thermal reduction processes suffer from either soot
   formation or the need to add steam to the reaction mixture to avoid soot formation. In
   both scenarios, particularly the second, fuel consumption is high.
20 [004]   Furthermore, known implementations of the process have relatively low
   sulphur recovery efficiency, typically up to 95% based on sulphur dioxide in the feed
   compared with sulphur produced.
   [005]   A way to ameliorate these problems has been sought.
   Summary of the Invention
25 [006]   Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention provides a process for removing
   sulphur dioxide from the gaseous effluent of a smelter furnace, typically a furnace for
   smelting a sulphide ore, typically a sulphide ore smelting furnace, preferably,
   comprising the steps of:
               a. providing gaseous effluent from a smelter;
30             b. separating the sulphur dioxide from the gaseous effluent to provide
                  both concentrated sulphur dioxide and effluent for discharge into the
                  atmosphere;

               c. mixing the concentrated sulphur dioxide with a fuel gas for reducing
                   the sulphur dioxide;
               d. heating the resulting mixture such that the concentrated sulphur
                   dioxide and fuel gas react to form a gaseous product mixture
 5                 comprising sulphur and hydrogen sulphide; and
               e. removing the majority of, preferably substantially all of, the sulphur
                   and hydrogen sulphide from the gaseous product mixture.
   [007] In a preferred embodiment, the remaining gaseous product mixture (i.e. the
10 gaseous product mixture remaining once the sulphur and hydrogen sulphide is
   removed) is incinerated before being vented into the atmosphere. Typically, the
   concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel gas are allowed sufficient time to react to form
   a gaseous product mixture comprising sulphur and hydrogen sulphide substantially
   without soot, preferably without soot. Experimental work has shown that a minimum
15 residence time is required in the furnace to avoid soot in the combustion products. In a
   preferred embodiment, the residence time of the reactants in the furnace is from about
   1 second to about 4 seconds, preferably from about 1.5 seconds to about 3 seconds.
   [008] In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of fuel gas and concentrated sulphur
20 dioxide are heated in a furnace. Preferably, the mixture of fuel gas and concentrated
   sulphur dioxide enters said furnace premixed. Preferably, the mixture of fuel gas and
   concentrated sulphur dioxide enters the furnace through a burner, or burners, which
   only discharge fuel gas and concentrated sulphur dioxide as a mixture. The inventor
   has found that by pre-mixing the fuel gas and concentrated sulphur dioxide before it is
25 heated, soot production is avoided with dry reactants or with a water content of less
   than 5%, preferably without needing to add any water vapour. Without being bound
   by theory, it is believed that if the concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel gas enter the
   furnace separately then different reaction pathways are followed, leading to the
   production of soot. The present invention avoids such soot formation and, thereby,
30 avoids fouling, for instance, of any catalyst beds used for sulphur and hydrogen
   sulphide removal.
   [009] Typically, the incinerator is heated by combustion of a fuel gas. Suitable fuel
   gases may be selected from the group consisting of methane, ethane, propane,

   hydrogen, carbon monoxide or mixtures thereof, or gases high in methane, such as
   natural gas. In a preferred embodiment, some, preferably the majority, more
   preferably at least about 65 % (lower heating value), preferably from about 65 % to
   about 90 %, of the fuel values combusted in the incinerator is provided by the
 5 remaining gaseous product mixture.
   [010]   In an embodiment, the remaining gaseous product mixture comprises sulphur
   species, typically other than sulphur and hydrogen sulphide, and is incinerated at a
   temperature sufficient to convert substantially all of the sulphur species to sulphur
10 dioxide. Typically, the incinerator operates at a temperature of from about 600 0C to
   about 1000 0C, preferably about 800 0C.
   [011]   In an embodiment the gaseous product mixture is cooled to enable the sulphur
   to be removed. Typically, the sulphur is a liquid when it is removed.
15
   [012]   In a further embodiment of the invention, the hydrogen sulphide is removed
   from the gaseous product mixture using the Claus process. The Claus process is well
   known in the art. Typically, one, two, three, or more, Claus reactors are used. The
   more Claus reactors that are used, the better the recovery of sulphur from the process.
20 Typically, the sulphur is removed in liquid form.
   [013]   Typically, the fuel gas for reducing the sulphur dioxide comprises a
   hydrocarbon fuel, preferably methane, or gases high in methane, such as natural gas,
   or hydrogen, or carbon monoxide. In other embodiments, hydrogen sulphide may be
25 used as the fuel gas.
   [014]   In a preferred embodiment, the fuel gas for reducing the sulphur dioxide and
   concentrated sulphur dioxide are heated by combusting the fuel gas with oxygen.
   Typically, the fuel gas and concentrated sulphur dioxide are heated to a temperature
30 of at least about 1000 0C, preferably at least about 1100 0C, more preferably at least
   about 1300 0C, preferably from about 1000 0C to about 1500 0C, preferably from
   about 1200 0C to about 1400 0C.
   [015]   Typically, the concentrated sulphur dioxide is produced by using an absorption
35 and regeneration process. Typical absorption and regeneration processes include, but

   WO 2013/190335                                                        PCT/GB2013/051662
                                             4
   are not limited to, carbon bed, solvent and chemical base processes, including amine
   gas treatment. Such processes and equipment for performing sulphur dioxide
   absorption and regeneration process are known in the art.
 5 [016] Typically, the gaseous effluent from a smelter contains sulphur dioxide,
   typically in the range of 3% to 30% by volume. Typically, the effluent is cleaned of
   dust and cooled before introduction to the bottom of an absorber. The absorber is
   typically column containing packing or trays in which the gas is contacted with a
   counter-current flow of solvent. The solvent removes sulphur dioxide from the gas
10 and leaves the bottom of the column as "rich" solvent containing dissolved sulphur
   dioxide. The "rich" solvent is transferred to a regenerator, or stripper, where,
   typically, heat is used to remove the sulphur dioxide from the solvent to produce a
   "lean" solvent, which is cooled and returned to the absorber. Typically the regenerator
   is a column containing packing or trays equipped with a reboiler at the bottom and
15 condenser with a reflux system at the top. "Rich" solvent is introduced at or near the
   top of the column and flows down the column counter-current to vapours from the
   reboiler to produce "lean" solvent. Vapour from the top of the column is cooled and
   some liquid condensed and used as reflux. The remaining vapour is concentrated
   sulphur dioxide which is used in the process of invention.
20
   [017] In a preferred embodiment, the effluent for discharge into the atmosphere
   comprises less than about 4 % by weight, more preferably less than 2 % by weight, of
   the sulphur dioxide present in the gaseous effluent from the smelter, preferably less
   than about 1 % by weight, preferably less than about 0.5 % by weight. Preferably,
25 only sulphur dioxide lost during the concentration step is let into the atmosphere.
   Typically, the effluent for discharge into the atmosphere is discharged into the
   atmosphere. Preferably, the concentrated sulphur dioxide comprises at least about 85
   %, preferably from about 85 % to about 96 %, by volume of sulphur dioxide.
30 [018] In a second aspect, the present invention provides a process for removing
   sulphur dioxide from the gaseous effluent of a smelter furnace, typically a sulphide
   ore smelting furnace, preferably, comprising the steps of
               a. providing the gaseous effluent from a smelter;

                                               5
               b. separating the sulphur dioxide from the gaseous effluent to provide
                   concentrated sulphur dioxide and effluent suitable for discharge into
                   the atmosphere;
               c.  mixing the concentrated sulphur dioxide with a fuel gas;
 5             d. heating the mixture such that the concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel
                   gas react to form a gaseous product mixture comprising sulphur and
                   hydrogen sulphide;
               e.  removing the majority of, preferably substantially all of, the sulphur
                   and hydrogen sulphide from the gaseous product mixture;
10 wherein the remaining gaseous product mixture is recycled into the smelter furnace.
   [019]   By recycling the remaining gaseous product mixture into the smelter furnace it
   has been found that fuel values in the remaining gaseous product mixture can be
   utilised and the overall sulphur recovery         efficiency of the process increased.
15 Typically, the concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel gas are allowed sufficient time to
   react to form a gaseous product mixture comprising sulphur and hydrogen sulphide
   substantially without soot, preferably without soot. Experimental work has shown that
   a minimum residence time is required in the furnace to avoid soot in the combustion
   products. In a preferred embodiment, the residence time of the reactants in the furnace
20 is from about 1 second to about 4 seconds, preferably from about 1.5 seconds to about
   3 seconds.
   [020]   In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of fuel gas and concentrated sulphur
   dioxide are heated in a furnace. Preferably, the mixture of fuel gas and concentrated
25 sulphur dioxide enters said furnace premixed. Preferably, the mixture of fuel gas and
   concentrated sulphur dioxide enters the furnace through a burner, or burners, which
   only discharge fuel gas and concentrated sulphur dioxide as a mixture. The inventors
   have found that by pre-mixing the fuel gas and concentrated sulphur dioxide before it
   is heated, soot production is avoided with dry reactants or with a water content of less
30 than 5%, preferably without needing to add any water vapour. Without being bound
   by theory, it is believed that if the concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel gas enter the
   furnace separately then different reaction pathways are followed, leading to the
   production of soot. The present invention avoids such soot formation and, thereby,

                                              6
   avoids fouling, for instance, of any catalyst beds used for sulphur and hydrogen
   sulphide removal.
   [021]   In an embodiment, the fuel gasses present in the remaining gaseous product
 5 mixture which is recycled into the smelter furnace contributes at least about 5 %,
   preferably at least about 10 %, more preferably from about 10 % to about 25 % of the
   lower heating value of the fuel gasses provided to the sulphur dioxide reduction
   furnace.
10 [022]   In a preferred embodiment, the process further comprises the step of
   hydrogenating the remaining gaseous product mixture before it is recycled into the
   smelter furnace.
   [023]   In a further embodiment, the process further comprises the step of quenching
15 the hydrogenated gaseous product mixture before it is recycled into the smelter
   furnace.
   [024]   Preferably, substantially all of the water from the hydrogenated gaseous
   product mixture is removed before it is recycled into the smelter furnace.
20
   [025]   In an embodiment the gaseous product mixture is cooled to enable the sulphur
   to be removed. Typically, the sulphur is liquid when it is removed.
   [026]   In a further embodiment of the invention, the hydrogen sulphide is removed
25 from the gaseous product mixture using the Claus process. The Claus process is well
   known in the art. Typically, one, two, three, or more, Claus reactors are used. The
   more Claus reactors that are used, the better the recovery of sulphur from the process.
   Typically, the sulphur is removed in liquid form.
30 [027]   Typically, the fuel gas for reducing the sulphur dioxide comprises a
   hydrocarbon fuel, preferably methane, or gases high in methane, such as natural gas,
   or hydrogen, or carbon monoxide. Preferably, the molar ratio of sulphur dioxide to the
   carbon atoms in the fuel gas is such that substantially no soot is formed. Typically, the
   molar ratio of sulphur dioxide to the carbon atoms in the fuel gas is equal to or greater
35 than 1:1. In other embodiments, hydrogen sulphide may be used as the fuel gas.

   [028]   In a preferred embodiment, the fuel gas for reducing the sulphur dioxide and
   concentrated sulphur dioxide are heated by combusting the fuel gas with oxygen
   Typically, the fuel gas and concentrated sulphur dioxide are heated to a temperature
 5 of at least about 1000 'C, preferably at least about 1100 'C, more preferably at least
   about 1300 'C, preferably from about 1200 'C to about 1400 'C, preferably from
   about 1000 'C to about 1500 'C.
   [029]   Typically, the concentrated sulphur dioxide is produced by using an absorption
10 and regeneration process. Typical absorption and regeneration processes include, but
   are not limited to, carbon bed, solvent and chemical base processes, including, but not
   limited to, amine gas treatment. As discussed above, such processes and equipment
   for performing sulphur dioxide absorption and regeneration process are known in the
   art.

   [030]   In a preferred embodiment, the effluent for discharge into the atmosphere
   comprises less than about 4 % by weight of the sulphur dioxide present in the gaseous
   effluent from the smelter, preferably less than about 1 % by weight, preferably less
   than about 0.5 % by weight. Preferably, only sulphur dioxide lost during the
20 concentration step is let into the atmosphere. Typically, the effluent for discharge into
   the atmosphere is discharged into the atmosphere. Preferably, the concentrated
   sulphur dioxide comprises at least about 85 %, preferably from about 85 % to about
   96 %, by volume of sulphur dioxide.
25 [031]   In a third aspect, the present invention provides a metal ore smelting process
   comprising the steps of smelting the metal ore and producing a gaseous effluent
   comprising sulphur dioxide, wherein sulphur dioxide present in said gaseous effluent
   is removed using the process according to any of the preceding aspects or

   [036]   In both smelter aspects, typically, the concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel
   gas are allowed sufficient time to react to form a gaseous product mixture comprising
   sulphur and hydrogen sulphide substantially without soot, preferably without soot. In
   a preferred embodiment, the residence time of the reactants in the furnace is from

   seconds.
   [037]   Advantages of the invention include that the remaining gaseous product
   mixture, and in particular the hydrogenated gaseous product mixture, can be used as
10 fuel, for example, in the upstream combustion process (e.g. the smelter), resulting in
   fuel economy and no loss of sulphur (i.e. reduced sulphur dioxide emission to
   atmosphere because the sulphur dioxide is treated in the concentration system and not
   lost from the sulphur recovery process). Typically, if the gaseous product mixture is
   incinerated, the additional     fuel requirements for the incinerator are reduced
15 significantly.

   Detailed Description of the Invention
   [040]   The present invention provides a process for removing sulphur dioxide from
   the gaseous effluent of a smelter furnace, typically a sulphide ore smelting furnace,
 5 preferably, comprising the steps of:
               a. providing the gaseous effluent from a smelter;
               b. separating the sulphur dioxide from the gaseous effluent to provide
                   concentrated sulphur dioxide and effluent suitable for discharge into
                   the atmosphere;
10             c.  mixing the concentrated sulphur dioxide with a fuel gas;
               d. heating the mixture such that the concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel
                   gas react to form a gaseous product mixture comprising sulphur and
                   hydrogen sulphide;
               e.  removing the majority of, preferably substantially all of, the sulphur
15                 and hydrogen sulphide from the gaseous product mixture;
   wherein the remaining gaseous product mixture is recycled into the smelter furnace,
   or incinerated before being vented into the atmosphere. Typically, the concentrated
   sulphur dioxide and fuel gas are allowed sufficient time to react to form a gaseous
   product mixture comprising sulphur and hydrogen sulphide substantially without soot,
20 preferably without soot. In a preferred embodiment, the residence time of the
   reactants in the furnace is from about 1 second to about 4 seconds, preferably from
   about 1.5 seconds to about 3 seconds.
25 [041]   In some embodiments, the fuel gas and concentrated sulphur dioxide are
   heated to a temperature of at least about 1000 'C, preferably at least about 1100 'C,
   more preferably at least about 1300 'C, preferably from 1000 0 C to 1700'C, more
   preferably from about 1200 'C to about 1400 'C, or from about 1100'C or about
   1200'C to about 1500'C or about 1400'C, especially a temperature of from 1200'C to
30 1350'C. In some embodiments, step d is carried out in a refractory lined furnace. In
   some embodiments a portion of the concentrated sulphur dioxide-fuel gas mixture is
   introduced into the furnace with oxygen via a burner, whilst the remaining portion of
   the mixture of concentrated sulphur dioxide and fuel gas is injected into the furnace
   downstream of the burner. In some embodiments, the higher elevated temperature is a

   WO 2013/190335                                                        PCT/GB2013/051662
                                              11
   temperature of from 1350'C to 1500'C and the lower elevated temperature is a
   temperature of from 1150'C to 1300'C.
   [042] In preferred embodiments the mixture of concentrated sulphur dioxide and
   fuel gas is at a pressure of from about 25 to 150 kPa, for example about 70 kPa, above
 5 atmospheric pressure.      The advantage of using an elevated pressure is that the
   processed gases are available for further processing or recycle to the upstream
   combustion process without the need for compression.
   [043]   In some embodiments the feed gases to the burner or furnace are not heated
   and the entire heat required for the process is provided by combustion of the of the
10 fuel gas, e.g. methane rich fuel and oxygen. In other embodiments of the process the
   feed gases are heated. This has the advantage of leading to a reduction in the amount
   of fuel and oxygen needed to heat the furnace to the needed operating temperature.
   [044]   In some embodiments the remaining gaseous product mixture (e.g. the tail gas
   from the Claus process) is incinerated and use is made of the fuel in the tail gas to
15 reduce the fuel needs of the incinerator.
   [045]    In some embodiments, the fuel rich stream from the hydrogenation / water
   removal process is used as fuel in a separate combustion process.
   [046]   Hydrogen sulphide is preferably removed using the Claus process. Sulphur is
   preferably removed by cooling the gaseous product mixture.
20 [047]    In some embodiments intimate mixing of a concentrated sulphur dioxide
   stream from the concentration unit with a methane fuel (or a methane rich fuel gas
   such as natural gas) to form a gaseous mixture wherein the molar ratio of sulphur
   dioxide to the carbon atoms in the fuel gas is equal to or greater than 1:1 is used to
   avoid soot during the combustion process.
25 [048]    In some embodiments the use of fuel (hydrocarbon gas, or hydrogen or
   carbon monoxide) blended with sulphur dioxide avoids the very high temperatures
   associated with burning fuel with oxygen and so reduces the risk of equipment or
   refractory damage.

   WO 2013/190335                                                       PCT/GB2013/051662
                                               12
   [049]   Fig. 1 shows a dilute sulphur dioxide stream (1) from a combustion process,
   such as a smelter. The dilute sulphur dioxide is processed (e.g. solvent treatment,
   carbon bed, chemical base treatment) in the concentrator unit to give a concentrated
   stream of sulphur dioxide (3) and a "cleaned" effluent suitable for discharge to
 5 atmosphere (2).
   [050]   The concentrated sulphur dioxide (typically containing up to 95% by volume
   sulphur dioxide with water vapour and trace amounts of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon
   dioxide) is mixed with a fuel gas steam rich in methane, such as natural gas, such that
10 the ratio of sulphur dioxide to carbon is 1:1 or greater based on atoms of carbon per
   molecule of sulphur dioxide. This ratio is to allow the following theoretical overall
   reaction between the methane and sulphur dioxide to occur:
                            SO2 + CH4   =  CO +H20 + H2 + (1/xSX)
15 [051]   The products of this reaction depend on the reaction temperature and will
   include hydrogen, carbonyl sulphide, carbon bisulphide, carbon monoxide, and
   carbon dioxide. Typically, there is sufficient oxygen present in the mixture to avoid
   soot formation.
20 [052]   The mixing the fuel gas with the sulphur dioxide stream is made possible by
   the use of the concentration process. Without the concentration process the sulphur
   dioxide stream can contain significant and variable amounts of oxygen, which could
   make mixing the stream with fuel gas potentially unsafe.
25 [053]   The mixed fuel and sulphur dioxide stream (6) is introduced as fuel to be burnt
   with oxygen in a burner which is attached to a refractory lined furnace, which
   provides residence time for the needed reactions. The oxygen stream (7) contains
   between about 50% and about 100% oxygen on a molar volume basis. Part of the
   mixed fuel and sulphur dioxide stream can be injected into the furnace downstream of
30 the burner (stream 5) to allow flexibility in the burner operation.
   [054]   The oxygen and methane (or other fuel gas) react to provide heat to raise the
   reaction temperature so that the thermal reaction between methane and sulphur
   dioxide can take place. Typically, the needed temperature is at least 1300'C,
35 preferably from 10000 C to 1500'C, more preferably from about 1200 'C to about
   1400 0C.

   WO 2013/190335                                                         PCT/GB2013/051662
                                               13
   [055]   The refractory lined furnace residence time for the reactants is preferable from
   about 1 second to about 4 seconds, more preferably from about 1.5 seconds to about 3
   seconds.
 5
   [056]   The overall reactions could be summarised by the simplified equations below:
                      202 + CH 4 = CO 2 + 2H 20 (heat producing reaction)
10               CH 4 + 2SO2   = CO 2 + 2H 20 + S2 (sulphur forming reaction)
        4CH 4 + 6SO 2  = 4CO 2 +4H 20 + 4H 2 S +S2 (sulphur+hydrogen sulphide forming
                                           reaction)
15 [057] For a catalytic process these equations approximately describe the
   overall reactions, but for thermal systems observations of high temperature
   furnaces processing sulphur bearing gases and computer simulations of the
   disclosed process show significant amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
   in the reaction products. These two gases can be used to advantage as they
20 can be recycled to the upstream combustion process as fuel.
   [058]   The gases from the furnace (8) pass to a heat removal system and one or more
   Claus catalyst stages which are operated in the conventional manner for such plant.
   The heat removal and Claus stages produce liquid sulphur (9). Tail gas from the Claus
25 section (10) is passed to a hydrogenation reactor where all residual sulphur species are
   converted to hydrogen sulphide by reaction with the hydrogen and carbon monoxide
   contained in the tail gas. The main reactions occurring in the hydrogenation reactor
   are:
30                                3H 2 + S02 = H2 S + 2H 20
                                       8H2 + Ss = 8H 2 S
                                    CO + H 2 0 = CO 2 + H 2 .
   [059] For the disclosed process significant amounts of hydrogen remain in
35 the process gases even after the hydrogenation reactions have taken place.

   WO 2013/190335                                                          PCT/GB2013/051662
                                              14
   [060]   The gases from the hydrogenation reactor are then cooled, typically in a direct
   contact condenser against a counter-current stream of cooled water, and most of the
   water condensed and removed (11).
 5 [061]   The remaining process gas contains fuel in the form of hydrogen, carbon
   monoxide and hydrogen sulphide (12) which is recycled to the upstream combustion
   process (a smelter in this case). The tail gas is burnt as fuel in the smelter and the
   hydrogen sulphide converted to sulphur dioxide and forms part of the smelter effluent
   stream (1), which is treated in the concentration unit.
10
   [062]   Preferably, only the sulphur dioxide from the concentration system absorber is
   lost to the atmosphere. The fraction of sulphur dioxide lost varies with the type of
   absorber and concentration of sulphur dioxide in stream (1), but overall losses of 0.5%
   of the sulphur dioxide in the feed would be typical.
15
   [063]   Fig. 2 shows the process according to the first aspect of the invention (i.e. the
   non-recycle process). The non-recycle process is similar to the recycle process except
   that the tail gases from the Claus section are incinerated and discharged to atmosphere
   and not hydrogenated and recycled.
20
   [064]   The Claus reaction tail gas (10) is fed to a thermal incinerator. The incinerator
   typically operates at 800'C with 3% free oxygen in the effluent in order to convert all
   sulphur species to sulphur dioxide before release to the atmosphere (215). The
   incinerator is heated by combustion of a fuel gas (213) with air (214).
25
   [065]   The Claus reaction effluent for the disclosed process contains significant fuel
   values and very little additional fuel is needed to achieve the correct incineration
   conditions.    This is in contrast with a catalytic process or a process using
   hydrogenation catalyst directly downstream of a thermal stage where there is little
30 fuel value in the tail gas.
   Examples
   [066]   The following examples are based on processing a typical concentrated
   sulphur dioxide stream containing approximately 95% (molar) sulphur dioxide with a
35 natural gas steam and oxygen stream containing approximately 90% (molar) oxygen.

   WO 2013/190335                                                          PCT/GB2013/051662
                                              15
   [067]   For the heating process (step d) the feeds (except oxygen) are heated to 210'C,
   typically, by some of the steam generated in cooling the thermal stage (step e).
   [068]   For the thermal processes the furnace outlet temperature calculated at
   thermodynamic equilibrium conditions is approximately 1300'C.
 5 [069]   For cases where the Claus unit tail gas is incinerated the incineration is carried
   out at typical industrial conditions (approximately 800'C with 3% free oxygen in the
   effluent).
   [070]   Recycle process.
           Reactant flows in kgmol/hour.
10         Concentrated sulphur dioxide: 1 kgmol/h
           Natural gas to process reactor  = 0.649 kgmol/h
           Oxygen    = 0.276 kgmol/h
   [071]   The process gases (principally sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, sulphur,
   carbonyl sulphide, water vapour, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and
15 nitrogen) from the furnace pass through (in this example) two Claus stages.
   [072]   Tail gases from the Claus process pass to a hydrogenation reactor and the
   effluent from the hydrogenation reactor is cooled, typically by counter-current contact
   with a stream of water in a contact condenser column.
   [073]   After the quench and water removal steps the flow of tail gas from the process
20 is calculated as:
           H2S   = 0.051 Kgmol/h
           H2  =  0.167 kgmol/h
           CO   = 0.004 kgmol/h
           Balance   = C02, N2, H20   =  0.766 kgmol/h.
25 [074]   The heating value of this gas is approximately 64.3 Mj/h, and it is recycled to
   the upstream process as fuel. This is equivalent to 0.085 kgmol/h of natural gas.
   (approximately 13% of the fuel value used in the sulphur dioxide reduction furnace)

   WO 2013/190335                                                           PCT/GB2013/051662
                                               16
   [075]   The total equivalent natural gas used for the process is then 0.549 kgmol/h.
   [076]   However, the recycle process must also handle the recycled gas and so the
   reactant volumes are to be increased by 5% to allow for the recycle flow, so the
   equivalent natural gas use is approximately (0.649-0.085) x 1.05     = 0.592 kgmol/h.
 5 [077]   The tail gas from the hydrogenation and quench system is recycled and the
   sulphur dioxide formed from the tail gasses in smelter is processed in the
   concentration unit. The sulphur dioxide losses from the sulphur recovery unit are then
   zero, so effectively the sulphur recovery efficiency of this unit is 100%.
   [078]   Non-recycle process.
10 [079]   For this process example three Claus stages are used.
   [080]   The reactant flows to the process reactor are the same as for the recycle
   process without the addition of the recycle flow. For this case the tail gas is
   incinerated and the fuel use (natural gas equivalent) for the incinerator is 0.029
   kgmol/h, (this is a low value because the fuel values in the tail gas also act as fuel for
15 the incinerator) making a total equivalent natural gas use of 0.678 kgmol/h.
   [081]   The sulphur recovery efficiency of this sulphur recovery unit is then typical of
   a three stage Claus unit, and is calculated as 97.3%.
   Comparison with Existing processes
   Thermal process with directly following hydrogenation stage
20 [082]   This process utilises the reducing gases (hydrogen and carbon monoxide)
   generated in the thermal stage to react with sulphur dioxide using a hydrogenation
   catalyst. After the hydrogenation stage the gases pass to Claus reactors (two in the
   given example) and then to an incinerator. This process allows reduced natural gas
   and oxygen to be used to achieve the reduction of sulphur dioxide, but requires more
25 fuel for the incinerator as most of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen is used in the
   process before the incinerator.
   [083]   For processing 1 kgmol/h of concentrated sulphur dioxide as above the oxygen
   and equivalent natural gas use is as follows:

   WO 2013/190335                                                         PCT/GB2013/051662
                                                17
            Natural gas to process reactor  = 0.587 kgmol/h
            Oxygen   = 0.258 kgmol/h
            Fuel for incinerator (as natural gas)  = 0.111 kgmol/h
   [084]     The recovery efficiency for the three reactor process (one hydrogenation plus
 5 two Claus) is calculated as 96.7%.
   Catalytic process
   [085]    This process is theoretical for concentrated sulphur dioxide feeds because the
   very high temperature rise would mean the catalyst may no longer work. However the
   illustration below assumes that the catalyst can react one molar volume of sulphur
10 dioxide with 0.5 molar volumes of methane (the theoretical minimum). The catalyst
   inlet temperature of 500'C (typical for process) is achieved by heating the feeds using
   a fired heater and the tail gas from the process is incinerated.
   [086]    For processing 1 kgmol/h of concentrated sulphur dioxide as above the oxygen
   and equivalent natural gas use is as follows:
15          Natural gas to process reactor   = 0.471 kgmol/h
            Oxygen   = 0 kgmol/h
            Fuel for feed heater (as natural gas)  = 0.04 kgmol/h
            Fuel for incinerator (as natural gas)  = 0.116 kgmol/h
   [087]    The recovery efficiency is calculated as approximately 97%, on the basis of an
20 "ideal" catalyst for the reaction of sulphur dioxide and natural gas.
   [088]    The following table summarises the oxygen and equivalent natural gas use for
   each process expressed as a ratio with the disclosed recycle process. The overall
   sulphur recovery efficiency sulphur dioxide concentration unit and sulphur recovery
   unit is shown based on sulphur dioxide losses of 1.0% for the sulphur dioxide
25 concentration unit.

   [089]   The disclosed recycle process has the lowest energy use of all the processes
   when fuel for the incinerator is considered. The disclosed non-recycle process has a
   slightly lower energy use than alternative thermal process. The "ideal" catalytic
 5 process has a greater fuel use than the disclosed recycle process and approximately
   8% less fuel use than the non-recycle process.
   [090]   The sulphur recovery efficiency of the recycle process is set by the
   performance of the concentration unit absorber. Typically, the sulphur dioxide capture
   efficiency of such units is above 99% and this is the same as the overall sulphur
10 recovery efficiency of the disclosed recycle process. Sulphur recovery units are well
   known in the art.
   [091]   The sulphur recovery efficiency of the disclosed non-recycle processes is
   typical for a three stage Claus unit, i.e. 97%, and the losses from the sulphur dioxide
   concentration unit are additional to this, making the overall sulphur recovery
15 efficiency approximately 96%. This is greater than the alternative thermal /
   hydrogenation process.
   [092]   The sulphur recovery efficiency of the non-recycle process can be increased,

   recovery efficiency must always be less than that set by the SO2 capture efficiency of
   the concentration unit. The catalytic process or the process using a hydrogenation
   catalyst directly after the thermal stage would require additional reducing gases if a
   conventional amine based tail gas treatment unit was to be used.
 5 [093]   The processes of the invention (both recycle and non-recycle) use process
   conditions, equipment, catalyst and techniques as used in industrial Claus units
   worldwide and many hundreds of years of accumulated operating experience exists
   for such plants. Typical operating run lengths between maintenance shutdowns for
   these plants are 3 to 4 years. The commercial application of the alternative processes
10 is far less frequent than the Claus process and when using special catalysts more
   frequent maintenance shutdowns would be expected.
   [094]   It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the foregoing is a
   description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention and that variations in
   design and construction may be made to the preferred embodiment without departing
15 from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
