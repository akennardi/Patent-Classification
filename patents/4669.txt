         METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING AND LOGGING THE
                PERFORMANCE OF A VEHICLE SUSPENSION SYSTEM
Technical Field
[0001]      The invention relates to the field of transport equipment. In particular, the
invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for the determination and logging
of the performance of a vehicle suspension system in reaction to impulsive loads.
Background of the Invention
[0002]      Vehicles commonly employ a suspension system connected between the road
wheels and the body of the vehicle, which are designed to absorb the vibrations
generated by the travel of the vehicle's wheels over uneven running surfaces.
[0003]       Methods for testing the performance of vehicle suspension systems are
generally known. Conventional shock absorbers typically have a limited operating life,
and therefore may need to be replaced when they no longer function properly. In order to
determine if a shock absorber needs to be replaced, the simplest and most widely used
conventional diagnostic testing approach typically involves a technician applying force to
the vehicle fender, or elsewhere on the vehicle body, and visually detecting the rocking
movement response of the vehicle. The resulting oscillations are often counted visually
or by an oscillation measuring device attached to the vehicle. The conventional
suspension testing approach therefore involves subjective interpretation by the technician
which may not be consistently reliable. As can be appreciated, this test also cannot
feasibly be applied to large vehicles, such as road haulage trucks or rail vehicles and the
like.
[0004]      Another test which may be applied is the European Drop Test for heavy road
vehicles, in which a set of axles is mounted on a test rig and is driven over an inclined
ramp with a sheer drop of approximately 80 mm on its facing edge. The damping ratio
and frequency of the suspension is then measured using load cells and displacement
transducers attached to the test rig.
[0005]      The results gained in either of the above testing regimes may be inaccurate
and/or inconclusive in that they do not accurately take into account the combined effect
of vehicle mass, suspension geometry and shock absorber characteristics on the
efficiency of the shock absorber in maintaining the vehicle's wheels in contact with the

                                                2
running surface while experiencing the running surface bumps which the vehicle normally
encounters.
[0006]      Also these simple tests do not take into account multiple axles coupled
together in what is commonly called a suspension group, for example, a tandem axle
group, tri axle group, quad axle group, and the like.
[0007]      Second, testing of a shock absorber isolated from its operating environment is
believed to be unsatisfactory as its dampening ability is measured against an arbitrary
standard rather than relative to the suspension system of which it is a part. Because the
suspension system as a whole affects the handling, ride, suspension performance,
stability and safety of the vehicle and its effect on the pavements and road structures on
which it operates, the practice of shock absorber testing as an isolated component can
be seen to be unsatisfactory as a method of determining in-service performance of the
suspension, or a suspension system as a whole unit in an operating environment.
[0008]      Also, as the shock absorber must be removed from the vehicle in order to test
its performance using the above described test, the vehicle must be removed from service
for the length of the tests. This results in a loss of profits for the owner operator while the
vehicle cannot be used during the period of downtime.
[0009]      Other devices currently on the market, namely those operating on the
'seismograph' principle evaluate the suspension systems as a whole, but are restricted
to recording movement of the vehicle's body without allowing the deduction of the
dampening provided by the system, (i.e. shock absorber performance).
[0010]      Any suspension testing systems that require the vehicle under test to be fitted
with measuring equipment; or to be required to be partially dismantled; or to have the
testing performed at a specially equipped facility; or for the vehicle to be removed from
its normal operating environment or the like, suffers from the disadvantage of causing a
loss of income to the vehicle operator for the duration of (at least) the testing and any
necessary travel to and from the testing facility.
[0011]      Accordingly, it is desirable to provide for an accurate test procedure for testing
the performance of vehicle suspension systems and components that overcomes the
above described shortcomings, and which preferably does so without requiring the
removal of the vehicle from service, and/or without the necessity to either temporarily or
permanently fit measuring equipment to the vehicle. In addition, it is desirable to provide

                                                3
for a test procedure for testing vehicle suspension components that does not require
subjective interpretation by a technician.
Summary of the Invention
[0012]        The present invention is directed to a method for measuring and logging the
performance of a vehicle suspension system, which may at least partially overcome the
abovementioned disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or commercial
choice.
[0013]        According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for
measuring and logging the performance of a wheeled vehicle suspension system by
measuring the dynamic performance of at least one component of said vehicle
suspension system, the method including the steps of: setting the vehicle on a pre
determined path and within a pre-determined speed range; causing the suspension of
said vehicle to be displaced by a predetermined amount by causing the wheels of the
vehicle to roll over one or more objects or features of known size on the running surface
on said path; measuring the displacement of said at least one suspension system
component relative to the sprung mass of the vehicle and/or one or more fixed objects in
response to said displacement; and/or measuring the oscillation frequency of said at least
one vehicle suspension system component in response to said displacement: and
determining the suspension damping characteristics relating to the at least one vehicle
suspension system component using the displacement and frequency measurements
obtained.
[0014]        The 'sprung mass' as recited above will be understood to mean all parts of the
vehicle that are suspended on the suspension system, such as body, tray, cab and the
like. It will be the relative movement of the at least one suspension system component to
these sprung mass components that is of interest and is required to be measured.
[0015]        Preferably, the means for measuring said displacement is an optical device,
such as a camera, mounted separately from the vehicle, and the analysis includes a
digital analysis of one or more images of said vehicle in order to compute displacement
and frequency.
[0016]        Preferably, the objects over which the vehicle drives in order to induce vibration
in the suspension are one or more ramps. These may extends above or below the level
of the surrounding running surface. They may also be of varying geometry, provided they
induce a detectable and useful displacement and vibration in the suspension.

                                                4
Furthermore, the feature over which the vehicle drives in order to induce vibration in the
suspension may be variable in form, displacement and retractable.
[0017]       More preferably, the method further includes the step of comparing the
measured performance of the vehicle suspension to a pre-determined standard.
[0018]       Advantageously, any deviation of the optical measuring system is measurable
against the fixed datum point of said fixed object in the locality of the vehicle.
[0019]       Preferably, the location of the at least one suspension system component, or
the sprung mass, is measurable against the fixed datum point of said fixed object in the
locality of the vehicle.
[0020]       Now will be described, by way of a specific, non-limiting example, a preferred
embodiment of the invention with reference to the drawings.

Detailed Description of the invention
[0025]       Within Australia, with the introduction of the Intelligent Access Project (IAP)
under the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) guidelines and with the
introduction of Performance Based Standards (PBS), haulage or freight trucks may be
required to comply with standards which relate to the performance of suspension and
suspension components, as a whole or as a group of axles.
[0026]       Under the IAP and the PBS guidelines, a vehicle suspension may be required
to meet performance standards in order to maintain the compliance of the vehicle and its

                                               5
fitness for service. This compliance testing may test one or more parameters of the
suspension which determine the "road friendliness" of the suspension. A "road friendly
suspension" may be one which functions within predetermined limits for one or more of
the parameters, and attaining or complying with "road friendliness" may provide
advantages for the owner/operator of the vehicle such as the ability to carry heavier loads
or access to roads which non-compliant vehicles may be restricted from using. As well,
the road friendly performance of the suspension/s will affect the working life of the road
itself with attendant reduction in maintenance costs and increased safety to all road users,
with the economic benefits of such savings flowing on to the general community. The
compliance of the suspension is generally tested periodically over the life of the vehicle
or of the vehicle suspension.
[0027]       The method described herein is preferably used to test the "road friendliness"
of the suspension of a vehicle and is capable of doing so whilst the vehicle is substantially
in its normal operating environment. Road friendliness is assessed by various regulatory
bodies (e.g. the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator). Compliant road friendly suspension
is a requirement to eligibility for participation in such schemes as Higher Mass Limits
(HML), Concessional Mass Limits (CML) and is therefore an important commercial
consideration for transport operators. Demonstration of compliance for road friendly
suspension is normally undertaken at the product design and verification stage, however,
demonstration of compliance following a period of use is requires the vehicle to be taken
out of routine operational service.
[0028]       In one embodiment, the invention resides in a method for measuring and
logging the performance of a vehicle suspension system including the steps of setting the
vehicle on a pre-determined path and within a pre-determined speed range and
measuring unit suspension displacement due to a running surface located feature,
wherein the displacement measuring system is external to the vehicle, and determining
one or more parameters selected from a group consisting of the damping ratio of the
suspension, the frequency of oscillation of the suspension and the instantaneous
proportional loading of the suspension at any point of the oscillation.
[0029]       In order for road friendly suspensions to be considered compliant, they are
required to have a predetermined damping ratio. The damping ratio is a dimensionless
measure describing how oscillations in a system decay after a disturbance. Many systems
exhibit oscillatory behaviour when they are disturbed from their position of static
equilibrium. Preferably, components of the suspension performance logging system
mounted external to the vehicle are used to measure, and or collect data used in

                                                6
accordance with the method of the present invention to calculate the damping ratio and
frequency of oscillation of the at least one suspension system component.
[0030]       Typical suspension displacement measuring systems include linear position
transducers, load cells, accelerometers, and impulse inducing apparatus. According to a
preferred embodiment of the invention, the optical displacement measuring device of the
present invention is capable of accurately measuring and logging the unit displacement
of at least one suspension system component while the vehicle is in routine operational
service and a data processing function then performing computations to establish the
amplitude of such displacements, rates of oscillation and suspension position.
[0031]       The optical means (e.g. digital camera) is required to be of sufficient resolution
to facilitate the detection of small, e.g. in the order of a few millimetres or less to ensure
sufficient resolution of data gathered, unit suspension displacements relative to both the
sprung mass of the vehicle and reference or datum objects in the vehicle's locality and in
the field of view of the camera.
[0032]       When a running surface feature causes the displacement of at least one unit
suspension component of a vehicle in motion, the relative position of the at least one unit
suspension component together with the sprung components of the vehicle in relation to
each other and/or a fixed datum object/s in the locality of the vehicle can be continuously
measured.
[0033]       In order that the damping ratio can be then computed, the positional difference
of the at least one unit suspension component of a vehicle in motion relative to the sprung
components of the vehicle and/or a fixed object/s in the locality of the vehicle can be
logged over a time period. The resulting decrease in amplitude of the at least one unit
suspension component over a measured time period is a measure of damping ratio per
cycle of oscillation, which is the frequency of oscillation in Hertz.
[0034]       The ability to measure the relative positional difference of the at least one unit
suspension component of a vehicle in motion relative to the sprung components of the
vehicle and/or a fixed object/s in the locality of the vehicle is facilitated by optical means.
Advantageously, the application to the vehicle of especially optically detectable feature/s,
such as reflective material may be employed to improve detection of object/s and hence
improve system capability and accuracy.
[0035]       In one embodiment of the present invention, a fixed digital camera of
sufficiently wide field of view for example, a correctly configured DITECT HAS-U2M (max

                                               7
100 fps at 2592 x 2048 resolution) is positioned adjacent a highway on which vehicles
are to be observed.
[0036]      Turning to figure 1, there is shown an embodiment of the invention. A brief
description of the numbered elements relating to the invention and a description of their
function follow.
[0037]      When a vehicle approaches the        apparatus, its proximity is sensed by 1,
approaching vehicle sensor. This is a means      by which the apparatus is initiated by way
of detecting the proximity of an approaching     vehicle. A number of sensor options exist
that are well established and understood         that may be adapted to suit functional
requirements.
[0038]      After the proximity of a vehicle is sensed, at 2, certain parameters of the
approaching vehicles' characteristics may be measured and logged, these may include
but not be limited to speed, trajectory, type, axle masses, and identification as show at 3.
[0039]      The vehicle characteristics measured at 3 may then be compared to those
stored in a vehicle parameters database, 4 and a decision made as to whether the
approaching vehicle is to be analysed further.
[0040]      If the approaching vehicle is a vehicle not selected for further analysis,
(indicated by 'No' on the flow chart) then the system returns to its initial state of readiness
to sense an approaching vehicle.
[0041]      If the approaching vehicle is a vehicle selected for further analysis, based upon
its parameters, (indicated by 'Yes' on the flow chart) then the system triggers a camera/s
16, to begin capturing and storing imagery in a Data Storage device, 13.
[0042]      Analysis of the captured imagery takes place at 6, referring to the Object
Database 12, employing any of a number of object recognition techniques, some of which
by way of example are shown at 7, in order to detect matching patterns, shapes or other
attributes that objects of interest exhibit, and track their respective positions relative to
one another, and to at least one fixed object in the field of view of the camera/s 16.
[0043]      Once the relative positions of the objects of interest are identified, their
positions relative to one another are plotted 8, leading to a numeric and/or or graphical
representation of the movement of the objects of interest, with particular regard to
amplitude and frequency over a distance travelled 9.

                                               8
[0044]      Once relative positions of the objects of interest are established 8 and 9,
computation is performed to establish the actual measured displacement of each object
of interest relative to another 10, with the focus of the computation being to subtract from
the position of one object of interest (for example a wheel rim or hub) the position of the
vehicle sprung mass (for example a truck body) so as to compute the actual displacement
at any data point of one object of interest (for example a wheel rim or hub) in relation to
another object of interest (for example a truck body) to result in a refined output that
numerically and/or graphically shows the actual measured displacement of, for example,
a wheel rim to a truck body as the vehicle travels past the camera/s 16.
[0045]      The computed values that reveal the measured distance (or displacement) of
for example, a wheel rim to a truck body as the vehicle travels past the camera/s 16, over
a suitable travelled distance of the vehicle, are then compared to a standard from the
Standard Database 11. If the values of displacement are outside of those established by
the standard, a fail will result (indicated by 'Fail' on the flow chart) and a corresponding
report generated and sent to Data Storage 13. Similarly, the values of displacement are
within of those established by the standard, a pass will result (indicated by 'Pass' on the
flow chart) and a corresponding report generated and sent to Data Storage 13.
[0046]      Communications apparatus 14 may be configured to relay information from
Data Storage 13 or other parts of the apparatus to other remote information interfaces
and for control functions to be performed from such remote interfaces.
[0047]      A vehicle proximity detector 1, which may include any of the types shown in
Figure 1, arranged to detect an approaching vehicle initiates the system and imagery of
the vehicle is collected and logged as the vehicle passes the camera. A high resolution,
high speed camera will provide greater accuracy, for example, a correctly configured
DITECT HAS-U2M (max 100 fps at 2592 x 2048 resolution) may meet system
requirements.
[0048]      The number of cameras required is dependent on the field of view of each
camera, which is in turn dependent on their distance from the subject, the distance over
which the subject is to be tracked and the specific capabilities of the particular camera. A
particular set-up of apparatus and the number of cameras required will take into account
many such factors, but ultimately a number of oscillations of an excited suspension that
provides sufficient reliability as to the amount the amplitude of oscillation diminishes over
a number of cycles (the damping ratio) will be a key determinant, as will vehicle speed
range.

                                               9
[0049]      External light sources that provide sufficient illumination, such as fluorescent
lights, may be employed to enhance the imagery obtained and ensure reliable image
capture and object tracking capability. Depending on environmental factors, a light source
that minimises shadows and illuminates well the objects of interest may be required. A
typical arrangement would be a linear array of light sources at low level along the vehicle
path, spaced to provide consistent light (illuminance uniformity) and directed toward the
side of the vehicle. Shrouding may be employed to minimise unwanted stray light and
initiation of lighting may be linked to the detection of an approaching vehicle by the
approaching vehicle sensor at 1 of Figure 1. Specific characteristics of the light source
will consider the local environment and requirements of the image capture and analysis
apparatus, and would typically consider illuminance level, illuminance uniformity, colour
temperature (CCT), colour temperature uniformity, flicker and colour rendering. The
system may rely on light outside of the visible spectrum, such as infra-red.
[0050]      The imagery is then processed as shown in Figure 1 to obtain information as
to the positional difference of the at least one unit suspension component of the vehicle
relative to the sprung components of the vehicle and/or a fixed object/s in the locality of
the vehicle in relation to time, as the vehicle passed the camera, or subsequently form
stored data.
[0051]      Turning to figure 2, there is shown a typical arrangement where a single
camera or polar array of cameras is employed. The vehicle travels on its path proximate
to the at least one stationary object in the field of view of the camera/s, in this example,
equally spaced bollards are shown. As the vehicle travels on its path, the camera/s record
imagery of the vehicle and bollards, as well as the vehicle's local environment, for
subsequent analysis. A unique reference on each bollard may be used to allow the
refining of imagery gathered so that it is duly compensated for distance from camera, and
hence displacements measured are accurate.
[0052]      Dependent on environmental conditions, camera specific requirements or
other lighting considerations, a light strobe may be employed to capture instantaneous
positioning of suspension/sprung mass/fixed object relationship, for later processing and
results analysis.
[0053]      Dependent on environmental conditions or particulate site attributes, or for the
purpose of providing the best image capture        solution, a camera/s that rotate about a
vertical axis, rather than a linear array of data  connected cameras substantially parallel
to the vehicle's path, or a cameras that            moves linearly with and substantially
synchronised to the forward movement of the        vehicle may be employed, the rotational

                                               10
speed of which will be directly proportional to the velocity of the vehicle, as measured at
point 3 in Figure 1, and which may be accurately controlled by the use of object
recognition from the image capture outputting a signal to a camera rotation actuator to
maintain the position of the tracked object with respect to the vehicle speed (thereby
maintaining a nominally matched position within the frame of the components under
scrutiny).
[0054]      Dependent on environmental conditions or particulate site attributes, or for the
purpose of providing the best image capture solution, multiple data and control linked
cameras to effectively increase the field of view by spanning a longer distance of
observation of the vehicle under scrutiny may be employed.
[0055]      Under certain circumstances, where for example the effects of side winds may
cause vehicle body roll, advantageously, the image capture and analysis apparatus may
be installed on either side of the vehicle's path to contemporaneously capture imagery for
analysis, data connected for synchronisation.
[0056]      Focus of the camera/s occurs may occur, as is common, by the use of one or
more integral sensors to determine correct focus and to detect whether the subject is
moving toward or away from the camera, including speed and acceleration data, and to
maintain focus, sometimes referred to as "continuous focus". An object proximate to the
commencement zone of the vehicle path where image capture is to take place may be
identified as a focal point for ready calibration of a camera/s, or objects parallel to the
vehicle's path for the same purpose where a linear array of cameras is to be employed.
[0057]      Turning to figure 3, there is shown a close-up perspective of a vehicle travelling
on its path past equally spaced bollards. Imagery obtained would be processed to track
the positions of the bollards, axles (by recognising and tracking a prominent, concentric
feature of each, such as a hub or rim) and a suitable prominent feature of the sprung
mass of the vehicle, proximate to the axle group of interest.
[0058]      Figure 4 shows a graphical representation of tracked objects of interest, where:
    *   the grey (Y suspension relative) plot is the displacement on the Y (vertical) axis of
        the at least one suspension component relative to the at least one fixed object
        (bollard/s),
    *   the yellow plot (Y body relative) is the displacement on the Y (vertical) axis of the
        vehicle sprung mass (for example, body) relative to the at least one fixed object
        (bollard/s),

                                                11
    *   the dark blue plot (Absolute Y suspension) is the refined (absolute) plot on the Y
        (vertical) axis of the at least one suspension component relative to the vehicle
        sprung mass (for example, body).
    *   the light blue plot (bollards) is that recorded by the camera/s and shows their
        perceived changing elevation as the bollards appear each in turn farther away from
        the camera/s. This reference is used as the datum for deduction of the position of
        the at least one suspension component minus the vehicle sprung mass (for
        example, body) at any time.
[0059]       Where pixel size presents an obstacle to resolution of the imagery captured
(as spatial issue), which could occur particularly when the subject is at a greater distance
from the cameras, or an issue where the speed of movement of the object tracked is fast
compared to the frame capture frequency of the camera, the ability to track the object
accurately is diminished. For the latter issue, increasing the frequency of capture may
alleviate the problem, for the former, other techniques exist to compensate for such
problems. In general, tracking methods can only detect movements when the object has
moved a complete pixel in the image. Subpixel techniques allow detecting movements
smaller than a single pixel:
" The simplest approach presently known to the inventors consists of detecting pixel
    groups that share a common feature or features and follow this feature structure along
    an image sequence. Calculation of the object (feature) centroid locates the object in
    the scene. As long as the common feature remains through all images in the
    sequence, the object will be detected and tracked. Sub-pixel resolution arises as a
    statistical effect since the centroid is calculated taking into account a high number of
    pixels.
*   An alternative approach consists of taking the objects that share a common feature
    and constructing an analytical model whose geometrical properties can be accurately
    calculated, for example, a circle that represents a wheel rim or hub, that when
    detected movement is half a pixel to the Left in the x axis, will cause some pixels to
    capture the object, whilst others will not. Although the structure has not moved a whole
    pixel to the Left, the geometrical bindings imposed on the target allow tracing the new
    contour and obtaining the new position.
[0060]       Other methods also exist that may lend themselves to the tracking of the
