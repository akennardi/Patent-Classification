  Statement of Related Applications
  [0001] Application No. 61/406,498 filed October 25, 2010 which is hereby incorporated
  by reference in its entirety for all purposes. This application entered the Australian National
  Phase as Australian Patent Application No. 2011323739. A divisional application was in turn
  filed as Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the entire content of which is
  incorporated herein by reference.
Field of the Invention
[0002]       The invention relates to compounds useful for inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase
("CDK").
Background
[0003]       Cancer continues to be a challenge for modem medicine. At a basic level, cancer
occurs when there is uncontrollable cell division. The uncontrollable cell division is an effect
of a break down in the natural life cycle of cells. CDK is a family of kinases involved in the
cell life cycle. Abnormally high CDK activity is one characteristic of several cancers. There
are naturally occurring CDK-inhibiting proteins and the abnormally high CDK activity
maybe due to a malfunction of the naturally occurring CDK inhibitors or due to an
overabundance of CDK. CDK inhibitors are known in the art but there remains a need for
additional CDK inhibitors.
Summary
[0004]       The invention is directed to compounds of formula I, II or III:

80 mL was added Hunig's base 3.0 mL followed by the addition of a solution of N-(tert
butoxycarbonyl)-1,2-diaminoethane 2.5 g (0.0 156 mole) in 20 mL ethanol. The contents
were stirred overnight for 20 hrs. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum. Ethyl acetate
(200 mL) and water (100 mL) was added and the layers separated. The organic layer was
dried with magnesium sulfate and then concentrated under vacuum. Column chromatography
on silica gel using hexane/ethyl acetate (0- 60%) afforded tert-butyl N-[2-[(5-bromo-2

Biological Activity
[02811      Kinase enzymatic reactions were performed in 384-well microplates using a 12
channel Caliper LabChip instrument as a detection device. The enzymatic phosphorylation
                                                 91

of a peptide results in a change in net charge, enabling electrophoretic separation of product
from substrate. As substrate and product are separated, two peaks of fluorescence are
observed. Change in the relative fluorescence intensity of the substrate and product peaks is
the parameter measured, reflecting enzyme activity. In the presence of an inhibitor, the ratio
between product and substrate is altered. The signal of the product decreases, while the
signal of the substrate increases.
[0282]      For the measurement of CDK2/cyclinE activity, enzyme (0.22 nM) was incubated
with 100 mM ATP and the phosphoacceptor substrate peptide (1 mM) for one hour. For the
measurement of CDK4/CyclinD activity, enzyme (0.85 nM) was incubated with 200 mM
ATP and the phosphoacceptor substrate peptide (1 mM) for three hours. Potential inhibitor
compounds (as HCl salts) were tested using 12-point dose response curves in single point at
the Km for ATP. The IC50 of each compound was determined using GraphPad Prism. Results
from the ICso values demonstrate 200 and 100 fold selectivity for compounds Compound I
and Compound 3 for Cdk4/CycD I over Cdk2/CycE respectively. Results are provided in

         Pharmaceutical Compositions
102841      In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition comprising compounds of the
invention is provided. In a first aspect, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or vehicles, and optionally other
therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. Such excipients are known to those of skill in
the art. The compounds of the present invention include, without limitation, basic
compounds such as free bases. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable
excipients and salts is available in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition
(Easton, Pennsylvania: Mack Publishing Company, 1990).
[02851      Depending on the intended mode of administration, the pharmaceutical
compositions may be in the form of solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage forms, such as, for
example, tablets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, suspensions, creams,
ointments, lotions or the like, preferably in unit dosage form suitable for single administration
                                                93

of a precise dosage. The compositions will include an effective amount of the selected drug
in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, in addition, may include other
pharmaceutical agents, adjuvants, diluents, buffers, etc.
[02861       The invention includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of
the present invention including isomers, racemic or non-racemic mixtures of isomers, or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof together with one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic and/or prophylactic
ingredients.
[02871       For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers include, for example,
pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin,
talc, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate and the like.
102881       For oral administration, the composition will generally take the form of a tablet,
capsule, a softgel capsule nonaqueous solution, suspension or syrup. Tablets and capsules are
preferred oral administration forms. Tablets and capsules for oral use will generally include
one or more commonly used carriers such as lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents,
such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. When liquid suspensions are used, the
active agent may be combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, flavoring,
coloring and/or sweetening agents may be added as well. Other optional components for
incorporation into an oral formulation herein include, but are not limited to, preservatives,
suspending agents, thickening agents and the like.
102891       The pharmaceutical composition or combination of the present invention can be in
unit dosage of about 1-1000 mg of active ingredient(s) for a subject of about 50-70 kg, or
about 1-500 mg or about 1-250 mg or about 1-150 mg or about 0.5-100 mg, or about 1-50 mg
of active ingredients. The therapeutically effective dosage of a compound, the pharmaceutical
composition, or the combinations thereof, is dependent on the species of the subject, the body
weight, age and individual condition, the disorder or disease or the severity thereof being
treated. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine the
effective amount of each of the active ingredients necessary to prevent, treat or inhibit the
progress of the disorder or disease.
102901       All publications and patent applications cited in this specification are herein
incorporated by reference as if each individual publication or patent application were
specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

102911       Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of
illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be readily apparent to
one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes
and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the
invention as defined in the appended claims.
