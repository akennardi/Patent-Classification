         "CONNECTION OF A-FRAME TO CARAVAN/RV CHASSIS"
Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to the construction of caravans and
recreational vehicles (RVs).
Background to the Invention
[0002] Caravans and RVs are generally constructed atop a chassis. The
chassis has two principle tasks: to support the weight of the structure, and to
provide a means by which the vehicle can be towed. It is common to form the
chassis in two parts: a supporting section which is generally rectangular in
shape and on which the body of the caravan or RV can be constructed, and
an A-frame section arranged to connect the chassis to a towing hitch.
[0003] Typically, the A-frame section is welded to a front cross-rail of the
supporting section.
Summary of the Invention
[0004] According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
chassis for a caravan/RV, the chassis including a supporting section having
at least one cross rail oriented in a transverse direction, and an A-frame
section extending forward of the supporting section, wherein the cross rail has
at least one mounting plate fixed to it, the mounting         plate extending
downwardly from the cross rail, the mounting plate being oriented at an acute
angle relative to the transverse direction, and whereby the A-frame section is
fixed to the mounting plate by removeable connection means.
[0005] Preferably, the A-frame section is bolted to the mounting plate.
[0006] The cross rail is preferably a front-most cross rail. In a preferred
embodiment, the A-frame section has a secondary connection to the
supporting section, the secondary connection being located to the rear of the
front-most cross rail.

                                        3
[0007] The mounting plate may be part of a mounting bracket having an
upper surface arranged to be generally horizontal and a vertical surface
forming the mounting plate.
[0008] It is preferred that the mounting plate is arranged to locate on an inner
side of an A-frame beam.
[0009] The acute angle is preferably in the order of 750.
Brief Description of the Drawings
[0010] It will be convenient to further describe the invention with reference to
preferred embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments are
possible, and consequently the particularity of the following discussion is not
to be understood as superseding the generality of the preceding description
of the invention. In the drawings:
[0011] Figure 1 is a plan view of a chassis in accordance with the present
invention;
[0012] Figure 2 is a side view of the chassis of Figure 1;
[0013] Figure 3 is a front view of the chassis of Figure 1;
[0014] Figure 4 is a close side view of a connection between a supporting
section and an A-frame section within the chassis of Figure 1;
[0015] Figure 5 is a close front view of the connection of Figure 4; and
[0016] Figure 6 is a side view of a secondary connection between the
supporting section and the A-frame section within the chassis of Figure 1.
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
[0017] Referring to the Figures, Figure 1 shows a chassis 10 for supporting
a caravan or RV. The chassis 10 has a generally longitudinal direction 12 and
a transverse direction 14. The chassis 10 has a generally rectangular

                                        4
supporting section 20 arranged to support a body of the caravan or RV, and
an A-frame section 30 having an apex 32 arranged to hitch to a towing vehicle.
[0018] The supporting section 20 has two primary outside supports 22
oriented in the longitudinal direction 12, and a plurality of cross-members 24
oriented in the transverse direction 14. These include a front-most cross
member 26 closest to the apex 32 of the A-frame section 30.
[0019] The A-frame section 30 has two main beams 34 extending rearwardly
of the apex 32. The main beams 34 form an angle of around 300 at the apex
32.
[0020] The main beams 34 meet the primary outside supports 22 of the
supporting section 20 at a meeting location 36 which is rearwardly spaced
relative to the front-most cross member 26. It will therefore be appreciated
that the main beams 34 'cross' the front-most cross member at a point internal
of the primary outside supports 22, and at an angle of about 750 relative to the
transverse direction 14.
[0021] The supporting section 20 is generally horizontal. As can be seen in
Figures 2 and 3, the A-frame section 30 is generally inclined from the
horizontal. At the meeting location 36 the A-frame section 30 is level with the
supporting section 20. At the front-most cross member 26, the A-frame section
30 is below the supporting section 20, with a top edge of the A-frame section
30 being about 100mm below the top edge of the supporting section 20.
[0022] The front-most cross member 26 has two mounting brackets 40 fixed
thereto by suitable means, such as welding. The mounting brackets 40 are
generally L-shaped, with an upper surface 42 and a side surface 46
perpendicular to each other. The arrangement is such that the upper surface
42 of each mounting bracket 40 is welded to a lower surface of the cross
member 26, with the side surface 46 extending downwardly from the front
most cross member 26.

                                        5
[0023] The side surface 46 is arranged to be generally vertical, and to be
angled at about 750 relative to the transverse direction 14.
[0024] The upper surface 42 is arranged to extend partially forward of the
cross member 26.
[0025] It will be appreciated that the mounting brackets 40 are arranged to
receive the main beams 34 of the A-frame 30. In use, the side surfaces 46 of
the mounting brackets 40 locate on the outside of the main beams 34, and act
as mounting plates for the connection of the A-frame 30 to the supporting
section 20.
[0026] The mounting brackets 40 include a plurality of apertures in both the
side surfaces 46 and the upper surfaces 42. In the embodiment of the
drawings, there are six apertures in each side surface 46 and two apertures
in each upper surface 42. These apertures are arranged to align with
corresponding apertures in the main beams 34. In this way, the main beams
34 can be bolted to the front-most cross member 26 by means of bolts 48.
This arrangement allows for significant advantages in both construction and
maintenance.
[0027] The main beams 34 are also arranged to bolt to the primary outside
supports 22 at the respective meeting location 36 by means of bolts 50. This
constitutes a secondary connection of the A-frame 30 to the supporting
section 20, and adds both strength and safety to the connection arrangement.
[0028] Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled
addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.
