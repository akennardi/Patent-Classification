         Provided are splices (200) comprising honeycomb cores (210, 220) and adhesive layers
(230) with tie clips (250) supporting the honeycomb cores (210, 220). Also provided are
methods (100) of forming such splices (200). Each tie clip (250) includes two legs (251, 252)
and a bridging portion (253) joining the legs (251, 252). When forming a splice (200), an
adhesive layer (230) is positioned between two honeycomb cores (210, 220). One leg (251) of
the tie clip (250) is inserted into the full cell (212) of one honeycomb core (210), while the other
leg (252) is inserted into the full cell (222) of the other honeycomb core (220). The bridging
portion (253) extends across the adhesive layer (230). While curing (150) the adhesive layer
(230), the tie clip (250) supports the honeycomb cores (210, 220) with respect to each other and
maintains their orientation. The tie clip (250) becomes a part of the splice (200). The tie clip
(250) may be buried in the honeycomb cores (210, 230) without extending above the first face of
the splice (200).

     Splices Comprising Honeycomb Cores Supported by Tie Clips and Methods of Forming
                                                  Thereof
                                              BACKGROUND
 5         Various applications, such as applications requiring large components, often involve
   splicing honeycomb cores. The resulting spliced assemblies may be referred to as splices. The
   need for splicing occurs, for example., when initial structures have a limited size. Splices may be
   used for various aircraft applications, such as interior aircraft panels, padding devices design to
   absorb impact, and other like applications.
10         Honeycomb cores may be spliced using various adhesive. For example, cells of two
   honeycomb cores may be aligned, and these structures may be pushed into contact with an
   adhesive layer disposed between the structures. When curing this adhesive layer, the gap
   between the two structures may change, for example, because of expansion of the adhesive layer.
   Supporting the two structures may be challenging especially when the adhesive layer and the
15 structures are covered by additional components, such as face sheets. For example., conventional
   solutions of using external removable supports do not allow integration of the face sheet into the
   adhesive curing process. The curing has to be performed without the face sheet. After the curing,
   these external supports are removed, and the face sheet is added and cured in a separate process.
   Another conventional approach is based on inserting a small piece of a honeycomb core across
20 the splice interface to bridge the interface. However, this approach does not work well for many
   types of honeycomb cores, such as NOMEX@ cores. When the bridging honeycomb piece is
   inserted over the two honeycomb cores, it shears the walls of these two honeycomb cores and
   may cause the overall splice to crush because of this wall cutting.
           There is a need for new types of splices comprising adhered and supported honeycomb
25 cores and new methods of forming thereof, in particular, for sandwiched honeycomb cores.
                                                SUMMARY
           Provided are splices comprising honeycomb cores and adhesive layers with tie clips
   supporting the honeycomb cores. Also provided are methods of forming such splices. Each tie
30 clip may include two legs and a bridging portion joining the legs. When forming a splice, an
   adhesive layer is positioned between two honeycomb cores. One leg of the tie clip may be
                                                      1

   inserted into the full cell of one honeycomb core, while the other leg is inserted into the full cell
   of the other honeycomb core. The bridging portion extends across the adhesive layer. While
   curing the adhesive layer, the tie clip supports the honeycomb cores with respect to each other
   and maintains their orientation. The tie clip becomes a part of the splice. The tie clip may be
 5 buried in the honeycomb cores without extending above the first face of the splice.
           In some embodiments, a method of adhering two honeycomb cores comprises applying
   an adhesive layer between a first honeycomb core and a second honeycomb core, inserting a first
   plurality of tie clips into the first honeycomb core and into the second honeycomb core, and
   curing the adhesive layer while the first plurality of tie clips is inserted into the first honeycomb
10 core and the second honeycomb core. When the adhesive layer is applied between the first
   honeycomb core and the second honeycomb core, the adhesive layer directly interfaces the first
   honeycomb core and the second honeycomb core.
           In some embodiments, inserting the first plurality of tie clips into the first honeycomb
   core and the second honeycomb core comprises bridging a full cell of the first honeycomb core
15 with a full cell of the second honeycomb core. This bridging of the full cell of the first
   honeycomb core with the full cell of the second honeycomb core may comprise inserting a first
   leg of each tie clip of the first plurality into a full cell of the first honeycomb core. The bridging
   may further comprise inserting a second leg of each tie clip of the first plurality into a full cell of
   the second honeycomb core.
20         In some embodiments, curing the adhesive layer comprises maintaining a set distance
   between the first honeycomb core and the second honeycomb core using the first plurality of tie
   clips. Curing the adhesive layer may also comprise adhering the first plurality of tie clips to the
   adhesive layer.

25 positioning a face sheet over the splice. The face sheet may interface the first honeycomb core,
   the second honeycomb core, the adhesive layer, and the first plurality of tie clips. In some
   embodiments, the method further comprises forming the face sheet and the first plurality of tie
   clips from a same material, such as a fiber reinforced material or, more specifically, a fiberglass.

   with a height of each of the first plurality of tie clips being at least 80% of a height of the first
   honeycomb core or of the second honeycomb core.
            In some embodiments, inserting the first plurality of tie clips into the splice comprises
10 aligning each tie clip in the first plurality such that an angle of each of the first plurality of tie
   clips relative to a first face of the first honeycomb core and a first face of second honeycomb
   core is substantially same. Alternatively, inserting the first plurality of tie clips into the splice
   comprises aligning each tie clip in the first plurality such that angles of tie clips of the first
   plurality of tie clips relative to the adhesive layer varies.
15          In some embodiments, the method further comprises forming the first plurality of tie clips
   having a first leg, a second leg parallel to the first leg, and a bridging portion extending between
   and connecting the first leg and the second leg.

   of tie clips and contacting a wall of a full cell of the second honeycomb core with a second leg of
   the same one of the first plurality of tie clips.
            In some embodiments, a first face of the first honeycomb core and a first face the second
25 honeycomb core are non-planar after curing the adhesive layer.
            In some embodiments, the method further comprises inserting a second plurality of tie
   clips into the splice. The bridging portions of the first plurality may be adjacent to a first face of
   the first honeycomb core. The bridging portions of the second plurality may be adjacent to a
   second face of the first honeycomb core opposite of the first face.
30          In some embodiments, at least one of the first plurality of tie clips and one of the second
   plurality of tie clips protrude into a same full cell of the first honeycomb core.

   core is a second honeycomb core.
20          In some embodiments, the splice further comprises a face sheet positioned over the splice
   such that the face sheet interfaces the first honeycomb core, the second honeycomb core, the
   adhesive layer, and the first plurality of tie clips. The face sheet is bonded to the splice by the
   adhesive layer. Top edges of the first plurality of tie clips may be at a level or below the first
   face of the first honeycomb core and the first face the second honeycomb core. In some
25 embodiments, the face sheet and the first plurality of tie clips are made from a same material,
   such as fiberglass.
            In some embodiments, a bridging portion of each of the first plurality of tie clips

                                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 5          In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a
   thorough understanding of the presented concepts. The presented concepts may be practiced
   without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations
   have not been described in detail so as to not unnecessarily obscure the described concepts.
   While some concepts will be described in conjunction with the specific embodiments, it will be
10 understood that these embodiments are not intended to be limiting.
   Introduction
            When two honeycomb cores are bonded together using an adhesive layer (e.g., adhesive
   foam), the adhesive layer may expand during its curing and push the cores apart. As a result, the
   assembly (splice) formed by bonding the two honeycomb cores with the adhesive layer needs to
15 be inspected and, in some instances, discarded. Furthermore, for visual inspection, the initial
   assembly must be cured separate from a face sheet in order to see the adhesive layer after curing.
   Otherwise, when the face sheet is cured together with the adhesive layer, the inspection has to be
   performed using complex and expensive techniques (e.g., X-Ray).
            Spliced honeycomb assemblies or simply splices described herein are formed with no or
20 minimal impact to the walls of the honeycomb cores while maintaining a set gap between spliced
   honeycomb cores. A splice includes tie clips supporting the honeycomb cores while curing the
   adhesive layers and preventing excessive expansion of the adhesive layer. Specifically, each tie
   clip includes two legs and a bridging portion extending between and joining the legs. One leg of
   this tie clip is inserted into a full cell of one honeycomb core, while the other leg is inserted into
25 a full cell of the other honeycomb core. The full cells receiving different legs of the same tie clip
   may be adjacent full cells of the two honeycomb cores. The bridging portion extends across an
   adhesive layer and, collectively with the legs, maintains orientation of the full cells with respect
   to each other. Multiple tie clips may be inserted along the adhesive layer and collectively these
   clips maintain orientation of the two honeycomb cores. While the bridging portion may come in

   that are substantially free from the adhesive. Limiting the adhesive to fewer cells of the
   honeycomb cores may be used to keep down the weight of the overall assembly.
            While curing the adhesive layer, the tie clips support the honeycomb cores with respect to
   each other and prevent their separation due to, for example, expansion of the adhesive layer.
 5 After curing, the tie clip remains in the splice and may be also bonded to the adhesive layer. In
   some embodiments, the face sheet may be adhered to the slice assembly while curing of the
   adhesive layer. This approach of using embedded tie clips allows expedited processing. For
   example, the splice may be cured together with the face sheet and the embedded tie clips under
   the face sheet. Furthermore, adding embedded tie clips eliminates the need for complex post
10 cure inspections (e.g., X-Ray) since the embedded tie clips maintain registration of the two
   honeycomb cores relative to each other.
   Examples of Splices and Methods of Forming Such Splices
            FIG. I is a process flowchart of method 100 of adhering two honeycomb cores 210 and
   220, in accordance with some embodiments. Two honeycomb cores 210 and 220 are shown in
15 FIG. 2A prior to executing method 100. Method 100 comprises operation 110, which involves
   applying adhesive layer 230 between first honeycomb core 210 and second honeycomb core 220.
   Splice 200 shown in FIG. 2B is forced during this operation. Adhesive layer 230 is not yet
   cured at this stage.
            FIG. 2A is a schematic top view of first honeycomb core 210 and second honeycomb
20 core 220 prior to operation 110, while FIG. 2B is a similar schematic top view of partially
   formed splice 200 after completing operation 110. Splice 200 comprises first honeycomb core
   210, second honeycomb core 220, and adhesive layer 230 disposed (e.g., sandwiched) between
   and interfacing first honeycomb core 210 and second honeycomb core 220. Splice does not
   include tie clips 250 at this stage.
25          First honeycomb core 210 includes full cells 212. Unlike partial cells 214, full cells 212
   have a complete periphery with all walls intact. Full cells 212 are later used for receiving tie clips
   250. First honeycomb core 210 may also include partial cells 214, which have portions of walls
   removed and incomplete peripheries. When present, partial cells 214 are not be used for
   insertion of tie clips 250. Unlike full cells 212, partial cells 214 may not be able to restrict legs
30 of tie clips 250 in directions parallel to first face 215 of first honeycomb core 210.
            In a similar manner, second honeycomb core 220 includes full cells 222, which have all
   walls intact. Full cells 222 are later used for insertion of tie clips 250. Second honeycomb core
                                                        8

   220 may also include partial cells 224, which have portions of walls removed, and which will not
   be used for insertion of tie clips 250.
            In some embodiments, first honeycomb core 210 is aligned relative to second honeycomb
   core 220 along adhesive layer 230 (the Y direction in FIG. 2B). For example, wall edges 211 of
 5 partial cells 214 may coincide with wall edges 221 of partial cells 224 as, for example, shown in
   FIG. 2B. In some embodiments, wall edges 211 of partial cells 214 may be offset relative wall
   edges 221 of partial cells 224 along adhesive layer 230.
            When partial cells 214 and partial cells 224 are present, adhesive layer 230 may partially
   penetrate in these partial cells while forming splice 200 as, for example, shown in FIG. 2B and,
10 in some embodiments, later while curing adhesive layer 230 as, for example, shown in Fig. 2C.
   This adhesive penetration feature provides a larger interface area between adhesive layer 230 and
   first honeycomb core 210 and between adhesive layer 230 and second honeycomb core 220.
   Furthermore, this feature (adhesive expanding into partial cells 214 and 224) provides space for
   adhesive layer 230 to expand into during its curing while maintaining the same spacing between
15 first honeycomb core 210 and second honeycomb core 220.
            Method 100 may involve forming first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 during operation 119.
   For example, first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 may be formed with height 264 of bridging
   portion 253 of each of first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 being less than 10% of a height 260 of
   first honeycomb core 210 or of second honeycomb core 220. In some embodiments, first
20 plurality 240 of tie clips 250 may be formed with height 262 of each of first plurality 240 of tie
   clips 250 being at least 80% of a height 260 of first honeycomb core 210 or of second
   honeycomb core 220. First plurality 240 of tie clips 250 may be formed from a pre-impregnated
   composite lamina sheet. In some embodiments, first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 are formed
   having a first leg 251, a second leg 252 parallel to first leg 251, and a bridging portion 253
25 extending between and connecting first leg 251 and second leg 252.
            Method 100 may proceed with inserting first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 into splice 200
   or, more specifically into first honeycomb core 210 and into second honeycomb core 220 during
   operation 120 (referring to FIG. 1). FIGS. 2C - 2E and FIG. 3 illustrate different views and
   examples of splice 200 after completing operation 120. Referring to FIG. 2D, each tie clip 250
30 comprises first leg 251, second leg 252, and bridging portion 253, which extends between and
   joins first leg 251 and second leg 252. For purposes of this disclosure, first leg 251 and second
   leg 252 are defined as portions of tie clip 250 that extend the entire height 262 of tie clip 250.
   Height 264 of bridging portion 253 is less than the entire height 262 of tie clip 250. Depending
                                                      Q

   on the design of tie clip 250, height 264 of bridging portion 253 may be variable as it extends
   between first leg 251 and second leg 252 (the X direction in FIG. 2D). Each of first plurality 240
   of tie clips 250 may have a U-shape. Height 262 of tie clips 250 may at least 60% of height 260
   of first honeycomb core 210 or of second honeycomb core 220 as shown in FIG. 2E or, more
 5 specifically, at least about 70% or even at least about 80% or at least about 90%.
            During operation 120, first leg 251 of tie clip 250 is inserted into full cell 212 of first
   honeycomb core 210 as shown in FIGS. 2D and 2E. Likewise, second leg 252 of tie clip 250 is
   inserted into full cell 222 of second honeycomb core 220. Bridging portion 253 extends across
   adhesive layer 230. Referring to FIG. 2F, angle 267 of each tie clips 250 relative to first face 215
10 of first honeycomb core 210 and first face 225 of second honeycomb core 220 may be
   substantially same. Specifically, this angle 267 may be about 900. Referring to FIG. 2C, angles
   269 of tie clips 250 relative to adhesive layer 230 may vary. Some clips (e.g., tie clip 250b in
   FIG. 2C) may be at an angle of about 90' relative to adhesive layer 230. However, tie clip 250a
   in FIG. 2C has a different angle. Angle 269 may depend on orientation of the two full cells
15 which receive the legs of tie clip 250a. Angle 269 may also depend on the size and shape of the
   full cells relative to the size and shape of the legs and ability of the legs to turn and move with
   the legs during insertion and later. The difference in angle 269 may be due to relative positions
   of full cells 212 and 222 along adhesive layer as well as sizes of full cells 212 and 222 and legs
   251 and 262. Furthermore, bridging portions 253 with different lengths may be used in some
20 embodiments.
            In some embodiments, first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 is made from a pre-impregnated
   composite lamina sheet, (e.g., fiber reinforced tie clips 250). Selection of materials for tie clips
   250 may depend on materials of first honeycomb core 210, second honeycomb core 220,
   adhesive layer 230, and/or face sheet 270 (if one is used). For example, the material of tie clips
25 250 may have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is within 50% or even within 25%
   of CTEs of other components around tie clips 250.
            Referring to FIG. 3, tie clips 250 may be evenly distributed along length 231 of adhesive
   layer 230. For example, spacing 268 between each pair of adjacent tie clips 250 may vary by less
   than 50% from average spacing 268 or even less than 25% or even less than 10%. Average
30 spacing 268 between each pair of adjacent tie clips 250 in first plurality 240 may be between
   about 1 inch and 5 inches or, more specifically, between about 2 inches and 4 inches. The
   spacing may be determined based on support needed for honeycomb cores 210 and 220.
   Furthermore, the spacing may be determined based on characteristics of adhesive layer 230.
                                                       10

   Additional factors include the cell height, the wall thickness of the cell, adhesive properties (e.g.,
   material, thickness, coefficient of thermal expansion), and assembly requirements. In some
   embodiments, tie clips 250 can be used to maintain registration of first honeycomb core 210 and
   second honeycomb core 220 that are non-planar (e.g., countered) either while forming (e.g.,
 5 curing) splice 200 or at later operations. One example of such non-planar splice 200 is shown in
   FIG. 4 and described below with reference to this figure.
            After tie clips 250 are inserted into splice 200, a portion of tie clips 250 may extend
   above first face 215 of first honeycomb core 210 and also above first face 225 of second
   honeycomb core 220 as, for example, shown in FIG. 2D. In this example, bridging portion 253
10 may extend over walls 213 of first honeycomb core 210 and walls 223 of second honeycomb
   core 220 and not cut into these walls 213 and 223. Furthermore, bridging portion 253 may
   extend over adhesive layer 230 rather than cutting into adhesive layer 230. This example may be
   used when extending tie clips above first faces 215 and 225 is acceptable and/or when cutting
   into these walls 213 and 223 should be avoided. Bridging portion 253 may have small height
15 264 in these examples.
            Alternatively, the top edge of tie clips 250 may be at the same level with first faces 215
   and 225 as, for example, shown in FIG. 2E. In this example, top edges 254 of tie clips 250 are at
   the level (as shown in FIG. 2E) or below first face 215 of first honeycomb core 210 and first face
   225 second honeycomb core 220. In this example, while inserting first plurality 240 of tie clips
20 250 into splice 200, bridging portion 253 may protrude into adhesive layer 230, into wall 213 of
   full cell 212 of first honeycomb core 210, and into wall 223 of full cell 222 of second
   honeycomb core 220. Height 264 (e.g., average height 264, if this height is variable) of bridging
   portion 253 of tie clips 250 may be less than 10% of height 260 of first honeycomb core 210 or
   of second honeycomb core 220 or even less than 5%. As such, distortions to walls 213 and 223
25 are minimal. This example may be used when planar first face 201 of splice 200 is needed. For
   example, first face 201 may receive face sheet 270 at a later operation. It should be noted that at
   least portions of first faces 215 and 225 adjacent to adhesive layer 230 may be coplanar.
            As such, operation 120 (inserting first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 into first honeycomb
   core 210 and second honeycomb core 220) may comprise bridging full cell 212 of first
30 honeycomb core 210 with full cell 222 of second honeycomb core 220, which is reflected as sub
   operation 122 in FIG. 1. This bridging sub-operation 122 may comprise inserting first leg 251 of
   each tie clip 250 of first plurality 240 into full cell 212 of first honeycomb core 210 (sub
                                                       11

   operation 123) and may further comprises inserting 120 second leg 252 of each tie clip 250 of
   first plurality into full cell 222 of second honeycomb core 220 (sub-operation 124).
            In some embodiments, inserting first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 during operation 120
   comprises positioning top edges 254 of first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 at a level or below a
 5 first face 215 of first honeycomb core 210 and a first face 225 second honeycomb core 220 as
   reflected by sub-operation 125 in FIG. 1. Furthermore, inserting operation 120 may comprise
   protruding bridging portion 253 of each tie clip of first plurality 240 into adhesive layer 230, into
   wall 213 of full cell 212 of first honeycomb core 210, and into wall 223 of full cell 222 of second
   honeycomb core 220 as reflected by sub-operation 126 in FIG. 1.
10          In some embodiments, inserting 120 first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 comprises aligning
   each tie clip 250 in first plurality such that an angle 267 of each of first plurality 240 of tie clips
   250 relative to a first face 215 of first honeycomb core 210 and a first face 225 of second
   honeycomb core 220 is substantially same, as reflected by sub-operation 127 in FIG. 1. Sub
   operation 127 may involve aligning each tie clip 250 in first plurality such that angles 269 of tie
15 clips 250 of first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 relative to adhesive layer 230 varies. Inserting
   operation 120 may also comprise evenly distributing tie clips 250 in first plurality 240 of tie clips
   250 along a length 231 of adhesive layer 230 as reflected by sub-operation 128 in FIG. 1.
            In some embodiments, method 100 also involves inserting second plurality 280 of tie
   clips 250 into splice 200 during optional operation 130 (referring to FIG. 1). As shown in FIG.
20 5A, second plurality 280 is inserted on side 201 of splice 200 opposite of first plurality 240. Tie
   clips 250 in first plurality 240 may be the same or different as tie clips 250 in second plurality
   280.
            Tie clips 250 of first plurality 240 and second plurality 280 may be inserted into the same
   or different full cells of honeycomb cores 210 and 220. Referring to FIG. 5B, tie clip 250a of
25 first plurality 240 and tie clip 250b of second plurality 280 protrude into same full cell 212 of
   first honeycomb core 210. The same tie clips 250a and 250b also protrude into same full cell
   222 of second honeycomb core 210. Tie clips 250a and 250b may or may not overlap in these
   cells along structures' height 260. Referring to the example illustrated in FIG. 5A where tie clips
   250a and 250b do not overlap, a combination of tie heights 262s and 262b may be less than
30 structure height 260. Alternatively, tie clips 250 of first plurality 240 may overlap with tie clips
   250 of second plurality 280 in the same cells. Specifically, a combination of tie height 262a and
   tie height 262b may be greater that structure height 260. In some embodiments, each of tie
   height 262a and tie height 262b may be greater than the half of structure height 260.
                                                       12

            Referring to FIG. 5C, in some embodiments, at least one full cell 212a of first
   honeycomb core 210 receives one tie clip 250a of first plurality 240 but no tie clips of second
   plurality 280 of tie clips. Specifically, tie clip 250a is inserted into full cell 212a and full cell
   222a. Neither one of tie clips 250b and 250d of second plurality 280 is inserted into either full
 5 cell 212a or full cell 222a. In a similar manner, tie clip 250b of second plurality 280 is inserted
   into full cell 212b and full cell 222b. Neither one of tie clips 250a, 2 50c, and 250e of first
   plurality 240 is inserted into either full cell 212b or full cell 222b. In this example, first plurality
   240 of tie clips is offset relative to second plurality 280 of tie clips along adhesive layer 230.
            In some embodiments, method 100 also involves positioning face sheet 270 over splice
10 200 during optional operation 140 (refer to FIG. 1). Operation 140 is performed prior to curing
   adhesive layer 230. As such, when adhesive layer 230 is later cured, face sheet 270 is also
   bonded to splice 200.
            An example of splice 200 with face sheet 270 positioned over it is presented in FIG. 21.
   In this example, face sheet 270 interfaces first honeycomb core 210 and second honeycomb core
15 220. Face sheet 270 may also interface with adhesive layer 230, which may at least in part
   support face sheet 270. Furthermore, face sheet 270 may also interface first plurality 240 of tie
   clips 250. Face sheet 270 is adhered to splice 200 after curing adhesive layer 230, which is
   further described below. In some embodiments, face sheet 270 and first plurality 240 of tie clips
   250 are both made from the same material. For example, face sheet 270 and first plurality 240 of
20 tie clips 250 may be both made from fiberglass. Furthermore, face sheet 270 can be also bonded
   to tie clips 250. As shown in FIG. 21, the assembly may include two face sheets 270 and 271
   with splice 200 disposed (sandwiched) in between face sheets 270 and 271.
            In some embodiments, method 100 further comprising forming face sheet 270 during
   optional operation 139. Face sheet 270 and first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 may be formed
25 from the same material, such as a fiber reinforced material or, more specifically, a fiberglass.
            Method 100 may proceed with curing (operation 150) adhesive layer 230 while first
   plurality 240 of tie clips 250 is inserted into splice 200. For example, splice 200 may be heated
   (sub-operation 152) and/or pressurized (sub-operation 154). Furthermore, splice 200 may be
   shaped (sub-operation 156). One example of shaped splice 200 is shown in FIG. 4. During this
30 collective operation 150, first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 maintains set distance 266 (shown in
   FIG. 2C) between first honeycomb core 210 and second honeycomb core 220. As such, curing
   adhesive layer 230 may comprise maintaining this set distance 266 between first honeycomb
   core 210 and second honeycomb core 220 using first plurality 240 of tie clips 250, as reflected by
                                                       13

   operation 160 in FIG. 1. Furthermore, curing adhesive layer 230 comprises adhering first
   plurality 240 of tie clips 250 to adhesive layer 230, as reflected by operation 162 in FIG. 1.
           In some embodiments, adhesive layer 230 expands during curing operation 150. This
   expansion may cause first leg 251 of tie clip 250 to come in contact with wall 213 of full cell 212
 5 as, for example, shown in FIG. 2D. Furthermore, this expansion may cause second leg 252 of
   same tie clip 250 of first plurality 240 to come in contact with wall 223 of full cell 222, which is
   also shown in FIG. 2D. After contacting walls 213 and 223, tie clip 250 will prevent further
   separation of honeycomb cores 210 and 220. Adhesive layer 230 may continue to expand
   without changing the relative position of honeycomb cores 210 and 220. For example, adhesive
10 layer 230 may be expanded into open cells of honeycomb cores 210 and 220. In other words, tie
   clips 250 hold honeycomb cores 210 and 220 together in proper relationship during adhesive
   layer 230 curing. In some embodiments, legs 251 and 252 of tie clip 250 may be equal to the
   width (in the X direction) of full cells 212 and 222 such that tie clip 250 is in contact with wall
   213 of full cell 212 and wall 223 of full cell 222 at the time of the insertion of tie clip 250. As
15 such, tie clip 250 may prevent expansion of adhesive layer 230 right from start. Furthermore, tie
   clip 250 may prevent for honeycomb cores 210 and 220 from getting closer to each other (e.g., if
   adhesive layer 230 shrinks).
            After completing curing operation 150, first plurality 240 of tie clips 250 is adhered to
   adhesive layer 230 and integrated into splice 200. In other words, first plurality 240 of tie clips
20 250 cannot be removed from splice 200. In some embodiments, splice 200 may be buried under
   other components, such as face sheet 270, which may be also bonded to splice 200 during cure
   operation 150.
           As such, curing adhesive layer 230 may comprise contacting wall 213 of full cell 212 of
   first honeycomb core 210 with first leg 251 of at least one of first plurality 240 of tie clips 250
25 and contacting wall 223 of full cell 222 of second honeycomb core 220 with second leg 252 of
   same one of first plurality 240 of tie clips 250, as reflected by optional operation 164 in FIG. 1.
           Also provided is splice 200. Slice 200 may comprise first honeycomb core 210, second
   honeycomb core 220, adhesive layer 230, and first plurality 240 of tie clips 250. Different views
   and examples of such splice 200 are presented in FIGS. 2C-21. Adhesive layer 230 is disposed
30 between and directly interfaces first honeycomb core 210 and second honeycomb core 220. First
   plurality 240 of tie clips 250 is inserted into splice 200. Specifically, each tie clip 250 of first
   plurality 240 of tie clips 250 comprises first leg 251, second leg 252, and bridging portion 253
   extending between first leg 251 and second leg 252. First leg 251 of each tie clip 250 is inserted
                                                       14

   into full cell 212 of first honeycomb core 210. Second leg 252 of each tie clip 250 is inserted
   into full cell 222 of second honeycomb core 220. Bridging portion 253 extends across adhesive
   layer 230. First plurality 240 of tie clips 250 is adhered to adhesive layer 230 and integrated into
   splice 200 after curing adhesive layer 230. Other aspects of splice 200 are presented above with
 5 reference to method 100 of forming splice 200.
           FIGS. 6A-6E are photographs of actual test splices at various fabrication stages.
   Specifically, FIG. 6A illustrates two honeycomb cores with an adhesive layer disposed between
   the structures and tie clips inserted into full cells of these structures. FIG. 6B is a close-up photo
