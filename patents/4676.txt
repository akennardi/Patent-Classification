                                    ABSTRACT
          The present invention comprises shelving posts (72) and shelving
 supports for use in adjustable shelving systems that reduce the space lost to
the posts and shelf supports. The shelving posts of the present invention do
 away with bulky RHS and SHS shaped posts with apertures formed therein and
 replaced them with planar vertical member or members (72) that are attached
to one or more fins (76) which extend perpendicularly from the planar vertical
member or members. The fins provide structural support for supporting shelves
and the goods that will be placed on them. The fins are orientated such that
they sit between adjacent shelves. Shelf supports in accordance with the
invention comprise flat planar shelf arms (70). The Shelf supports have a
vertical stop (78) which abuts a fin of the shelving post to provide additional
support to the shelves. In addition, the shelf supports also have a perpendicular
planar portion (80) which also provides additional rigidity and strength to the
shelf support.

              A SHELVING POST AND AN ADJUSTIBLE SHELVING SYSTEM
       TECHNICAL FIELD
               The invention relates to shelving posts utilised in adjustable shelving
      systems. More specifically the invention relates to improved shelving systems
  5   for displaying product in retail environments and in particular, supermarkets
      and other such stores.
      BACKGROUND ART
               Retail environments such as supermarkets employ shelving systems
      for displaying merchandise for sale. Due to the ever changing nature of
 10   products sold by stores, shelving systems employing adjustable shelving are
     the dominant and most common type of shelving systems used in this area.
     This is because a retailer may wish to reconfigure one or more sections of the
     shelves to accommodate products that would otherwise not fit in the pre
     existing shelving fit out.
15             Adjustable shelves often are supported by a single pair of shelving
     posts which differentiate them from those shelving systems that incorporate
     four posts and rectangular shelves attached to all four posts. The utilisation of
    just a single pair of posts at the rear of the shelves allow for more unimpeded
     access to the products on the shelves.
20             However the utilisation of a single pair of posts to support shelves
     brings with it a set of problems in how to support the shelves which may have
    to bear considerable amount of heavy products. For this reason, and others,
    the usual manner of constructing a shelving post is to utilise rectangular hollow
    section (RHS) or square hollow section (SHS) steel members which have
25  apertures cut into them for receiving the connecting lugs that are connected to
    the shelf to be supported by the post. Due to the structural requirement for
    supporting heavy loads, the cross section of the RHS or SHS sections are often
    considerable. This leads to a significant disadvantage which is that the width
    02/01/18

                                                   3
       and depth of the SHS or RHS steel posts reduces the available shelving space.
       In particular it often means that there is a rear section of the supported shelf
      that extends between the posts that is of a reduced width when compared with
      the width of the front section of the shelf. Due to the depth of the posts, this
  5   restricted rear area of the shelf can be significant. For retailers, who tend to line
      products up in lines extending from the front of the shelf right to the rear of the
      shelf, this means that there will be product lines at either side of the shelf that
      can hold lesser quantities of product. More often than not, retailers leave a gap
      at each side of the shelf in front of the shelving posts. Considering that rows
 10  and rows of shelves are placed side by side, the loss of valuable retail space
     along a supermarket aisle due to the posts can be considerable.
                Similarly, in some cases the shelf support arms that hook into
     conventional shelving posts are tapered such that there is little vertical extent to
     the portions of the arms that reach the front of the shelf and more often than
15   not, quite a significant vertical extent to the support arms at the rear of the shelf
    where they hook into the posts. The significant vertical extent of the support
    arms at the rear of the shelf often means that product cannot be stacked below
    the shelf support arms due to their size.
                It is an object of the present invention to produce a shelving post for
20  utilisation within a shelving system that obviates or at least lessens the losses
    of retail space around the shelving posts or below the shelf support arms.

    BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
25            There are three main aspects to the present invention. The first aspect
    is a shelving post that is adapted to be used in an adjustable shelving system.
    The second aspect is an adjustable shelving system incorporating the novel

                                                 10
      shelving post. The third aspect of the invention is a method of using the
      shelving post or adjustable shelving system.
               Fig. 1 depicts a prior art shelving system 10. The shelving system 10
      suffers from the problems set out in the background to the invention. In
  5   particular it features large posts 12 which support two horizontal supports 14
     which in turn support shelf or rack 16. Due to the width and depth of the posts
      12 the width of the rear of shelf or rack 18 is significantly narrower than the
     width of the front of the shelf or rack 20. Further as prior art shelving systems
     often incorporate shelves with support arms that themselves are quite big in
 10  their vertical dimension, it can be difficult to display products under such shelve
     support arms. So with respect to prior art system you lose space around the
     posts and under the shelve support arms. The present invention seeks to
     ameliorate these deficiencies of the prior art.
               Figures 2 to 6 depict a shelving post 22 according to a first embodiment
15   of the invention. The shelving post 22, when incorporated into a shelving
     system, obviates or significantly reduces the problems associated with prior art
    shelving systems. It does this by dispensing with RHS or SHS for the structural
    element of the helving posts. Instead the present embodiment uses flat or low
    profile members that have a planar protrusion or fin 24 that provides structural
20  support, such that the overall width and depth of post 22 are reduced
    considerably, thereby reducing the dead space associated with prior art posts
    12.
              Referring to Figs. 2 to 6 the post 22 features a low profile rear support
    comprising front facing surface 26 and lug guard 28. The front facing surface
25  has apertures 30 either side of fin 24 through which lugs 52 (from Fig 7) on the
    shelf arms are supported and maintained. Lug guards 28 are preferably utilised
    so as to prevent the shelf post from being pressed up against a wall thereby
    causing the inserted lugs from being dislodged. However, in other

                                                11
       embodiments such as the embodiment depicted in Fig. 13 the post 22 may be
      simply comprised of front facing surface 26 and fin 24 which forms a simple T
      shape. Alternatively, lug guards 28 and front facing surface 26 are replaced by
      curved and concave surface 27 in which apertures are formed as shown in Figs
  5   9 and 10. In Fig. 10 the curvature formed on the rear face of the planar portion
      is slight and the lugs 52 remain exposed. In Fig 9 the curvature is sufficient to
      create a space behind concave surface 27 in which the lugs would be protected
      from being dislodged if pushed against a wall.
                In addition to the vertical members, the post 22 also has horizontal leg
 10   portion 32 which is in turn comprised of a leg fin 34 mounted upon a planar leg
     base 36. The fin 24 and leg fin 34 abut each other to provide further structural
     support.
               Turning to Figs. 7 and 8, they depict the second aspect of the
     invention, a shelving system 40, which incorporates post 22 of Figs. 2 to 6. The
15   system 40 is depicted with only one post 22 in Fig 7 for simplicity however
    when assembled, as depicted in Fig. 8, two posts 22 are utilised in the
     provision of adjustable shelving. The components of shelving system 40
     include bracing members 42 which are made from roll formed steel in a U
    shape with an open bottom and a planar top surface 44. The bracing members
20  42 further feature downwardly projecting tabs 46 which are adapted to extend
    over and be secured on leg fin 34. When bracing members are fitted over the
    leg fins 34 of two posts the top surfaces 44 create a flat surface for the support
    of a shelving surface 48 which can be fixed to the bracing members 42 in any
    number of conventional ways including screwing or gluing to form a bottom
25  shelf.
              There is also depicted in Figs. 7 and 8 a shelf 50 that has a number of
    lugs 52 for insertion and retention within apertures 30. The lugs 52 are located
    on support arms 54 which are kept spaced apart by a plurality of shelf supports

                                                 12
       56 in a similar fashion to the bracing members 42 of the bottom shelf. The shelf
       50 also has a front fascia 58 that extends vertically beyond the support arms 54
       such that when shelf surface 48 is overlaid, the top of the fascia 58 and shelf
      surface 48 form a level surface. Front fascia 58 can also be used as a ticket or
  5   signage holder.
                It should be noted that persons skilled in the art would appreciate that
      the shelving system 40 can incorporate many different types of shelving
      including angled shelving where product slides or rolls (including those shelves
      that have small rollers) to the front of the shelf. The invention also incorporates
 10   shelves that are provided in modular form where separate arm brackets are
      used to support separate shelves (that is not integrally formed as in the case of
     shelf 50). Further the surface of the shelves may not be planar and may in fact
     be formed from wire or steel mesh or other materials or are otherwise adapted
     to have dividers and/or other retailing aids inserted or attached onto them.
15             Referring to Fig. 8 there is also depicted back panels 60 which also
     feature lugs 52 at their vertical edges. The back panels are inserted between
     two posts 22 when a retailer does not wish for the customer to see beyond the
     rear of the shelves in the shelving system 40. The back panels 60 also provide
     some structural integrity to the assembled shelving system as they brace the
20   posts 22. When not utilised, they are often replaced by structural bracing
     members (not shown).
               Shelving system 40 is designed such that a plurality of posts 22 can be
     utilised side by side creating extended shelf surfaces. By utilising posts 22 in
    the shelving system 40 it is now possible to have a shelf surface 48 which is
25  the same width at the rear of the shelf as it is at the front of the shelf,
    eliminating dead space on the shelf. No unsightly indents are required to be
    formed into the shelf surface 48 in shelving system 40 as shown in Fig. 8 and

                                                 13
      wherein shelf surface 48 is maximised as compared to prior art shelving
      systems.
                Reference is now made to Figs. 11 to 13 in which cross sections of
      second through fifth embodiments of posts 22 are depicted. The embodiments
  5   differ with regard to the length and width of fin 24. The depicted embodiments
      are not exhaustive of the embodiments of the invention that fall within the
      scope of the invention and are provided for illustrative purposes only. In terms
      of ratios of fin length to fin width the depicted figures show a ratio of between
      8:1 for Fig 11 and 15:1 for Fig 12. In terms of absolute widths and lengths, the
 10   invention encompasses fins of the following dimensions: 4mm x 60mm, 6mm x
     60mm, 6mm x 80mm, 6mm x 100mm, 8mm x 80mm, 8mm x 100mm, 8mm x
      120mm. The longer the fin 24, the greater weight can be accommodated on the
     supported shelves. In terms of the weight that can be supported by shelf 50 as
     depicted in Fig. 8 a minimum of 300KG can be supported using an 8mm x
15   80mm sized fin 24.
               Turning to Figs. 14 to Fig. 21 the shelving post and system depicted in
    the figures is a double sided version of the shelving posts and system depicted
     in Figs. 1 to 13. A double sided embodiment allows for further space saving by
    only having the one central post support shelves on either side of the post. A
20  depiction of the assembled system 41 is shown in Fig. 28. Figs 22 to 27 also
    represent an alternative double sided embodiment. In this latter embodiment
    the post comprises a star shaped post without any rectangular or hollow
    section that may take up valuable product display space.
              Figs 29 to 31 depict an eleventh embodiment of a shelving post, the
25  third embodiment that is also double sided. The shelving post is H shaped as
    depicted in the cross section shown in Fig. 31 and those in Fig 32 and 33 which
    shows multiple variations of the post of Fig. 31.

                                                14
              The post of Fig 29 is shown in figures 34 to 38 together with second
     embodiment of the shelving support (arm). In Figs 34 and 35 shelving support
     70 is connected to shelving post 72 via lugs 74 which are inserted into
     apertures 73 of the shelving post 72. To provide additional support and stability
  5  a stop 78 is provided on the support 70 such that when supported in the post
     72 by the lugs 74 the stop 78 sits flush with and is supported by post fin 76 (as
     shown in Fig 34 and 35). In addition to the stop 78 providing additional support,
     a return 80 is provided on the top surface of support 70 so as to provide
     additional resilience against bending when forces are applied to the top surface
10  of 70. The additional support provided by the stop 78 and return 80 allows the
    support 70 to adopt a very low vertical profile, thereby freeing up space that
    would otherwise be unavailable under the support in a conventional shelving
    system. The same arrangement is observed for the support and post depicted
    in Figs. 39 to 43 except that the support 70 does not have a return 80. This
15  reduces the load that can be carried comparatively to the support depicted in
    Figs 34 to 38 however it is still sufficient to provide the support required to
    lower the vertical profile of support 70 thereby providing additional room for
    product to be displayed under the support 70.
    INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
20           The present invention has industrial applicability in the field of retail
    display shelving for use in displaying and retailing goods including heavy
    goods.
