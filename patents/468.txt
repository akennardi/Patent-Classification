                DIOXOLANE ANALOGUES OF URIDINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER
   This is a divisional of Australian patent application No. 2015308988, the entire contents of
   which are incorporated herein by reference.

   Technical Field
   The present invention relates to phosphorus prodrugs of troxacitabine and derivatives
   thereof which are useful in the treatment of cancers, in particular live cancer such as
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and secondary liver cancers. The invention further
10 relates to compositions and combinations comprising these compounds, and methods for
   their use in the treatment of cancers, particularly liver cancer such as HCC.
   Background to the Invention
   Primary liver cancer is the sixth most frequent cancer globally and the second leading
15 cause of cancer death. The most frequent liver cancer, accounting for approximately 85%
   of all primary malignant liver cancers and has a rising incidence, is hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC), which is formed by hepatocytes that become malignant. Another type
   of cancer formed by hepatocytes is hepatoblastoma, a rare malignant tumour that
   primarily develops in children, and accounts for approximately 1% of all cancers in
20 children and 79% of all primary liver cancers under the age of 15. Secondary liver cancer,
   or metastasis in the liver, is a cancer that starts somewhere else in the body and then
   spreads to the liver. Examples of secondary liver caner includes many common types of
   cancer, such as colon, rectum, lung, and breast cancer. Liver cancer can also form from
   other structures within the liver such as the bile duct, blood vessels and immune cells.
25 Cancer of the bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma and cholangiocellular cystadenocarcinoma)
   account for approximately 6% of primary liver cancers.
                                                                 1

   While surgical resection and liver transplantation are potentially curative therapies for
   early stage HCC, more than 20% of the patients will eventually relapse or encounter
   further problems, and the majority of HCC diagnosis take place at a stage that is too
   advanced for these treatments. Regional therapies, such as radiofrequency ablation are
 5 associated with response rates above 60%, but they are only suitable for a certain
   proportion of patients and are not always curative. Chemotherapy used so far has been
   minimally effective in HCC and to date response rates have not exceeded 25%. At
   present, sorafenib is the only effective drug on the market for the treatment of advanced
   or unresectable HCC, therefore, there is a great need for further treatments of HCC to
10 reduce relapse rates and increase overall survival rates.
   Many nucleoside analogues have been found to possess anticancer activity and they
   constitute a major class of chemotherapeutic agents that are widely used for the treatment
   of patients with cancer. This group of agents, known as antimetabolites, includes a
15 variety of pyrimidine and purine nucleoside derivatives with cytotoxic activity.
                                                                  1A

       WO 2016/030335                                                           PCT/EP2015/069370
   Cellular nucleotide kinases phosphorylate nucleosides to their corresponding 5'
   monophosphates which are further converted into their diphosphate and subsequently to the
   pharmacologically active triphosphate. It is known that some nucleosides are weakly active
   because they cannot be efficiently phosphorylated by kinases or are not substrates for kinases
 5 at all. In the phosphorylation sequence, the first phosphorylation of nucleoside analogues is rate
   limiting whereas the second and third phosphorylations are less sensitive to modifications to the
   nucleoside. Nucleoside monophosphates (nucleotides) per se are generally unstable in blood
   and show poor membrane permeation and hence are not suitable for use as drugs. Due to the
   high instability and poor cellular permeation of triphosphate of nucleosides and nucleoside
 0 analogues they cannot either be considered as possible drug candidates.
   Troxacitabine, (beta-L-dioxolane cytidine) is a cytotoxic deoxycytidine analogue with an
   unnatural L-configuration which has demonstrated broad activity against both solid and
   hematopoietic malignancies in vitro and in vivo. Particularly, impressive activity has been
 5 observed against human cancer cell lines and xenografts of hepatocellular, prostate, and renal
   origin (Cancer Res., 55, 3008-3011, 1995). Troxacitabine has shown to give rise to a mutation
   of the kinase deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) which is normally responsible for the first
   phosphorylation step of the nucleoside, leading to no or very low levels of troxacitabine
   monophosphate, thereby leading to resistance.
 0
   Troxacitabine entered phase Ill clinical trials in 2008 in the acute myologenous leukemia
   indication, but did not proceed to registration. Discontinued phase || trials with troxacitabine
   include breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, NSCLC, renal, prostate
   and ovarian tumours. Troxacitabine was generally administered as an intravenous infusion,
L5 thereby exposing many tissues to the drug, irrespective of the site of the cancer.
   It has been shown that troxacitabine, despite its hydrophilic character, is transported into cells
   by passive diffusion, but is only very slowly accumulated in cancer cells in comparison with
   other, carrier transported nucleosides.
30
   In W02008/030373 derivatives of troxacitabine carrying a prodrug group on the cytosine base
   moiety are disclosed and the relationship between the lipophilicity of the prodrugs and their
   antitumor activity is evaluated. The patent states that base modification is desirable to avoid
   esterase difficulties with 5'-OH modification.
35
   Phosphoramidate prodrugs at the 5' hydroxyl function of D-nucleosides have been successfully
   employed in antiviral drugs, such as sofosbuvir used in the treatment of HCV infection.
                                                      2

       WO 2016/030335                                                        PCT/EP2015/069370
   Unmasking of the sofosbuvir prodrug to reveal the monophosphate intracellularly is a complex,
   multistep process involving several hydrolase enzymes in a particular sequence.
   The use of phosphoramidate prodrugs on cancer nucleosides has been less successful.
 5 Nucana is developing Acelerin (Nuc-1031), a phosphoramidate prodrug of the D-nucleoside
   gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic cancer (for structure: see page 71 of
   W02005012327). However, even though the phosphoramidate would be thought to enhance
   lipophilicity and cell permeability of the compound, the Acelarin prodrug must still be
   administered as an IV infusion, thus exposing many healthy tissues to the cytotoxic metabolite.
 0
   There is even less experience with monophosphate prodrugs of L-nucleosides such as
   troxacitabine. W02008048128 discloses a small number of troxacitabine monosphosphate
   prodrugs including the compound at Example 14:
                                       H2N       N-  -O      O N   NH2
                                                   H
                                               - HOH    .. O0
 5 No cancer or other biological activity is disclosed for any of the compounds, either in the
   W02008048128 specification or elsewhere in the academic literature. There are no reports of
   such a prodrug entering clinical trials. However, the inventors of W02008048128 have
   published broadly similar prodrugs on the D-nucleoside gemcitabine (Baraniak et al Biorg Med
   Chem 2014 2133-2040) where the prodrug approach appears to work in certain tissues, and the
 0 D-nucleoside azidothymidine (Kulic et al Antivir Chem Chemother 2011 21(3) 143-150) where
   the prodrugs were 2-20 times less potent than the corresponding parent nucleoside. Kulic
   speculates that the azidothymidine prodrugs tended to be first dephosphorylated to the
   nucleoside and only then phosphorylated to the active triphosphate species. In that the prodrug
   approach works on gemcitabine (which resembles RNA by virtue of its substituted 2' function),
25 and does not work on azidothymidine (which is 2'-deoxy thereby resembling DNA), it is
   hypothesised that the W02008048128 prodrugs of troxacitabine (which is a DNA analog, albeit
   L-DNA), are likely to be inactive, like the azidothymidine prodrugs.
   Balzarini et al Biochem Biophys Res Comm 225, 363-369 (1996) describe the HIV and HBV
30 activity of CF 1109, a phosphoramidate prodrug of the L-nucleoside lamivudine/3TC, having the
   structure:

                                                                   NH 2

   Balzarini states that this phosphoramidate prodrug was ~250 fold less active against HIV than
   its parent nucleoside 3TC, but that the prodrug as "virtually equally effective against HBV in Hep
   G2.2.15 cells". In other words, addition of this large, phosphoramidate methyl ester prodrug,
 5 group did not improve antiviral potency in a liver cell line. Balzarini did not assay whether the
   prodrug was being metabolized to 3TC prior to being phosphorylated to the active triphosphate.
   The present invention provides phosphorus prodrugs of troxacitabine, particularly liver targeted
   prodrugs such as phosphoramidates, which are suitable for oral administration. These prodrugs
 0 have the advantage of improved cell permeability due to increased lipophilicity compared to
   troxacitabine per se, and to more efficient form the active triphosphate due to bypassing the rate
   limiting first phosphorylation step. Further, the compounds of the invention are primarily
   metabolised to the active triphosphate in the liver thereby providing a high concentration of
   active compound in the target organ and at the same time keeping side effects due to toxicity in
 5 other organs to a minimum.

   In order to avoid undesired side effects, particularly toxicity in other organs, delivery of the drug
   to the site of the tumour while reducing exposure to normal tissue is crucial. The compounds of
   the invention are stable in gastric fluid but readily metabolized by liver enzymes, they may
   therefore be absorbed in the stomach and transported as a masked cytotoxic agent to the liver
 0 where absorption, metabolism and formation of the active cytotoxic triphosphate occurs.
   Accordingly, the invention provides compounds which are absorbed and processed primarily in
   the liver, thus minimizing exposure to other organs in the body and toxic side effects.
   Without wishing to be bound by theory, the anti-oncogenic activity of the compounds of the
 5 invention may be exerted directly against cellular processes of the rapidly acting tumourogenic
   cells of the cancer, but may additionally or alternatively exert their effects through modulation of
   the tumour's microenvironment , such as inhibition of angiogenesis, thereby starving the tumour
   of nourishment leading to inhibition of tumour growth.
 o The compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of secondary liver
   cancers, metastasis in the liver, i.e. cancer that originate from organs elsewhere in the body,
   such as the colon, lung or breast and migrates to the liver.
   The present invention also relates to a method of treating warm-blooded animals, in particular
 5 humans, having cancer, especially liver cancer such as HCC, said method comprises the
   administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula (1)or any subgroup thereof.

 5 compound of Formula (1)may nevertheless be of value when intended for use in combination
   with other agents or in multiple doses.
   In this context a therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to produce an intended
   result. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on individual requirements in
30 each particular case. Features that influence the dose are e.g. the severity of the disease to be
   treated, age, weight, general health condition etc. of the subject to be treated. With respect to
   an anti-cancer effect, that effect may be inhibition of further tumour growth, reduction of the
   likelihood or elimination of metastasis or producing cell death in the tumour, resulting in a
   shrinkage of the tumour or preventing the regrowth of a tumour after the patient's tumour is in
35 remission.

   Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for manufacturing a compound of Formula (1), to
   novel intermediates for use in the manufacture of compounds of Formula (1)and to the

 5 Whenever the term 'compounds of Formula (I)', 'the compounds of the invention", "the
   compounds of the present invention" or similar terms is used in the foregoing and hereinafter, it
   is meant to include the compounds of Formula (1) and any subgroup of compounds of Formula
   (1), including all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable
   salts, solvates, quaternary amines and metal complexes.

   The compounds of the present invention may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms
   for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions
   usually employed for oral administration of drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions
   of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form
 5 or solvate, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of
   preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in
   unitary dosage form suitable for oral administration. For example, in preparing the compositions
   in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for
 0 example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as
   suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars,
   kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills,
   capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent
   the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are
 5 obviously employed. Also included are solid form preparations intended to be converted, shortly
   before use, to liquid form preparations.
   It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in
   unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used
30 herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a
   predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect
   in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are
   tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers and the like,
   and segregated multiples thereof.

   In general it is contemplated that an an-cancer effective daily amount would be from about 0.01
   to about 700 mg/kg, or about 0.5 to about 400 mg/kg, or about 1 to about 250 mg/kg, or about 2

   to about 200 mg/kg, or about 10 to about 150 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to
   administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals
   throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example,
   containing about 1 to about 5000 mg, or about 50 to about 3000 mg, or about 100 to about 1000
 5 mg, or about 200 to about 600 mg, or about 100 to about 400 mg of active ingredient per unit
   dosage form.
   The compounds of the present invention may exhibit an anticancer effect alone and/or enhance
   the ability of another anti-cancer agent to exhibit an anticancer effect.

   The compounds of the invention are represented as a defined stereoisomer. The absolute
   configuration of such compounds can be determined using art-known methods such as, for
   example, X-ray diffraction or NMR and/or implication from start materials of known
   stereochemistry. Pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention will preferably
 5 comprise substantially stereoisomerically pure preparations of the indicated stereoisomer.
   Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are
   defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same
   basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term
 0 "stereoisomerically pure" concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess
   of at least 80% (i.e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible
   isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the
   other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90%
   up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and
 5 most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms
   "enantiomerically pure" and "diastereomerically pure" should be understood in a similar way, but
   then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, and the diastereomeric excess, respectively, of
   the mixture in question.
30 Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be
   obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be
   separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with
   optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid,
   ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphorsulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by
35 chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically
   isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric
   forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically.

   Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound is synthesized by stereospecific
   methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure
   starting materials.
 5 The diastereomeric racemates of the compounds of the invention can be obtained separately by
   conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be
   employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column
   chromatography.
 0 When a phosphorus atom is present in a compound of the invention, the phosphorus atom may
   represent a chiral centre. The chirality at this centre is designated "R" or "S" according to the
   Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. When the chirality is not indicated, it is contemplated that
   both the R- and S-isomers are meant to be included, as well as a mixture of both, i.e. a
   diastereomeric mixture.
 5
   In preferred embodiments of the invention, the stereoisomers having the S-configuration at the
   phosphorus atom are included. These stereoisomers are designated Sp.
   In other embodiments of the invention, the stereoisomers having the R-configuration at the
 0 phosphorus atom are included. These stereoisomers are designated Rp.
   In other embodiments of the invention, diastereomeric mixtures are included, i.e. mixtures of
   compounds having the R- or S- configuration at the phosphorus atom.
 5 The present invention also includes isotope-labelled compounds of Formula (1),wherein one or
   more of the atoms is replaced by an isotope of that atom, i.e. an atom having the same atomic
   number as, but an atomic mass different from, the one(s) typically found in nature. Examples of
   isotopes that may be incorporated into the compounds of Formula (1), include but are not limited
   to isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3 H (also denoted D for deuterium and T for tritium,
30 respectively), carbon, such as "C,    13C and  14C,  nitrogen, such as     13
                                                                                N and 1 5N, oxygen, such as
         17                                  31 P and 32 P, sulfur,
   15,     0  and 18,  phosphorus, such as                          such as 35S, fluorine, such as     18
                                                                                                         F,

   and  1311.  The choice of isotope included in an isotope-labelled compound will depend on the
   specific application of that compound. For example, for drug or substrate tissue distribution
35 assays, compounds wherein a radioactive isotope such as 3H or             14C is incorporated will
   generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications, for example positron emission
                                                                     18
   tomography (PET) a positron emitting isotope such as 11C,            F, 13 N or 15O will be useful. The

   incorporation of a heavier isotope, such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may provide greater metabolic
   stability to a compound of Formula (1) which may result in, for example, an increased in vivo
   half life of the compound or reduced dosage requirements.
 5 Isotope-labelled compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes analogous to those
   described in the Schemes and/or Examples herein below by using the appropriate isotope
   labelled reagent or starting material instead of the corresponding non-isotope-labelled reagent
   or starting material, or by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art.
 0 The pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts comprise the therapeutically active acid and
   base addition salt forms of the compounds of Formula (1). Of interest are the free, i.e. non-salt
   forms of the compounds of Formula (1) or any subgroup thereof.
   The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating
 5 the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic
   acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric
   and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propionic, hydroxyacetic, lactic,
   pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic
   (i.e. hydroxylbutanedioic acid), tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic,
 0 p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids. Conversely
   said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.
   The compounds of Formula (1)containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non
   toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic
 5 bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and
   earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and
   the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine
   salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.
30 Some of the compounds of Formula (1)may also exist in their tautomeric form. For example,
   tautomeric forms of amide groups (-C(=O)-NH-) are iminoalcohols (-C(OH)=N-), which can
   become stabilized in rings with aromatic character. Such forms, although not explicitly indicated
   in the structural formulae represented herein, are intended to be included within the scope of
   the present invention.

   For a prodrug to be liver targeted, a correct processing of the prodrug is crucial. The prodrug
   should be stable in intestinal fluid, and processed in the liver by liver enzymes in a first pass
   metabolism to form the monophosphate. The formed monophosphate is then to be anabolized
   by cellular kinases in the hepatocytes to the active triphosphate species. Additionally, the anti
 5 cancer drug should be toxic to proliferating cells. Suitable methods to evaluate compounds for
   these properties are, for example, as set out below.
   Stability in human intestinal S9 fraction (HIS9) and in human liver S9 fraction (HLS9),
   Stock solutions of each test compound (10 mM) were prepared in DMSO and stored at -200C.
 0 Prior to the start of the experiment, the test compounds were diluted to 500 pM in 50%
   acetonitrile in water. The reaction mixture was prepared in a total volume of 250 pL containing 5
   mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM NADPH and 5 pM test compound in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
   7.4). The reaction was initiated by addition of human liver or intestinal S9 fraction with a final
   concentration of 0.4 mg protein/mL (Xeno Tech). The reaction mixture was incubated on an
 5 orbital shaker at 37 C. At the desired time points (0, 10, 30 and 60 minutes) aliquots of 50 pL
   were taken and the reaction was stopped by mixing with 150 pL acetonitrile containing internal
   standard. Standard solutions of each test compound were prepared from the 500 pM solution by
   diluting the solution to a final concentration of 5 pM in boiled human S9 (0.4 mg protein/mL), 5
   mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The standards and samples were
30 kept on ice for 30 min then centrifuged at 3 000 g for 20 minutes at 10     0C, there after 10 pL of
   supernatant was mixed with 200 pL 50% acetonitrile in water. 0.5 pM of each test compound in
   50% acetonitrile in water was injected into the LC/MS-MS to determine the daughter ion,
   declustring potential (DP), collision energy (CE) and collision cell exit potential (CXP) in order to
   develop a LC/MS-MS method. The compounds were separated using a C18 column with a
35 QTRAP5500 system. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (98% water, 2% acetonitrile,
   0.1% acetic acid or 10 mM ammonium acetate) and solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 20% water,
   0.1% acetic acid or 10 mM ammonium acetate). Elution of the compounds was performed by
                                                      61

  using a gradient of solvent B from 0% to 100%. 5 pL of standard points and samples were
  injected for analysis with QTRAP5500.
  The amount of parent compound was determined on the basis of the peak area for each time
  point compared to standard which was set to 5 pM. Intrinsic clearance (CLi1 ) and half-life (t1 /2 )
5 were determined from the disappearance curves of the test compound using Excel software.
  Cell Cytotoxicity Assays
  Cells were seeded 24 hours prior to compound addition. Each test compound (serially diluted
  from 100 pM) was added to Huh7 (1.5 x 104 cells/well) or HepG2 (1.5 x 104 cells/well), and
0 allowed to incubate for 5 days at 37 OC. A medium only control was used to determine the
  minimum absorbance value and an untreated cell value. At the end of the growth period, XTT
  dye from Polysciences Europe GmbH was added to each well. The absorbance at 450 nm with
  a reference wavelength of 600 nM was read with a Sunrise (Tecan) using the medium only
  control wells as blanks. The 50% inhibition value (CC 5 0 ) was determined by comparing the
5 degree of inhibition (compared to cell control) plotted against compound concentration. Results
  from the dilution series were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve.
  Compounds of the invention were evaluated in these assays to assess the stability in human
  intestinal S9 fraction (HIS9) and human liver S9 fraction (HLS9), and for Cell Cytotoxicity in
0 HUH7, HEP3B and HEPG2 cells. The results are summarised in TABLE B1.

   Triphosphate formation assay
   Each compound was tested in triplicates in the assay.
 5 Fresh human plated hepatocytes (Biopredic, France) in 12-well plates were used. Each well
   was plated with 0.76 x 106 cells and incubated with a 10 pM DMSO solution of compound (0.1%
   DMSO) in 1 mL incubation medium in a C02 incubator at 37 0C for 8 hours. Huh7 cells grown in
   DMEM with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum were seeded in 12 well plates, 2x1 05 cells/well.
   After 24 hrs 1 mL of 10 pM compound in medium was added and the cells were incubated
10 another 6-8 hrs.

       WO 2016/030335                                                         PCT/EP2015/069370
   The incubation was stopped by washing each well with 1 mL ice cold Hank's balanced solution,
   pH 7.2 twice, followed by addition of 0.5 mL ice cold 70% methanol. Immediately after the
   addition of methanol, the cell-layer was detached from the bottom of the well by a cell scraper
   and sucked up and down 5-6 times with an automatic pipet. The cell suspension was
 5 transferred to a glass vial and stored over night at -20 0C.
   The samples, each consisting of various levels of prodrug, free nucleoside, and mono-, di- and
   triphosphate were then vortexed and centrifuged at 10     0C for 10 minutes, at 14000 rpm in an
   Eppendorf centrifuge 5417R. The supernatants were transferred to 2 mL glass vials with insert
   and subjected to bioanalysis as follows:
 0 An internal standard (Indinavir) was added to each sample and the samples (10 pL injection
   volume) were analysed on a two column system coupled to a QTRAP 5000 mass spectrometer.
   The two column system consisted of two binary pumps, X and Y, two switching valves and an
   autosampler. The two HPLC columns used were a Synergy POLAR-RP 50*4.6 mm, 4 pm
   particles and a BioBasic AX 50*2.1 mm 5 pm particles. The LC flow rates were 0.4-0.6 mL/min
 5 mL/min (the higher flow rate were used in the recondition step).
   The HPLC mobile phases for the POLAR-RP column consisted of 10 mmol/L ammonium
   acetate in 2 % acetonitrile (mobile phase A) and 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate in 90 %
   acetonitrile (mobile phase B) and for the BioBasic AX column 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate in
   2 % acetonitrile (mobile phase C) and 1 % ammonium hydroxide in 2 % acetonitrile (mobile
 0 phase D). The HPLC gradient for pump Y started at 0% mobile phase B and was held for 2 min.
   During loading phase, the mobile phase went through the POLAR-RP and BioBasic AX column,
   and prodrug, nucleoside and internal standard were trapped on the POLAR-RP column;
   whereas the nucleotides (mono-, di- and triphosphates) eluted on to the BioBasic AX column
   and were trapped there.
 5 In the next step, the flow was switched from the POLAR-RP column to the MS and the mobile
   phase C switched from pump X to the BioBasic AX column. The compounds on the POLAR-RP
   column were eluted with a gradient from 0 % B up to 100 % B in about two minutes and
   analyzed in positive or negative mode using the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM).
   In the last step the flow from the BioBasic AX column was switched to the MS and the
30 phosphates were eluted with a of about 7 minutes gradient up 50 % D, and analyzed in positive
   or negative mode using MRM. During the last step both columns are reconditioned.
   Triphosphate concentration for each compound was then determined by comparison with
   standard curves which were made by analysis of standard samples with known concentrations
   of triphosphate. The standards were run in the same matrices as the test samples. Due to
35 variations in phosphorylation levels between hepatocyte donors, an internal reference
   compound is required in each run of the assay in order to enable ranking the results from
   different runs to each other.
