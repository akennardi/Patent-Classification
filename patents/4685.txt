                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
          The invention will be understood from the following
15 detailed description of embodiments of the invention, which
   are meant to be descriptive and not limiting. For the sake of
   brevity,    some   well-known     features,  methods,    systems,
   procedures, components, circuits, and so on, are not described
   in detail.
20        The reference numbers have been used to point out
   elements in the embodiments described and illustrated herein,
   in order to facilitate the understanding of the invention. They
   are meant to be merely illustrative, and not limiting. Also, the

                                    3

          Fig. 1 depicts the input and the product of the recycling
   system according to one embodiment of the invention.
          Raw organic waste 12 is manually removed from dishes
   14 into a sink 16, and therefrom automatically to a recycling
 5 system 10 disposed under sink 16. Recycling system 10
   produces a capsule 42A containing processed organic waste 60.
   Processed organic waste 60 may be used for agriculture, such
   as for growing vegetables.
          Fig. 2 is a front sectional view of the recycling machine
10 of Fig. 1.
          The term "waste disposal unit" refers herein to a device,
   being usually electrically powered, installed under a kitchen
   sink between the sink's drain. The disposal unit shreds food
   waste.
15        Recycling system 10 includes a waste disposal unit 20,
   for receiving raw organic waste 12, for shredding it.
          Recycling    system   10 further includes    a processing
   assembly 62,      for producing processed     organic waste 60
   contained in capsule 42A, from shredded waste 64A.
20        At the first step, processing assembly 62 mixes shredded
   waste 64A with water 66A from the tap 68, in a soaking
   compartment 22, for making shredded waste 64A absorb
   water 66A.
          The water absorption softens shredded waste 64A, thus
25 forms a first mixture 44, including water 66B and softened
   shredded waste 64A.
                                     4

         At the second step, processing assembly 62 separates
   first mixture 44. The separation includes removal of water
   66B from soaking compartment 22 into the drain 70; and
   removal    of softened shredded waste     64B, named herein
 5 "second mixture", from soaking compartment 22, through a
   pipe 28, into a cylinder 30 containing capsule 42A. Softened
   shredded waste 64B is yet liquid.
         The removal of water 66B from soaking compartment 22
   into  drain    70  is  performed  by   gravity  only,   in  that
10 compartment 22 includes a drain pipe 24 extending from the
   top 72A to the bottom 72B. Thus, surplus water contained
   within soaking compartment 22 rises to the top 72A of drain
   pipe 24, and therefrom goes down into drain 70.
         The removal of softened shredded waste 64B from
15 soaking compartment 22 into cylinder 30 is performed by
   turning on a pump 26, disposed at the bottom of compartment
   22. Pump 26 is turned to one once a sensor 34 provides a
   signal 74 indicating presence of first mixture 44 above a
   height wherein sensor 34 is disposed.
20       At the third step,     processing  assembly   62 further
   separates absorbed water 66C from softened shredded waste
   64B, for forming processed organic waste 60, being quite dry,
   within   capsule   42A.  The  separation  includes    aggressive
   removal of absorbed water 66C from cylinder 30, through a
25 pipe 36, into the drain 70.
         The aggressive removal of absorbed water 66C from
   cylinder 30 is performed by making a piston 80 compress
   softened shredded waste 64B within cylinder 30 from time to
                                   5

   time, for removing water 66C through a filter 82, disposed at
   the bottom of cylinder 30.
          During the pressing by piston 80, a valve 46 at the inlet
   of cylinder 30 is closed.
 5        According to one embodiment, piston 80 may receive the
   power thereof from the water network 84, supplying the water
   to  tap   68,   upon   opening  an  electric  faucet    52,  thus
   pressurizing water through a pipe 50 to piston 80.
          A sensor 76 may report that cylinder 30 contains
10 processed organic waste 60 above a height of sensor 76.
          Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the recycling system of
   Fig. 1.
          A cover 78 of cylinder 30 may be removed for opening
   cylinder 30.
15        Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the recycling system of
   Fig. 3 upon opening the cover.
          Upon removing cover 78 of cylinder 30, capsule 42A may
   be removed from cylinder 30, for replacing it with an empty
   capsule 42B.
20        Fig.  5 is   similar to Fig.  2,  according   to   another
   embodiment.
          The removal of softened shredded waste 64B from
   soaking compartment 22 into cylinder 30 may be performed by
   rotating an elongated spiral blade 58, disposed within pipe 28,
25 in relation thereto.
                                   6

          Fig. 6 is a perspective view of the elongated blade of Fig.
   5.
          Fig. 7 is similar to Fig. 4, according to the embodiment
 5 of Fig. 5.
          Pipe 28 according to this embodiment, is as well
   elongated. Thus, preferably it must be tilted downwards
   towards cylinder 30.

   (24) extending from the top (72A) of the soaking compartment
   (22) to the bottom (72B) thereof to the drain (70),
10    thereby    surplus  water  contained    within   the soaking
      compartment (22) rises to the top (72A) of the drain pipe
      (24), and therefrom goes down into the drain (70).
         The removal means (24, 80), for removing the water
15 (66A) from the mixture (64B), may include a piston (80), for
   compressing the mixture (64B).

   (66A) from the mixture (64B), may further include:
20    -  a filter (82),
      thereby the piston (80) compresses the mixture (64B)
      through the filter (82), thereby removing water from the
      mixture (64B).
25       The piston (80) may be powered by the water network
   (84).
         The recycling system (10) may include:
      -  a waste disposal unit (20), for shredding the raw organic
30       waste (12) received by the sink (16); and
                                  8

      -   a soaking compartment (22), for soaking shredded waste
          (64A), produced by the waste disposal unit (20) to     the
          organic waste (60), for softening the shredded waste
          (64A), thereby making a mixture (44, 64B); and
 5    -   an elongated spiral blade (58),      for transferring the
          mixture (44) into a capsule (42A), being removable from
         the recycling system (10).
          In  another   aspect, the    invention  is directed  to  a
10 recycling system (10), comprising:
      -   a waste disposal unit (20), for shredding raw organic
         waste (12); and
      -   a processing assembly (62), for processing liquid (66A)
          and shredded waste (64A),        produced by the waste
15        disposal unit (20), to organic waste (60).
          The processing assembly (62) may include:
      -   a soaking compartment (22), for soaking the shredded
         waste    (64A) in    the liquid (66A),   for softening the
20        shredded waste (64A), thereby making a mixture (44,
          64B); and
