                    LID CONSTRUCTION FOR BREATHING APPARATUS
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
           [0001]      The present invention generally relates to respiratory devices.         More
 5 particularly, the present invention relates to respiratory devices in which respiratory gases are
   supplied at a positive pressure after passing over a surface of liquid in a reservoir.
   Description of the Related Art
           [0002]      CPAP treatment of obstructive sleep apnea involves the delivery of
   pressurized, breathable gas, usually air, to a user's airways using a conduit and a user
10 interface, such as a mask. The gas pressures employed for CPAP typically range from about
   4 cm H20 to about 28 cm H20 at flow rates of up to about 180 L/min (measured at the user
   interface), depend upon the requirements of the user. The pressurized gas acts as a pneumatic
   splint for the airway of the user. As such, the pressurized gas reduces the likelihood of
   collapsing of the airway.
15                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           [0003]      This   application   is  a divisional    of Australian     patent application
   2013324530, which is the national phase entry in Australia of PCT international application
   PCT/NZ2013/000175 (published as WO2014/051436), and claims the benefit of priority to
   US 61/705,340, filed September 25, 2012 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
20         [0003a]     CPAP machines include an airflow generator to supply the pressurized gas
   and many CPAP machines include a heated water bath or other source of water for
   humidification of the pressurized gas. CPAP machines often are used in bedrooms or other
   sleeping quarters and are placed on nightstands, for example. As such, reducing the footprint
   of CPAP machines is desirable.        In addition, given the limited space of nightstand tops,
25 CPAP machines often are pushed as close to a wall as possible.
           [0004]      Because of the cramped spaces in which CPAP machines are used, easy
   manipulation of a lid or other component used to enclose a water reservoir or the like is
                                                   -1-

   desired. Preferably, the lid or other such component can be easily pivoted about hinges.
   More preferably, the hinges are configured to be generally flush with, or recessed into, the
   adjoining outer surfaces Even more preferably, the hinges provide a restraint against forces
   generated by air pressure within the machine (e.g., vertical forces with a generally horizontal
 5 lid) while allowing detachment of the lid when the lid is overextended during opening.
            [0005]      Moreover, to improve the ability to access the water reservoir, the lid
   preferably carries a latch mechanism such that a user can open the lid with a single hand. In
   other words, the latch can be operated and the lid can be opened with a single hand and,
   preferably, with the single hand in a single position. Such configurations are a welcomed
10 improvement over configurations requiring one hand to operate the latch and another hand to
   subsequently raise the lid.
            [0005a]          In some configurations, breathing assistance apparatus comprising: a
   lid and a main body, the lid and the main body selectively enclosing a cavity configured to
   hold a body of liquid; and at least one hinge assembly comprising at least one post mounted
15 to the lid and at least one support mounted to the main body, wherein the at least one support
   comprises a recess configured to receive at least a portion of the post, the at least one hinge
   assembly adapted to provide restraint against air pressure within the apparatus in use,
   wherein, when the lid is in an open position, the lid can be separated from the main body with
   application of a sufficient force without breakage of either the at least one support or the at
20 least one post; wherein the at least one hinge assembly comprises a guide structure and cam
   structure, the guide structure and the cam structure configured to cause sliding movement of
   the at least one post during rotation of the post, wherein the guide structure comprises a
   recess configured to receive the cam structure such that the cam structure and the guide
   structure engage each other and resist detachment of the lid from the main body when the lid
25 is in an at least partially closed position, and wherein when the lid is in the open position, the
   guide structure is sufficiently spaced from the cam structure such that the lid can be separated
   from the main body with application of the sufficient force; and wherein the guide structure
   comprises a guide surface, wherein in use the guide surface contacts the cam structure to
                                                    -2-

   move the lid from a detached state to an attached state relative to the main body via the
   sliding movement of the at least one post as a result of closing motion of the lid.
            [0005b]        In some configurations, the breathing assistance apparatus further
   comprises a release assembly.
 5          [0005c]        In some configurations, the release assembly comprises a button
   member.
            [0006]     In some configurations, a breathing assistance apparatus comprises a lid
   and a main body with the lid and the main body selectively enclosing a cavity.         The lid
   comprises a button member and at least one hinge assembly.
10          [0007]     In some configurations, the lid further comprises a component adapted to
   be engaged with one or more fingertips while the button member is depressed.
            [0008]     In some configurations, the button member is spring biased away from the
   at least one hinge assembly.
            [0009]     In some configurations, the at least one hinge assembly allows pivotal
15 movement of the lid relative to the main body.
            [0010]     In some configurations, the hinge assembly comprises at least one post and
   at least one support, the supports overlying the post and the post being positioned inboard of
   an outer perimeter of the lid.
            [0011]     Preferably, the hinge assembly comprises a clip extending along at least an
20 axial length of the post, the clip being positioned on an opposite side of the post from the
   supports such that the post is captured between the clip and the supports.
            [0012]     In some configurations, the at least one hinge assembly comprises a guide
   structure and cam structure, the guide structure and the cam structure configured to cause
   sliding movement of the post during rotation of the post.
                                                  -3-

            [0013]     In some configurations, the guide structure comprises a guide surface,
   wherein in use the guide surface contacts the cam structure to move the lid from a detached
   state to an attached state relative to the main body via the sliding movement of the post as a
   result of closing motion of the lid.
 5          [0014]     Preferably, the sliding movement only occurs when the lid is moved from
   a disengage state to an engaged state with respect to the main body.
            [0015]     Preferably, the sliding movement of the post is substantially horizontal
   with the supports being positioned at least vertically above the post with the lid in the closed
   position.
10          [0016]     In some configurations, the at least one support defines an opening that
   permits the at least one post to pass through the opening such that in use the lid can be moved
   from a detached state to an attached state relative to the main body.
            [0017]     In some configurations, a method of opening a lid of a breathing apparatus
   comprises moving a button member toward an engagement component to unlatch the lid and
15 then rotating the lid to an opened position without the user having to reposition a hand.
            [0018]     In some configurations, a method of engaging a lid on a main body of a
   breathing apparatus comprises placing a post alongside at least one support member with the
   lid in an open position, pivoting the lid toward a closed position such that at least one
   engaging structures formed on the lid and at least one engaging structure formed on the main
20 body cause the lid to translate into an engaged structure with the lid being pivotable while in
   the engaged structure.

             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
20          [0028]      Figure 1 illustrates a breathing assistance apparatus 100 that is arranged
   and configured in accordance with certain features, aspects and advantages of the present
   invention. The apparatus 100 comprises a main body 102 and a lid 104. Together, the main
   body 102 and the lid 104 define a housing 106 that encloses, or generally encases, a reservoir,
   tub, tank or other body of liquid (not shown) within a cavity.
                                                    -5-

            [0029]     The illustrated body 102 comprises at least one outer surface 110. In the
   illustrated configuration, the body 102 comprises four generally planar outer surfaces 110 that
   are connected by rounded corners 112. Other configurations are possible.
            [0030]     The lid 104 is connected to the body 102 with hinge assemblies 114. In
 5 the illustrated configuration, the lid 104 is connected to a rear of the main body 102 using
   two hinge assemblies. The lid 104 can be connected to other surfaces. In addition, the lid
    104 can be connected to the main body 102 using as few as one hinge assembly 114 or more
   than two hinge assemblies 114. Preferably, the hinge assemblies 114 are constructed such
   that, with the lid 104 in the closed position (e.g., as shown in Figure 1), the hinge assemblies
10  114 are generally flush with or recessed into the rear outer surface 110.              In some
   configurations, the hinge assemblies 114 are constructed such that the hinge assemblies do
   not protrude rearward of the rear outer surface 110.       In some configurations, some of the
   hinge features may protrude very slightly from one or more surrounding surface of the rear
   outer surface or other surrounding portion of the apparatus. In some configurations, the lid
15  104 comprises an outer perimeter 116 and the hinge assemblies 114 do not protrude
   significantly outward of the outer perimeter 116 of the lid 104.
            [0031]     With reference to Figure 2, the hinge assemblies 114 comprise at least one
   post 120 and at least one support 122. Preferably, the at least one post 120 is mounted such
   that the post is recessed and located inside of the outer perimeter 116 of the lid.         The
20 illustrated configuration comprises a single post 120 that is connected to two supports 122.
   In some configurations, the at least one post 120 is mounted to the lid 104 while the at least
   one support 122 is mounted to the main body 102. In some configurations, the at least one
   post 120 can be mounted to the main body 102 while the at least one support 122 can be
   mounted to the lid 104.
25          [0032]     The at least one post 120 can be secured to the lid 104 using one or more
   standoffs 124. In the illustrated construction, the standoffs 124 are positioned between the
   two supports 122. The standoffs reduce the deflection of the post 120 in the region of the
   supports 122. In some configurations, the portion 126 of the post 120 extending between the
   standoffs 124 can be omitted. In the illustrated configuration, however, the portion 126 of
                                                   -6-

   the post 120 can be secured by a clip 130. The clip 130 can have a recess that accommodates
   the post 120 or any other suitable configuration.
            [0033]     A force generated by the clip 130 on the post 120 in the illustrated
   configuration is opposed by forces generated by the supports 122, for example. The clip 130
 5 can contact an opposite side of the post 120 relative a contact region between the supports
    122 and the post 120. In some configurations, the clip 130 can be configured to deflect away
   from the post 120 during assembly of the post 120 and the clip 130. For example, the clip
    130 can be a deflectable finger that extends rearward from the main body 102. The supports
    122 can have a recess that defines a rearwardly-opening mouth that receives at least a portion
10 of a circumference of the post 120. Accordingly, movement of the post 120 in the directions
   shown by the arrow can result in attachment and detachment of the post 120 relative to the
   supports 122 and the clip 130.       The rearwardly-opening mouth of the supports 122 also
   results in a structure that overlies the post 120 such that vertical movement of the post 120
   relative to the supports 122 is not possible with the post 120 fully received within the mouths
15 of the supports 122. As such, the lid 104 is unlikely to separate from the main body 102
   during therapy.
            [0034]     With reference to Figure 3, the lid 104 and the main body 102 can include
   structures that guide the post 120 and the clip 130 and supports 122 into connection. In some
   configurations, the structures facilitate movement of the at least one post 120 into the mouth
20 of the supports 122 and into engagement with the clip 130 when the lid 104 is brought toward
   the closed position on the main body 102.          In the illustrated configuration, two guide
   structures 140 are positioned outboard of the two supports 122. Other configurations also are
   possible.
            [0035]     With reference to Figure 4, the guide structure 140 comprises a recess 142
25 that receives a cam structure 144. The cam structure 144 is received within the recess 142
   such that, with the lid 104 moved to the fully closed position on the main body 102, the cam
   structure 144 does not prevent the lid 104 from fully closing. The cam structure 144 tapers
   toward a point with a sloping surface 146 such that the thickness of the cam structure 144
   increases from back to front while the guide structure has an opposing surface 150. The
                                                  -7-

   sloping surface 146 and the opposing surface 150 engage each other such that the sloping
   surface 146 and the opposing surface 150 resists movement of the lid 104 relative to the main
   body 102 in the detachment direction (see Figure 2) when the lid 104 is in an at least partially
   closed position.
 5          [0036]     Moreover, as the lid 104 is rotated toward a closed position (e.g., Figure
    1), the sloping surface 146 and the opposing surface 150 act to draw the lid 104 forward into
   the attachment position (e.g., the at least one post 120 connected to the supports 122 and the
   clip 130).     Thus, rotation of the lid 104 can result in the hinge assemblies 114 being
   operatively connected from a detached state.        In some configurations, the difference in
10 thicknesses of the sloping surface 146 and the opposing surface 150 from initial contact to
   fully closed is substantially the same as a distance from the outer surface of the post 120 and
   the first contact with the supports 122 such that as the sloping and opposing surfaces 146,
    150 are moved into full engagement along their lengths, the post 120 is pulled into position
   within the supports 122 and the clip 130.
15          [0037]     Notably, with the lid 104 in the open position (e.g., Figure 3) relative to
   the main body 102, sufficient space exists between the sloping surface 146 and the opposing
   surface 150 such that the lid 104 can be separated from the main body 102 with the
   application of force. Advantageously, such a construction allows separation between the lid
    104 and the main body 102 by disconnection of the posts 120 from the supports 122 and the
20 clips 130. Such a separation can protect the apparatus 100 from damage resulting from forces
   that result from over-opening of the lid or from possible misuse of the apparatus 100.
   Accordingly, the ability to separate the lid 104 from the main body 102 can protect the
   apparatus 100 from permanent damage.          As discussed above, the lid 104 can be easily
   reconnected by placing the posts 120 alongside the supports 122 and rotating the lid 104
25 toward a closed position, which results in the sloping surface 146 of the cam structure 144
   and the opposing surface 150 of the guide structure drawing the components back together.
            [0038]      With reference now to Figure 5, a release and handle assembly 160 of the
   lid 104 will be described. As illustrated, the release and handle assembly 160 comprises at
   least one button member 162 that is mounted on the lid 104. In some configurations, the
                                                  -8-

   button member 162 is mounted for movement toward and away from the hinge assemblies
   162. In some configurations, the button member 162 can be mounted along a side of the lid
   104 that is adjacent to the side of the lid 104 having the hinge assemblies 162.            In the
   illustrated configuration, the button member 162 is mounted on an opposing side of the lid
 5 104 relative to the hinge assemblies 114 and capable of movement toward and away from the
   hinge assemblies 114.
            [0039]      The button member 162 is illustrated in Figure 6. The button member
   comprises an exterior surface 164, which is best shown in Figure 5. The exterior surface 164
   is sufficiently large for contact with a finger or thumb. As also illustrated in Figure 5, the lid
10 104 can comprise a component 166 that is used to raise the lid 104.             In the illustrated
   configuration, the component 166 is a recessed region that has a wall 170 extending generally
   parallel with the exterior surface 164. Preferably, the recessed region 166 is sufficiently large
   as to accommodate at least tips of fingers. In some configurations,. the component 166 is one
   or more lip, ridge, protrusion, recess or the like. Accordingly, the component 166 (e.g.,
15 having the wall 170) and the exterior surface 164 can allow a simple squeezing action to
   accomplish both an unlatching of the button member 162 as well as providing a grasping
   action to allow movement of the lid 104 away from the main body 102.
            [0040]      With reference again to Figure 6, the illustrated button member 162
   comprises two outer posts 172.        The posts 172 are sized and configured to engage with
20 biasing members, such as compression springs or the like, for example but without limitation.
   The posts 172 are received within corresponding housings 174 that are formed in the lid 104.
   The housings 174 can contain the biasing members and the posts 172 can slide into and out
   of the housings 174 against the biasing force of the biasing members.
            [0041]      The illustrated button member 162 also comprises at least one tab 176. In
25 the illustrated configuration, the button member 162 comprises two tabs 176. The tabs 176
   are bayonet shaped with a barb 180 at the end. As shown in Figure 7, the tabs 176 can
   engage a structure 182 formed in the lid 104. Thus, the tabs 176 in cooperation with the
   structure reduce the likelihood of the button member 162 coming out of a recess of the lid
   104 while allowing inward depression of the button member 162 relative to the lid 104.
                                                   -9-

            [0042]     The structure 182 also comprises a passage 184 that receives a finger 186
   mounted to, or formed on, the button member 162. The passage 184 facilitates generally only
   linear translation of the button member 162 relative to the lid 104. In other words, the
   passage 184 receives the finger 186 and the finger 186 is generally limited by the passage 184
 5 to substantially linear movement.
            [0043]     The finger 186 supports a locking post 190.     The locking post 190 can
   engage with a structure formed on the main body 102. In some configurations, the locking
   post 190 engages with a structure formed on an inner surface of the main body 102 such that
   the depression of the button member 162 results in separation between the locking post 190
10 and the structure with which it normally engages.       Releasing of the button member 162
   results in the biasing members moving the locking post 190 into position for reengagement
   with the structure with which it nonnally engages.
            [0044]     Figures 8A-8D illustrate the lid 104 in several positions relative to the
   main body 102. Figure 8A illustrates the lid 104 in a first opened position. Figures 8B and
15 8C illustrate the lid 104 in progressively further closed positions relative to the first opened
   position of Figure 8A. Figure 8D illustrates the lid 104 in a closed position. In particular,
   Figures 8A-8D further illustrate the interaction between the sloping surface, or cam surface,
    146 of the cam structure 144 and the opposing surface (also referred to as a guide surface or
   cam follower surface) 150 of the lid recess 142 as the lid 104 moves from an opened position
20 to a closed position. As described herein, the cam structure 144 and the recess 142 can
   interact to move the lid 104 from a detached position relative to the main body 102 to an
   attached position relative to the main body 102 when the lid 104 is moved from an opened
   position to a closed position.
            [0045]     As described herein, the support 122 includes the recess 200 comprising
25 the mouth 202, which opens in a rearward direction in the illustrated arrangement.
   Preferably, the recess 200 is elongate in shape and extends in a generally fore-aft direction.
   In the illustrated arrangement, the recess 200 is generally or substantially horizontal or
   aligned with a bottom support surface of the main body 102 such that the recess 200 is
   generally or substantially horizontal when the apparatus 100 is rested on a flat surface. The
                                                 -10-

   recess 200 includes upper and lower guide surfaces 204 that extend forwardly from the mouth
   202 to an end surface 206. As described herein, the support 122 also assists in retaining the
   lid 104 on the main body 102 in response to forces within the housing 106 (e.g., forces
   resulting from internal pressure) tending to separate the lid 104 from the main body 102.
 5 Thus, the upper portion of the end surface 206 and/or the upper guide surface 204 can form a
   retention surface that contacts the post 120 to retain the lid 104, or at least a portion of the lid
   104 near the support 122 and/or hinge 114 (e.g., a rearward portion), on the main body 102 in
   response to forces tending to separate the lid 104 from the main body 102.
           [0046]     In the illustrated arrangement, the end surface 206 is curved (e.g., semi
10 circular) in shape from a side view and connects the upper guide surface 204 and the lower
   guide surface 204. The illustrated support 122 is elongate in a lateral or side-to-side direction
   and, thus, defines a substantially semi-cylindrical shape in three dimensions. However, for
   convenience, the hinge 114, guide structure 140 and cam structure 144 may be described
   herein in the context of the side views of Figures 8A-8D in two-dimensional terms. It will be
15 appreciated that the described structures also have a width dimension relative to the apparatus
   100 or a depth dimension relative to the side view of Figures 8A-8D.
           [0047]     The illustrated end surface 206 is defined by a curve having a radius 208
   from a center point 210 (or an axis in three dimensions).           The recess 200 can have a
   longitudinal axis 212 that extends along a length of the recess 200 generally from the mouth
20 202 to the end surface 206 and, in the illustrated configuration, passes through the center
   point 210. The axis 212 can be aligned with or parallel to one or both of the upper and lower
   guide surfaces 204 or can be centrally-located between the guide surfaces 204 (such as in the
   event of a tapered recess, for example and without limitation).                 In the illustrated
   configuration, the axis 212 is generally or substantially horizontal (or parallel to a bottom
25 surface of the main body 102). However, in other configurations, the axis 212 could be non
   horizontal or angled relative to the bottom surface of the main body 102).
           [0048]     As described herein, the post 120 preferably is cylindrical in shape or
   circular in shape from a side view, as illustrated in Figures 8A-8D. The post 120 defines a
   center point 214 (or an axis in three dimensions) and a radius 216. Preferably, the radius 216
                                                  -11-

   of the post 120 is substantially equal to the radius 208 of the end surface 206 such that the
   post 120 can be snugly positioned against the end surface 206 and restrained in a vertical
   direction within recess 200 with the center points 210, 214 substantially aligned or coaxial
   with one another.
 5          [0049]     Preferably, the cam surface or sloping surface 146 of the cam structure 144
   is positioned or oriented relative to the end surface 206 and/or center point 210 such that the
   post 120 is moved along the axis 212 of the recess 200 toward the end surface 206 as the lid
   104 is moved from the opened toward the closed position. In the illustrated arrangement, a
   first distance 220 is defined between a first point or location 222 on the sloping surface 146
10 and the center point 210 and a second distance 224 is defined between a second point or
   location 226 on the sloping surface 146 and the center point 210. Preferably, the first point
   222 is located on an initial portion of the sloping surface 146 and the second point 226 is
   located on a subsequent portion of the sloping surface 146 such that the opposing surface 150
   will contact the first point 222 before the second point 226 as the lid 104 is moved from an
15 opened position to a closed position. The first point 222 can be at or near the location that is
   first contacted by the opposing surface 150 during closing of the lid 104 and the second point
   226 can be at or near the furthest location along the sloping surface 146 contacted by the
   opposing surface 150 when the lid 104 is in the closed position.        The first distance 220
   preferably is smaller than the second distance 224, which causes the movement of the post
20 120 along the axis 212 of the recess 200 as the lid 104 is moved from an opened position to a
   closed position and the opposing surface 150 moves along the sloping surface 146 in a
   direction from the first point 222 towards the second point 226.
            [0050]     A distance 228 traveled by the center point 214 of the post 120 within the
   recess 200 when the lid 104 is closed preferably is substantially equal to a difference 230
25 between the second distance 224 and the first distance 220. The distance 228 can be less than
   an overall length of the recess 200 because the post 120 can be at least partially located
   within the recess 200 prior to being drawn to the end surface 206 by the guide structure 140.
   In other arrangements, the distance 228 could be substantially equal to a length of the recess
   200. Although the distances described immediately above are in relation to the center points
                                                 -12-

   210 and 214, the distances similarly could be measured relative to other points on locations
   on the recess 200 (e.g., end surface 206) and post 120, respectively, if desired, such as in the
   context of non-circular (or non-cylindrical) recess or post shapes.
            [0051]     Figure 8A illustrates the lid 104 in a first open position relative to the main
 5 body 102, which may be a fully opened position, such as when initiating a process of
   reattachment of the lid 104. As illustrated, the opposing surface 150 is clear of the sloping
   surface 146 such that rearward movement (e.g., detachment) of the lid 104 is permitted.
   Advantageously, such an arrangement reduces the likelihood of permanent damage resulting
   from excessive opening forces applied to the lid 104. Figure 8B illustrates the lid 104 in a
10 second open position that is further towards a closed position relative to the first open
   position of Figure 8A. In Figure 8B, the opposing surface 150 remains clear of the sloping
   surface 146. That is, a vertical gap exists between a bottom of the opposing surface 150 and
   a top of the sloping surface 146.
            [0052]     Figure 8C illustrates the lid 104 in a third open position that is further
15 towards a closed position relative to the positions of Figures 8A and 8B. In the position of
   Figure 8C, a leading portion or engagement portion 232 of the opposing surface 150 is
   engaged with or contacts an initial portion of the sloping surface 146, which may be at or
   near the first point or location 222. In the illustrated arrangement, the post 120 is spaced
   away from the end surface 206 of the recess 200.          Figure 8D illustrates the lid 104 in a
20 position that is further towards a closed position than the positions of Figures 8A-8C. The
   position of Figure 8D can be a fully closed position of the lid 104.             In the illustrated
   arrangement, at least the leading portion or engagement portion 232 of the opposing surface
    150 is engaged with or contacts a subsequent portion of the sloping surface 146 spaced from
   the initial portion. The subsequent portion may be at or near the second point or location
25 226. Preferably, the post 120 is snugly positioned against the end surface 206 in the position
   of Figure 8D.     Thus, preferably, a distance between the engagement surface 232 and the
   center point 214 is preferably substantially equal to the second distance 224.
            [0053]     As described herein, the interaction of the guide structure 140 and the cam
   structure 144 as illustrated in Figures 8A-8D may occur only during a reattachment or
                                                   -13-

   engagement procedure for the lid 104. In normal opening and closing movement, sliding of
   the post 120 (or significant sliding of the post 120) within the recess 200 may not occur.
   Advantageously, such an arrangement reduces wear by reducing the amount of sliding
   movement between components during normal use.             However, other arrangements are
 5 possible in which the sliding movement of the post 120 occurs more often than only during
   engagement of the lid 104, such as during normal opening and closing of the lid 104.
           [0054]      Although the illustrated opposing surface 150 has a similar size and shape
   as the sloping surface 146 and extends along a substantial portion of the sloping surface 146
   when the lid 104 is in the closed position, other arrangements are also possible. For example,
10 the opposing surface 150 could be a smaller surface, such as a cam follower surface, defining
   an engagement portion 232 that contacts only a point or small length of the sloping surface
    146 in any one position. The engagement portion 232 could be rotatable such that it rolls
   along the sloping surface 146, if desired.      Moreover, as disclosed herein, the illustrated
   arrangements could be reversed such that the cam surface or sloping surface 146 is carried by
15 the lid 104 and the opposing surface 150 (or cam follower with engagement portion 232) is
   carried by the main body 102.
