                      INTEGRATED ALARM DEVICE
             CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
   [0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C.
   §119(e) to provisional U.S. patent application serial No.
 5 61/700,055 filed on September 12,  2012, the entirety of
   which is incorporated by reference herein.
                            BACKGROUND
   [0002] This disclosure relates generally to proximity
   detection systems at work sites, and in particular to
10 personal alarm devices  (PADs) for use with an interactive
   magnetic marker field and proximity detection system.
   [0003] Mining is a very diverse industry, in many ways.
   The diversities include the differing products being
   mined, geologic formations from which the product is being
15 extracted, locations throughout the world, strategies for
   mining, countless types of equipment used, mining above
   ground and underground, to mention a few examples. In most
   cases, equipment is being used to accomplish or to assist
   in the mining process, including mining machines and
20 vehicles. Such vehicles and mobile equipment may be used
   for above and/or below ground operations. Examples of the
   equipment include:  road construction equipment such as
   trucks, road graders, rollers and pavers;    surface mining
   equipment, such as for use with gravel and sand
25 operations, front end loaders, trucks, dozers, conveyors
   and other items; underground mining equipment such as
   continuous miners, shuttle cars, conveyors, crushers,
   load-haul-dump vehicles, man-trips, tractors, and other
   items. The equipment also includes fork lifts, cranes, and
30 trucks used at warehouses and shipping ports.
   [0004] Much too often, workers are injured while doing
   their jobs. As more equipment is used and as that
   equipment has become larger and more powerful, and as the
                                              9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                                -  2
   operations have become more complex, many of the injuries
   and fatalities result from workers being struck or crushed
   by the mining machines or by collisions between vehicles.
   [0005]  Many methods have been devised to warn people
 5 against being struck, pinched, crushed or otherwise harmed
   by vehicles and mobile equipment. Unfortunately, the
   systems that have been devised to help protect people and
   property in these industrial operations, such as proximity
   detection and collision avoidance systems, have usually
10 not been very effective. A new proximity detection system
   was developed and successfully demonstrated for use on
   continuous miners, as disclosed in US patents 7,420,471
    (the '471 patent),  8,169,335   (the '335 patent),         8,232,888
    (the '888 patent) and 8,446,277    (the '277 patent),               and US
15 patent publications 2009/0322512     (the '512 publication)
   and 2012/0268261   (the '261 publication),   which patents and
   publications are herein referred to collectively as the
   "Frederick patents,"   the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
20 [0006]  An objective of the   '471 patent is to help prevent
   the crushing or pinning of personnel who are remotely
   controlling a continuous miner, and to help protect other
   personnel assisting in use of the continuous miners. The
   '471 patent also envisions to provide protection to
25 personnel from other types of mobile equipment and
   machines. The system of the    '4 71 patent employs a
   magnetic marker field and an active architecture that
   incorporates two-way communication between the worker and
   the machine that the worker is near. Warnings are given to
30 workers who are too close to the miner. Warnings are also
   provided to the operator of the machine. Provisions are
   made to immobilize the equipment until personnel are able
   to reach a safer position.
   [0007]  The magnetic fields used in the '471 patent system
35 oscillate at low frequencies and can be effectively used
                                                 9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                              - 3
   to mark off warning zones, danger zones and silent zones.
   Although the maximum practical range of such low frequency
   magnetic fields may be as much as one hundred feet, in
   most applications that is more than is needed or desirable
 5 for most equipment. Typical very large off-highway haul
   trucks would probably be best served with a warning zone
   in the range of eighty feet and a danger zone in the range
   of thirty to forty feet. In some applications, such as
   remotely controlled continuous miners, it is necessary for
10 the operator to remain within a range of five to ten feet
   of the miner much of the time in order to maintain good
   visual contact with the machine and the immediate
   surroundings. The zones are shaped to be longer in the
   direction of travel or movement, but shorter in directions
15 perpendicular to the direction of travel. In underground
   mines, the low frequency magnetic fields pass unimpeded
   through earth formations so that a worker that is around a
   comer, not in line of sight, or otherwise obstructed, will
   still be visible to the marker field. These magnetic
20 fields do not radiate from antennas but simply expand and
   contract around the element that produces them, and are
   well suited for marking boundaries between silent zones
   and warning zones.
   [0008] According to one form of the present invention,
25 there is provided an alarm device for a proximity
   detection system, the proximity detection system having at
   least one magnetic field generator adapted to generate a
   magnetic field oscillating at low frequency, the alarm
   device comprising:
30 an antenna adapted to sense the strength of a magnetic
   field in which the device is located;
   a battery;
   a sounder device electrically connected to the battery
   through at least one sounder power wire; and
                                            9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                              - 4
   a shield adapted to attenuate EMI from reaching the at
   least one sounder power wire and/or the battery.
   [0010] The embodiments of the invention are particularly
   applicable to work sites that require personnel to be in
 5 close proximity to various hazardous elements, such as
   machines, mobile equipment, remotely controlled machines,
   and operated vehicles. Such work environments may include
   locations that are inherently dangerous and should be
   avoided or entered only with great caution. Examples of
10 such work environments include surf ace mining,
   underground mining, sand and gravel operations, road
   construction, warehouses, shipping docks, coke plants,
   etc. Hundreds of people are killed each year in the U.S.
   in such work environments. Workers are sometimes struck,
15 pinched, crushed or otherwise harmed while performing
   their jobs in such environments. Collisions between the
   various elements at the work sites need to be avoided also
   to avert property damage.
   [0011] Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a
20 simplified example of a work site in which a proximity
   detection system is implemented. FIG. 1 shows a truck 304
   on which a magnetic field generator 81 is mounted. The
   magnetic field generator 81 generates a magnetic field 92
   that surrounds the truck 304. The edge of the magnetic
25 field 92 generated by the magnetic field generator 81
   corresponds to the border of a Warning or Danger Zone
   surrounding the truck 304. A worker 301 within the
   boundary of the Warning or Danger Zone is in potential
   danger from being struck or otherwise injured by the truck
30 304. The worker 301 carries a personal alarm device 60.                     If
   the worker 301 and, correspondingly, the personal alarm
   device 60 are within the magnetic field 92 created by the
   magnetic field generator 81, the personal alarm device 60
   detects the presence of the magnetic field 92 and issues a
35 visual or audio warning. In embodiments of the magnetic
                                            9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               -  5
   field warning system, as detailed in the   '888 patent,
   multiple magnetic field generators 81 may be used to
   generate Warning and Danger Zones having a complex shape
   around the truck 304 or other equipment or areas. These
 5 zones may be adjusted in both size and shape. In addition,
   safe zones may be designated near the truck 304 in which a
   personal alarm device 60, while within the magnetic field
   92, does not generate a warning signal to the worker 301.
   [0012] FIG. 2 is a diagram of the personal alarm device 60
10 and the magnetic field generator 81 of the proximity
   detection system of FIG. 1.   The magnetic field generator
   81 is contained within a housing 80 and includes an
   amplifier 84 connected to a ferrite core 90, inductor 86
   and capacitor 88.  In addition, the magnetic field
15 generator 81 is connected to a power source 83 that
   provides the power to operate the magnetic field generator
   81. The amplifier 84 is connected to and controlled by a
   controller 82. The ferrite core 90, inductor 86 and
   capacitor 88 generate a magnetic field 92 in response to
20 an input voltage from the amplifier 84. The amplifier 84
   is controlled by the controller 82 which controls the
   voltage and current outputs of the amplifier 84.             The
   controller 82 is also connected to a receiver 96 and
   warning system 98. The receiver 96 is connected to an
25 antenna 94 which receives an input signal 76 from a
   personal alarm device 60. The antenna 94 conveys the
   signal 76 to the receiver 96 which passes the signal 76 to
   the controller 82.  Upon receiving the signal 76 from the
   personal alarm device 60, the controller 82 directs the
30 warning system 98 to issue a warning. In one embodiment,
   the warning system 98 may issue an audio and/or visual
   warning. In another embodiment, the warning system 98 may
   be capable of terminating the operation of a vehicle to
   which the warning system 98 is mounted, for example, the
35 truck 304 of FIG. 1. The magnetic field generator 80 may
   also be mounted in a location in which it is desirable to
                                              9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               -  6
   warn a worker carrying a personal alarm device 60 of their
   proximity to the location.
   [0013] The personal alarm device 60 has x, y,         and z axis
   magnetic field antennas 62 that sense the magnetic field
 5 92 produced by the magnetic field generator 81.          The sensed
   magnetic field signal 92 is passed through filters 66 and
   an amplifier 68 to a signal detector 64. The signal
   detector 64 then passes information about the detected
   signal to a controller 70. The controller 70 activates a
10 transmitter 72 which transmits a corresponding response
   signal 76 to the magnetic field 92 through an RF             (radio
   frequency) antenna 74. In one embodiment, the response
   signal 76 is an RF signal. The personal alarm device 60 is
   powered by power source 71.   The personal alarm device 60
15 is carried by the worker 301   (FIG. 1) in order to provide
   the worker with a warning of their proximity to a magnetic
   field generator 81.
   [0014] Proximity detection systems are beginning to be
   deployed in many types of mining operations around the
20 world in an effort to avert mining accidents related to
   the use of machines and vehicles. As this technology
   advances, there is an increased need for higher
   performance from these systems.
   [0015] The components of a PAD may include an antenna for
25 detecting the marker field, a signal generator, visual and
   auditory alarms, and associated batteries, electronics,
   firmware, software, wiring, housing and mounting
   structure, and/or other components including those
   described in the Frederick patents.
30 [0016] Piezoelectric sounders have been used as part of
   the P ADs to generate an audible alarm because such
   sounders use little power when producing a sufficiently
   loud sound, and because they are small in size. However,
   such piezoelectric sounders have a characteristic that
                                              9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               - 7
   causes a problem when used with a low frequency magnetic
   field system. These type sounders emit electromagnetic
   interference  (EMI) in the low frequency spectrum which
   introduces noise into the sensing coils.
 5 [0017] In work environments where hard hats are being
   used, it is effective to place the warning devices on the
   hard hat so that an alarm can be seen within the
   peripheral vision of the worker  (i.e., in the line of
   sight) and/or so that the audible alarm is near their ear
10 so that it can be heard even in noisy environments. See
   the '512 publication for a description of a hard hat
   positioned PAD. When used on a hard hat, the warning
   device portion of the PAD can be physically separated from
   the sensor portion by a sufficient distance to prevent the
15 EMI from degrading proper operation. This is typically
   accomplished by positioning the sensor portion on the back
   of the hard hat and positioning the warning portion near
   the front of the hard hat, e.g.,  on the brim. If a hard
   had is not being used, then this separation must be
20 accomplished by other means. Cables have been used which
   allow for the warning device portion to be in a shirt
   pocket, where it can be seen and heard, while the sensor
   portion is on a belt.
   [0018] Also, placement of the device on the hard hat
25 ensures that the device will always be present as part of
   the hard hat, a mandatory requirement in many industrial
   operations, and not left behind or lost. Workers who are
   busy with the many things required for their jobs do not
   like to have to keep up with safety devices. Mounting PAD
30 components on the hard hat eliminates a nuisance for the
   worker and results in better acceptance and compliance.
   However, although many industrial operations require
   wearing a hard hat, many others do not. Therefore, another
   approach is required.
35 [0019] Multiple pockets on a vest have also been tried for
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               - 8
   holding various components of a PAD, with the
   piezoelectric sounder component   (warning device portion)
   pocket being positioned a sufficient distance from the
   antenna component  (sensor portion) pocket. However,
 5 acceptance of the PAD by the user will be improved if the
   sounder and antenna can be included in a single,
   integrated PAD unit. To use this approach, the
   piezoelectric sounder emitted EMI noise inducement problem
   must be solved.
10 [0020]  The manner in which workers are given alerts or
   warnings is important. Alarms given to the worker should
   be implemented so as to ensure that they will not be
   missed or ignored but must also not be a nuisance to the
   person who is using them. There is a need for improvement
15 of the available alarm devices, so that they effectively
   satisfy these two requirements as well as being practical
   to use.

           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                                     -  10
    [0034]     The various embodiments described herein are
   particularly applicable to work sites that require
   personnel to be in close proximity to various hazardous
   elements, such as machines, mobile equipment, remotely
 5 controlled machines, and operated vehicles. Such work
   environments may include locations that are inherently
   dangerous and should be avoided or entered only with great
   caution. Examples of such work environments include
   surface mining, underground mining, sand and gravel
10 operations, road construction, warehouses, shipping docks,
   coke plants, etc. Workers are sometimes struck, pinched,
   crushed or otherwise harmed while performing their jobs in
   such environments. Collisions between the various elements
   at the work sites also need to be avoided to avert
15 property damage.
    [0035]     Proximity protection systems are normally
   configured specifically for the type of machine or vehicle
   on which they are installed. For example, a typical
   shuttle car used in an underground coal mine will
20 generally require a four generator ping-echo type system,
   utilizing two pairs of generators, each pair configured to
   produce shaped fields, in the form of a pulse                    (the "ping")
   of an oscillating magnetic field. The primary information
   from personal alarm devices         ("PADs") or vehicle alarm
25 devices      ("VADs") to the system will be a short pulse of
   radio frequency       ("RF")  (the "echo").    In  this

   number of PADs and VADs can be present with no conflict
   between them.       The magnetic fields are pulsed, having a
30 statistical      timing element such that      multiple systems can
   be operative within a typical work space without conflicts
   that      would impair the effectiveness of the system.
    [0036]     Referring now to FIG. 3, a personal alarm device
   160 according to preferred embodiments is illustrated. The
35 PAD 160 is a single unit that is equipped with all the
                                                        9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

   required performance capabilities while still being small
   enough to fit into a shirt pocket or in a pouch provided
   on a safety vest. Included in the device 160 is a means of
   detecting and measuring the magnetic field produced by the
 5 magnetic field generator of the proximity detection
   system, and of making decisions about the proximity of the
   moving machinery or vehicles and for issuing signals to
   alert the worker and for issuing signals to the operator
   of the machine and/or to slow or stop the machine.
10 [0037] Both visual and audible signals are include that
   may be synchronized in order to maximize the stimulation
   to the worker. An LED 180 provides a visual warning and a
   sounder 112 provides an audible warning. A    lighted vest,
   with LEDs, electro-luminescent wire or other lighting
15 elements, could also provide visual warning to the worker
   and/or others. Such synchronous stimuli tend to reduce the
   chance of missing an alarm due to other persons or sounds
   or activities in the area. Microcontrollers measure the
   incoming magnetic field pulses and make many logical
20 decisions as to the responses to make to the magnetic
   field generators and for alerting the worker who is
   carrying the PAD 160. Communications between the PADs and
   the magnetic field generators are essential to the process
   of determining if a worker is too close to a machine and
25 for deciding what action should be taken by the worker
   and/or the operator of the machine. Communications from
   the PAD back to the magnetic field generator is
   accomplished with a UHF transmitter. A rechargeable
   battery 171 provides power and a special port 150 provides
30 a means to recharge the battery 171. The port 150 includes
   a jack 156 for accepting a charging cable    (not shown),                  and
   a cover 152 is connected to the jack 156 through a hinge
   154. The cover 152 prevents dust from entering the jack
   156, and also may serve as a shield to inhibit EMI from
35 escaping the jack 156. The PAD 160 may be disabled during
   charging so it will not be induced to generate a false
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               - 12
   alarm by EMI emitted from the charging equipment. An
   optional switch 182 provides a means to remove power
    (e.g., to turn off the device) in order to save battery
   power. The LED 180 may be caused to blink every few
 5 seconds, typically every 10-20 seconds, to assure the
   worker that the battery 171 is adequately charged. This is
   done without making a sound with the sounder 112 in order
   to not be a nuisance.
   [0038]  Clearly, much electronics is required to accomplish
10 all the required tasks and good design procedures are
   required to ensure that the electronics are effective and
   accurate, and that the electronics do not cause
   interference to other elements and are not easily
   interfered with by other elements. However, even with
15 proper design practices being followed, the EMI problem
   previously described must be solved. A key part of the
   solution is the use of a special shield, e.g.,         shield cup
   120, made specifically for the sounder 112.
   [0039]  Provisions must be made to make it easy for the
20 worker to carry the PAD, make it convenient to charge the
   PAD, and provide a practical means of carrying the PAD
   even when heavy clothing must be worn in cold weather or
   when working around furnaces or other hot equipment. For
   these special cases, a safety vest may be used that has a
25 special pocket positioned where it is easy for the worker
   to see the visual alarm indication and to hear the audible
   alarm. The pocket may include a first flap to secure the
   PAD unit within the pocket so that it will not fall out
   during use. The pocket may include a second small flap to
30 allow quick and easy access for attaching a charging
   cable. This way, when the worker puts on his vest before
   entering the work area, his PAD will already be in his
   vest. All he has to do is to disconnect the cable that is
   connected to the charger, close the flap and proceed to
35 work.
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               - 13
   [0040] An essential task to be performed by a PAD is to
   detect and measure the strength of low frequency magnetic
   fields that are produced by a magnetic field generator. By
   making measurements of this magnetic field, the PAD can
 5 determine when it is within the boundary of a warning zone
   or a danger zone. As mentioned earlier, the preferred
   device for providing an audible sound is a piezo-electric
   sounder device, which are known to generate EMI in various
   frequency ranges, including within the low frequency range
10 used to produce the magnetic marker field. Therefore, if
   the sounder is too close to the sensing coils of the PAD,
   when the sounder is required to make a sound, it can alter
   the magnitude and characteristics of the magnetic pulses
   being measured which results in errors, a problem that
15 cannot be tolerated. It should be understood that the
   typical gain applied to the signal from the sensing coils,
   which are wound on small ferrite rods, will typically be
   in the range of 3000  (i.e., output is three thousand times
   input) and could be higher. Emissions of noise in the
20 frequency range of the tuned circuit, of which the coils
   are an integral part, would be readily picked up by the
   sensing coils. If the magnitude of the noise is
   significant relative to the magnitude of the magnetic
   pulses, the noise induced errors may be significant.
25 [0041] Using a model HA-S-2200-14 PAD from Frederick
   Energy Products, LLC of Huntsville, AL, and a
   piezoelectric sounder model AI-1223-TWT-SVR from Projects
   Unlimited, Inc. of Dayton OH, experimentation has shown
   that this problem is detected when the sounder is within
30 about six inches of the coils and produces false alarms
   when within about four inches from the coils. If
   integrated P ADs were made large enough to allow more than
   four inches, and preferably more than six inches,
   separation between the sounder and the coils, the P ADs
35 would be too large to be conveniently carried by the
   workers. A PAD needs to not be any larger than can be
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               - 14
   fitted into a shirt pocket or similar pocket on a safety
   vest. Further, it needs to be light so that the size of
   the enclosure needs to be as small as possible.
   [0042] To accomplish these requirements, the sounder
 5 should be moved as far away from the coils as possible
   within the PAD housing. However, this alone is not
   adequate and other steps are required. Typical box
   shielding with closed compartment panels and guards,
   positioned between the sounder and the coils is also not
10 sufficient. These shield approaches can reduce the induced
   noise slightly but they allow the magnetic fields to
   extend around them from the sounder to the magnetic
   sensing coils. Shielding foils make slight improvements
   but are thin  (about one thousandth of an inch) and do not
15 sufficiently capture the magnetic fields. In addition, EMI
   in the vicinity of the sounder induces current in the
   leads to the sounder, which current is then carried to
   parts of the electronics, where the current induces
   additional EMI emitted onto the coils.
20 [0043] A more substantial approach is required to block
   electrostatic fields and to capture the magnetic fields
   being produced by the sounder and being induced on its
   leads. The solution involves three steps. One step is to
   position the sounder 112 as far from the coils 162 as the
25 housing size will allow. This is shown in FIG. 3. As a
   second step, wires, leads, and traces in the vicinity of
   the sounder 112 should be as short as possible to minimize
   their picking up the EMI and/or their radiating noise. For
   example, wires leading to the charging port are routed
30 behind the battery 171  (i.e., with the battery positioned
   between the wires and the pick-up coils) to help shield
   any radiation from them resulting from any EMI that does
   couple into them from the sounder 112. These two steps
   help to avoid noise sources but they are not sufficient.
35 The third step is to provide a metal cup 120, preferably
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               - 15
   made from mu-metal or copper, into which the sounder 112
   is placed. Alloy 145 machinable copper is a commercially
   available shielding material that may be used for the cup
   120.
 5 [0044]  The cup 120 should cover all of the sounder 112
   except the end where the sound exits, as shown in F1G. 6.
   If the gain of the sensing circuit is higher, the front of
   the cup 120 can be covered with a plate 110, having only a
   small hole 111 through which the sound passes, as shown in
10 F1G. 7,  and the plate 110 can be soldered to the cup 120.
   Tiny holes 127, just barely large enough to allow the
   power leads from the sounder 112 to pass, are fitted near
   the rear of the sounder housing cup 120 to isolate the
   leads as much as possible from the emissions from the
15 sounder 112. The power leads should be covered with a thin
   insulating sleeve to prevent shorting to the cup 120. Very
   thin heat shrink tubing is suitable for this purpose.
   [0045]  The cup 120 has a cylindrical side wall 122, an
   outer open end 128 and an inner end wall 129, defining a
20 cylindrical chamber 121. The piezoelectric sounder 112 is
   housed in the chamber 121, with its power lead wires
   extending through the holes 127 in the end wall 129. The
   sounder 112 sound is emitted from the open end 128, or, if
   the disc 110 is in place, from the disc hole(s) 111. The
25 sounder 112 is not shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. And, the disc
   110 is not shown in F1G. 6, rather the empty chamber 121
   is shown. The chamber 121 has a diameter D2 at its side
   wall 122. The inner wall 129 has a thickness T2. The lead
   wire holes 127 have a diameter D3.
30 [0046]  The cup 120 has at its outer end 128, a flange rim
   124 extending outwardly from the side wall 122. The rim
   124 has and inner diameter D2    (which is the same as the
   chamber 121 diameter D2),  an outer diameter DI and a
   thickness Tl.  Upon threading the cup 120 into the housing
35 140, the inner surface 143 of the rim 124 engages the
                                               9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                              - 16
   outer surface 142 of the housing 140. As such, the rim 124
   stands out from the housing by its thickness Ti.            Having
   the rim configured in this manner provides collection
   point surface and structure that shapes the EMI field in a
 5 way that enhances capturing or confining it, and decreases
   the strength of the EMI that leaks from the shielding.
   [0047] In example embodiments, the thicknesses of the
   shielding cup 120 and disc 110 are about 0.35 inches to
   about 0.5 inches. Those thicknesses have been found to be
10 sufficient for attenuating EMI to reduce noise to
   acceptable levels in the devices tested;  the typical
   shielding foil thickness of 0.001 inch was found to not be
   sufficient. Generally, as the shielding thickness is
   decreased, the shielding effect decreases.
15 [0048] The cup 120 is positioned in the housing 140 at a
   location remote from the antenna pickup coils 162. The cup
   120 is oriented so the sound opening  (if disc 110 is used
   the opening is hole 111 and if disc 110 is not used, the
   opening is defined by diameter D2) and the lead wire
20 openings 127 are not directed towards the antenna pickup
   coils 162, as can be seen in F1G. 3.
   [0049] Although all noise may not be completely
   eliminated, the shielding, sounder and wire orientation
   and placement should preferably reduce noise in the system
25 caused by the sounder to less than thirty millivolts                   (30
   mV).
   [0050] Being a safety device, it is important the all
   parts be positively restrained. Although the sounder 112
   can be effectively bonded into the cup 120, given the
30 large surface area relative to the weight of the sounder
   112, retaining the cup 120, including the sounder 112,
   into the PAD plastic housing 140 requires special
   attention. Bonding the metal cup 120 to the molded plastic
   housing 140 may not be reliable. A positive restraint is
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                              - 17
   accomplished by machining threads 125 on the outside of
   the cup 120 as shown in FIG. 7.
   [0051] The same systems that provide protection for
   pedestrians from moving machines can also provide
 5 protection for one machine from being hit by another
   machine. This is commonly referred to as Collision
   Avoidance versus Proximity Detection for pedestrians.
   Alarm devices are also used on machines as part of
   Collision Avoidance Systems. Since there is a need to keep
10 Collision Avoidance alarm devices as small as possible to
   avoid reducing the visibility of the operators and to
   reduce the chance of being hit or damaged, some of the
   same problems associated with making PADs small also apply
   to the Vehicle Alarm Devices  (VADs). It is necessary to
15 position sounders close to the low frequency sensing coils
   such that EMI problems exist and must be solved in a
   similar to the solution for PADs.
   [0052] In addition to the EMI problem with the sounder, it
   has been learned that whenever the UHF transmitter is
20 turned on and off, to accomplished the required pulsing,
   transients are induced into the coils, especially the one
   nearest to the transmitter antenna. These transients are
   strong but are very brief, less than one millisecond long
   and are avoided by ignoring the signals from the sensing
25 coils when the transmitter is turned on and turned off.
   Placement of field effect transistors across the coils
   have been used to disable the sensing coils during the
   turn on and turn off of the transmitter but tend to
   introduce transients of their own so that ignoring the
30 short duration transients is preferable if the
   communication protocol will allow.
   [0053] Another aspect of this design is minimizing
   confusion for the worker wearing the PAD. It is desirable
   that whenever an alarm is being given, that there be no
35 other sounds or visuals indications happening
                                             9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                                - 18
   concurrently. It is also important for the worker to know
   that his/her PAD has adequate charge in the battery. Use
   of a visual indicator for this purpose is preferable over
   use of an audible indicator. However, it is also desirable
 5 to have the visual indicator 180 to only be activated
   periodically, such as every 15 seconds, in order to
   conserve power and thereby extend battery life. To satisfy
   these competing requirements, the micro-controller must
   not activate the battery ready indication when the PAD is
10 also issuing an alert. Doing both concurrently would be
   confusing. Thus, a single visual indicator      (LED) 180 is
   energized   (blinked) by the micro-controller 170 on a
   periodic basis, except when there is need for an alert.
   When alerting, the micro-controller will withhold an
15 indication of battery status. To accomplish these
   functions, the LED and the sounder are separately
   energized via field effect transistors that are controlled
   by the micro-controller. Advantageously, this arrangement
   helps cut down on noise to the coils by electrically
20 isolating the sounder wires by minimizing the circuitry
   connected to the sounder wires.
    [0054] One method of carrying the PAD is by adding a
   Velcro patch on the safety vest to which the PAD is
   routinely attached prior to use. It is then easy to remove
25 the PAD in order to place it on a charger when not in use.
   A pouch is provided so that a variety of restraint methods
   may be utilized to give added protection to the PAD. A
   special safety vest is incorporated that includes a pouch
   having a flap that restrains the PAD while also being
30 configured to not restrict easy viewing of the warning
   light and to not obstruct the output of the sounder. A
   special cloth weave in the vest and/or the pouch protects
   the sounder opening from dust and particles that could
   damage the PAD or reduce its effectiveness.
35  [0055] FIGS. 8 and 9 show a PAD being worn in a pouch 200
                                              9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                               - 19
   attached to a safety vest 205. The pouch 200 has two
   flaps. One of the flaps, the top flap 212 in the
   illustrated embodiment, closes over the PAD to secure the
   PAD in the pouch 200 while leaving the LED visual
 5 indicator 180 and sounder 112 exposed. The second flap,
   the bottom flap 210 in the illustrated embodiment, opens
   to expose the battery charging port 156 and allows the
   battery charger to be connected without removing the PAD
   from its pouch 200. FIG. 9 shows the charge port flap 210
10 in its open position, and shows the charger receptacle 156
   exposed for inserting the battery charger plug. When the
   charge port flap 210 is closed, it is held closed by
   hook/loop material 211, 213, the charge port sealing foam
   214 closes over the charge port 156 and protects the
15 charge port 156 from dust and dirt when the battery 171 is
   not being charged. After the battery charge is complete
   and the charge port flap 210 is closed, the PAD is fully
   operational, ready for use when the safety vest 205 is
   donned.
20 [0056]  Refer now to FIG. 10,  additional shielding foil
   240, 260 placed in the vicinity of the battery 171 is
   shown. The foil 240, 260 in an example embodiment is
   copper and has a thickness chosen to be strong enough to
   resist damage upon assembly and use, yet thin enough to be
25 pliable for assembly. Three thousandths of an inch
   thickness of copper has been found to be sufficient in one
   application, but other thicknesses and materials could be
   used. A  first generally rectangular piece of foil 240 is
   wrapped around the battery 171 so that the foil edges 241,
30 242 overlap and the foil is crimped over the battery ends
    (not shown). A second generally rectangular piece of foil
   260 extends from its first edge 260, over the battery 171,
   around the wires 245, 256, 252, 254 and back under the
   battery 171 at edge 262 of foil 260. The wires 252 and 254
35 are the sounder power wires. The wires 246 and 266 are
   ground wires connected to foils 240 and 260 at solder
                                              9712745_1 (GHMatters) P99505.AU.1 21/11/17

                              - 20
   points 246 and 266 respectively. Both pieces of foil
   extend over substantially the length of the battery
   compartment 172 in the direction of axis x.     The cap 165
   closes the battery compartment. A spacer 166 may be
 5 positioned on the cap 165 to firmly hold the contents of
   the compartment 172. The shielding foil 240, 260 impedes
   electric or magnetic fields  (from whatever source) from
   inducing current in the battery 171 or the wires 245, 256,
   252, 254, which may result in undesirable magnetic field
10 generation detectible by the antennae.
