        Lid for insulated box and method for storing products.
       The present invention relates to a lid for
                                                                 an insulated box
   5   and a method for storing products.
       It  is    known to temporarily        store products       that have to be
       kept cooled in an insulated box, that is closed
                                                                          by means of
      a lid,      in which box there is            a cooling element that has
 10   been cooled or frozen beforehand. This is done
                                                                          in order to
      transport       such     products     without      them   warming       up,     for
      example.
      Here     a  box   is   considered     as   a   general   term     for    a  broad
 15   range      of   roughly      rectangular       storage   means,       which      in
      principle are intended to be carried by a person and
                                                                                  which
      can be constructed as a bin or crate,                       for example in
      plastic.
20    The   products       concerned     are   for    example   frozen      products,
     meat      products,       dairy    products,      medicines,       flowers      and
     vegetables.
     A cooling       element     for use    with    such  a box    is    typically      a
25   closed      casing,    in   which   a  coolant,     for  example      water,     is
     introduced. This cooling element is cooled or frozen
                                                                                 before
     use. During use the cooling element, together
                                                                            with the
     products to be cooled, is placed in the insulated
                                                                             box such
     that     the   content     of  the  box   can    remain  sufficiently         cool
30   for a long time, typically around ten hours,
                                                                      and this also
     due to the good insulation of the box and the
                                                                      lid.

    WO 2014/111788                                                      PCT/IB2014/000025
                                               2
     Different types of cooling elements are hereby known, which
    are   designed       to   maintain      a    certain       temperature       interval
    during     use.     This    means     that      these    cooling      elements      are
  5 designed to be able to absorb or give off more energy for a
    given      temperature         change     in      the     specific      temperature
    interval       than   outside      the   specific        temperature       interval.
    These    cooling elements          essentially differ           from one another
    due to the formulation of the coolant.
10
    It goes without saying that all these elements, if they are
    cooled to       a temperature        that    is    low   enough,     can  perform a
    cooling     function      at all     temperatures         that   are    higher    than
    the said temperature.
15
    The   difference       between      the   various       types    is    that   with    a
    mutually equal total cooling capacity, the quantity of heat
    that     a    cooling      element      can       absorb     in     the    specified
    temperature        interval       concerned         is   greater      than    with    a
20  cooling element of a different type, i.e. a cooling element
    optimised for a different temperature interval.
    The   cooling      elements      are   normally        separate     from    the   box,
    because it is then the easiest to compactly cool or freeze
25  them again in a cooling or freezing device for reuse.
    However,      such    boxes     have   a   number       of   disadvantages        that
    primarily       show   up   in    industrial        practice.     This    primarily
    concerns      the   risk    of   mistakes        that   can   be    made,    and   the
30  lack of possibilities to ascertain them.

     WO 2014/111788                                                      PCT/IB2014/000025
                                                3
       Thus   it    can     happen   that    no   cooling      elements       or    too   few
       cooling     elements       are    accidentally         placed      in    a    box    by
       somebody     who places       a  product     in   the    box    and   then     closes
       the box.
   5
       It  can     also      happen    that    somebody        is    confused       by    the
       presence     of     cooling     elements.      for    different       temperature
       intervals,        so     that     incorrect         cooling       elements         are
       accidentally       used   that    are   not     suitable      or   less     suitable
 10    for the product concerned.
      These     mistakes       cannot    be   observed,        and    thus      cannot     be
      rectified, after the box has been closed.
 15   A further disadvantage is that placing the cooling
                                                                                  elements
      is labour intensive.
      The   cooling         elements     also    take       up    space      that      could
      otherwise     be    usefully used,       and they can move            in    the box,
 20   for  example      during     transport     of    the   box,     and   thereby      can
     damage themselves, the box and/or the product placed
                                                                                     in it.
     An uneven      distribution       of cooling function            over the volume
     of the box can occur relatively easily.
25
     The   purpose        of   the   present      invention        is   to     provide      a
     solution to the aforementioned                and other disadvantages,               by
     providing      a   lid    for   a  box,    preferably        an   insulated        box,
     with a cooling element that              forms     part of the lid,           whereby
30   this    cooling        element     is   filled       with     coolant       that     is
     intended to be cooled or frozen in order to then
                                                                                perform a

       WO 2014/111788                                                           PCT/IB2014/000025
                                                     4
         cooling      function,        whereby      the      cooling       element        forms     a
         permanent part of the lid.
         This     means     that   the   cooling      element       is   integrated         in   the
    5    lid     and  that     the     lid   and    the       cooling element are not
         intended or suitable for the regular
                                                                   removal of the cooling
        element from the lid, although there can
                                                                           be a possibility
        to take the cooling element out of the
                                                                       lid, for example to
        replace a damaged cooling element.
  10
        As a result the number of actions for
                                                                     the cooled packaging
        of products is           reduced, because no step is                       necessary to
        place      cooling       elements     in       the      box     because         they    are
        necessarily present when the lid is put
                                                                       on.
 15
       Also      the  risk     of   mistakes     is      hereby      reduced,         because    in
       principle      the     cooling     elements        can    never     be    taken     out   of
       the lids.
 20    Normally this is           a passive     cooling        element,       i.e.     a cooling
       element       without        a    connection           to    an     energy         source.
      Alternatively,            the    cooling       element         could        also     be    an
       activatable        cooling      element,      i.e.      a   cooling       element with
      different compartments with different
                                                                   chemicals which, when
25    they are brought together, for example
                                                                            by breaking a
      partition,       absorb energy from the environment
                                                                                   and thereby
      perform a cooling function.
      In    a preferred       embodiment,      the cooling element                 is   designed
30    to    perform     its    cooling     function        in    a  certain temperature
      interval, whereby the lid is provided
                                                                  on its outside with a

   WO 2014/111788                                                      PCT/IB2014/000025

   mark or      a colour      that    is    an indication       of the temperature
    interval for which the cooling element is designed.
   Hereby      an   identification          legend     must   of  course       be    agreed
 5 and    used    to   link    a   specific     mark    or   colour    to   a    specific
   temperature interval.
   In this way a suitable cooling element, on the basis of the
   optimum      storage     conditions        of    the  product    that      has      to  be
10 stored,      is    identified       more     easily     because     the     different
   types are easy to distinguish from one another.
   As   a    result,    the    risk    of mistakes       relating      to   the      use   of
   the correct type of cooling element is reduced.
15
   The     invention      also     concerns       a   combination      of    a    lid,     as
   described above, and a box, preferably an insulated box, on
   which the lid fits.
20 Preferably,        the    lid    is    a   lid    with   a   mark    or    colour       to
   indicate       the   optimum      temperature        interval     of   the      cooling
   element,       whereby     a mark      corresponding        to  the    mark      of    the
   lid    is   affixed     on    the   outside      of  the   box,   or    whereby        the
   outside of the box is made in a colour corresponding to the
25 outside of the lid.
   As a result the risk of mistakes is further reduced because
   a   clearly      affixed      mark    or   specific      colour    on   the      box    is
   easily recognisable.

     Preferably         this       concerns           two        or      more      of    the      said
     combinations        whereby        a    first        type        of    lid   has    a    cooling
     element      that    is   designed         for     a    first       temperature        interval
     and    a   second      type    of    lid       has     a     cooling      element       that    is
  5  designed for a second temperature interval.
    This      has     the     advantage          that        in      a    situation       in     which
    products       with      different         optimum           temperatures         have      to  be
    packed,       the    risk      of   mistakes           is      lower     because       only    the
10  colour      or mark       on   the    box,        which       is    easy    to   observe      even
     for somebody who has no product knowledge, determines which
     lid,    and thereby        which      type of cooling                 element,      has    to be
    used.
15  Moreover,         a    subsequent           check         for       correctness         is    very
    simple.
    The      invention        also     concerns            a      method       for    the      cooled
    storage      and/or      transport         of products,              whereby the products
20  can include products               of a       first       type that are           intended      to
    be stored at a temperature in a first temperature interval,
    and     products       of    a   second         type       that       are   intended       to   be
    stored at        a  temperature           in    a   second         temperature        interval,
    characterised          in    that     use      is   made         of   two    or more      of   the

       the following step is implemented for step A:
      a   box  is   selected      on   the   basis     of    correspondence       between
      the mark or the colour and the desired temperature
                                                                                 interval

      step A,
      whereby     optionally step B can be              implemented      indirectly by
      selecting a       lid on the basis of correspondence between the
      mark or the colour of the lid and the mark or the colour

 15   the box.
      These     methods        have    the     advantage        that    they     can     be
      implemented        entirely       or    partially         by   people       without
      knowledge      of      the   desired      cooling       temperature       for    the
20   various      products,        and    that      the    risk    of   mistakes,        as
     discussed in detail above, is thereby very low.

   The     combination           1   shown       in     the      drawings          comprises        an
10 insulated box 2 and a lid 3 that fits on the insulated box
   2.
   The box 2 is double-walled and made of plastic. The space 4
   between the walls 5 is filled with an insulating foam.
15
   The   plastic        from which        the walls         5    are made         forms,     on    the
   top edge       of the box 2,            two    lips     6 with a widening               7,     that
   are somewhat elastic due to the nature of the plastic.
20 The outside of the box 2 is blue.
   The   lid    3   is     also double-walled             and     filled        with    foam.      Two
   cooling      elements         8   are     affixed      in     the     lid     3   against       the
   bottom     wall       9   of    the   lid,      i.e.      the    wall       that    is     turned
25 towards     the box 2           when     the   box 2       is   closed        by the       lid   3.
   The lid 3 is in the same shade of blue.
   The    lid     3    is    narrowed        on    its     underside           such    that       this
   narrowed part            10  fits    in    the box 2.          The      lid    3 is    provided
30 with two cutaways              11   on its      top at positions, corresponding
   to the lips 6 on the box 2.

       The   cooling         elements           8       are      designed        to    maintain          a
       temperature of approximately -230C.
   5  The   use     of    the      lid     3    and       the     box   2    is   simple     and      as
      follows.
      This   use     takes      place       at     a     location      where      many    different
      products     must      be packed,           for      example     to     be  transported         to
 10   an end user.
      These   products        are      to be      classified          on   the basis       of three
      different      types,       i.e.     a   first        type of product,           for example
      frozen    foodstuffs,             that     must        be   stored      at   a   temperature
 15   below   -10*C,       a   second        type       of product,          for    example      fresh
      meat or meat-products, that must be stored at a temperature
      between 0"C and 4"C, and a third type of product, for
      example     fresh        vegetables,               that      must      be     stored      at      a
      temperature of 10 0 C to 150C.

     The   blue      boxes       2     and    blue         lids     3  described        above       are
     present     at    the     location.           There        are   also      yellow    boxes      2,
     yellow lids        3,    green boxes             2   and green        lids    3.   Apart      from
     their    colour,        the       yellow      boxes        2   and    green      boxes    2    are
25   identical to the above-mentioned blue boxes 2.
     The yellow       lids      3    and    the      green      lids    3,    in   addition       to   a
     different       colour,          also     have         different       types      of   cooling
     elements 8 to the blue lids 3. More specifically, the green
30   lids 3 have cooling elements 8 that are designed to
     maintain      a    cooled         temperature             of    around      100C,     and      the

    WO 2014/111788                                                            PCT/IB2014/000025
                                                  10
     yellow lids 3 have cooling elements 8 that are designed to
     maintain a cooled temperature just above 0*C.
     The,   lids        3     are     cooled       in      an     industrial          freezing
  5  installation          or     cooling     installation          until        the   cooling
     elements 8 in the lids 3 are at the right temperature, i.e.
     have   been     cooled        to   a   temperature        that       enables     them      to
     optimally fulfil            their    cooling      function.        Normally a period
     in  a   cooling         or    freezing     installation            specified       by    the
 10  supplier      is     adhered       to   for     this     purpose,         whereby      this
    period is determined by the supplier on the basis of tests.
    Then the packing of the products is started. The lids 3 are
    hereby      made       ready      for    the     people       who      implement        this
15  process.
    Depending       on    the     circumstances,         and   the      expected     quantity
    of required lids 3, this can mean that they are ready in a
    cooling     or     freezing device,           or    that   they are         all  together
20  close    to    the     location       concerned.        An   intermediate         form     is
    also possible whereby               a partial        stock     stands       ready at      the
    location,          whereby        this     partial         stock          is    regularly
    supplemented from a cooling or freezing device.
25  A first     product        is   now taken.       If   this is        a product      of the
    first    type,       it    is    placed    in    a    blue    box      2.    If  it    is    a
    product of the second type, it is placed in a yellow box 2.
    If  it   is    a product         of   the   third      type,     it    is    placed    in    a
    green    box    2.    It    goes    without      saying     that,       instead     of    one
30  product, a number of products of the same type can also be

     placed       in     the       same     box     2   simultaneously           or    after        one
     another.
     In order to           facilitate        this,      information         signs    are present
  5  at the location that clearly indicate which type of product
    must be placed in which colour of box 2.
    Then     the      box    2    is    closed with a         lid      3,   whereby       only      the
    colour of the box 2 needs to be checked and a lid 3 of the
 10 same     colour has            to be taken.         Hereby the         colour of       the      lid
    3,  and as         a    result       the    temperature        for     which    the     cooling
    elements         8   are      designed,        is   selected,         indirectly       via     the
    colour of the box 2, on the basis of the type of product.
15  When       closing,          the     lips      6   of   the      box      spring      somewhat
    outwards, until the widenings 7 of these lips come into the
    cutaways        11    in    the    lid    3,    such that the          box 2 is       properly
    closed.
20  It  is      now    certain        that    the     closed    combination          1   of box         2
    and    lid      3   is     provided        with     cooling      elements        8   and     that
    these      cooling         elements       8    are   of  the      right     type.      This       is
    achieved in a very low number of operations.
25  The closed box 2, as shown in figure 4 for example, is now
    ready      for     shipping.          The    box    shown    in     figure     4   is    filled
    with sausages 12. The box 2 and lid 3 are yellow.
    The   sausages           12     are    hereby      kept  cool        because      the    bottom
30  wall     9   of    the . lid       3 does       not   form     a   significant         thermal
    barrier,        so that         the    cooling      elements       8   can   perform       their

        that heat. from outside the box 2 can only penetrate

        2 slowly.
   5   The box 2 and the lid 3 can be reused after the product
                                                                                    12
       has been delivered to the recipient, whereby the lid

       sufficient time, after which it is again ready for use.
 10    It   goes  without   saying    that    instead    of the   said    colours,
      other    colours   or other marks       can also be     used,   whereby      it
      also goes without saying that these marks are preferably

      clear as possible.
 15   The method can also be implemented in steps, in which
                                                                               in a
      first    step an employee with product knowledge places the
      products in the boxes 2 belonging to the product type,

      provides     the  boxes  2,   on   the   basis   of the   colour,    with      a
20    lid 3 with a corresponding colour.
     The     first    step   can    also    be    implemented     at   different
     locations,      whereby   only     products     of   a certain     type     are
     placed in the boxes 2 at each location, so that only

1. - Combination of a lid for an insulated box and a box on which
the lid fits, whereby the lid has a cooling element that forms part
of the lid, whereby this cooling element is filled with coolant that
is intended to be cooled or frozen in order to then perform a
cooling function, whereby the cooling element is a passive cooling
element that forms a permanent part of the lid, whereby the cooling
element is designed to perform its cooling function in a certain
temperature interval, whereby the lid is provided on its outside
with a mark or a colour that is an indication of the temperature
interval for which the cooling element is designed.
2. - The combination of claim 1, wherein the combination includes an
identification legend that links the specific mark or colour to a
specific temperature.
3. - The combination of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the material or
materials from which the lid is made is such that the coolant is not
visible.
4. - Combination (of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a mark is
affixed on the outside of the box that corresponds to the mark on
the lid or that the outside of the box is made in a colour that
corresponds to the outside of the lid.
5.- Two or more of the combination according to any one of claims 1
to 4, wherein a first type of lid of the lids has a cooling element
that is designed for a first temperature interval and a second type
of lid of the lids has a cooling element that is designed for a
second temperature interval.
6.- Two or more of the combination according to any one of claims 1
to 5, wherein a first type of lid of the lids has a cooling element
(that is designed for a first temperature interval and a second type
of lid of the lids has a cooling element (8) that is designed for a
second temperature interval and whereby the first type of lid and
the second type of lid have the same shape.
7.- Method for the cooled storage and/or transport of products,
whereby the products can include products of a first type that are
intended to be stored at a temperature in a first temperature
interval, and products of a second type that are intended to be
stored at a temperature in a second temperature interval,
characterised in that use is made of two or more of the combination
of claims 1 to 4, whereby the lids are stored at a suitable
temperature for sufficiently long in order to cool the cooling
elements sufficiently, whereby the following steps are completed for
each product to be stored: A: the product to be stored is placed in
a box, B: a lid is selected on the basis of correspondence between
the mark or the colour of the lid and the desired temperature
interval for the type of product, C: the selected lid is used to
close the box.

                                  15
8.- Method according to claim 7, wherein before step A the following
step is implemented: a box is selected on the basis of
correspondence between the mark or the colour of the box and the
desired temperature interval for the type of the product, whereby
this box is used in step A, whereby optionally step B can be
implemented indirectly by selecting a lid on the basis of
correspondence between the mark or the colour of the lid and the
mark or the colour of the box.
