ABSTRACT - Radio transmission based shark alert system
Step Three Pty Ltd
The disclosed Shark alert system uses shark buoy or other shark data
to warn swimmers, surfers or beach users of tagged or sighted sharks
entering the local vicinity - while they are in the water or nearby.
To complete this we have three key elements comprising the invention
as a whole:
Al. A cloud based data service that tracks shark buoy or other shark
data and then filters the feed by location. When a shark is detected
it signals the relevant radio base station at that specific beach.
A2.  A radio      base station   or network of radio       base stations       which
will   exist   at   each of the  beaches where sharks have been detected.
These consist       of internet   connectivity,      a simple operating      system
and a radio transmitter.        Once these have received an alert from the
cloud based data service they broadcast over radio to the local area
the existence of a shark in the area.
A3. A wristband or personal device consisting but not limited to
an alert     system and radio    receiver.      The radio receiver      only reacts
to the pre-programmed signal from the radio base station. Once this
signal is retrieved it triggers an alert made up but not limited to
- audio, visual and vibration signals. This informs the user that a
shark is in their immediate vicinity.

Description - Radio transmission based shark alert system
Step Three Pty Ltd
Sharks can be a general danger to                  the  public   and various     systems
have been put in place to improve safety of water and beach users.
The notification         systems previously          used have been limited       due to
not having direct          contact   with beach users          while in   the   water or
even while at the beach.            This invention notifies swimmers, surfers
or beach users the instant a tagged or sighted shark is reported at
their local beach.
The disclosed Shark alert system uses shark buoy or other shark data
to warn swimmers, surfers or beach users of tagged or sighted sharks
entering the local vicinity - while they are in the water or nearby.
To complete this we have three key elements comprising the invention
as a whole:
Al. A cloud based data service that tracks shark buoy or other shark
data and then filters the feed by location. When a shark is detected
it signals the relevant radio base station at that specific beach.
A2.  A radio        base station    or network of radio          base stations      which
will   exist     at   each of the   beaches where sharks have been detected.
These consist         of internet    connectivity,        a simple operating      system
and a radio transmitter.           Once these have received an alert from the
cloud based data service they broadcast over radio to the local area
the existence of a shark in that area.
A3. A wristband or personal device consisting but not limited to
an alert      system and radio      receiver.        The radio  receiver     only reacts
to the pre-programmed signal from the radio base station. Once this

Claims - Radio transmission based shark alert system
Step Three Pty Ltd
The claims defining the invention are as follows:
1. A cloud based data service that tracks shark buoy or other shark
data and then filters the feed by location. When a shark is detected
it signals the relevant radio base station as claimed in claim 2 at
that specific beach.
2.    A radio   base station         or network of radio        base stations          that
communicates to all nearby wristbands or other device as claimed in
claim 3 that       a shark is     in the   vicinity.     This consists        of but not
limited     to internet    connectivity,         a simple operating        system and a
radio transmitter.
3. A wristband or other          personal device comprising but not limited
to a radio receiver and an alert system - comprising but not limited
to    a audio, visual    and vibration        signal.   That alerts       a user  that      a
shark is in the vicinity.
4.     The communication system as a whole across                   those    claimed in
claims 1, 2 and 3 that allows beach or sea users to be alerted that
a shark is in their vicinity with a communication to the end user
via radio.
