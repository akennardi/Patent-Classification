  PRO-DRUGS OF NSAIAS WITH VERY HIGH SKIN AND MEMBRANES
         PENETRATION RATES AND THEIR NEW MEDICINAL USES
                                               Abstract
The novel positively charged pro-drugs of NSAIAs in the general formulas (1, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d)
"Structure 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d" were designed and synthesized. The compounds of the general
formulas (1, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d) "Structure 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d" indicated above can be prepared
from metal salts, organic base salts, or immobilized base salts of NSAIAs with suitable halide
compounds. The positively charged amino groups in the pro-drugs in this invention largely
increase the solubility of the drugs in water and will bond to the negative charge on the
phosphate head group of membrane. Thus, the local concentration of the outside of the
membrane or skin will be very high and will facilitate the passage of these pro-drugs from a
region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. This bonding will disturb the
membrane a little bit and may make some room for the lipophilic portion of the pro-drug. When
the molecules of membrane move, the membrane may "crack" a little bit due to the bonding of
the pro-drug. This will let the pro-drug insert into the membrane. At pH 7.4, only about 99% of
the amino group is protonated. When the amino group is not protonated, the bonding between
the amino group of the pro-drug and the phosphate head group of the membrane will
disassociate, and the pro-drug will enter the membrane completely. When the amino group of
the pro-drug flips to the other side of the membrane and thus becomes protonated, then the pro
drug is pulled into the cytosol, a semi- liquid concentrated aqueous solution or suspension.
These pro-drugs can be used for treating and preventing diabetes (type I or/and type II),
abnormal blood glucose and lipid levels, stroke, heart attack, and other heart and vascular
diseases, Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's diseases and other neurodegenerative diseases,
psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune
hepatitis, multiple sclerosis (MS), and other autoimmune diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), and other muscle disorders, inflamed
hemorrhoids, cryptitis, other inflammatory conditions of the anorectum, and pruritus ani,
prostatitis, prostatocystitis, varicose veins, autoimmune liver inflammation, autoimmune kidney
inflammation, vein inflammation and other inflammations, skin cancers, breast cancer, colon
rectum cancer, oral cancer, and other cancers, scars, abnormal vascular skin lesions, birthmarks,
moles (nevi), skin tags, aging spots (liver spots), and other skin disorders. These pro-drugs can
be administered transdermally without the help of skin penetration enhancers.

         Bakgroua.d Art
  [2]       NSALAs ar used for the relief of signs and symptoms of rheuatoid artuitis, os
         teoardritis and ankylosing spondylitis. NSAIAs are used alone or as an adjunct in the
         treatment of biliary colic, fever, and episiotomy pain. It is also used in treatment of
         gout, acute migraine headaches, and renal colic and in the trftment of postoperative
         inflammation in patients who have undergone cataract extaction. Aspirin is used for
         preventing heart and vascular dismase

                                             2
[3]   Unfortunately, a number of side effects are associated with the use of NSAIAs, most
    notably GI disturbances such as dyspepsia, gastroduodenal bleeding, gastric ul
    cerations, and gastritis. Fishman (Fishman; Robert, U.S. Pat. No. 7,052,715) indicated
    that an additional problem associated with oral medications, is that the concentration
    levels which must be achieved in the bloodstream must be significant in order to ef
    fectively treat distal areas of pain or inflammation. These levels are often much higher
    than would be necessary if it were possible to accurately target the particular site of
    pain or injury. Fishman and many others (Van Engelen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,416,772;
    Macrides et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,346,278; Kirby et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,444,234, Pearson
    et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,040, and Botknecht et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,597) have
    attempted to develop a delivery system for transdermal application by formulation.
    Song, et al. developed a transdermal drug delivery system for anti-inflammatory
    analgesic agent comprising of diclofenac diethylammonium salt (Song, et. al., US
    Patent No. 6,723,337). Donati, et al. developed a plaster for topical use containing
    heparin and diclofenac. (Donati, et al., US patent, NO. 6,592,891). Kawaji, et al.
    developed an oily patch for external use containing diclofenac sodium (Kawaji, et al.
    US Patent No. 6,262,121). Effing, et al. developed a device for the transdermal
    delivery of diclofenac (Effing, et al. US Patent No. 6,193,996). It is very difficult,
    however, to deliver therapeutically effective plasma levels of NSAIAs into the host by
    formulation. Susan Milosovich, et. al. designed and prepared testosteronyl
    4-dimethylaminobutyrate.HC1 (TSBH), which has a lipophilic portion and a tertiary
    amine groups that exists in the protonated form at physiological pH. They found that
    the prodrug (TSBH) diffuses through human skin -60 times faster than does the drug
    (TS) itself [Susan Milosovich, et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 82, 227(1993).
    Disclosure of Invention
    Technical Problem
[4]   Some NSAIAs have been used medicinally for more than 100 years. NSAIAs are
    indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and os
    teoarthritis, the relief of mild to moderate pain, the reduction of fever, and the
    treatment of dysmenorrhea. They are the most widely used drugs in the world.
[5]   Unfortunately, a number of side effects are associated with the use of NSAIAs, most
    notably GI disturbances such as dyspepsia, heartburn, vomiting, gastroduodenal
    bleeding, gastric ulcerations, and gastritis. Gastroduodenal bleeding induced by
    NSAIAs is generally painless but can lead to fecal blood loss and may cause a
    persistent iron deficiency anemia.
[6]   Transdermal delivery systems help to avoid directly hurting the gastro-intestinal tract
    and inactivation of the drugs caused by the " first pass metabolism" in the gastro-

                                             3
    intestinal tract and liver. Traditional transdermal drug delivery by using skin
    penetration enhancer has limits. First, the penetration rates are very low (in [tg/cm 2/h
    scale). Second, large amounts of enhancer will enter the host body that may cause very
    serious side effects. .
    Technical Solution
[7]   Transdermal delivery systems help to avoid directly hurting the gastro-intestinal tract
    and inactivation of the drugs caused by the " first pass metabolism "in the gastro
    intestinal tract and liver. Traditional transdermal drug delivery by using skin
    penetration enhancers has limits. First, the penetration rates are very low (in [tg/in2/h
    scale). Second, large amounts of enhancer will enter the host body and may cause extra
    side effects. Third, in traditional transdermal drug delivery by using skin penetration
    enhancers, the high concentrated enhancers in the formulation may help the drug cross
    the skin, but when the enhancers and drug enter the skin, the concentration of
    enhancers will be diluted greatly and they cannot provide any more help for drug
    molecule to cross more biologic membranes, and then the drug molecule will be ac
    cumulated in the fat layer under the skin and the accumulated drugs may cause very
    serious and even fatal side effects.
[8]   Biological availability of a drug is the measurement of the relative amount of ad
    ministered drug that reaches the general circulation. However, the general circulation
    is not the "'site of action" for most of drugs. Even if the drug molecules have reached
    the general circulation, they must cross more biologic membranes, which may be less
    permeable than the gastrointestinal membranes, and interact with intercellular and in
    tracellular fluids before reaching the elusive region called the "site of action"; thus
    most drugs will be metabolized by intestinal mucosa, liver, blood, kidneys, and lungs
    before they reach the "site of action." The situation not only produces very low phar
    macological effect, but also causes toxic burden on intestinal mucosa, blood, liver,
    kidneys, and lungs. If we can increase various membranes penetration rates of drugs,
    the pharmacological effect and the clinical response of drugs will be increased greatly,
    then a smaller drug dosage will be needed and fewer side effects will be caused. The
    transdermal pro-drug delivery for the pro-drugs with very high skin and membranes
    penetration rates will be very useful not only for local diseases, but also for systemic
    diseases. Because these prodrugs have tens or hundreds of times more potency than the
    parent drugs, only a few tenths or hundredths of the normal drug dosage is needed and
    much less side effects will be caused. This will benefit not only transdermal drug
    delivery, but also to any other drug delivery systems (such as oral, subcutaneous, in
    travenous, inhalation, and nasal).
[9]   We found that drugs that have a lipophilic portion and a primary, secondary, or
    tertiary amine group (preferably tertiary amine groups) that exists in the protonated

                                             4
     form (hydrophilic portion) at physiological pH can penetrate skin, scar, blood-brain,
     and blood-milk barriers in very high rates (in mg/cm2 /h scale). The principles for
     designing these prodrugs of NSAIAs are:
[10] 1.        The prodrug must have a lipophilic portion and a primary, secondary, or
               tertiary amine group (preferably tertiary amine groups) that exists in the
               protonated form (hydrophilic portion) at physiological pH.
     2.        Every prodrug of NSAIAs should have only one or two (preferably one)
               primary, secondary, or tertiary amine groups that exist in the protonated form
               (hydrophilic portion) at physiological pH.
     3.        The main role of the primary, secondary, or tertiary amine group is to help the
               drug pass through the skin, scars, membrane, blood-brain, blood-milk, and
               other barriers. The primary, secondary, or tertiary amine group can be any
               structure that is non-toxic and does not interfere the parent drugs' biologic
               activities.

[12]    We found that the role of the primary, secondary, or tertiary amine group is only to
     help the drug pass through the skin, membrane, blood-brain, blood-milk, and other
     barriers, so the primary, secondary, or tertiary amine group can be any kind of
     structures which are non-toxic and do not interfere the parent drugs' biologic activities.
     So we designed and prepared different kinds of amines groups for this property. The
     new pro-drugs of NSAIAs have the general formulas (2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d) "Structure 2a,
     2b, 2c, or 2d"

[13]   Drug absorption, whether from the gastrointestinal tract or other sites, requires the
     passage of the drug in a molecular form across the barrier membrane. The drug must
     first dissolve, and if the drug possesses the desirable biopharmaceutical properties, it
     will pass from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across
     the membrane into the blood or general circulation. All biological membranes contain
     lipids as major constituents. The molecules that play the dominant roles in membrane
     formation all have phosphate-containing highly polar head groups, and, in most cases,
     two highly hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails. Membranes are bilayers, with the hy
     drophilic head groups facing outward into the aqueous regions on either side. Very hy
     drophilic drugs cannot pass the hydrophobic layer of membrane and very hydrophobic
     drugs will stay in the hydrophobic layer as part of the membrane due to their sim
     ilarities and cannot enter the cytosol on the inside efficiently.
[14]   One goal of this invention is to avoid the side effects of NSAIAs by increasing the
     solubility of NSAIAs in gastric juice which will make it administrable orally and the
     penetration rate of NSAIAs through the membranes and skin barrier which will make it
     administrable transdermally (topical application). The most important goal of this
     invention is to design pro-drugs of NSAIAs that can penetrate the skin, cell membrane,
     especially the brain cell and nerve cell membranes, very effectively and stay the
     general circulation much shorter, thus they will have tens or hundreds of times more
     potency than the parent drugs, only a few tenths or hundredths of the normal drug
     dosage is needed and much less side effects will be caused. This will benefit not only
     transdermal drug delivery, but also any other drug delivery systems (such as oral, sub
     cutaneous, intravenous, inhalation, and nasal) and can treat many conditions that
     cannot be treated by their parent drugs. These novel pro-drugs of NSAIAs have two

                                            19
     structural features in common: they have a lipophilic portion and a primary, secondary,
     or tertiary amine group that exists in the protonated form (hydrophilic part) at phys
     iological pH. Such a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance is required for efficient passage
     through the membrane barrier [Susan Milosovich, et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 82, 227(1993)].
     The positively charged amino groups largely increase the solubility of the drugs in
     water. The positive charge on the amino groups of these pro-drugs will bond to the
     negative charge on the phosphate head group of membrane. Thus, the local con
     centration of the outside of the membrane or skin will be very high and will facilitate
     the passage of these pro-drugs from a region of high concentration to a region of low
     concentration. This bonding will disturb the membrane a little bit and may make some
     room for the lipophilic portion of the pro-drug. When the molecules of the membrane
     move, the membrane may "crack" a little bit due to the bonding of the pro-drug. This
     will let the pro-drug insert into the membrane. At pH 7.4, only about 99% of the amino
     group is protonated. When the amino group is not protonated, the bonding between the
     amino group of the prodrug and the phosphate head group of the membrane will dis
     associate, and the pro-drug will enter the membrane completely. When the amino
     group of the pro-drug flips to the other side of the membrane and thus becomes
     protonated, then the pro-drug is pulled into the cytosol, a semi-liquid concentrated
     aqueous solution or suspension. Due to the short stay in GI tract, the pro-drugs will not
     cause gastric mucosal cell damage. The penetration rates of the novel pro-drugs
     through human skin were measured in vitro by using modified Franz cells, which were
     isolated from human skin tissue (360-400 pm thick) of the anterior and posterior thigh
     areas. The receiving fluid consisted of 10 ml of 2% bovine serum albumin in normal
     saline and was stirred at 600 rpm. The cumulative amounts of pro-drugs and drugs
     entering the skin versus time were determined by a specific high-performance liquid
     chromatography method. Apparent flux values of the pro-drugs of NSAIAs are 0.1-50
     mg/cm2/h . The results suggest that the pro-drug diffuses through human skin at least a
     hundred times faster than do their parent drugs. The results suggest that the positive
     charge on the dialkyaminoethyl group has a very important role in the passage of the
     drug across the membrane and skin barrier.
[15]   The novel prodrugs of NSAIAs can penetrate the skin barrier, blood-brain barrier,
     and blood-milk barrier. The in vivo rates of penetration of pro-drugs and their parent
     drugs through the skin of intact rats were compared. The donor consisted of 20% pro
                                                                            2
     drugs or their parent drugs in 1 ml of ethanol applied to about 5cm area on the backs

     1 ml of blood, 1 g of liver, 1 g of kidney, or 1g of brain (liver, kidney or brain was
     washed with pH 7.2 buffer for three times) and the mixtures were homogenized. The
     samples were then centrifuged for 5 min and analyzed using HPLC. The results are

     blood-brain barrier, and other membrane barriers at a very high rate, but the parent
     NSAIAs cannot penetrate the skin barrier in a detectable amount.
[22]   The pro-drugs of the general formula (1) "Structure 1" have demonstrated anti
     inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic activity in our patents
     (international application Nos: PCT/IB2006/052732, PCT/IB2006/052318, PCT/
     IB2006/052815, PCT/IB2006/052563, PCT/IB2006/052575, PCT/IB2006/053741,
     PCT/IB2006/053091, PCT/IB2006/053090, PCT/IB2006/052549). We found that the
     pro-drugs of the general formula (2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d) "Structure 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d", have
     demonstrated anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic activity. The
     main focuses of this invention are the new medicinal uses of the pro-drugs of NSAIAs.
[23]   The relationship between inflammation and cancer is well known. Dr. Thea D. Tlsty
     described in his speech (Keystone Symposia: Inflammation and Cancer, Breckenridge,
     Colorado, USA, Feb. 27-March 3, 2005) that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) stimulates
     aromatase activity, angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and prostaglandin synthesis.
     The increase in prostaglandins leads to an inhibition of apoptosis. Aspirin and other

                                            22
     NSAIAs inhibit COX-1 and COX-2. The overall relative risk of colorectal cancer, oe
     sophageal cancer, ovarian cancer or other cancers is reduced in people taking long term
     aspirin. However, cancer cells may change their membrane structure to keep the
     NSAIAs from entering the cancer cells. The novel pro-drugs in this invention can pen
     etrate any membrane barriers and can be applied topically to the outside skin area of
     the location of the cancer and large amounts of the pro-drugs will enter the cancer cells
     with very little systemic exposure.
[24]    For evaluation of anti-tumor activity of the pro-drugs of NSAIAs, human breast
     cancer cells (BCAP-37, 2-3 mm 3 of tumor tissue was used in each mouse) were subcu
     taneously xenografted into nude mice (BALB, 12 groups, 7 mice each group). After 14

[30]   The results show that the pro-drugs of NSAIAs have very strong anti-tumor activity
     and have none or very little side effects.
[31]   The hypoglycemic effect of salicylates was first observed over 100 years ago by
     German physicians (Edmund J. Hengesh, Principles of medicinal chemistry, 4th ed., pg
     591, Williams & Wilkins, 1995). Salicylates enhance glucose-stimulated insulin
     secretion and inhibits glucogenesis from lactate and alanine (H. F. Woods, et al., Clin.
     Exp. Pharmacol Physiol., 1, 534(1974). Certain salicylates decrease plasma levels of
     free fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Because elevated levels of plasma-free
     fatty acids inhibit glucose utilization, a decrease in their concentration could contribute
     to the hypoglycemic action. Unfortunately, the large doses (5g daily) of salicylates are
     necessary to maintain adequate control of blood sugar levels and blood lipid levels. At
     these dosage levels, numerous side effects, such as gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting,
     and tinnitus, occur frequently. The novel pro-drugs in this invention have very high
     skin and membrane penetration rates. They can reach the "site of action" very fast and
     the pharmacologic effect and the clinical response of these pro-drugs are increased
     greatly, then much smaller (only hundredths to tenths of the parent drug dosage
     needed) drug dosage will be needed and much less side effects will be caused.
[32]   The pro-drugs in this invention lower blood glucose levels in rat models (SLAC/GK,
     type 2 diabetes, n=7). 50% acetone solution of diethylaminoethyl acetyl

     was shaved ) once per day (at 8 am) for 5 weeks. The blood glucose levels were

                                            25
     measured once every 3 days at 4pm (no fasting) from the second week to the fifth

        The results showed that the pro-drug s of NSAIAs lowered blood glucose levels in
     diabetes rat models very effectively and did not affect the blood glucose levels of
     normal rats. The most interesting thing is that the blood glucose levels of the rats still
     stayed at normal levels (7-8 mmol/L, no fasting) after the treatment was stopped for 30
     days. This means that the pro-drugs not only control blood glucose levels, but also may
     cure diabetes.

[36]    The pH of stomach juice is 1-3. The negative charge on the phosphate head group of
     membrane is neutralized by the proton and the positive charge on the amino groups of
     these pro-drugs cannot bond to the phosphate head group of membranes, then the pro
     drugs cannot pass through the wall of the stomach and will not hurt or upset the
     stomach. The pH of the duodenum is about 5-7 and the pro-drugs can pass through the
     mucosa of duodenum. The pancreas is nearby and large amount of the pro-drugs will
     enter there before going to the liver, kidneys, and the general circulation where the
     drug will be metabolized, so only very low dose of these pro-drugs are needed and
     very few and low side effects will be caused. The 20% acetone solution of diethy

     The results showed that the pro-drugs of NSAIAs lowered blood glucose levels in
     diabetic (type I) mouse models very effectively.
[41]    Eighteen Chinese White rabbits weighing between 3.0 and 3.5 kg (aged 6-7 months)
     were selected and divided into three groups (control, P-1 and P-10 groups, n=6). One
     hour before the experiment, thrombi were made by aspirating venous blood (1 ml) into
     a sterilized bottle to clot. To avoid fragmentation and slow lysis, the autologous blood
     clots were stabilized in temperature-controlled (70 C ) distilled water for 10 min. After
     anesthesia, the femoral veins were exposed and distally isolated, and autologous blood
     clots (0.05 g/kg) were injected through an indwelling catheter (20GA), which had been
     placed in the femoral vein isolated earlier. 50% acetone solution of diethylaminoethyl
     acetylsalicylate.acetylsalicylic acid salt (P-1, in acetone, 15 mg/kg ) and diethy
     laminoethyl acetylsalicylsalicylate.acetylsalicylsalicylic acid salt (P-59, 15 mg/kg)
     were topically applied to the back of the rabbits . After 2 days, rabbits were euthanized
     with an excessive intravenous injection of sodium amobarbital (60 mg/kg). The lungs
     and hearts were isolated to observe whether thrombi were present in the pulmonary
     arteries. The lungs were immersed in 10% formalin for 24 h. Consecutive transverse
     sections along the obstructed pulmonary arteries were paraffin-embedded and stained
     with hematoxylin-eosine. In the control group, platelet thrombus and mixed thrombus
     surrounded the infused clots, which were present in large-sized vessels as well and
     stretched the vessel walls in both proximal and distal directions. There was excessive
     proliferation of endothelial cells and fibrocytes in these vessels. Additionally, there
     was acute pulmonary congestion. In the P-1 and P-59 groups, both lung tissue and
     vascular walls were normal. The results showed that thrombotic activity and that em
     bolization-associated thrombus propagation can be prevented by these pro-drugs of
     NSAIAs. These pro-drugs can be very useful for preventing and treating blood clots--a
     major cause of strokes, heart attacks and organ transplant rejection.
[42]    The pro-drugs in this invention can help heal wounds and soften and shrink scars

                                             30
     from cuts and bums in rabbit models. The average scar area of the pro-drugs treated
     rabbits is only a third of that of the control rabbits from same size cut wounds in the
     Chinese white rabbit model and the scars are as soft as normal unscarred tissues..
[43]   COX-1 and COX-2 play a very important role in animal immune-responses. NSAIAs
     inhibite COX-1 and COX-2. The pro-drugs of NSAIAs in this invention may be very
     useful for treating psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus , systemic lupus ery
     thematosus (SLE) , and other autoimmune diseases . Heavy suspensions of Malassezia
     [Rosenberg, E.W., et al., Mycopathologia, 72, 147-154 (1980)] were applied to the
     shaved skin on the backs of the Chinese white rabbits (n=4 x 6) twice (at 7 am and
     7pm) per day for 2 weeks , lesions similar to psoriasis resulted. Then a 5% aqueous
     solution of 3-piperidinemethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (P-5), diethy
     laminoethyl 1-methyl-5-(4-methylbenzoyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-acetate.AcOH (P-13), diethy
     laminoethyl 5-(4-Chlorobenzoyl)-1,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-2-acetate.AcOH (P-14), di
     ethylaminoethyl 1,8-diethyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydropyrano-[3,4-b]indole-1-acetate.AcOH
     (P-15), diethylaminoethyl 2-amino-3-(4-bromo-benzoyl)benzeneacetate.AcOH (P-17)
     diethylaminoethyl 3-chloro-4-(2-propenyloxy)benzeneacetate.AcOH (P-18), diethy
     laminoethyl
     1-(4-chlorobenzoyl-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indole-3-acetoxyacetate.AcOH (P-20),
     diethylaminoethyl 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-phenyl-5-thiazoleacetate.AcOH (P-21), di
     ethylaminoethyl 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-acetate.AcOH (P-22)
     were applied to the same areas 3 hours (10 am and 10 pm) after the application of
     heavy suspensions of Malassezia (7am and 7pm). 10 days after the application of these
     pro-drugs, the lesions were resolved. but the condition of the control mice were getting
     worse.
[44]   For evaluation of anti-lupus erythematosus activity, 5% diethylaminoethyl acetyl
     salicylate.acetylsalicylic acid salt (P-1, in acetone, 30 mg/kg) or 3-piperidinemethyl
     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (P-5, in water, 30 mg/kg) were topically
     applied to the skin on the backs of mice (MRL/LPR, n=5 x 3) with discoid lupus ery
     thematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus twice per day. After 6 weeks, all skin
     lesions and lupus nephritis were resolved in the pro-drug treated mice , but the
     condition of the control mice were getting worse.
[45]   These results suggest that these pro-drugs of NSAIAs are very promising agents for
     the treatment of psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus
     (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and other autoimmune diseases in human.
[46]   The pathogenesis of cell death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may involve
     glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. Cyclooxygenase
     2, present in spinal neurons and astrocytes, catalyzes the synthesis of prostaglandin E2.
     Prostaglandin E2 stimulates glutamate release from astrocytes, whereas cy-

                                            31
     clooxygenase-2 also plays a key role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
     reactive oxygen species, and free radicals. Treatment with a selective cyclooxygenase
     2 inhibitor, celecoxib, markedly inhibited production of prostaglandin E2 in the spinal
     cords of ALS mice. Celecoxib treatment significantly delayed the onset of weakness
     and weight loss and prolonged survival by 25%. Spinal cords of treated ALS mice
     showed significant preservation of spinal neurons and diminished astrogliosis and
     microglial activation (Merit. E. Cudkowicz , et al., Annals of neurology, 52, 771-778,
     2002). These results suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition may benefit ALS
     patients. The pro-drugs of NSAIAs in this invention can penetrate skin and nerve cell
     membrane barriers in very high rates (most NSAIAs cannot penetrate nerve cells ef
     fectively) and can be administered transdermally without hurting the GI tract, so these
     pro-drug are very promising agents for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS),
     Crohn's disease, and other autoimmune diseases , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
     , oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy ( OPMD), myotonic dystrophy ( MD),
     Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) , polymyositis ( PM), dermatomyositis ( DM),
     inclusion body myositis ( IBM), and other muscle disorders .
[47]   Inflammatory mechanisms have been proposed as important mediators in the
     pathogenetic cascade of Alzheimer's disease (McGeer PL, McGeer EG. The in
     flammatory response system of brain implications for the therapy of Alzheimer and
     other neurodegenerative diseases. Brain Res. Rev., 1995; 21: 195-218). In the study by
     in't Veld et al. (the New England Journal of Medicine, 2001; 345, 1515), they followed
     almost 7000 person at risk of Alzheimer's disease for nearly seven years. Their results
     suggested that NSAIAs can reduce the relative risk for those whose cumulative use of
     NSAIAs was at least two years and two or more years before the onset of dementia. If
     the neuroprotective capacity of NSAIAs ceases in the years just before the onset of
     dementia, then these compounds would offer no protection against progression among
     most persons with the prodromal stage of diseases. We believe that the reason for this
     is that the tissues around the damaged nerve cells will form scars to protect the nerve
     cells from damaging farther. Most of NSAIAs have very low brain-blood and nerve
     cell barriers penetration rate and cannot penetrate the scar barrier. These pro-drugs in
     this invention have very high skin, blood-brain, nerve cell membrane, and scar barriers
     penetration rates and are very promising agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's
     disease, Parkinson's diseases, and other progressive neurodegenerative diseases.
[48]   These pro-drugs may help the patients with a spinal cord injury in which the healing
     is stopped by the protected scars around the injured spinal cord. Most NSAIAs cannot
     penetrate the scar barrier in a therapeutic effective amount , but the pro-drugs in this
     invention can penetrate the scar barrier, have anti-inflammatory activity, and can help
     wound healing.

                                             32
[49]   NSAIAs are not very effective for treatment of the conditions described above or
     have serious side effects because they cannot penetrate the cell membrane, especially
     the brain cells and nerve cells, very effectively and stay the general circulation too
     long, thus most of drugs will be metabolized by intestinal mucosa, liver, kidney, and
     lung before they reach the "site of action." This situation not only produces very low
     pharmacologic effect, but also causes toxic burden on intestinal mucosa, liver, kidneys,
     lungs, and other parts of the body. These pro-drugs in this invention penetrate skin,
     brain-blood, brain cells, nerve cells and other membranes barriers very well and they
     have hundreds of times more potency than the parent drugs, only a few tenths or
     hundredths of the normal drug dosage is needed and much less side effects will be
     caused. This will benefit not only transdermal drug delivery, but also any other drug
     delivery system (such as oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, inhalation, and nasal) and
     can treat many conditions better than they can be treated by their respective parent
     drugs and even some conditions which cannot be treated by their respective parent
     drugs.
[50]   The compounds of the general formula (1, 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d) "Structure 1, 2a, 2b, 2c,
     or 2d" indicated above can be prepared from NSAIAs, by reaction with
     N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N, N'-Diisopropylcarbodiimide or other coupling
     reagents to form anhydrides, then react with suitable alcohols, thiols, or amines.

[52]   Transdermal therapeutic application systems of a compound of the general formula

     2c, or 2d" as an active ingredient, can be used for treating any NSAIAs-treatable
     conditions and any conditions described in this invention in humans or animals. These
     systems can be a bandage or a patch comprising of one active substance-containing
     matrix layer and an impermeable backing layer. The most preferable system is an
     active substance reservoir, which has a permeable bottom facing the skin. By
     controlling the rate of release, this system enables NSAIAs to reach constantly optimal
     therapeutic blood levels to increase effectiveness and reduce the side effects of
     NSAIAs. These systems can be worn on the wrist, ankle, arm, leg, or any part of body.
     Advantageous Effects
[53]   NSAIAs are not very effective for treatment of the conditions described in this
     invention or have serious side effects because they cannot penetrate the cell membrane,
     especially the brain cells and nerve cells, very effectively and stay in the general
     circulation too long, thus most of drugs will be metabolized by intestinal mucosa, liver,

                                                 33
        kidneys, and lungs before they reach the "site of action." This situation not only
        produces very low pharmacologic effect, but also causes toxic burden on intestinal
        mucosa, liver, kidneys, lungs and any other parts of the body. These pro-drugs in this
        invention penetrate skin, brain-blood, brain cells, nerve cells, scars and other
        membranes barriers very well, and they have hundreds of times more potency than the
        parent drugs, only a few tenths or hundredths of the normal drug dosage is needed and
        much less side effects will be caused. This will benefit not only transdermal drug
        delivery, but also any other drug delivery system (such as oral, subcutaneous, in
        travenous, inhalation, and nasal) and can treat many conditions that cannot be treated
        by their parent drugs. These pro-drugs can be administered not only transdermally, but
        also orally (they will not hurt stomach because they cannot penetrate the wall of the
        stomach) for any type of medical treatment and should avoid most of the side effects of
        NSAIAs, most notably GI disturbances such as dyspepsia, gastroduodenal bleeding,
        gastric ulcerations, and gastritis. Another great benefit of transdermal administration of
        these pro-drugs is that administering medication, especially to children, will be much
        easier.
