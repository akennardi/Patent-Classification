                     METHODS FOR REDUCING CD36 EXPRESSION
         [0001]      The application asserts priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.
60/718,170 filed on September 16, 2005. The specification of U.S. Provisional Application
Serial No. 60/718,170 is hereby incorporated by reference.
         [0002]      The invention described in this application was funded by the National
Institute of Drug Abuse, Grant No. P01 DA08924, the National Institute of Neurological
Diseases and Stroke, Grant No. R21 NS48295, and the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, Grant No. RO 1 HL0825 11. The United States Government has certain rights in this
invention.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         [0003]      CD36 is a transmembrane protein of the class B scavenger receptor family.
The protein is widely expressed on numerous cells, such as microvascular endothelium,
macrophages, platelets, adipocytes, epithelial cells (e.g., intestinal epithelial and renal tubular
cells, etc.), pancreatic islet cells and cardiac muscle. The receptor may interact with multiple
extracellular ligands, such as thrombospondin-1, long-chain fatty acids, and oxidized low
density lipoprotein.
         [0004]      Abnormal expression of CD36 has been implicated in a wide variety of
diseases and conditions. For example, mice lacking CD36 have less atherosclerotic lesions
when fed a Western diet compared to wild-type mice. Further, CD36 knock out mice were
reported to be protected against acute cerebral ischemia.
         [0005]      Therefore, methods for reducing expression of CD36 expression are
beneficial for treating a disease or condition characterized by abnormal expression of CD36.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Peptides
        [0030]      The invention is directed to the reduction of CD36 expression by certain
aromatic-cationic peptides. The aromatic-cationic peptides are water-soluble and highly
polar. Despite these properties, the peptides can readily penetrate cell membranes.
        [0031]      The aromatic-cationic peptides useful in the present invention include a
minimum of three amino acids, and preferably include a minimum of four amino acids,
covalently joined by peptide bonds.
        [0032]      The maximum number of amino acids present in the aromatic-cationic
peptides of the present invention is about twenty amino acids covalently joined by peptide
bonds. Preferably, the maximum number of amino acids is about twelve, more preferably
about nine, and most preferably about six. Optimally, the number of amino acids present in
the peptides is four.
        [0033]      The amino acids of the aromatic-cationic peptides useful in the present
invention can be any amino acid. As used herein, the term "amino acid" is used to refer to
any organic molecule that contains at least one amino group and at least one carboxyl group.
Preferably, at least one amino group is at the a position relative to a carboxyl group.
        [0034]      The amino acids may be naturally occurring. Naturally occurring amino
acids include, for example, the twenty most common levorotatory (L)amino acids normally
found in mammalian proteins, i.e., alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg), asparagine (Asn), aspartic
acid (Asp), cysteine (Cys), glutamine (Gln), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), histidine
                                                5

(His), isoleucine (Ileu), leucine (Leu), lysine (Lys), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe),
praline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), tryptophan, (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), and valine
(Val).
         [0035]     Other naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, amino acids
that are synthesized in metabolic processes not associated with protein synthesis. For
example, the amino acids ornithine and citrulline are synthesized in mammalian metabolism
during the production of urea. Another example of a naturally occurring amino acid include
hydroxyproline (Hyp).
         [0036]     The peptides useful in the present invention optionally contain one or more
non-naturally occurring amino acids. Optimally, the peptide has no amino acids that are
naturally occurring. The non-naturally occurring amino acids may be levorotary (L-),
dextrorotatory (D-), or mixtures thereof.
         [0037]     Non-naturally occurring amino acids are those amino acids that typically
are not synthesized in normal metabolic processes in living organisms, and do not naturally
occur in proteins. In addition, the non-naturally occurring amino acids useful in the present
invention preferably are also not recognized by common proteases.
         [0038]     The non-naturally occurring amino acid can be present at any position in
the peptide. For example, the non-naturally occurring amino acid can be at the N-terminus,
the C-terminus, or at any position between the N-terminus and the C-terminus.
         [0039]     The non-natural amino acids may, for example, comprise alkyl, aryl, or
alkylaryl groups not found in natural amino acids. Some examples of non-natural alkyl
amino acids include a-aminobutyric acid,     p-aminobutyric  acid, y-aminobutyric acid, S
aninovaleric acid, and c-aminocaproic acid. Some examples of non-natural aryl amino acids
include ortho-, meta, and para-aminobenzoic acid. Some examples of non-natural alkylaryl
amino acids include ortho-, meta-, and para-aminophenylacetic acid, and 7-phenyl-p
aminobutyric acid.
         [0040]     Non-naturally occurring amino acids include derivatives of naturally
occurring amino acids. The derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids may, for example,
include the addition of one or more chemical groups to the naturally occurring amino acid.
                                                 6

        [0041]        For example, one or more chemical groups can be added to one or more of
the 2', 3', 4', 5', or 6' position of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue, or
the 4', 5', 6', or 7' position of the benzo ring of a tryptophan residue. The group can be any
chemical group that can be added to an aromatic ring. Some examples of such groups
include branched or unbranched C1-C 4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl,
butyl, isobutyl, or t-butyl, CI-C 4 alkyloxy (i.e., alkoxy), amino, C1 -C4 alkylamino and C1 -C 4
dialkylamino (e.g., methylamino, dimethylamino), nitro, hydroxyl, halo (i.e., fluoro, chloro,
bromo, or iodo). Some specific examples of non-naturally occurring derivatives of naturally
occurring amino acids include norvaline (Nva) and norleucine (Nle).
        [0042]        Another example of a modification of an amino acid in a peptide useful in
the methods of the present invention is the derivatization of a carboxyl group of an aspartic
acid or a glutamic acid residue of the peptide. One example of derivatization is amidation
with ammonia or with a primary or secondary amine, e.g. methylamine, ethylamine,
dimethylamine or diethylamine. Another example of derivatization includes esterification
with, for example, methyl or ethyl alcohol.
        [0043]        Another such modification includes derivatization of an amino group of a
lysine, arginine, or histidine residue. For example, such amino groups can be acylated. Some
suitable acyl groups include, for example, a benzoyl group or an alkanoyl group comprising
any of the C1-C 4 alkyl groups mentioned above, such as an acetyl or propionyl group.
        [0044]        The non-naturally occurring amino acids are preferably resistant, and more
preferably insensitive, to common proteases. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino
acids that are resistant or insensitive to proteases include the dextrorotatory (D-) form of any
of the above-mentioned naturally occurring L-amino acids, as well as L- and/or D- non
naturally occurring amino acids. The D-amino acids do not normally occur in proteins,
although they are found in certain peptide antibiotics that are synthesized by means other than
the normal ribosomal protein synthetic machinery of the cell. As used herein, the D-amino
acids are considered to be non-naturally occurring amino acids.
        [0045]        In order to minimize protease sensitivity, the peptides useful in the
methods of the invention should have less than five, preferably less than four, more
preferably less than three, and most preferably, less than two contiguous L-amino acids
                                                   7

  recognized by common proteases, irrespective of whether the amino acids are naturally or
  non-naturally occurring. Optimally, the peptide has only D-amino acids, and no L-amino
  acids.
           [0046]     If the peptide contains protease sensitive sequences of amino acids, at least
  one of the amino acids is preferably a non-naturally-occurring D-amino acid, thereby
 conferring protease resistance. An example of a protease sensitive sequence includes two or
 more contiguous basic amino acids that are readily cleaved by common proteases, such as
 endopeptidases and trypsin. Examples of basic amino acids include arginine, lysine and
 histidine.
          [0047]     It is important that the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum number
 of net positive charges at physiological pH in comparison to the total number of amino acid
 residues in the peptide. The minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH
 will be referred to below as (pm). The total number of amino acid residues in the peptide will
 be referred to below as (r).
          [0048]     The minimum number of net positive charges discussed below are all at
physiological pH. The term "physiological pH" as used herein refers to the normal pH in the
cells of the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. For instance, the physiological pH of
a human is normally approximately 7.4, but normal physiological pH in mammals may be
any pH from about 7.0 to about 7.8.
         [0049]      "Net charge" as used herein refers to the balance of the number of positive
charges and the number of negative charges carried by the amino acids present in the peptide.
In this specification, it is understood that net charges are measured at physiological pH. The
naturally occurring amino acids that are positively charged at physiological pH include L
lysine, L-arginine, and L-histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids that are negatively
charged at physiological pH include L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid.
         [0050]      Typically, a peptide has a positively charged N-terminal amino group and
a negatively charged C-terminal carboxyl group. The charges cancel each other out at
physiological pH.
                                                  8

          [0051]      As an example of calculating net charge, the peptide Tyr-Arg-Phe-Lys
 Glu-His-Trp-Arg has one negatively charged amino acid (i.e., Glu) and four positively
 charged amino acids (i.e., two Arg residues, one Lys, and one His). Therefore, the above
 peptide has a net positive charge of three.
          [0052]      In one embodiment of the present invention, the aromatic-cationic peptides
have a relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH
 (pm) and the total number of amino acid residues (r) wherein 3 pm is the largest number that is
 less than or equal to r + 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the minimum
number of net positive charges (pm) and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as
follows:
  (r)    3   4   5 6     7   8 9     10  11   12   13  14    15   16   17   18   19   20
 (Pm)    1   1 2     2    2  3   3    3  4     4   4    5     5    5   6    6    6     7
          [0053]     In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship
between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total number of amino
acid residues (r) wherein 2 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1. In this
embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and
the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:
  (r)    3   4   5 6     7   8   9   10  11   12   13  14    15   16  17    18   19 20
 (Pm)    2   2   3  3    4   4   5   5   6    6    7    7    8    8    9    9   10    10
          [0054]     In one embodiment, the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and
the total number of amino acid residues (r) are equal. In another embodiment, the peptides
have three or four amino acid residues and a minimum of one net positive charge, preferably,
                                                 9

 a minimum of two net positive charges and more preferably a minimum of three net positive
 charges.
          [0055]      It is also important that the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum
 number of aromatic groups in comparison to the total number of net positive charges (pt).
 The minimum number of aromatic groups will be referred to below as (a).
          [0056]      Naturally occurring amino acids that have an aromatic group include the
 amino acids histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. For example, the hexapeptide
 Lys-Gln-Tyr-Arg-Phe-Trp has a net positive charge of two (contributed by the lysine and
 arginine residues) and three aromatic groups (contributed by tyrosine, phenylalanine and
 tryptophan residues).
         [0057]       In one embodiment of the present invention, the aromatic-cationic peptides
 useful in the methods of the present invention have a relationship between the minimum
number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges at physiological
pH (pt) wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1, except that when
pt is 1, a may also be 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number
of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt) is as follows:
 (Pt)   1 2     3  4     5    6   7 8   9    10   11   12  13    14  15   16   17  18   19  20
  (a)   1 1 1 1 2            2    2 3 3       3    4    4   4    5    5   5     6   6   6    7
         [0058]      In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship
between the minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive
charges (pt) wherein 2a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1. In this
embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of aromatic amino acid residues
(a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt) is as follows:
 (Pt)  1 2     3   4     5   6   7  8 9      10   11   12  13   14   15  16    17  18  19 20
 (a)   1 1 2       2     3   3   4  4   5    5    6    6   7     7   8    8    9   9   10   10
                                                   10

         [0059]     In another embodiment, the number of aromatic groups (a) and the total
number of net positive charges (pt) are equal.
        [0060]      Carboxyl groups, especially the terminal carboxyl group of a C-terminal
amino acid, are preferably amidated with, for example, ammonia to form the C-terminal
amide. Alternatively, the terminal carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid may be
amidated with any primary or secondary amine. The primary or secondary amine may, for
example, be an alkyl, especially a branched or unbranched CI-C 4 alkyl, or an aryl amine.

        [0064]     In one embodiment, the peptides useful in the methods of the present
invention have mu-opioid receptor agonist activity (i.e., they activate the mu-opioid
receptor). Activation of the mu-opioid receptor typically elicits an analgesic effect.
        [0065]     In certain instances, an aromatic-cationic peptide having mu-opioid
receptor agonist activity is preferred. For example, during short-term treatment, such as in an
acute disease or condition, it may be beneficial to use an aromatic-cationic peptide that
                                               12

  activates the mu-opioid receptor. Such acute diseases and conditions are often associated
  with moderate or severe pain. In these instances, the analgesic effect of the aromatic-cationic
  peptide may be beneficial in the treatment regimen of the human patient or other mammal.
 An aromatic-cationic peptide which does not activate the mu-opioid receptor, however, may
 also be used with or without an analgesic, according to clinical requirements.
           [0066]    Alternatively, in other instances, an aromatic-cationic peptide that does not
 have mu-opioid receptor agonist activity is preferred. For example, during long-term
 treatment, such as in a chronic disease state or condition, the use of an aromatic-cationic
 peptide that activates the mu-opioid receptor may be contraindicated. In these instances the
 potentially adverse or addictive effects of the aromatic-cationic peptide may preclude the use
 of an aromatic-cationic peptide that activates the mu-opioid receptor in the treatment regimen
 of a human patient or other mammal. Potential adverse effects may include sedation,
 constipation and respiratory depression. In such instances an aromatic-cationic peptide that
 does not activate the mu-opioid receptor may be an appropriate treatment.
          [0067]     Peptides useful in the methods of the present invention which have mu
 opioid receptor agonist activity are typically those peptides which have a tyrosine residue or a
tyrosine derivative at the N-terminus (i.e., the first amino acid position). Preferred
 derivatives of tyrosine include 2'-methyltyrosine (Mmt); 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (2'6'Dmt);
 3',5'-dimethyltyrosine (3'5'Dmt); N,2',6'-trimethyltyrosine (Tint); and 2'-hydroxy-6'
methyltryosine (Hmt).
         [0068]     In a particular preferred embodiment, a peptide that has mu-opioid
receptor agonist activity has the formula Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (for convenience
represented by the acronym: DALDA, which is referred to herein as SS-01). DALDA has a
net positive charge of three, contributed by the amino acids tyrosine, arginine, and lysine and
has two aromatic groups contributed by the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. The
tyrosine of DALDA can be a modified derivative of tyrosine such as in 2',6'
dimethyltyrosine to produce the compound having the formula 2 ', 6 '-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH 2 (i.e., DmtI-DALDA, which is referred to herein as SS-02).
         [0069]     Peptides that do not have mu-opioid receptor agonist activity generally do
not have a tyrosine residue or a derivative of tyrosine at the N-terminus (i.e., amino acid
                                                 13

position 1). The amino acid at the N-terminus can be any naturally occurring or non
naturally occurring amino acid other than tyrosine.
         [0070]     In one embodiment, the amino acid at the N-terminus is phenylalanine or
its derivative. Preferred derivatives of phenylalanine include 2'-methylphenylalanine (Mmp),
2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine (Dmp), N,2',6'-trimethylphenylalanine (Tmp), and 2'-hydroxy
6'-methylphenylalanine (Hmp).
         [0071]     Another aromatic-cationic peptide that does not have mu-opioid receptor
agonist activity has the formula Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (i.e., Phel-DALDA, which is
referred to herein as SS-20). Alternatively, the N-terminal phenylalanine can be a derivative
of phenylalanine such as 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine (2'6'Dmp). DALDA containing 2',6'
dimethylphenylalanine at amino acid position 1 has the formula 2',6'-Dmp-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH2 (i.e., 2'6'Dmp'-DALDA).
         [0072]     In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid sequence of Dmt'-DALDA
(SS-02) is rearranged such that Dint is not at the N-terminus. An example of such an
aromatic-cationic peptide that does not have mu-opioid receptor agonist activity has the
formula D-Arg-2'6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (referred to in this specification as SS-3 1).
         [0073]     DALDA, Phe'-DALDA, SS-3 1, and their derivatives can further include
functional analogs. A peptide is considered a functional analog of DALDA, Phel-DALDA,
or SS-31 if the analog has the same function as DALDA, Phel-DALDA, or SS-3 1. The
analog may, for example, be a substitution variant of DALDA, Phe'-DALDA, or SS-3 1,
wherein one or more amino acids are substituted by another amino acid.
        [0074]      Suitable substitution variants of DALDA, Phe'-DALDA, or SS-31 include
conservative amino acid substitutions. Amino acids may be grouped according to their
physicochemical characteristics as follows:
        (a)     Non-polar amino acids: Ala(A) Ser(S) Thr(T) Pro(P) Gly(G);
        (b)     Acidic amino acids: Asn(N) Asp(D) Glu(E) Gln(Q);
        (c)     Basic amino acids: His(H) Arg(R) Lys(K);
        (d)     Hydrophobic amino acids: Met(M) Leu(L) Ile(I) Val(V); and
        (e)     Aromatic amino acids: Phe(F) Tyr(Y) Trp(W) His (H).
                                                14

                 [0075]       Substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide by another amino acid in the
         same group is referred to as a conservative substitution and may preserve the
         physicochemical characteristics of the original peptide. In contrast, substitutions of an amino
         acid in a peptide by another amino acid in a different group is generally more likely to alter
        the characteristics of the original peptide.
                 [0076]       Examples of analogs useful in the practice of the present invention that
        activate mu-opioid receptors include, but are not limited, to the aromatic-cationic peptides
        shown in Table 1.

 Methods
           [0079]      The aromatic-cationic peptides described above are useful in reducing
 CD36 expression in a cell. For the purposes of this specification, CD36 expression in a cell
 is considered to be reduced if the expression of CD36 is decreased by about 10%, preferably
 by about 25%, more preferably by about 50%, even more preferably by about 75%.
 Optimally, CD36 is reduced to about normal levels in a cell.
          [0080]       CD36 is expressed on a wide variety of cells. Examples of such cells
 include macrophages, platelets, adipocytes, endothelial cells such as microvascular
 endothelial cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells; epithelial cells such as intestinal
 epithelial cells, gall bladder epithelial cells, bladder epithelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells
 and alverolar epithelial cells; renal tubular cells; pancreatic islet cells; hepatocytes; skeletal
 muscle cells; cardiac muscle cells; neuronal cells; glia cells; pancreas cells; sperm cells; etc.
         [0081]       For the purposes of this specification, cells expressing about 10%,
typically about 25%, about typically about 50%, and even more typically about 75% more
CD36 than normal cells are considered to express increased levels of CD36.
         [0082]       In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing CD36
expression in a cell. Any cell that expresses CD36 can be used in the method of the
invention, and include those mentioned above. The method for reducing CD36 expression in
a cell comprises contacting the cell with an effective amount of an aromatic-cationic peptide
described above.
                                                   19

          [0083]      In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing
  CD36 expression in a mammal in need thereof. The method for reducing CD36 expression in
  the mammal comprises administering to the mammal an effective amount of an aromatic
  cationic peptide described herein.
          [0084]      Mammals in need of reducing CD36 expression include, for example,
  mammals that have increased CD36 expression. The increased expression of CD36 is
  associated with various diseases and conditions. Examples of diseases and conditions
 characterized by increased CD36 expression include, but are not limited to atherosclerosis,
 inflammation, abnormal angiogenesis, abnormal lipid metabolism, abnormal removal of
 apoptotic cells, ischemia such as cerebral ischemia and myocardial ischemia, ischemia
 reperfusion, ureteral obstruction, stroke, Alzheimer's Disease, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy
 and obesity. A discussion on the involvement of CD36 in atherosclerosis may be found in
 "Targeted disruption of the class B scavenger receptor CD36 protects against atherosclerotic
 lesion development in mice". Febbraio M, Podrez EA, Smith JD, Hajjar DP, Hazen SL et al. J
 Clinical Investigation 105:1049-1056, 2000 and "CD36: a class B scavenger receptor
 involved in angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and lipid metabolism".
Febbraio M., Hajjar DP and Silverstein RL. Journal of Clinical Investigation 108:785-791,
2001.
         [0085]      Mammals in need of reducing CD36 expression also include mammals
suffering from complications of diabetes. Some complications of diabetes include, in
addition to nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, coronary artery disease, and peripheral
vascular disease associated with diabetes.
         [0086]      In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for reducing
CD36 expression in removed organs and tissues. The method comprises contacting the
removed organ or tissue with an effective amount of an aromatic-cationic peptide described
above. An organ or tissue may, for example, be removed from a donor for autologous or
heterologous transplantation. Some examples of organs and tissues include
                                                                              heart, lungs,
pancreas, kidney, liver, skin, etc.
Synthesis of the Peptides
                                               20

            [0087]    The peptides useful in the methods of the present invention may be
  synthesized by any of the methods well known in the art. Suitable methods for chemically
  synthesizing the protein include, for example those described by Stuart and Young in "Solid
  Phase Peptide Synthesis," Second Edition, Pierce Chemical Company (1984), and in "Solid
  Phase Peptide Synthesis," Methods Enzymol. 289, Academic Press, Inc, New York (1997).
  Modes of Administration
           [0088]    Any method known to those in the art for contacting a cell, organ or tissue
  with a peptide may be employed. Suitable methods include in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo
  methods.
           [0089]    In vitro methods typically include cultured samples. For example, a cell
 can be placed in a reservoir (e.g., tissue culture plate), and incubated with an aromatic
 cationic peptide under appropriate conditions suitable for reducing CD36 expression.
 Suitable incubation conditions can be readily determined by those skilled in the art.
          [0090]     Ex vivo methods typically include cells, organs or tissues removed from a
 mammal, such as a human. The cells, organs or tissues can, for example, be incubated with
 the peptide under appropriate conditions. The contacted cells, organs or tissues are normally
 returned to the donor, placed in a recipient, or stored for future use. Thus, the peptide is
 generally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
          [0091]    In vivo methods are typically limited to the administration of an aromatic
cationic peptide, such as those described above, to a mammal, preferably a human. The
peptides useful in the methods of the present invention are administered to a mammal in an
amount effective in reducing expression of CD36 or treating the mammal. The effective
amount is determined during pre-clinical trials and clinical trials by methods familiar to
physicians and clinicians.
         [0092]     An effective amount of a peptide useful in the methods of the present
invention, preferably in a pharmaceutical composition, may be administered to a mammal
                                                                                              in
need thereof by any of a number of well-known methods for administering pharmaceutical
compounds. The peptide may be administered systemically or locally.
                                                 21

            [0093]     In one embodiment, the peptide is administered intravenously. For
   example, the aromatic-cationic peptides useful in the methods of the present invention may
   be administered via rapid intravenous bolus injection. Preferably, however, the peptide is
   administered as a constant rate intravenous infusion.
            [0094]    The peptide may also be administered orally, topically, intranasally,
   intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or transdermally. In a preferred embodiment, transdermal
   administration of the aromatic-cationic peptides by methods of the present invention is by
  iontophoresis, in which the charged peptide is delivered across the skin by an electric current.
           [0095]     Other routes of administration include intracerebroventricularly or
  intrathecally. Intracerebroventiculatly refers to administration into the ventricular system
                                                                                                  of
  the brain. Intrathecally refers to administration into the space under the arachnoid membrane
  of the spinal cord. Thus intracerebroventricular or intrathecal administration may be
  preferred for those diseases and conditions which affect the organs or tissues of the central
  nervous system.
          [0096]      The peptides useful in the methods of the invention may also be
  administered to mammals by sustained release, as is known in the art. Sustained release
 administration is a method of drug delivery to achieve a certain level of the drug over a
 particular period of time. The level typically is measured by serum or plasma concentration.
          [0097]   A description of methods for delivering a compound by controlled release
 can be found in international PCT Application No. WO 02/083106. The PCT application
                                                                                                 is
 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
         [0098]    Any formulation known in the art of pharmacy is suitable for administration
of the aromatic-cationic peptides useful in the methods of the present invention. For oral
administration, liquid or solid formulations may be used. Some examples of formulations
include tablets, gelatin capsules, pills, troches, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers,
                                                                                          chewing
gum and the like. The peptides can be mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier
                                                                                           (vehicle)

 receptor that mediates uptake of oxLDL into macrophages and subsequent
                                                                                 foam-cell

 atherosclerosis.
          [0105]      CD36 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by various
 cellular stimuli, including glucose and oxLDL. Macrophages were harvested
                                                                                    from mice

 48 h. Incubation with oxLDL significantly increased CD36 mRNA (figure

Example 2:       SS-31 Protected Mice from Acute Cerebral Ischemia
         [0109]      Cerebral ischemia initiates a cascade of cellular and molecular events that
lead to brain damage. One such event is postischemic inflammation. Using a mouse model
of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (20 min. occlusion of the middle cerebral artery), it was
found that CD36 was upregulated in microglia and macrophages in the post-ischemic brain,
and there was increased reactive oxygen species production. CD36 knock out mice had a
profound reduction in reactive oxygen species after ischemia and improved neurological
function compared to wild type mice.
         [0110]      Cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral
artery for 30 min. Wild-type (WT) mice were given either saline vehicle (Veh) (ip, n=9) or
SS-31 (2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg, ip, n=6) at 0, 6, 24 and 48 h after ischemia. Mice were killed 3
days after ischemia. Brains were removed, frozen, and sectioned. Brain sections were
stained by the Nissl stain. Infarct volume and hemispheric swelling was determined using an
image analyzer. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with posthoc analysis.
         [0111]      Treatment of wild type mice with SS-31 (2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg, ip, n=6) at
0, 6, 24 and 48 hours after 30 min. occlusion of the middle cerebral artery resulted in a
significant reduction in infarct volume (figure 2A) and hemispheric swelling (figure 2B)
compared to saline controls.(*P<0.05 compared to Veh).
         [0112]      Thirty min. cerebral ischemia in WT mice resulted in significant depletion
in reduced glutathione (GSH) in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum compared to the
contralateral side in vehicle-treated animals (figure 3). The depletion of GSH in the
ipsilateral cortex was significantly reduced in mice treated with SS-31 (2 mg/kg ip at 0, 6, 24
and 48 h) (figure 3). The depletion of GSH in the striatum was also reduced by SS-31
treatment but did not reach statistical significance.
Example 3.       SS-31 mediated protection against acute cerebral ischemia mimics protection
observed in CD36 knockout mice.
         [0113]     CD36 knockout (CD36 KO) mice were subjected to acute cerebral
ischemia as described under Example 2. CD36 KO mice were given either saline vehicle
(Veh) (ip, n=5) or SS-31 (2 mg/kg, i.p. n=5) at 0, 6, 24 and 48 h after 30 min ischemia.
                                                 26

Infarct volume (figure 4A) and hemispheric swelling (figure 4B) in CD36 KO mice were
similar whether they received saline or SS-31.
         [0114]       Treatment of CD36 KO mice with SS31 (2 mg/kg, i.p., n=5) also failed to
further prevent GSH depletion in the ipsilateral cortex caused by 30 min ischemia (figure 5).
         [0115]       These data suggest that the protective action of SS-3 1 against acute
cerebral ischemia may be mediated by inhibiting the upregulation of CD36.
Example 4.        SS-31 reduced CD36 mRNA expression in post-ischemic brain.
          [0116]      Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery has been shown to
 significantly increase the expression of CD36 mRNA in microglia and macrophages in the
post-ischemic brain. Wild-type mice were given saline vehicle (Veh, i.p., n=6) or SS-31 (5
mg/kg, i.p., n=6) at 0 and 6h after 30 min ischemia, and CD36 mRNA levels were determined
 using real time PCR. CD36 expression was upregulated almost 6-fold in the ipsilateral brain
 compared to the contralateral brain in mice that received saline (figure 6). CD36 mRNA was
 significantly reduced in the ipsilateral brain in mice that received SS-31 treatment (figure 6).
 Example 5:       SS-31 Suppressed Upregulation of CD36 in Renal Tubular Cells Following
 Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction
          [0117]       Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is a common clinical disorder
 associated with tubular cell apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and interstitial fibrosis.
 Interstitial fibrosis leads to a hypoxic environment and contributes to progressive decline in
 renal function despite surgical correction. CD36 has been shown to be expressed on renal
 tubular cells.
           [0118]      CD36 was found to have been upregulated in tubular cells after UUO.
 UUO was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were treated with saline (ip, n=6) or
 SS-31 (1 mg/kg ip, n=6) one day prior to induction of UUO, and once a day for 14 days after
 UUO. Rats were killed, kidneys removed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The slides
                                                                          4
 were treated with the anti-CD36 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz #sc-915 ; 1:100 with blocking
  serum) at room temperature for 1.5 hours. The slides were then incubated with the second
  antibody conjugated with biotin (anti-rabbit IgG-B 1; ABC kit, PK-6 101) at room temperature
                                                    27

for 30 min. The slides were then treated with avidin, developed with DAB and
counterstained with 10% hematoxylin. The contralateral unobstructed kidney served as the
control for each animal.
         [0119]      UUO resulted in tubular dilation and significant increase in expression of
CD36 on the tubular cells (fig. 7). Tubular dilation was also observed in rats treated with SS
31, but there was a significant reduction in CD36 expression (fig. 3). CD36 expression
(brown stain) is primarily found on tubular cells in the contralateral unobstructed kidney (fig.
7A). CD36 expression was increased in the obstructed kidney in animals treated with saline
(fig. 7B), but was much reduced in obstructed kidneys obtained from rats treated with SS-31
(fig. 7C).
         [0120]      To determine whether SS-31 reduces lipid peroxidation in kidney after
UUO, rats were treated with either saline (n=6) or SS-31 (1 mg/kg ip, n=6) one day prior to
 induction of UUO, and once a day for 14 days UUO. Rats were then killed, kidneys
removed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Slides were incubated with anti-HNE rabbit
IgG and a biotin -linked anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody. The slides were
 developed with DAB. Lipid peroxidation, which was increased by UUO, was reduced by SS
 31 treatment (fig. 8). HNE stain (brown) was significantly increased in tubular cells in the
 obstructed kidney (fig. 8B) compared to the contralateral control (fig. 8A). Obstructed
 kidneys from rats treated with SS-31 showed significantly less HNE stain (Fig. 8C) compared
 to saline-treated rats (fig. 8B).
          [0121]      To determine whether SS-31 reduced tubular cell apoptosis in obstructed
 kidney after UUO, rats were treated with either saline (n=6) or SS-31 (1 mg/kg ip, n=6) one
 day prior to induction of UUO, and once a day for 14 days after UUO. Rats were then killed,
 kidneys removed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. To quantitate nuclei with fragmented
 DNA, the TUNEL assay were performed with in situ TUNEL kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY).
 Slides were developed with DAB and counterstained with 10% hematoxylin. The
 upregulation of CD36 in saline-treated controls associated with tubular cell apoptosis was
 significantly inhibited by SS-31 treatment (fig. 9). Compared to the contralateral
 unobstructed control (fig. 9A), a significant increase in apoptotic cells was observed in the
 obstructed kidney from saline-treated animals (fig. 9B). The number of apoptotic cells was
                                                 28

significantly reduced in obstructed kidney from SS-31 treated animals (fig. 9C) (P<0.001;
n=6).
        [0122]      Macrophage infiltration (fig. 10) and interstitial fibrosis (fig. 11) were also
prevented by SS-31 treatment. Rats were treated with either saline (n=6) or SS-31 (1 mg/kg
ip, n=6) one day prior to induction of UUO, and once a day for 14 days after UUO. Rats
were then killed, kidneys removed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Slides were treated
with monoclonal antibody for EDI macrophage (1:75; Serotec). Horseradish-peroxidase
linked rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dako) was used for macrophage detection.
Sections were then counterstained with 10% hematoxylin. The number of macrophages in
the obstructed kidney in saline-treated rats (fig. 10B) was significantly increased compared to
the contralateral unobstructed control (fig. 10 A). Macrophage infiltration was significantly
reduced in rats treated with SS-31 (fig. 1OC) (P<0.05; t-test).
         [0123]      Rats were treated with either saline (n=6) or SS-31 (1 mg/kg ip, n=6) one
day prior to induction of UUO, and once a day for 14 days after UUO. Rats were then killed,
kidneys removed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Slides were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin and Masson's trichome for interstitial fibrosis (blue stain). Obstructed kidneys
from saline-treated rats showed increase fibrosis (fig. 11 B) compared to the contralateral
unobstructed control (fig. 11A); while obstructed kidneys from SS-31 treated rats showed
significantly less fibrosis (P<0.05; t-test).
         [0124]      These results show that SS-31 suppresses the upregulation of CD36 on
renal tubular cells induced by UUO.
Example 6:      SS-31 and SS-20 Reduced CD36 Expression in Isolated Hearts Upon
Reperfusion After Prolonged Cold Ischemic Storage
         [0125]      Organ transplantation requires hypothermic storage of the isolated organ
for transport to the recipient. Currently, cardiac transplantation is limited by the short time of
cold ischemic storage that can be tolerated before coronary blood flow is severely
compromised (<4 hours). The expression of CD36 in coronary endothelium and cardiac
muscles is up-regulated in isolated hearts subjected to prolonged cold ischemic storage and
warm reperfusion.
                                                 29

        [0126]      Isolated guinea pig hearts were perfused with St. Thomas solution alone,
or St. Thomas solution containing 1 nM SS-31, or 100 nM SS-20, for 3 min. and then stored
in the same solution at 4'C for 18 hours. After ischemic storage, hearts were reperfused with
34 0C Kreb-Henseleit solution for 90 min. Hearts freshly isolated from guinea pigs were used
as controls.
        [0127]      The hearts were fixed in paraffin and sliced for immunostaining with an
anti-CD36 rabbit polyclonal antibody. The results are shown in fig. 12. Two sections are
shown for each treatment group. Antibody staining showed that CD36 is expressed in
endothelium and cardiac muscles in normal hearts. The "background" control (figs. 12A and
12B) represents two sections from a normal non-ischemic heart that was not treated with the
primary antibody. "Normal heart" (figs. 12C and 12D) represents two sections obtained from
a non-ischemic heart. The sections from a representative heart stored in St. Thomas solution
(figs. 12E and 12F) for 18 hours at 4'C showed increased CD36 staining compared to
"Normal heart." CD36 staining was significantly reduced in hearts stored with either 1 nM
SS-31 (figs. 12G and 12H) or 100 nM SS-20 (figs. 121 and 12J) in St. Thomas solution for 18
h.
        [0128]      CD36 staining is increased in hearts that have undergone 18 hours of cold
ischemic storage and warm reperfusion. However, hearts that were stored with either 1 nM
SS-31 or 100 nM SS-20 did not show the upregulation of CD36 expression.
        [0129]      Lipid peroxidation in the hearts was also decreased by the aromatic
cationic peptides. Guinea pig hearts were perfused with a cardioplegic solution (St. Thomas
solution) alone or St. Thomas solution containing either 1 nM SS-31 or 100 nM SS-20 for 3
min. and then subjected to 18 hours of cold ischemia (4'C). The hearts were then reperfused
with Krebs Henseleit buffer at 34'C for 90 min. Immunohistochemical analysis of 4
hydroxynonenol (HNE)- modified proteins in paraffin sections from tissue slices were
performed by incubation with an anti-HNE antibody (Santa Cruz) and a fluorescent
secondary antibody. HNE staining was significantly increased in hearts subjected to 18 hours
of cold storage in St. Thomas solution (fig. 13B) compared to non-ischemic hearts (fig. 13A).
HNE staining was reduced in hearts stored in SS-31 (fig. 13C) or SS-20 (fig. 13D).
                                               30

        [0130]      Further, the peptides dramatically reduced endothelial apoptosis (fig. 14).
Guinea pig hearts were perfused with a cardioplegic solution (St. Thomas solution) alone or
St. Thomas solution containing either 1 nM SS-31 or 100 nM SS-20 for 3 min. and then
subjected to 18 hours of cold ischemia (4'C). The hearts were then reperfused with Krebs
Henseleit buffer at 34'C for 90 min. After deparaffinization, sections were incubated with
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt) with digoxigenin-dNTP for 1 hour. The reaction was
stopped with terminating buffer. A fluorescent anti-digoxigenin antibody was then applied.
Hearts subjected to 18 hours of cold storage in St. Thomas solution (figs. 14C and 14D)
showed prominent endothelial apoptosis whereas no endothelial apoptosis was observed in
non-ischemic normal hearts (figs. 14A and 140B). Apoptotic cells were not observed in
hearts stored in SS-31 (figs. 14E and 14F) or SS-20 (figs. 14G and 14H).
        [0131]      A significant improvement of coronary blood flow after prolonged cold
ischemic storage and warm reperfusion occurred (fig. 15). Guinea pig hearts were perfused
with a cardioplegic solution (St. Thomas solution) alone or St. Thomas solution containing
either 1 nM SS-31 (fig. 15A) or 100 nM SS-20 (fig. 15B) for 3 min. and then subjected to 18
hours of cold ischemia (4'C). The hearts were then reperfused with Krebs Henseleit buffer at
34'C for 90 min. Coronary flow was significantly reduced after prolonged ischemia
compared to pre-ischemic control (expressed as 100%). Preservation in either SS-31 or SS
20 significantly restored coronary flow to approximately 80% of pre-ischemic flow.
Example 7:      SS-31 prevented renal damage in diabetic mice
        [0132]      CD36 expression is upregulated in a variety of tissues of diabetic patients,
including monocytes, heart, kidneys, and plasma. High glucose is known to upregulate the
expression of CD36 by improving the translational efficiency of CD36 mRNA. Diabetic
nephropathy is a common complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and is associated with
tubular epithelial degeneration and interstitial fibrosis. CD36 has been identified as a
mediator of tubular epithelial apoptosis in diabetic nephropathy. High glucose stimulates
CD36 expression and apoptosis in proximal tubular epithelial cells.
        [0133]      Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce diabetes in mice. Three groups of
CD-I mice were studied: Group I - no STZ treatment; Group II - STZ (50 mg/kg, ip) was
given once a day for 5d; Group III - STZ (50 mg/kg, ip) was given once a day for 5 d, and
                                                 31

SS-31 (3 mg/kg, ip) was given once a day for 16 d. STZ treatment resulted in progressive
increase in blood glucose. By week 3, blood glucose values were: Group 1 (10.6  0.27
mmol/L); Group 11 (24.5      1.15 mmol/L); Group III (21.3 :L 1.48 mmol/L). Animals were
sacrificed after 3 weeks and kidney tissues preserved for histopathology. Kidney sections
were examined by Periodic Schiff (PAS) staining for renal tubular brush border.
         [0134]     STZ treatment caused dramatic loss of brush border in proximal tubules in
the renal cortex (figure 16). In mice not treated with STZ, the renal brush border in the cortex
was stained red with PAS (figure 16A, see white arrows). In mice treated with STZ, the brush
border was obliterated, and the tubular epithelial cells showed small condensed nuclei (figure
 16B). Daily treatment with SS-31 (3 mg/kg, ip) prevented the loss of brush border in the
STZ-treated mice (figure 16C), and the nuclei appeared normal (figure 16C, top and bottom
panels). In general, the architecture of the proximal renal tubules was preserved in diabetic
mice treated with SS-3 1.
        [0135]      STZ treatment induced significant apoptosis in tubular epithelial cells
(figure 17). Kidney sections were examined for apoptosis using the TUNEL assay. After
deparaffinization, sections were incubated with deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt) with
digoxigenin-dNTP for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped with terminating buffer. A
fluorescent anti-digoxigenin antibody was then applied. Kidney sections from mice treated
with STZ showed large number of apoptotic nuclei in the proximal tubules (PT)(figure 17A,
panel b), compared to no apoptotic cells in mice not treated with STZ (figure 17A, panel a).
Treatment with daily SS-31 dramatically reduced apoptotic cells in the proximal tubule
(figure 17A, panel c). Figure 17B shows the significant decrease in tubular cell apoptosis
provided by SS-31.
        [0136]      CD36 expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells is known to be
increased by high glucose and is upregulated in diabetic models. SS-3 1. by reducing CD36
expression, was able to inhibit tubular cell apoptosis and loss of brush border in mice treated
with STZ without affecting blood glucose.
