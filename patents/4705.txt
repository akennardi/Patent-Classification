                            ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
        A system for managing trading orders comprises a memory operable to store an
order associated with a first price.         The system further comprises a processor
communicatively coupled to the memory and operable to identify a latency value.            The
processor is further operable to receive a counterorder and to identify a potential trade
associated with the order and the counterorder, the potential trade based at least in part on
the first price.  If the latency value satisfies a configurable condition, the processor is
further operable to initiate a configurable period of time. If the potential trade is not valid
upon expiration of the configurable period, the processor is further operable to prevent the
execution of the potential trade.

                       LATENCY PROTECTION FOR TRADING ORDERS
   TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates generally to electronic trading and more specifically to
   a system and method for providing latency protection for trading orders.
 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           In recent years, electronic trading systems have gained widespread acceptance for
   the trading of a variety of items, such as goods, services, stocks, bonds, currencies, and
   commodities. In traditional trading systems, traders may submit electronic trading orders to
   the trading system over networks. The network transmission speed for one trader may be
10 faster than the network transmission speed for another trader. In a fast moving market, the
   trader associated with the slower network connection may be at a significant disadvantage.
   In particular, when market conditions change, the trader may want to cancel a previously
   submitted order. As a result, the trader may transmit to the trading system a request to
   cancel the order. The slow network connection, however, may cause the trader's request to
15 arrive at the trading system after a counterorder from another trader. In such situations,
   traditional trading systems match the counterorder to the previously submitted order. The
   result is a trade that is unwanted by the trader with the slower network connection. The
   execution of unwanted trades may discourage traders from engaging in trading activity.
20 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           In accordance with the present invention, the disadvantages and problems associated
   with prior electronic trading systems have been substantially reduced or eliminated.
           In some embodiments, a system for managing trading orders comprises a memory
   operable to store an order associated with a first price. The system further comprises a
25 processor communicatively coupled to the memory and operable to identify a latency value.
   The processor is further operable to receive a counterorder and to identify a potential trade
   associated with the order and the counterorder, the potential trade based at least in part on
   the first price.   If the latency value satisfies a configurable condition, the processor is
   further operable to initiate a configurable period of time. If the potential trade is not valid

                                                  2
   upon expiration of the configurable period, the processor is further operable to prevent the
   execution of the potential trade.
           The invention has several important technical advantages. Various embodiments of
   the invention may have none, some, or all of these advantages. One advantage is that the
 5 trading system is operable to monitor and compensate for latency in the system.             In
   particular, upon identifying a potential trade involving an order and counterorder, the
   trading system is operable to record the potential trade in a timer queue associated with a
   configurable period of time. Upon expiration of the configurable period of time, the trading
   system is operable to determine whether the potential trade is still valid.     If the trading
10 system determines that the potential trade is no longer valid, the trading system may
   prevent the execution of the potential trade. Thus, the trading system may prevent the
   execution of unwanted trades.      The trading system may thereby encourage traders to
   participate in trading activity. An increase in trading activity may increase liquidity in the
   trading system.
15         Other advantages will be readily apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art
   from the following figures, descriptions, and claims.

                                                 3
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
           FIGURE 1 illustrates one embodiment of a trading system 10. Trading system 10
   may comprise clients 20, manager servers 30, gateway servers 40, and a trading platform 50
 5 communicatively coupled by one or more networks 60. Generally, trading system 10 is
   operable to receive, process, and match trading orders 12 from clients 20. Trading system
   10 is further operable to monitor latency associated with communications in trading system
   10. In particular, trading system 10 may determine latency values 14 associated with one or
   more components in trading system 10.          If a particular latency value 14 satisfies a
10 configurable condition 16, trading system 10 may monitor a potential trade for a
   configurable period 18 of time prior to executing the potential trade. If, upon expiration of
   the configurable period 18, trading system 10 determines that the potential trade is not
   valid, trading system 10 may prevent execution of the potential trade.          By monitoring
   potential trades during configurable period 18, trading system 10 may protect traders 22
15 against unwanted trades.
           Trading system 10 may comprise one or more clients 20. Client 20 represents any
   suitable local or remote end-user device that may be used by traders 22 to access one or
   more elements of trading system 10, such as trading platform 50. A particular client 20
   may comprise a computer, workstation, telephone, Internet browser, electronic notebook,
20 Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), pager, or any other suitable device (wireless, wireline, or
   otherwise), component, or element capable of receiving, processing, storing, and/or
   communicating information with other components of trading system 10. Client 20 may
   also comprise any suitable user interface such as a display, microphone, keyboard, or any
   other appropriate terminal      equipment    according to particular      configurations   and
25 arrangements. It will be understood that trading system 10 may comprise any number and
   combination of clients 20. In some embodiments, client 20 may comprise a graphical user
   interface (GUI) 24.
           GUI 24 is generally operable to tailor and filter data presented to trader 22. GUI 24
   may provide trader 22 with an efficient and user-friendly presentation of trading orders 12,
30 market data, and/or other suitable information.        GUI 24 may comprise a plurality of
   displays having interactive fields, pull-down lists, and buttons operated by trader 22. In one
   example, GUI 24 presents relevant market data to trader 22 and conceals the remaining
   information to reduce visual clutter. Then, upon receiving a request from trader 22, GUI 24

                                                   4
   expands the visual representation of market data to display trading history, trading volumes,
   credit limits, and/or other suitable information.    GUI 24 may include multiple levels of
   abstraction including groupings and boundaries.       It should be understood that the term
   graphical user interface may be used in the singular or in the plural to describe one or more
 5 graphical user interfaces 24 and each of the displays of a particular graphical user interface
   24.
            Clients 20 are operable to receive trading orders 12 and change orders 26 from
   traders 22. Clients 20 are further operable to send trading orders 12 and change orders 26
   to gateway server 40. Trading orders 12 may comprise orders to trade products such as, for
10 example, currencies,      financial instruments, stocks, bonds, futures contracts, equity
   securities, mutual funds, options, derivatives, commodities, or any number and combination
   of suitable trading products. Trading orders 12 may comprise bids, offers, market orders,
   limit orders, stop loss orders, day orders, open orders, GTC ("good till cancelled") orders,
   "good through" orders, "all or none" orders, "any part" orders, or any other suitable order
15 for trading.
            A particular trading order 12 may be referred to as an order 12a or a counterorder
   12b.    Orders 12a and counterorders 12b represent complementary actions such as, for
   example, buying and selling. If the party that submits a particular order 12a is referred to as
   trader 22, then the party that submits a corresponding counterorder 12b may be referred to
20 as a "counterparty" trader 22. If a particular order 12a represents a buy order (e.g., bid,
   take, lift, etc.), then a corresponding counterorder 12b may represent a sell order (e.g.,
   offer, hit, etc.).    Conversely, if a particular order 12a represents a sell order, then a
   corresponding counterorder 12b may represent a buy order.
            Change orders 26 may comprise orders to cancel and/or modify a previously
25 submitted trading order 12. In some embodiments, after submitting trading order 12, trader
   22 may later decide that he or she no longer wants to execute trading order 12. In this
   situation, trader 22 may submit a particular change order 26 that instructs trading platform
   50 to cancel trading order 12.      Upon receiving the particular change order 26, trading
   platform 50 may delete, deactivate, and/or ignore trading order 12. In other embodiments,
30 after submitting trading order 12 for a particular trading product at a particular price, trader
   22 may later decide that he or she wants to execute the trade at a different price and/or with
   a different quantity. In this situation, trader 22 may submit change order 26 that instructs

                                                   5
   trading platform 50 to change the price, quantity, and/or other suitable characteristic of
   trading order 12.
            Although clients 20 are described herein as being used by "traders", it should be
   understood that the term "trader" is meant to broadly apply to any user of trading system
 5 10, whether that user is an agent acting on behalf of a principal, an individual, a legal entity
   (such as a corporation), or any machine or mechanism that is capable of placing and/or
   responding to trading orders 12 in trading system 10. Certain traders 22 in trading system
   10 may be associated with market makers 28.
            Market maker 28 may refer to any individual, firm, or other entity that submits
10 and/or maintains either or both bid and offer trading orders 12 simultaneously for the same
   instrument. For example, a market maker 28 may be a brokerage or bank that maintains
   either a firm bid and/or offer price in a given security by standing ready, willing, and able
   to buy and/or sell that security at publicly quoted prices. A market maker 28 generally
   displays bid and/or offer prices for specific numbers of specific securities, and if these
15 prices are met, the market maker 28 will immediately buy for and/or sell from its own
   accounts. According to certain embodiments, a single trading order 12 may be filled by a
   number of market makers 28 at potentially different prices.
            In some embodiments, market makers 28 may include individuals, firms or other
   entities that are granted particular privileges such that trading orders 12 received from such
20 individuals, firms or other entities are treated as being received from a traditional market
   maker 28 (such as a brokerage or bank, for example).          For example, certain individuals,
   firms or other entities that may otherwise be treated as individual traders 22 may be granted
   privileges to be treated as market makers 28 for the purposes of the systems and methods
   discussed herein. To receive market maker privileges, an individual, firm or other entity
25 may be required to pay a fee, pay a commission, or submit and/or simultaneously maintain
   both bid and offer trading orders 12 for particular instruments.         According to certain
   embodiments, an individual, firm or other entity may be designated as a market maker 28
   for particular instruments but as a non-market maker for other instruments.
            In some embodiments, a multi-tiered system of market makers 28 may be
30 employed. Trading platform 50 may grant different privileges to different market makers
   28 based on one or more criteria such as, for example, whether the market maker 28 is
   associated with an electronic feed, whether the market maker 28 is a strong trader 22, or
   whether the market maker 28 has particular information.            Market makers 28 may be

                                                     6
   categorized into different tiers for different tradable instruments. For instance, a particular
   market maker 28 may be categorized as a first-level market maker 28 for instrument(s) for
   which that market maker 28 is a strong trader 22 and as a second-level market maker 28 for
   other types of instruments.
 5          In some embodiments, clients 20 may be communicatively coupled to manager
   server 30. The combination of a particular manager server 30 and one or more clients 20
   may represent a computer system maintained and operated by a particular market maker 28.
   Manager server 30 associated with a particular market maker 28 is generally operable to
   monitor trading orders 12 submitted by traders 22 associated with the particular market
10 maker 28. Manager server 30 may regulate credit extended to other market makers 28
   and/or traders 22 in trading system 10.
            In some embodiments, manager server 30 is operable to monitor latency in trading
   system 10. Latency generally refers to delays associated with communications between
   and/or functions performed by various components in trading system 10.              Latency in
15 trading system 10 may be associated with a number of sources. For example, latency may
   be attributed, at least in part, to clients 20, manager servers 30, network 60, gateway servers
   40, trading platform 50, and/or any number and combination of hardware and/or software
   components in trading system 10.
            According to certain embodiments, manager server 30 may determine one or more
20 latency values 14 associated with various components in trading system 10. Latency value
   14 may represent delays associated with the transmission and/or processing of trading
   orders 12 in trading system 10. In some embodiments, latency value 14 may be based at
   least in part on the amount of time it takes for trading platform 50 to acknowledge receipt
   of trading order 12 transmitted from manager server 30. Due to changing conditions in
25 network 60 and trading system 10, latency value 14 may fluctuate over time. Different
   market makers 28 and/or clients 22 may be associated with different latency values 14. At
   a given time, a particular latency value 14 associated with network communications
   between a first manager server 30 and trading platform 50 may be different from another
   latency value 14 associated with network communications between a second manager
30 server 30 and trading platform 50.
            According to certain embodiments, manager server 30 is operable to use an
   acceptance message 32 and/or a test order 34 to determine latency value 14. Acceptance
   message 32 represents a communication from trading platform 50 acknowledging receipt of

                                                 7
   trading order 12, change order 26, and/or test order 34. For example, upon determining that
   a particular trading order 12 has been received from a particular manager server 30, trading
   platform 50 is operable to generate acceptance message 32. Trading platform 50 may then
   transmit acceptance message 32 to the particular manager server 30.             The particular
 5 manager server 30 may calculate latency value 14 based at least in part on the time at which
   trading order 12 was sent from manager server 30 and/or the time at which manager server
   30 received acceptance message 32 from trading platform 50.           In some embodiments,
   trading order 12 may comprise a time value that represents the time at which manager
   server 30 transmitted trading order 12 to trading platform 50.         Manager server 30 is
10 operable to store time value(s) representing the time at which manager server 30 received
   trading order 12 from client 20, the time at which manager server 30 transmitted trading
   order 12 to trading platform 50, the time at which manager server 30 received acceptance
   message 32 from trading platform, and/or the time(s) associated with any number and
   combination of events.
15         Test order 34 represents an order for an artificial trading product.         In some
   embodiments, test order 34 is a dummy order or an artificial order. Because test order 34 is
   associated with an artificial trading product, trading platform 50 does not execute any
   trades involving test orders 34. A particular test order 34 may be associated with a time
   value that represents the time at which manager server 30 transmitted test order 34 to
20 trading platform 50. In some embodiments, in response to receiving test order 34, trading
   platform 50 may generate and transmit acceptance message 32 to manager server 30.
   Based at least in part on the time at which manager server 30 transmitted test order 34 and
   on the time at which manager server 30 received acceptance message 32, manager server 30
   may determine latency value 14.
25         In other embodiments, latency value 14 may be based at least in part on the amount
   of time associated with the one-way transmission of test order 34 and/or other message(s).
   For example, test order 34 may comprise a particular time value representing the time at
   which manager server 30 transmitted test order 34 to trading platform 50. Upon receiving
   test order 34, trading platform 50 may, based at least in part on the particular time value in
30 test order 34 and the time at which trading platform 50 received test order 34, determine
   latency value 14 associated with the one-way transmission of test order 34 from manager
   server 30.

                                                   8
            In some embodiments, manager server 30 may be configured to occasionally
   transmit test orders 34 to trading platform 50. For example, manager server 30 may be
   configured to transmit test orders 34 at configurable intervals. By periodically sending test
   orders 34, manager server 30 may calculate and monitor latency values 14 on an ongoing
 5 basis.
            In some embodiments, manager server 30 is operable to transmit latency values 14
   to trading platform 50. In response to receiving latency values 14 from manager server 30,
   trading platform 50 may adjust conditions in network 60 or trading system 10. Based at
   least in part on latency values 14, trading platform 50 may take measures to compensate for
10 and/or reduce latency in trading system 10.
            Manager server 30 may comprise any suitable combination of hardware and/or
   software implemented in one or more modules to provide the described functions and
   operations. In some embodiments, manager server 30 may comprise a general-purpose
   personal computer (PC), a Macintosh, a workstation, a Unix-based computer, a server
15 computer, or any suitable processing device. Manager server 30 may comprise manager
   memory 36 and manager processor 38.
            Manager memory 36 comprises any suitable arrangement of random access memory
   (RAM), read only memory (ROM), magnetic computer disk, CD-ROM, or other magnetic
   or optical storage media, or any other volatile or non-volatile memory devices that store one
20 or more files, lists, tables, or other arrangements of information such as trading orders 12.
   Although FIGURE 1 illustrates manager memory 36 as internal to manager server 30, it
   should be understood that manager memory 36 may be internal or external to components
   of trading system 10, depending on particular implementations. Also, manager memory 36
   may be separate from or integral to other memory devices to achieve any suitable
25 arrangement of memory devices for use in trading system 10.             According to certain
   embodiments, manager memory 36 may comprise one or more order logs 42, acceptance
   messages 32, latency values 14, and manager rules 44.
            Order log 42 comprises a log of trading orders 12, change orders 26, and/or test
   orders 34 transmitted from manager server 30 to trading platform 50. In association with
30 each trading order 12, change order 26, and/or test order 34, order log 42 may store the time
   at which the particular trading order 12, counterorder 12b, or trading order 12 was sent to
   trading platform 50. In addition, or alternatively, to storing order log 42, manager memory

                                                  9
   36 may store one or more acceptance messages 32 received from trading platform 50.
   Manager memory 36 may further store latency values 14 calculated by manager server 30.
           Manager rules 44 comprise software instructions for routing and/or processing
   trading orders 12 and/or change orders 26 from clients 20.         Manager rules 44 further
 5 comprise instructions for generating test orders 34, calculating latency values 14, and
   regulating trading activity associated with market maker 28.
           Manager memory 36 may be communicatively coupled to manager processor 38.
   Manager processor 38 is generally operable to execute manager rules 44 stored in manager
   memory 36. Manager processor 38 comprises any suitable combination of hardware and
10 software implemented in one or more modules to provide the described function or
   operation.
           In some embodiments, trading platform 50 may be associated with an internal
   manager server 30. The internal manager server 30 may be operated by the business entity
   that maintains and/or operates trading platform 50.      In some embodiments, the internal
15 manager server 30 may be directly coupled to gateway server 40. Thus, communications
   between the internal manager server 30 and gateway server 40 may not be routed through
   network 60. The internal manager server 30 may be configured to generate and transmit
   test orders 34 to trading platform 50.      In response to receiving test orders 34, trading
   platform 50 may transmit acceptance messages 32 to the internal manager server 30. The
20 internal manager server 30 may calculate latency values 14 and transmit the calculated
   latency values 14 to trading platform 50. Thus, trading system 10 may monitor the latency
   associated with the interfaces, components, and/or servers that not associated with network
   60 and/or that are internal to the business entity that maintains and/or operates trading
   platform 50.
25         Manager servers 30 may be communicatively coupled to gateway servers 40.
   Gateway servers 40 generally support communication between clients 20, manager servers
   30, and trading platform 50. As clients 20 log into trading system 10, gateway servers 40
   may perform authentication, load balancing, and/or other suitable functions. A particular
   gateway server 40 may comprise any suitable combination of hardware and/or software
30 implemented in one or more modules to provide the described functions and operations. In
   some embodiments, gateway server 40 may comprise a general-purpose personal computer

   suitable processing device.

                                                  10
            Gateway server 40 may be communicatively coupled to trading platform 50.
   Trading platform 50 is generally operable to process, route, and match trading orders 12
   from traders 22. Trading platform 50 is operable to process trading orders 12 by filling
   orders 12a with one or more corresponding counterorders 12b. Trading platform 50 may
 5 include any suitable combination of hardware, software, personnel, devices, components,
   elements, or objects that may be utilized or implemented to achieve the operations and
   functions of an administrative body or a supervising entity that manages or administers a
   trading environment. In some embodiments, trading platform 50 may comprise platform
   memory 46 and platform processor 48.
10          Platform memory 46 comprises any suitable arrangement of random access memory
   (RAM), read only memory (ROM), magnetic computer disk, CD-ROM, or other magnetic
   or optical storage media, or any other volatile or non-volatile memory devices that store one
   or more files, lists, tables, or other arrangements of information such as trading orders 12.
   Although FIGURE 1 illustrates platform memory 46 as internal to trading platform 50, it
15 should be understood that platform memory 46 may be internal or external to components
   of trading system 10, depending on particular implementations. Also, platform memory 46
   may be separate from or integral to other memory devices to achieve any suitable
   arrangement of memory devices for use in trading system 10.            According to certain
   embodiments, platform memory 46 may comprise inbound queue 52, order books 54,
20 latency value log 56, configurable conditions 16, timer queue 58, and platform rules 62.
            Inbound queue 52 may represent an intake queue of trading orders 12, change
   orders 26, and/or test orders 34 received from gateway server 40. Prior to performing the
   initial processing of a particular trading order 12, change order 26, and/or test order 34,
   trading platform 50 may store the particular trading order 12, change order 26, and/or test
25 order 34 in inbound queue 52. The trading orders 12, change orders 26, and/or test orders
   34 in inbound queue 52 may be stored in chronological sequence and processed according
   to a first-in first-out ("FIFO") sequence. Once a particular trading order 12, change order
   26, and/or test order 34 has passed through inbound queue 52, trading platform 50 may
   generate acceptance message 32 and assign trading order 12, change order 26, and/or test
30 order 34 to the appropriate order book 54 in platform memory 46. In some embodiments,
   because trading platform 50 may generate acceptance message 32 after trading order 12,
   change order 26, and/or test order 34 passes through inbound queue 52, latency value 14
   may be based at least in part on inbound queue 52.

                                                 11
           Order books 54 represent queues, tables, or lists for storing, sorting, and processing
   information regarding trading orders 12 received from traders 22. Each order book 54 in
   memory may be associated with a respective trading product.          In some embodiments, a
   particular order book 54 may be associated with a particular type of trading order 12. For
 5 example, platform memory 46 may comprise a first order book 54 associated with a first
   security and a second order book 54 associated with a second security.                In some
   embodiments, a particular trading product may be associated with a first order book 54 for
   bids (e.g., "bid book") and a second order book 54 for offers (e.g., "offer book").
           Trading platform 50 may monitor trading orders 12 in order books 54 to identify
10 matches between orders 12a and counterorders 12b. In some embodiments, order 12a and
   counterorder 12b match if they are for the same trading product and for the same price. For
   example, a bid for Trading Product X at $10.00 per unit matches an offer of Trading
   Product X at $10.00 per unit. According to certain embodiments, trading platform 50 may
   match order 12a and counterorder 12b if their prices cross. For example, trading platform
15 50 may match a bid for Trading Product X at $10.00 per unit with an offer of Trading
   Product X at $9.00 per unit.       In certain embodiments, counterorder 12b may be an
   aggressive trading order 12 that does not specify a particular trading product. For example,
   counterorder 12b may be a "hit" for Trading Product X that targets the current best bid
   price. Accordingly, if the best bid for Trading Product X is associated with a price of $11,
20 trading platform 50 may match the "hit" to the bid and execute the trade at a price of $11.
   It should be understood that trading platform 50 is operable to match orders 12a and
   counterorders 12b of any suitable type and for any suitable trading product.
           Upon identifying a match between order 12a and counterorder 12b in order book 54,
   trading platform 50 may generate a potential trade record 64. Potential trade record 64
25 represents an entry, message, or other suitable indicator that a match has been identified
   between a particular order 12a and a particular counterorder 12b. Potential trade record 64
   may indicate the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b that have been identified as
   matching. Trading platform 50 may then store the potential trade record 64 in timer queue
   58.
30         Timer queue 58 represents a queue, table, or list for storing and managing potential
   trade records 64. Timer queue 58 may be associated with a configurable period 18 of time.
   When a particular trade record is stored in timer queue 58, trading platform 50 may initiate
   the configurable period 18. When the configurable period 18 expires, trading platform 50

                                                  12
   may determine whether the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b associated with the
   potential trade record 64 still match. If the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b match
   upon expiration of the configurable period 18, trading platform 50 may execute a trade with
   the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b. However, if the particular order 12a and
 5 counterorder 12b do not match upon expiration of the configurable period 18, trading
   platform 50 may prevent the trade involving the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b.
           In some embodiments, timer queue 58 may be associated with a callback function.
   When the configurable period 18 expires, platform processor 48 may be notified and
   prompted to determine whether the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b associated
10 with the potential trade record 64 still match. In some embodiments, timer queue 58 may
   store multiple potential trade records 64. As each potential trade record 64 is entered in
   timer queue 58, a respective configurable period 18 may be initiated for that potential trade
   record 64. Thus, configurable period 18 for a first potential trade record 64 may, in some
   embodiments, overlap with configurable period 18 for a second potential trade record 64.
15         During configurable period 18 associated with a particular order 12a and
   counterorder 12b, the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b may remain listed in order
   books 54. According to certain embodiments, trading platform 50 may receive, during
   configurable period 18, change order 26 associated with the particular order 12a or
   counterorder 12b. In some embodiments, trading platform 50 may cancel the particular
20 order 12a or counterorder 12b based at least in part on received change order 26. In other
   embodiments, trading platform 50 may change the price, the quantity, and/or other
   characteristic of order 12a or counterorder 12b based at least in part on the received change
   order 26. If change order 26 causes the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b to not
   match, then, upon expiration of configurable period 18, trading platform 50 may prevent
25 the execution of a trade between the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b.
           In some embodiments, preventing the execution of the trade between order 12a and
   counterorder 12b may comprise deleting order 12a and/or counterorder 12b from order
   book 54, moving order 12a or counterorder 12b to a different order book 54, assigning
   market priority to a third trading order 12, and/or matching order 12a or counterorder 12b
30 with a third trading order 12.
           An example illustrates certain embodiments. Trader A submits to trading platform
   50 Bid A for Trading Product X at $10.00 per share. Trading platform 50 stores Bid A in
   order book 54. Subsequently, Trader B submits to trading platform 50 Offer B for Trading

                                                 13
   Product X at $10.00 per share. Trading platform 50 stores Offer B in order book 54 and
   identifies a match between Bid A and Offer B. Trading platform 50 generates potential
   trade record 64 associated with Bid A and Offer B and stores potential trade record 64 in
   timer queue 58. Upon storing potential trade record 64 in timer queue 58, trading platform
 5 50 initiates configurable period 18. During configurable period 18, trading platform 50
   receives change order 26 from Trader A. Change order 26 directs trading platform 50 to
   cancel Bid A. Accordingly, trading platform 50 cancels Bid A. In this example, trading
   platform 50 deletes Bid A from order book 54. Subsequently, configurable period 18
   expires. Upon expiration of configurable period 18, platform processor 48 scans for Bid A
10 and Offer B in order book(s) 54 and determines that, because Bid A was canceled, there is
   no match between Bid A and Offer B. Accordingly, trading platform 50 does not execute
   trade involving Bid A and Offer B.
            In the foregoing example, if trading platform 50 had, upon initially identifying the
   match, executed a trade involving Bid A and Offer B rather than initiate the configurable
15 period 18, the particular change order 26 from Trader A would not have been received in
   time to prevent the trade. If Trader A submitted the particular change order 26 prior to
   Offer B and if the particular change order 26 was delayed due to latency in trading system
   10, the latency in trading system 10 would have contributed to the execution of a trade that
   Trader A did not want. The execution of unwanted trades may discourage Trader A from
20 submitting trading orders 12. Thus, by avoiding the execution of unwanted trades, trading
   platform 50 may increase the number of trading orders 12 submitted by traders 22, which
   may increase liquidity in trading system 10.
            In the foregoing example, the price of Trading Product X was expressed in dollars.
   It should be understood, however, that the price of a particular trading product may be
25 expressed according to any currency, rate, or other suitable unit.
            As explained above, platform memory 46 may comprise latency value log 56.
   Latency value log 56 comprises one or more latency values 14 received from manager
   servers 30 and/or determined by trading platfrom 50. In some embodiments, latency value
   log 56 may comprise latency values 14 associated with clients 20, manager servers 30,
30 gateway server 40, trading platform 50, network 60, and/or any number and combination of
   hardware and/or software in trading system 10. According to certain embodiments, latency
   value log 56 may comprise historic latency values 14 associated with a particular manager
   server 30. In other embodiments, latency value log 56 may comprise a plurality of current

                                                14
   latency values 14, wherein each current latency value 14 is associated with a respective
   manager server 30.
           Platform memory 46 may further comprise one or more configurable conditions 16.
   Configurable condition 16 may specify a threshold, limitation, characteristic, and/or criteria
 5 associated with latency values 14 in latency value log 56 and/or with configurable period
   18 associated with timer queue 58. For example, configurable condition 16 may specify
   that, if latency value 14 in latency value log 56 satisfies a configurable threshold, then
   configurable period 18 is set to a particular amount of time.         As another example,
   configurable condition 16 may specify that, if latency value 14 does not satisfy a
10 configurable threshold, then configurable period 18 is set to zero.      Thus, configurable
   period 18 may be based at least in part on latency value(s) 14 in latency value log 56. It
   should be understood that platform memory 46 may comprise any suitable number and
   combination of configurable conditions 16.
           In some embodiments, upon receiving trading order 12, trading platform 50 may
15 determine the particular trader 22, client 20, and/or manager server 30 that submitted
   trading order 12.   According to certain embodiments, configurable period 18 associated
   with a particular trading order 12 may based at least in part on the particular trader 22,
   client 20, and/or manager server 30 that submitted the particular trading order 12.       For
   example, trading order 12 from client 20 and/or manager server 30 associated with a
20 particular latency value 14 may be assigned a different configurable period 18 than trading
   order 12 from a different client 20 and/or manager server 30 associated with a different
   latency value 14.
           As explained above, platform memory 46 may comprise platform rules 62.
   Platform rules 62 comprise software instructions for performing the described functions and
25 operations.
           Platform memory 46 may be communicatively coupled to platform processor 48.
   Platform processor 48 is generally operable to execute platform rules 62 stored in platform
   memory 46. Platform processor 48 comprises any suitable combination of hardware and
   software implemented in one or more modules to provide the described function or
30 operation.
           It should be understood that the internal structure of trading platform 50 and the
   interfaces, processors, and memory devices associated therewith is malleable and can be

                                                15
   readily changed, modified, rearranged, or reconfigured to achieve the intended operations
   of trading platform 50.
           As explained above, clients 20, manager servers 30, gateway servers 40, and trading
   platform 50 may be communicatively coupled via one or more networks 60. Network 60
 5 may represent any number and combination of wireline and/or wireless networks suitable
   for data transmission.     Network 60 may, for example, communicate internet protocol
   packets, frame relay frames, asynchronous transfer mode cells, and/or other suitable
   information between network addresses. Network 60 may include one or more intranets,
   local area networks, metropolitan area networks, wide area networks, cellular networks, all
10 or a portion of the Internet, and/or any other communication system or systems at one or
   more locations.
           It should be understood that the internal structure of trading system 10 and the
   servers, processors, and memory devices associated therewith is malleable and can be
   readily changed, modified, rearranged, or reconfigured to achieve the intended operations
15 of trading system 10. In particular, although FIGURE 1 illustrates gateway server 40 as
   separate from trading platform 50, it should be understood that, in some embodiments,
   trading platform 50 may be operable to perform the functions and operations of gateway
   server 40.
           In operation, trading system 10 is operable to use and manage latency values 14 in
20 processing trading orders 12. According to certain embodiments, manager server 30 may
   generate and transmit test order 34 to trading platform 50. Trading platform 50 may store
   test order 34 in inbound queue 52 in memory. Upon retrieving test order 34 from inbound
   queue 52, trading platform 50 may generate and transmit acceptance message 32 to
   manager server 30.     In some embodiments, based at least in part on the time at which
25 manager server 30 transmitted test order 34 and on the time at which manager server 30
   received acceptance message 32, manager server 30 may determine latency value 14.
   Manager server 30 may then transmit latency value 14 to trading platform 50.
           In other embodiments, latency value 14 may be associated with the one-way
   transmission of test order 34 and/or other message(s).      For example, test order 34 may
30 comprise a particular time value representing the time at which manager server 30
   transmitted test order 34 to trading platform 50. Upon receiving test order 34, trading
   platform 50 may, based at least in part on the particular time value in test order 34 and the

                                                  16
   time at which trading platform 50 received test order 34, determine latency value 14
   associated with the one-way transmission of test order 34 from manager server 30.
            According to certain embodiments, trading platform 50 may receive trading orders
   12 from clients 20. Trading platform 50 may store trading orders 12 in order books 54 in
 5 platform memory 46.        Upon identifying a match between a particular order 12a and
   counterorder 12b in order book 54, trading platform 50 may generate in time queue
   potential trade record 64 associated with the particular order 12a and counterorder 12b.
   Upon generating potential trade record 64, trading platform 50 may initiate configurable
   period 18.    Configurable period 18 may be based at least in part on one or more latecy
10 values 14 received and/or determined by trading platform 50. During configurable period
   18 associated with a particular order 12a and counterorder 12b, the particular order 12a and
   counterorder 12b may remain stored in order books 54.
            During configurable period 18, trading platform 50 may receive change order 26
   associated with the particular order 12a or counterorder 12b. In some embodiments, trading
15 platform 50 may cancel the particular order 12a or counterorder 12b based at least in part
   on the received change order 26. In other embodiments, trading platform 50 may change
   the price, the quantity, and/or other characteristic of order 12a or counterorder 12b based at
   least in part on received change order 26. If change order 26 causes the particular order 12a
   and counterorder 12b to not match, then trading platform 50 may, upon expiration of
20 configurable period 18, prevent the execution of a trade between the particular order 12a
   and counterorder 12b. Preventing the execution of the trade between the particular order
   12a and counterorder 12b may comprise deleting the particular order 12a or counterorder
   12b from order book 54, moving the order 12a or counterorder 12b to a different order book
   54, assigning market priority to a third trading order 12, and/or matching the particular
25 order 12a or counterorder 12b with a third trading order 12.
            FIGURE 2 illustrates an example platform memory 46, which comprises order
   books 54, latency value log 56, configurable conditions 16, inbound queue 52, and timer
   queue 58, according to certain embodiments.           In this example, latency value log 56
   comprises latency values 14 associated with a plurality of manager servers 30.           Each
30 latency value 14 was received from a respective manager server 30. Manager server 30 is
   operable to determine latency value 14 based at least in part on test order 34 and acceptance
   message 32. In particular, manager server 30 transmits test order 34 to trading platform 50.
   Upon receiving test order 34, trading platform 50 may generate and transmit acceptance

                                                    17
   message 32 to manager server 30. Based at least in part on the time at which manager
   server 30 transmitted test order 34 and on the time at which manager server 30 received
   acceptance message 32, manager server 30 may determine latency value 14.                Manager
   server 30 may then transmit latency value 14 to trading platform 50.
 5         In this example, latency value log 56 in platform memory 46 comprises latency
   values 14 from a plurality of manager servers 30.           In particular, Manager Server A is
   associated with latency value 14 of 0.22 seconds, Manager Server B is associated with
   latency value 14 of 0.31 seconds, Manager Server C is associated with latency value 14 of
   0.57 seconds, and Manager Server D is associated with latency value 14 of 0.12 seconds.
10         The example platform memory 46 further comprises multiple configurable
   conditions 16. The first configurable condition 16 is that, if all latency values 14 in latency
   value log 56 are equal to or less than 0.30 seconds, then configurable period 18 is zero. The
   second configurable condition 16 is that, if any latency value 14 in latency value log 56 is
   between 0.30 seconds and 0.60 seconds, then configurable period 18 is 0.20 seconds. The
15 third configurable condition 16 is that, if any latency value 14 in latency value log 56 is
   equal to or more than 0.60 seconds, then configurable period 18 is 0.40 seconds.
           Although this    example     illustrates   particular   latency ranges     and particular
   configurable periods 18 of time, it should be understood that latency ranges and/or other
   values associated with configurable condition 16 and/or configurable period 18 may be
20 below, within, or above the illustrated values and/or ranges.
           In this example, platform memory 46 further comprises two order books 54 -- bid
   book 54 and offer book 54. Initially, bid book 54 comprises Bid A associated with a price
   of $6.00 and Bid B associated with a price of $8.00.          Initially, offer book 54 comprises
   Offer M associated with a price of $8.00.
25         Platform processor 48 monitors bid book 54 and offer book 54 to identify any
   matches between orders 12a and counterorders 12b.              In this example, at 14:22:27.04,
   platform processor 48 determines that Offer M matches Bid B. Platform processor 48 then
   generates and stores in timer queue 58 potential trade record 64 associated with Offer M
   and Bid B.      Because latency value log 56 comprises latency values 14 between 0.30
30 seconds and 0.60 seconds, configurable period 18 associated with timer queue 58 is 0.20
   seconds. In this example, during configurable period 18, platform processor 48 does not
   retrieve from timer queue 58 any change orders 26 associated with Offer M and Bid B.
   When configurable period 18 expires at 14:22:27.24, trading platform 50 scans order books

                                                 18
   54 and determines that Offer M and Bid B still match. Accordingly, trading platform 50
   executes a trade with Offer M and Bid B.
            Platform processor 48 subsequently retrieves from inbound queue 52 Bid C
   associated with a price of $8.00.     Platform processor 48 stores Bid C in bid book 54.
 5 Platform processor 48 then retrieves from inbound queue 52 Offer N associated with a price
   of $8.00. After storing Offer N in offer book 54, platform processor 48 determines, at
   14:23:38.24, that Offer N matches Bid C. Platform processor 48 then generates and stores
   in timer queue 58 potential trade record 64 associated with Offer N and Bid C. During
   configurable period 18 associated with potential trade record 64 for Offer N and Bid C
10 (e.g., prior to 14:23:38.44), platform processor 48 retrieves from inbound queue 52 change
   order 26 that instructs platform processor 48 to cancel Bid C.         As a result, platform
   processor 48 deletes Bid C from bid book 54. In this example, when configurable period
   18 expires at 14:23:38.44, platform processor 48 scans order books 54 and determines that
   the previously identified match between Bid C and Offer N is no longer valid because Bid
15 C has been canceled. Accordingly, trading platform 50 does not execute a trade with Bid C
   and Offer N.
            The example inbound queue 52 comprises multiple trading orders 12, change orders
   26, and test orders 34 waiting to be processed by platform processor 48. In this example,
   test orders 34 in inbound queue 52 are not associated with prices. Test order 34 represents
20 a dummy order and/or an artificial order.       Because test order 34 is associated with an
   artificial trading product, trading platform 50 does not execute any trades involving test
   orders 34.
            In the foregoing example, the price of trading orders 12 was expressed in dollars. It
   should be understood, however, that the price of a particular trading product may be
25 expressed according to any currency, rate, or other suitable unit.
            In the foregoing example, latency values 14 are expressed in seconds. It should be
   understood, however, that latency values 14 may be expressed according to any suitable
   unit and/or combination of units.
            In the foregoing example, manager server 30 determines latency values 14.          It
30 should be understood that, in some embodiments, manager server 30 and/or trading
   platform 50 may determine latency values 14 that are associated with one-way and/or
   round-trip communications.

                                                  19
            The foregoing example illustrates configurable periods 18 of 0.20 seconds and 0.40
   seconds. It should be understood that configurable period 18 may be any suitable amount
   of time.
            The invention has several important technical advantages. Various embodiments of
 5 the invention may have none, some, or all of these advantages.          One advantage is that
   trading platform 50 is operable to monitor and compensate for latency in trading system 10.
   In particular, upon identifying a potential trade involving order 12a and counterorder 12b,
   trading platform 50 is operable to enter potential trade record 64 in timer queue 58
   associated with configurable period 18. Upon expiration of configurable period 18, trading
10 platform 50 is operable to determine whether the potential trade is still valid. If trading
   platform 50 determines that the potential trade is no longer valid, trading platform 50 may
   prevent the execution of the potential trade. Thus, trading system 10 may prevent the
   execution of unwanted trades. Trading system 10 may thereby encourage traders 22 to
   participate in trading activity. An increase in trading activity may increase liquidity in
15 trading system 10.
            FIGURE 3 illustrates a flowchart for providing latency protection for trading orders
   12, according to certain embodiments.        The method begins at step 302 when trading
   platform 50 receives test order 34 from manager server 30. Trading platform 50 may
   initially store test order 34 in inbound queue 52.      Upon retrieving test order 34 from
20 inbound queue 52, platform processor 48 may generate acceptance message 32. At step
   304, platform processor 48 transmits acceptance message 32 to manager server 30. Upon
   receiving acceptance message 32, manager server 30 determines latency value 14. Latency
   value 14 may be based at least in part on the particular time at which test order 34 was sent
   to trading platform 50 and the particular time at which manager server 30 received
25 acceptance message 32. At step 306, platform processor 48 receives latency value 14 from
   manager server 30.
            At step 308, platform processor 48 identifies a potential trade associated with order
   12a and counterorder 12b stored in order books 54 in platform memory 46. At step 310,
   platform processor 48 determines whether the received latency value 14 satisfies
30 configurable condition 16.      In some embodiments, configurable condition 16 may be
   associated with a latency value threshold. If platform processor 48 determines at step 310
   that latency value 14 does not satisfy configurable condition 16, then the method may

                                                   20
   proceed to step 316. At step 316, platform processor 48 executes the trade with order 12a
   and counterorder 12b.
            If, however, platform processor 48 determines at step 310 that latency value 14
   satisfies configurable condition 16, then at step 312 platform processor 48 initiates
 5 configurable period 18. Upon expiration of the configurable period 18, platform processor
   48 determines at step 314 whether order 12a still matches counterorder 12b. If platform
   processor 48 determines at step 314 that order 12a still matches counterorder 12b, then at
   step 316 platform processor 48 executes the trade with order 12a and counterorder 12b. If,
   however, platform processor 48 determines at step 314 that order 12a does not match
10 counterorder 12b, then at step 318 platform processor 48 prevents the execution of the
   potential trade. In some embodiments, preventing the execution of the trade between order
   12a and counterorder 12b may comprise deleting order 12a and/or counterorder 12b from
   order book 54, moving order 12a or counterorder 12b to a different order book 54,
   assigning market priority to a third trading order 12, and/or matching order 12a or
15 counterorder 12b with a third trading order 12. The method then ends.

   myriad of changes and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art, and it is
   intended that the present invention encompass such changes and modifications as fall
   within the scope of the present appended claims.
