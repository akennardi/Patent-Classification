                                                        FIELD
[0002] The present disclosure relates to systems and apparatuses for performing automated
reagent-based biochemical assays.
                                           BACKGROUND INFORMATION
[0003] Automated molecular assay instrumentation offers numerous advantages, however
most automated instruments suffer from a limited set of assay capabilities. These limited
capabilities complicate or inhibit parallel processing of multiple assays and, as a result,
reduce sample throughput and flexibility in assay choices.                   This is particularly true for
sensitive assays such as those involving nucleic acid detection and/or an amplification
procedure. There are many procedures in use for amplifying nucleic acids, including the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), (see, e.g., Mullis, "Process for Amplifying, Detecting,
and/or Cloning Nucleic Acid Sequences," U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195), transcription-mediated
amplification (TMA), (see, e.g., Kacian et al., "Nucleic Acid Sequence Amplification
Methods," U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,491), ligase chain reaction (LCR), (see, e.g., Birkenmeyer,
"Amplification of Target Nucleic Acids Using Gap Filling Ligase Chain Reaction," U.S.
Pat. No. 5,427,930), strand displacement amplification (SDA), (see, e.g., Walker, "Strand
Displacement Amplification," U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,166), and loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (see, e.g., Notomi et al., "Process for Synthesizing Nucleic Acid," U.S. Pat.
No. 6,410,278).                  A review of several amplification procedures currently in use, including
PCR         and TMA,                 is provided in   HELEN H.      LEE ET AL.,       NUCLEIC       ACID
AMPLIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES (1997).
[0004] Automated molecular assays incorporate the use of consumable components, which
may or may not hold reagents utilized in the molecular assay to be performed, which can be

manually loaded onto automated instrumentation. Providing such consumable components
that are configured to limit contamination, enhance target detection, simplify loading into
and transport within the system, enhance the operability of mechanical components within
the automated system while lowering cost, and providing high performance in connection
with the assay to be performed is desirable.

by reference herein. No document, however, is admitted to be prior art to the claimed
subject matter.

                                         DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00039]            The present disclosure relates to a system, apparatus, and method for automated
processing of a sample receptacle holder that is adapted for use in an automated instrument
capable of performing nucleic acid-based amplification assays. Also provided are methods
for conducting automated, random-access temperature cycling processes using the same.
[00040]            Before the present systems, methods, and apparatuses are described, it is to be
understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods and experimental
conditions described, as such methods and conditions may vary. It is also to be understood
that the terminology used herein is for purposes of describing particular embodiments only,
and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present disclosure will be limited
only in the appended claims.
[00041]           As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a,"
"an," and "the" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
Thus, for example, references to "the method" includes one or more methods, and/or steps
of the type described herein which will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art
upon reading this disclosure and so forth.
[00042]            The term "comprising,"        which is used interchangeably with "including,"
"containing," "having," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended language and does
not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps.                The phrase "consisting of'
excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. The phrase "consisting
essentially of' limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps and those that
do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the disclosed subject matter.
The present disclosure contemplates exemplary embodiments of an apparatus and methods
                                                        11
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

of use thereof corresponding to the scope of each of these phrases. Thus, an apparatus or
method comprising recited elements or steps contemplates particular embodiments in which
the apparatus or method consists essentially of or consists of those elements or steps.
[00043]           Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the
same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this
disclosure belongs.                Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
described herein can be used in the practice or testing disclosed herein, the preferred
methods and materials are now described.
[00044]           As used herein, a "reaction mixture" refers to a volume of fluid comprising one
or more of a target-specific reagent, diluent for reconstituting a lyophilized reagent, one or
more nucleotides, an enzyme, and a sample containing or suspected of containing a nucleic
acid.
[00045]           As used herein, a "sample" or a "test sample" refers to any substance suspected
of containing a target organism or biological molecule, such as nucleic acid. The substance
may be, for example, an unprocessed clinical specimen, a buffered medium containing the
specimen, a medium containing the specimen and lytic agents for releasing nucleic acid
belonging to the target organism, or a medium containing nucleic acid derived from a target
organism which has been isolated and/or purified in a reaction receptacle or on a reaction
material or device. In some instances, a sample or test sample may comprise a product of a
biological specimen, such as an amplified nucleic acid to be detected.
[00046]           As used herein, the term "biochemical assay" refers to a scientific investigative
procedure for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence or amount or
the functional activity of a target entity, such as, but not limited to, a biochemical substance,
a cell, organic sample, or target nucleic acid sequence. Included in the term "biochemical
assay" are nucleic acid amplification and heat denaturation (i.e., melting).           Nucleic acid
melting typically involves precise warming of a double stranded nucleic acid molecule to a
temperature at which the two strands separate or "melt" apart.                 The melting process
typically occurs at a temperature of about 50'C to about 95'C.
                                                       12
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[00047]           As used herein, the term lyophilizationn" refers to a dehydration process that is
typically used to preserve a perishable material and/or facilitate transport thereof. Thus,
"conditions for lyophilization" refer to subjecting a liquid material and/or a vessel
containing the liquid material to freezing conditions while reducing the surrounding
pressure to allow the frozen water within the material to sublimate directly from the solid
phase to the gas phase. Such freezing conditions may include cooling the material below
the lowest temperature at which the solid and liquid phases thereof can coexist (known in
the art as the "triple point"). Usually, the freezing temperatures are between -50 'C and
-80 'C, however, one of skill in the art can determine the appropriate freezing temperature
to lyophilize the reagent for use in the automated biochemical assay.
[00048]           As used herein, the term "reconstituting" refers to the act of returning a
lyophilized material to its liquid form. Thus, the term encompasses contacting a fluid, e.g.,
water or other suitable diluent, with a lyophilized reagent for sufficient time to allow the
lyophilized reagent to absorb water, thereby forming a stabilized liquid reagent.
Receptacle & Cap
[00049]           Accordingly, in an exemplary aspect, there is provided a receptacle 100 to receive
and store fluid test samples for subsequent analysis, including analysis with nucleic acid
based assays or immunoassays diagnostic for a particular pathogenic organism. As shown
in FIGS. 1A-ID, the receptacle 100 is a single-piece receptacle that includes a body 105
having a generally cylindrical upper portion 110 and a tapered lower portion 120. Formed
on an outer surface of the body 105 is a laterally-extending flange, which, in the illustrated
embodiment, comprises an annular ring 125, which separates the upper and lower portions
of the body. The upper portion 110 of the body 105 has an open end 145 through which
fluid samples are deposited or removed from the receptacle 100. The tapered lower portion
120 has a closed end 150 that may either be flat or rounded                     to provide optical
communication with an optical system, for example, one or more optical fibers (not shown)
of a biochemical analyzer. In various embodiments, the bottom surface of the closed-ended
lower portion may be flat or curved.
[00050]            The receptacle 100 optionally containing a sample or reaction mixture is
configured for insertion into a receptacle holder of an automated biochemical analyzer (not
                                                    13
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

shown). As used herein, a receptacle that is "configured for insertion" refers to the exterior
surface of the body 105 of the receptacle 100 being sized and shaped to maximize contact
between the receptacle and a receptacle well of a receptacle holder.                    In certain
embodiments, this maximal contact refers to physical contact of the receptacle well with at
least a portion of the receptacle 100. Also in certain embodiments, this maximal contact
refers to physical contact of the receptacle well with the tapered lower portion 120 of the
receptacle 100, or at least a portion the tapered lower portion 120 of the receptacle 100.
[00051]            Formed in the inner surface 140 of the upper portion 110 of the body 105 is one
or more longitudinally oriented grooves 135 to facilitate the venting of air displaced from
the interior upon deposit of the test sample or attachment of a cap 200 to the receptacle 100.
In various embodiments, a plurality (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8) of longitudinally oriented
grooves may be formed in the inner surface 140 of the upper portion 110, and the grooves
135 may be equally spaced apart from one another around the entire circumference of the
body 105.
[00052]            Circumscribing the open end 145 of the upper portion 110 of the body 105 is a lip
155 extending radially outward from a central axis thereof. In various embodiments, the lip
155 tapers from the outer-most portion of the radially-extended lip towards the open end of
the body, and is configured for securable attachment to a cap 200 (FIGS. 2A-2D).
[00053]            With reference now to FIGS. 2A-2D, the securable cap 200 includes a lower
portion 220 having an outer surface for sealing engagement of the inner surface 140 of the
upper portion 110 of the receptacle 100 and an upper portion 210. To ensure an essentially
leak-proof seal when the cap 200 is securely attached to the open end 145 of the upper
portion 110 of the receptacle 100, the outer surface of the lower portion 220 of the cap 200
is formed with one or more annular ribs 230 for contacting the inner surface 140 of the
upper portion 110 thereof. In various embodiments, the lower portion 220 of the cap 200 is
formed with 1, 2, or 3 annular ribs 230 for contacting the inner surface 140 of the upper
portion 110 of the receptacle 100.
[00054]            The upper portion 210 of the cap 200 includes an open end 215 for frictional
attachment to a portion of a receptacle transport mechanism 300 (FIG. 3A), such as a
tubular probe of a pipettor or pick-and-place robot.           Guiding insertion of the receptacle
                                                    14
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

transport mechanism 300 into the open end 215 of the upper portion 210 of the cap 200 are
one or more linear ribs 260 formed in the inner surface 270 of the upper portion 210. The
linear ribs 260 protrude towards an axial center of the cap 200, thereby decreasing the inner
fitment diameter of the upper portion 210 of the cap 200.             Each linear rib 260 may be
beveled (as at 262) at an upper, or proximal, end thereof. These linear ribs 260 can, among
other things, enhance the frictional attachment to the receptacle transport mechanism 300.
In various embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 linear ribs 260 are formed in the inner
surface 270 of the cap 200 and extend at least a portion of the way down the length of the
upper portion 210 thereof.
[00055]           At least one of the linear ribs 260 may be formed with a portion 265 thereof, e.g.,
at a lower, or distal, end, that gradually tapers radially inward toward a central axis of the
upper portion 210 of the cap. In other words, the amount of protrusion of the linear rib 260
may gradually increase in size as the linear rib 260 approaches the bottom 245 of the upper
portion 210 of the cap 200. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, in certain embodiments,
the linear rib 260 may gradually increase in overall thickness as it approaches the bottom
245 of the upper portion 210 of the cap 200. Thus, gradual increase in thickness or radial
geometry is contemplated for the gradual tapering of the one or more linear ribs 260, which
serves to stabilize and center the receptacle transport mechanism 300 as it is lowered into
the cap 200 for transport.
[00056]            Corresponding with each linear rib 260 and disposed on the exterior surface of
the upper portion 210 of the cap 200 are one or more indentations, or recesses, 234 that
extend along at least part of the length thereof. The recesses may be formed in any shape
such as, for example, concave, notched, squared, etc.             Thus, at least one recess 234 is
formed in the exterior surface of the upper portion 210 of the cap 200.                  In various
embodiments, the length of the recess 234 is the same as the length of the corresponding
linear rib 260, and each linear rib 260 is positioned such that it lies on the inner surface 270
of the cap 200 in a location that directly opposes the position of the at least one recess 234
formed on the outer surface of the cap 200 in a one-to-one relationship. The coupling of a
linear rib 260 with an recess 234 in this manner enhances the predictability of the frictional
attachment of the cap 200 to a receptacle transport mechanism 300.                       In certain
embodiments, as the receptacle transport mechanism 300 is lowered into the open end 215
                                                      15
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

of the cap 200, it contacts the one or more linear ribs 260, thereby pressing against the one
or more linear ribs 260. Such pressing against the linear ribs 260 causes the cap 200, and
recesses 234 to flex and/or expand radially outward with respect to the axial center thereof
to accommodate the receptacle transport mechanism 300 and thus enhance frictional
attachment of the cap 300 to the receptacle transport mechanism 300. Accordingly, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 recesses 234 may be formed on the exterior surface of the upper portion 210
of the cap 200.
[00057]            Circumscribing the open end 215 of the upper portion 210 of the cap 200 is a lip
225 extending radially outward from a central axis thereof. In various embodiments, the lip
225 tapers from the open end 215 towards the lower portion 220. Protruding from the taper
of the lip 225 are a plurality of protrusions 235. The protrusions 235 may be equally spaced
apart from one another and facilitate stacking and/or docking within a well of a multi-well
tray 400 (FIG. 4A) for use in an automated biochemical analyzer. In various embodiments,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 protrusions 235 are formed in the taper of the lip 225.
[00058]            In various embodiments, the cap 200 is removed from the receptacle transport
mechanism 300 by means of a sleeve 306 coaxially disposed over a tip of the receptacle
transport mechanism 300 and axially movable with respect to thereto.              The sleeve 306
moves axially with respect to the tip toward a distal end of the tip and contacts the lip 225 of
the cap, thereby pushing the cap off the tip of the receptacle transport mechanism 300.
[00059]            Separating the upper portion 210 from the lower portion 220 of the cap 200 is a
flange 240 that extends radially away from an axial center thereof. The flange 240 includes
a plurality of locking arms 250 that extend from the flange 240 toward the lower portion
220 of the cap 200. The locking arms 250 are shaped for securely engaging the lip 155 of
the receptacle 100, and may be disposed to allow for removable attachment of the cap 200
to the receptacle 100, while maintaining a leak-proof seal of the contents thereof. In various
embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 locking arms 250 are formed in the cap 200.
[00060]            The flange 240 of the cap 200 additionally serves to form a bottom 245 to
separate the upper portion 210 from the lower portion 220, thereby closing the interior of
the receptacle 100 from the environment.            However, in certain embodiments, the bottom
245 is scored 255 for piercing by a mechanism for collecting and/or adding reagents to the
                                                     16
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

test sample within the receptacle 100. Such piercing avoids the need to remove the secured
cap 200 from engagement with the receptacle 100, while providing access to the contents
therein.
[00061]            The receptacle 100 and cap 200 of the present disclosure may be prepared from a
number of different polymer and heteropolymer resins, including, but not limited to,
polyolefins (e.g., high density polyethylene ("HDPE"), low density polyethylene ("LDPE"),
a mixture of HDPE and LDPE, or polypropylene), polystyrene, high impact polystyrene and
polycarbonate. An example of an HDPE is sold under the trade name Alathon M5370 and
is available from Polymerland of Huntsville, N.C.; an example of an LDPE is sold under the
trade name 722 and is available from The Dow Chemical Company of Midland, Mich.; and
an example of a polypropylene is sold under the trade name Rexene 13T10ACS279 and is
available from the Huntsman Corporation of Salt Lake City, Utah. Although LDPE is a
softer, more malleable material than HDPE, the softness of LDPE provides flexibility in the
locking arms 250 of the cap 200 to securably engage the lip 155 of the receptacle 100. And,
while a cap made of HDPE is more rigid than one made of LDPE, this rigidity tends to
make an HDPE cap more difficult to penetrate than one made of LDPE.                   It should be
understood that the receptacle 100 and cap 200 may be comprised of a combination of
resins, including, for example, a mixture of LDPE and HDPE, preferably in a mixture range
of about 20% LDPE:80% HDPE to about 50% LDPE:50% HDPE by volume. In addition,
the amounts of LDPE and HDPE used to form each of the receptacle 100 and cap 200 may
be the same or different.           In various embodiments, at least a portion of the cap 200 is
formed from an opaque material having low to no autofluorescence characteristics. Also, in
certain embodiments, the portion of the cap 200 formed from an opaque material having
low to no autofluorescence characteristics is at least the lower portion 220 thereof, including
the inner surface 232 of the lower portion 220 of the cap 200.
[00062]            Regardless of the type or mixture of resins chosen, the receptacle 100 and cap
200 are preferably injection molded as unitary pieces using procedures well-known to those
skilled in the art of injection molding, including a multi-gate process for facilitating uniform
resin flow into the receptacle and cap cavities used to form the shapes thereof. Uniform
resin flow is desirable for achieving consistency in thickness, which is important for a
variety of reasons, including for the penetrable bottom 245 of the cap 200; to ensure a
                                                    17
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

secure, such as an air-tight, engagement of the cap 200 and receptacle 100; to ensure a
predictable engagement of the cap 200 with the receptacle transport mechanism 300; and to
ensure maximal contact of the receptacle 100 with a receptacle well of a receptacle holder.
[00063]           As shown in FIG. 3A, the tip of a receptacle transport mechanism 300, (e.g., an
automated pipettor or other pick and place apparatus) may include one or more annular ribs,
as indicated at 302 and 304, for enhancing a frictional, interference fit between the tip 300
and a component into which the tip 300 is inserted, such as the cap 200 or a pipette tip (not
shown). In the case of a cap, such as cap 200, the tip 300 may be inserted into the cap and
removed from the cap several times during the course of a process that is performed using
the cap and a receptacle to which it is attached, such as a diagnostic assay. As the cap may
be made of a plastic material, such repeated insertion and removal of the tip 300 into and
out of the cap may result in creep in the plastic material (permanent or semi-permanent
deformation) that can result in a poor frictional connection between the tip 300 and the cap
200.
[00064]            Thus, in various embodiments, the cap may be provided with internal relief
structures, or detents, that cooperatively engage one or both of the annular ribs 302, 304 to
enhance the securement of the cap to the tip.
[00065]           An embodiment of a cap having such a relief or detent feature is indicated by
reference number 900 in FIG. 3C. Cap 900 includes an upper portion 910, a lower portion
920, an annular flange 940 with locking arms 950 extending axially therefrom, and an
opening 915 that defines an inner-surface 970. In various embodiments, cap 900, like cap
200 described above, is configured to engage a receptacle 100 by means of the locking arms
950 engaging the lip 155 surrounding the opening of the upper portion 110 of the receptacle
100.        The cap 900 further includes a number of longitudinal ribs 960 extending axially
along the inner surface 970. In various embodiments, the ribs 960 are equiangularly spaced
about the inner surface 970. In one embodiment, each rib 960 has associated therewith a
longitudinally-extending indention, or recess, 934 formed on an exterior surface of the
upper portion 910 opposite the rib 960.             The recess 934 may be in the form of a
longitudinally extending, concave groove, which, in various embodiments, may be the same
length as the rib 960. Each rib 960 includes an enlarged portion 965 at a lower distal end
                                                   18
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

thereof. In one embodiment, the rib 960 incudes a tapered transition between the upper
narrower portion of the rib 960 and the larger lower portion 965. Larger portion 965 may
extend through a transition between the generally cylindrical inner surface 970 of the upper
portion 910 and a tapered, e.g., conical, surface 972.
[00066]           As discussed elsewhere in this disclosure, in various embodiments each rib 960
and associated recess 934 cooperate to allow radial flexure of the rib 960 that enables the rib
to conform to the general shape of a portion of a receptacle transfer mechanism inserted into
the cap 900.
[00067]            One or more of the longitudinal ribs 960 further includes a relief, or detent, 964
defined as a portion of the enlarged section 965 of the rib 960 that is removed or scalloped
out, as shown in FIG. 3C to define a concave recess or cavity in the lower end of the rib
960.        As shown in FIG. 3D, each relief 964 receives the lower annular rib 302 of the
receptacle transport mechanism 300. The inter engagement of the annular rib 302 with the
relief 964 enhances the frictional securing of the cap 900 to the receptacle transport
mechanism 300.
[00068]            In various embodiments, a detent 964 is formed in every one of the longitudinal
ribs 960.
[00069]           An alternate embodiment of a cap having a relief, or detent, feature for securing
the cap to a receptacle transport mechanism is indicated by reference number 1000 in FIG.
3E. Cap 1000 includes an upper portion 1010 and a lower portion 1020. An annular flange
1040 extends radially from the cap 1000 and has a plurality of locking arms 1050 extending
axially therefrom. In various embodiments, cap 1000 is configured to interlock with a
receptacle 100 by means of the locking arms 1050 engaging a lip 155 surrounding an
opening at the upper end 110 of the receptacle 100.
[00070]            Cap 1000 has a number of longitudinal ribs 1060 extending axially along an inner
surface of the upper portion 1010. In various embodiments, the ribs 1060 are equiangularly
spaced about the inner surface of the upper portion. In one embodiment, each rib 1060 has
associated therewith a longitudinally-extending indention or recess 1034 formed on an
exterior surface of the upper portion 1010 opposite the rib 1060. The recess 1034 may be in
                                                     19
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

the form of a longitudinally extending, concave groove, which, in various embodiments,
may be the same length as the rib 1060.
[00071]            In various embodiments, each rib 1060 transitions into an enlarged, portion 1065
near a lower, distal end thereof. Various embodiments may include a tapered transition
between the enlarged portion 1065 and a non-enlarged portion of the rib 1060.
[00072]           As discussed elsewhere in this disclosure, in various embodiments each rib 1060
and associated recess 1034 cooperate to allow radial flexure of the rib 1060 that enables the
rib to conform to the general shape of a portion of a receptacle transfer mechanism inserted
into the cap 1000.
[00073]           A relief, or detent, is provided in one or more of the ribs 1060 by a window, or
opening, 1064 cutout of the cap 1000 near the transition between the upper, relatively
straight-sided surface 1070 and the lower, tapered portion 1072 of the upper portion 1010.
As shown in FIG. 3E, each opening 1064, combined with the enlarged portion 1065 of the
rib 1060 located directly above each opening 1064, forms a relief or detent that receives the
lower annular rib 302 of the receptacle transport mechanism 300. In various embodiments,
an opening 1064 is provided in each of at least two ribs 960. In various embodiments, two
openings 1064 are provided at diametrically opposed positions.
[00074]            The relief, or detent structure, provided by the opening 1064 of cap 1000 or the
relief 964 or detent of cap 900 physically engages a portion of the tip 300, such as the
annular rib 302, to frictionally secure the cap 900, 1000 on to the receptacle transport
mechanism 300 with minimal or no deformation of the plastic material in the vicinity of the
relief, thereby avoiding or limiting creep of the plastic material in the vicinity of the detent.
Method for Automated Removal of a Cap
[00075]            Occasionally, after process is performed on the cap-receptacle assembly and its
contents,           such as, for example, centrifugation       or incubation under isothermal    or
thermocycling conditions, it is necessary to access the interior of the receptacle to remove
substances therefrom and/or to add substances thereto. Accordingly, in such instances, it
becomes necessary to remove the cap 200 (or 900 or 100), from the receptacle 100 to which
it is lockingly attached.

[00076]            In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method for automated removal of a cap
from a capped reaction receptacle.              The method includes providing a receptacle 100
securably engaging the lip 155 of a receptacle 100, as shown in FIG. 3B.              Thereafter,
performing an automated motion of contacting an inner portion 280 of at least one of the
plurality of locking arms 250 of the cap 200 with a raised annular ridge defined around a
receptacle slot. The receptacle slot may be provided in a receptacle holder of an automated
biochemical analyzer, alternatively the receptacle slot may be provided in a card or
cartridge intended to be removed from an automated biochemical analyzer. The contacting
urges the locking arms 250 away from the lip 155 of the receptacle 100, thereby
disengaging the cap 200 from the receptacle 100. While the cap 200 is being disengaged
from the receptacle 100, an automated motion is performed to lift the cap 200 away from
the receptacle 100, thereby removing the cap 200 from the receptacle 100.              In various
embodiments, the automated motion is performed by a receptacle transport mechanism 300
(FIG. 3A), such as, for example, a pipettor or pick-and-place robot.
[00077]           An apparatus for removing a cap from a receptacle in an automated fashion is
indicated by reference number 1260 in FIGS. 12 and 13. FIGS. 12 and 13 are partial top
and bottom perspective views, respectively, of a cap removal tray 1260. The tray 1260
includes a base 1262 generally surrounding the tray, and a top wall 1264 supported on the
base 1262. An assembly comprising the cap 200 and receptacle 100 is shown inserted into
one of the plurality of cap removal stations 1266 for removing the cap 200 from the
receptacle 100, as will be described below. As shown in FIG. 13, when inserted into an
opening 1268 of the cap removal station 1266, the receptacle 100 extends below the top
wall 1264. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the base 1262 has sufficient height to
accommodate the length of the receptacle 100 projecting through the cap removal station
1266 and beneath the top wall 1264.
[00078]            In FIGS. 12 and 13, which are partial views of the cap removal tray 1260, a
matrix of nine cap removal stations 1266 is shown. The cap removal tray 1260 may have
any number of cap removal stations 1266.                In various embodiments, the cap removal
stations 1266 are oriented in aligned rows and columns. As will be described below, after
the cap 200 is removed from the receptacle 100, the receptacle 100 remains within the cap
removal station 1266. Accordingly, by orienting the cap removal stations 1266 in aligned
                                                     21
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

rows and columns, a spatially indexed orientation is provided so that a receptacle transport
mechanism (e.g., an automated pipettor) can accurately identify and/or access any of the
receptacles retained within the cap removal tray 1260.
[00079]            Each cap removal station includes a raised collar 1270 surrounding the opening
1268 and extending above the top wall 1264. A plurality of resilient tabs 1272, e.g., four,
surround the opening 1268 and extend below the top wall 1264. In various embodiments,
each of the tabs 1272 is angled radially inwardly relative to the center of the opening 1268.
[00080]            The manner in which a cap is removed from a receptacle by the cap removal
station 1266 is shown by the sequence illustrated in FIGS. 14A, 14B, 14C.
[00081]           As shown in FIG. 14A, when an assembly comprising a cap 200 and receptacle
of 100 is inserted though the opening 1268 of a cap removal station 1266 the annular ring
125 formed on the receptacle 100 engages the lower ends of the resilient tabs 1272, which
are angled inwardly so that the distance between the tabs at their lower or distal ends 1274
is less than the diameter of the annular ring 125. The force of the annular ring 125 being
pushed through the resilient tabs 1272 pushes the tabs outwardly, as shown in FIG. 14A, to
thereby permit the receptacle to be pushed through the tabs 1272.
[00082]            The raised collar 1270 has an outer surface that angles away from the opening
1268 with a larger width (e.g., diameter) at the base of the collar than at the tip of the collar
and is configured so that the top edge of the raised collar 1270 will fit inside the undeflected
locking arms 250 of the cap 200 to contact the an inner portion 280 (see FIG. 2B) of the
locking arms 250.
[00083]           As shown in FIG. 14B as receptacle 100 is pushed through the opening 1268 the
locking arms 250 slide along the exterior surface of the raised collar 1270, which is angled
outwardly progressing from the top of the collar to the base of the collar, thereby pushing
the locking arms outwardly, out of engagement with the lip 155 of the receptacle 100.
Further, as the annular ring 125 of the receptacle 100 clears the lower ends 1274 of the
resilient tabs 1272, the tabs 1272 snap resiliently toward their undeflected positions bearing
against an outer surface the receptacle 100 above the annular ring 125.
                                                    22
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[00084]            The lip 155 of the receptacle 100 is spaced apart from the annular ring 125 of the
receptacle 100 by a distance generally corresponding to the distance between the top edge,
or upper tip, of the raised collar 1270 and the lower ends 1274 of the resilient tabs 1272.
Moreover, the width, or diameter, of the upper edge of the raised collar 1270 generally
corresponds to the width, or diameter, of the lip 155 surrounding the opening of the
receptacle. Thus, the receptacle 100 continues to be moved through the opening 1268, the
angled outer surface of the raised collar 1270 moves the locking arms 250 out of
engagement with the lip 155, and the lip 155 into contact with the top edge of the raised
collar 1270. At this time, the annular ring 125 of the receptacle 100 clears the lower ends
1274 of the resilient tabs 1272.           The receptacle is then essentially locked within the cap
removal station 1266, with the resilient tabs 1272 and the raised collar 1270 disposed
between the lip 155 and the annular ring 125. The contact between the underside of the lip
155 and the top edge of the raised collar 1270 prevents the locking arms 250 from
reengaging the lip 155.
[00085]           As shown in FIG. 14C, when the cap 200 is then raised, its locking arms 250 are
no longer engaged with the lip 155 of the receptacle 100, and the receptacle 100 is retained
within the cap removal station 1266 by the annular ring 125 in contact with the lower ends
1274 of the resilient tabs 972. Thus, the cap 200 can be separated from the receptacle 100,
and the receptacle 100 is retained within the cap removal station 1266 of the cap removal
tray 1260.
[00086]           Although the cap removal stations 1266 of the cap removal tray 1260 and the cap
200 and receptacle 100 are shown as having generally circular shapes, the concepts
embodied in the cap removal stations 1266 are applicable to different shapes. For example,
a cap removal station may have a rectangular shape for remove a cap having similar a
rectangular shape from a receptacle also having a similar rectangular shape.
[00087]            In various embodiments, the cap removal tray 1260 comprises an integrally
molded plastic component, and raised collar 1270 and resilient tabs 1272 of each cap
removal station 1266 are integrally formed within the top wall 1264.

Multi-Well Tray
[00088]            In another aspect, disclosed herein is a multi-well tray for use in an automated
process. Referring now to FIGS. 4A and 4B, a multi-well tray 400, as shown, includes a
base 410 having disposed in a top surface 417 thereof, a plurality of wells 415, 416. A card
insert 420 (see also FIG. 5A) configured for removable attachment to the base 410, is
attached thereto. When the card insert 420 is attached to the base 410, a top surface 425 of
the card insert 420 is substantially parallel to and flush with the top surface 417 of the base
410.
[00089]            Disposed in the top surface 425 of the card insert 420, is a plurality of wells 430,
each configured for containing one or more reagents used for performing a biochemical
analysis. Each well 430 of the card insert 420 corresponds to at least one of the wells 415
disposed in the base 410. Thus, in certain embodiments, after attachment of the card insert
420 to the base 410, the multi-well tray 400 takes on the uniform appearance of, for
example, a multi-well plate. The wells 415, 416 disposed in the base 410 may be arranged
in pairs, where each pair corresponds to a single well 430 of the card insert 420. As such,
the multi-well tray 400 may include a plurality of sets 435 of wells, where each set 435
includes a first well 415 and a second well 416, which are disposed in the top surface 417 of
the base 410, and a third well 430 disposed in the top surface 425 of the card insert 420.
The wells of each set 435 of wells may be in alignment with each other, thereby resulting in
a multi-well tray 400 that is spatially indexed such than an automated receptacle transport
mechanism 300 can accurately identify and/or access any of the plurality of wells when the
multi-well tray 400 is placed or inserted into an automated system. In certain embodiments,
the multi-well tray 400 includes ten sets 435 of wells. As such, the base 410 is formed with
ten pairs of first and second wells 415, 416 and the card insert 420 is formed with ten third
wells 430, where each of the first, second, and third wells of the set 435 are arranged in
alignment with each other. Thus, the multi-well tray 400 may include ten receptacles 100
and ten caps 200 provided therein for used in an automated biochemical analyzer.
[00090]            The first and second wells 415, 416 of the set 435 are configured to receive a cap
200 and a receptacle 100, respectively. While it should be understood that the terms "first"
and "second" as used to distinguish the wells formed in the base 410, for descriptive
                                                     24
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

purposes, the "first well", or cap well, 415 will refer to a well configured to receive a
receptacle cap 200.
[00091]            With reference now to FIGS. 7A and 7B, the first well 415 of the base 410 is
defined by a cylindrical wall 470 and a bottom wall 472.                  Formed in the center of the
bottom surface 472 is a protrusion 475 extending upwardly toward the top surface 417 of
the base 410. The protrusion 475 is sized and shaped for engagement, optionally frictional
engagement, with a hollow portion 232 of the lower portion 220 of the cap 200.
Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the cylindrical wall 470 may be formed with a plurality
of tabs 477 protruding towards the axial center of the first well 415.              Such tabs 477 are
configured for securely engaging at least a portion of the cap 200 to prevent the cap 200
from dislodging from the multi-well tray if, for example, the multi-well tray is inverted or
shaken. In certain embodiments, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 tabs 477 are formed in the cylindrical
wall 470 of the first well. Each of tabs 477 may securely engage the top surface of the
flange 240 of the cap 200.
[00092]            Similarly, the "second well", or receptacle well, 416 will refer to a well
configured to receive a receptacle 100. As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the second well 416
is defined by a cylindrical wall 480 and a bottom wall 482. Formed in the center of the
bottom wall 482 is a through-hole 485base. The through-hole 485 is sized and shaped in
conformance with the outer surface of the lower portion 120 of the receptacle 100. As such,
the through-hole                   may be tapered at an angle corresponding to the angle of the lower
portion 120. As shown in FIG. 7A, the bottom wall 482 of the second well 416 forms an
annular ledge at the perimeter of the through-hole for engaging the ring 125 of the
receptacle 100. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the cylindrical wall 480 may be formed
with a plurality of legs 487 protruding towards the axial center of the second well 416.
Such legs 487 are configured for securely engaging at least a portion of the receptacle 100
to prevent the receptacle 100 from dislodging from the multi-well tray if, for example, the
multi-well tray is inverted or shaken. In certain embodiments, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 legs 487
are formed in the cylindrical wall 480 of the second well 416. Each of the legs 487 may
securely engage the top surface of the ring 125 of the receptacle 100.

9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[00093]           As discussed above, the third well, or reagent well, 430 of each set 435 contains
one or more reagents for performing a biochemical analysis. In certain embodiments, the
third well 430 of the set 435 contains a lyophilized reagent 495 (FIGS. 8 and 9C), and may
be sealed with a frangible seal 440 (FIG. 8). For example, each well 430 of the card insert
420 may be sealed with a metallic foil (or foil laminate) using, for example, a pressure
sensitive adhesive which is applied to the top surface 425 thereof. The frangible seal 440
may further include a plastic liner, such as a thin veneer of HDPE applied to one or both
surfaces thereof, which promotes attachment of the frangible seal 440 to the top surface 425
when a heat sealer is used.                   Heat sealing is a well-known process and involves the
generation of heat and the application of pressure to the surface being sealed, which, in this
case, is the top surface 425 or a raised lip 427 (see FIGS. 4A, 5A) surrounding the well 430
of the card insert 420. Alternatively, any known ultrasonic welding procedure using either
high frequency or high amplitude sound waves may also be used to affix the frangible seal
440 to the card insert 420. The card insert 420 may include a plurality of frangible seals
440, each of which sealing a single well 430, or may include a single sheet that seals all
wells 430 disposed therein.
[00094]           A single lyophilized reagent 495 may be provided in each well 430 of the card
insert 420. However, in certain embodiments, one or more wells 430 of the card insert 420
may contain a different lyophilized reagent 495, such as a different target-specific reagent.
Thus, each well 430 of the card insert 420 may contain a distinct lyophilized reagent 495
compared with the lyophilized reagent 495 contained in at least one other of the plurality of
wells 430 therein.                 In various embodiments, the card insert 420 does not contain non
reagent consumables. As used herein, a "reagent" refers to a substance or mixture for use in
a chemical or biochemical reaction.                    Thus, a "non-reagent consumable" refers to a
component that is used by an automated biochemical assay, but is not a reagent. Exemplary
non-reagent consumables include, but are not limited to, contamination limiting elements,
receptacles 100, and caps 200.
[00095]            Referring now to FIGS. 5A-5E, each well 430 of the card insert 420 is defined by
a side wall, or well wall, 450 and a bottom, or bottom wall or bottom wall portion, 455. In
various embodiments, the side wall 450 tapers from an upper end thereof to the bottom 455,
and may therefore be referred to as a conical wall. As shown in FIGS. 5B-5E, the bottom
                                                          26
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

455 of each well may be formed with one or more features to facilitate deposit of and
collection of fluid from the well. Such features include, but are not limited to a concave
groove 457, 460 (FIGS. 5C, 5D, 5E), convex ridge (not shown), or a set of grooves
positioned in a crisscross pattern (not shown).         The features may be located at the axial
center of the well 430, as shown in FIG. 5C, or may be off-set to a side thereof, as shown in
FIG. 5B. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the side wall 450 may be formed with a
plurality of bumps 462 on the surface thereof for additional facilitation of depositing and/or
collecting fluids contained therein. The side wall 450 of each well 430 of the card insert
420 may further be formed with a plurality of rigid guides 465 that protrude radially from
the side wall 450 towards the axial center of the well 430. Such rigid guides 465 guide a
pipette tip 310 (FIGS. 8 and 9C) mounted on an automated pipettor toward the axial center
of the well 430 as the tip is lowered therein, and may further serve to retain the lyophilized
reagent at, or adjacent to, the bottom 455 of the well 430. In various embodiments, each
well 430 may be independently formed with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 rigid guides 465 protruding
from the respective tapered side wall 450.
[00096]            The features formed at the bottom 455 of the well 430, such as grooves, ridges,
and/or bumps, interfere with the end of a pipette tip inserted into the well 430 and thus
prevent the end of the pipette tip from making sealing contact with the bottom 455 so as to
prevent a negative pressure build up within the pipette tip during a fluid aspiration. For
example, as shown in FIG. 5E, a feature formed on the bottom 455 of well 430, such as
groove 457, provides a clearance that prevents a pipette tip 310 from making sealing contact
with the bottom 455 of the well 430.
[00097]           Additionally, in certain embodiments, the side wall 450 of each well 430 of the
card insert 420 may include one or more retention features (FIGS. 8, and 9C-9D) that can be
used to retain the lyophilized reagent 495 at, or adjacent to, the bottom 455 of the well 430
when, for example a diluent is deposited into the well 430 for reconstitution of a lyophilized
reagent. In FIGS. 9C and 9D, the retention features are shown within a well 715 of an
alternative embodiment of a multi-well tray 700 described below. In various embodiments,
the retention feature may include one or more protrusions or an annular ridge 800 formed
above the area to be occupied by the lyophilized reagent 495, and extending toward the
axial center of the well 430. Such protrusions or annular ridge 800 narrow the opening of
                                                    27
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

the side wall 450 such that the opening is smaller than the diameter of the lyophilized
reagent 495.
[00098]           As shown in FIG. 9E, the annular ridge 800 may be formed by inserting one or
more heat stakes 880 into the wells 430, such that the side wall 450 is deformed, thereby
forming an annular ridge 800 therein. The one or more heat stakes 880 may be attached to
an apparatus 890, which may heat the one or more heat stakes 880, thereby providing
sufficient heat to deform the side wall 450 at a point along the taper where the diameter
thereof equals that of the diameter of the heat stake.
[00099]            In various embodiments, the retention feature may also take the form of one or
more solid extensions 810 formed over the area to be occupied by the lyophilized reagent
495. Such extensions 810 connect opposing areas of the side wall 450, thereby retaining the
lyophilized reagent 495 at, or adjacent to, the bottom 455 of the well 430.              In various
embodiments, the side wall 450 may be formed to mimic the thread of a coarse screw as
shown at 820. Such a threaded feature 820 may be formed during injection molding of the
well 430, or may be formed by applying a heated screw portion to the well wall, thereby
forming a spiral channel along a length thereof, through which fluid may run to the bottom
455 using gravitational force.          In various embodiments, the retention feature may be
provided in the form of a tapered ring insert 830 that is fixedly attached to the side wall 450
either before or after deposit of the lyophilized reagent 495. The tapered ring 830 may be
formed of plastic and include an exterior surface that tapers in accordance with the taper of
the side wall 450. When present, the tapered ring 830 narrows the opening of the well 430
such that the lyophilized reagent 495 is retained at, or adjacent to, the bottom 455 of the
well 430.
[000100] Whether the lyophilized bead 495 is formed within the well from an initially
liquid reagent or the solid bead is formed outside the well and then placed into the well may
depend on whether the retention feature is an integral part of the well.           If the retention
feature is an integral part of the well, a solid bead could not be placed into the well below
the retention feature and a liquid reagent must be dispensed into the bottom of the well and
then lyophilized. If the retention feature is not an integral part of the well, a lyophilized
                                                    28
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

bead could be placed into the well, and then the retention feature installed in the well over
the lyophilized bead.
[000101] As shown in FIG. 9D, the inner surface of a well wall may be substantially
vertical as at 840, while an exterior surface of the well retains its tapered shape. In certain
embodiments, the inner surface of the well wall may be substantially vertical as at 840,
while the exterior surface of the well is also substantially vertical (not shown).       When
present, the vertical wall 840 allows the entirety of a liquid reagent to be lyophilized to
settle at the bottom 455 of the well, thereby ensuring reagent uniformity upon
lyophilization.
[000102] In various embodiments, as also shown in FIG. 9D, the retention feature may be
in the form of a capillary insert 850 that is fixedly attached to the well wall. The capillary
insert 850 may be formed of plastic and include an exterior surface that tapers in accordance
with the taper of the well wall. In an exemplary embodiment, the well and capillary insert
850 may be formed as a single unit. The capillary insert 850 may not extend completely to
the bottom of the well, thereby defining a chamber 856 below a bottom end of the capillary
insert 850. The inner surface of the capillary insert 850 may include substantially vertical
walls forming a capillary channel 852 extending from an upper end of the insert to a lower
end of the insert through which fluid will flow via capillary attraction, and within which the
fluid will be retained as a result of the combination of surface tension and adhesive forces
between the fluid and the walls of the capillary channel.       The capillary insert 850 may
further include an open upper end 854 that tapers from a top surface of the insert 850 to the
channel 852. Thus, when a capillary insert 850 is present in a well and a liquid reagent to
be lyophilized is deposit therein, the reagent remains held within the capillary channel
thereof, and is prevented from flowing into the bottom of the well. After lyophilizing the
liquid reagent, the lyophilized reagent 495 remains lodged within the channel 852 of the
capillary insert 850. Deposit of a diluent for reconstitution of the lyophilized reagent 495 is
accomplished by addition of the diluent to the tapered open upper end 854 of the capillary
insert 850. The diluent then flows within the capillary channel 852 via capillary attraction,
and is retained therein as a result of the combination of surface tension and adhesive forces
between the diluent and the walls of the capillary channel 852. Once reconstituted, the
reagent may be collected by insertion of the pipette tip 310 into the tapered open upper end
                                               29
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

854 of the capillary insert 850 and withdrawing the liquid reagent therefrom. The entirety
of the liquid reagent may therefore be collected at the tapered open upper end 854 of the
capillary insert 850 since the liquid will travel upwards due to capillary attraction within the
channel 852 of the capillary insert 850.
[000103] Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the bottom 455 of the well can be formed to
include a roughened surface, thereby providing sufficient surface area to which the
lyophilized reagent 495 will adhere upon formation thereof. Alternatively, or in addition
thereto, the lyophilized reagent 495 will adhere to, or adjacent to, the bottom 455 of the well
430 through a static electrical attractive force created on the well wall 450 and/or bottom
455 of the well 430. In such embodiments, the inner surface of the well 430 is provided
with an electrical charge such that the lyophilized reagent 495 adheres thereto.
[000104] In various embodiments, the retention feature may take the form of an insert
through which the pipette tip 310 may be inserted. For example, as shown in FIG. 9D the
retention feature may be a fingered collar 860 that is fixedly attached to a top portion of the
well. The fingered collar 860 may be formed of plastic and include an exterior surface that
tapers in accordance with the taper of the well wall. The fingered collar 860 may include
one or more (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8) fingers extending from a bottom surface thereof,
and protruding along a radius of curvature toward the axial center of the well. The one or
more fingers may be flexible such that contact with a pipette tip 310 inserted therein causes
the fingers to flex toward the well wall, thereby allowing the pipette tip 310 to pass there
through. Upon withdrawal of the pipette tip 310, the fingers return to a rest position such
that the fingers protrude along the radius of curvature toward the axial center of the well.
[000105] In an alternative embodiment, the retention feature may take the form of a collar
870 that resembles the fingered collar 860, but does not include the one or more fingers
protruding therefrom. Such a collar 870 may be fixedly attached to a top or center portion
of the well wall, and may be formed of plastic and include an exterior surface that tapers in
conformance with the taper of the well wall. When present, the collar 870 narrows the well
wall to retain the lyophilized reagent 495 at, or adjacent to, the bottom 455 of the well,
while allowing the pipette tip 310 to pass there through.
                                                 30
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[000106] Each of the base 410 and card insert 420 may be independently constructed of an
injection molded plastic, such as the plastics described above. The plastic used to form the
base 410 may be the same or different from the plastic used to form the card insert 420. For
example, the card insert 420 may be formed from a plastic having lower permeability to air
and/or moisture than the plastic forming the base 410.                 Such plastics may be more
expensive than their conventional counterparts but, due to the decreased air and moisture
permeability, provide for enhanced stability of reagents, such as lyophilized reagents
contained in the wells thereof. Any exterior surface of the base 410 or card insert 420 may
further include one or more identifying labels 490, such as a barcode, 2D barcode, quick
response (QR) code, radio frequency identification (RFID), or other human or machine
readable indicia, disposed thereon.             The information carried on such label may include
identifying information regarding the multi-well tray 400 and/or card insert 420, including
information regarding the reagents contained therein, such as lot number, serial number,
assay type, expiration date, etc. In various embodiments, the base 410 may include one or
more barcodes and/or QR codes on a side surface thereof for identifying assays to be
performed by the automated biochemical analyzer.
[000107] As shown in FIG. 4B, the base 410 may be formed with one or more locking
arms 445 positioned for locking engagement with the card insert 420.               Additionally, the
card insert 420 may be formed with one or more corresponding lock-holes 447 for receiving
the locking arms 445 of the base 410. Once secured into the base 410 by the locking arms
445 and/or the lock-holes 447, the card insert 420 is prevented from detachment therefrom.
However, in certain embodiments, locking arms 445 may be moved out of locking
engagement with the card insert 420 to release the card insert 420 from the base 410. Such
releasable engagement provides for reuse of the base 410, if necessary, and/or replacement
of a card insert 420 should the need arise.
[000108] As shown in FIG. 6A, base 410 may be further formed with one or more locking
fingers 422 disposed on a side surface thereof. The locking fingers 422 are configured for
releasably engaging a rack to secure the base 410 to the rack for use in automated
processing.              In various embodiments, the base 410 may further include a release 437 for
urging the locking fingers 422 away from the engaging surface of the rack to facilitate
removal therefrom.
                                                      31
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[000109] As shown in FIG. 6B, the card insert 420 may be secured to the base 410 by
means of locking features 424 disposed along opposed sides of the card insert 420 that are
configured for locking engagement with cooperating ledges 412 formed in the base 410
[000110] FIGS. 9A-9E show an alternative embodiment of a multi-well tray 700.
Referring now to FIGS. 9A and 9B, the multi-well tray 700 includes a base 710 having
disposed in a top surface 717 thereof, a plurality of wells 715. The base 710 also includes
an arm 720 for engagement by a transport mechanism, such as a rotary distributor (not
shown) for transport within an automated biochemical analyzer. As shown in FIG. 9B, the
bottom surface 730 of the base 710 is formed with one or more snap fingers 735, which
define a slot 740 into which an element (not shown) of the biochemical analyzer is inserted.
Thus, snap fingers 735 grasp the element (not shown) of the biochemical analyzer, thereby
forming a secure attachment thereto.
[000111] In this alternative embodiment, all of the wells 715 are configured to contain one
or more reagents used for performing automated biochemical analysis. Similar to the wells
430 of the multi-well tray insert 420, each well 715 is defined by an inner side wall 750 and
a bottom 755. In various embodiments, the side wall 750 tapers from a top portion of the
well 715 to the bottom 755, as shown in FIG. 9C.
[000112] As discussed above, the bottom 755 of each well 715 may be formed with one or
more features to facilitate deposit of and collection of fluid from the well. Such features
include, but not limited to a concave groove 457, 460 (FIGS. 5B-5D), a convex ridge (not
shown), or a set of grooves positioned in a crisscross pattern (not shown). The features may
be located at the axial center of the well 715, as shown in FIG. 5C, or may be off-set to a
side thereof, as shown in FIG. 5B. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the inner wall 750
may be formed with a plurality of bumps 462 (FIGS. 5B-5D) on the surface thereof for
additional facilitation of depositing and/or collecting fluids contained therein. The inner
wall 750 of each well 715 of the card 700 may further be formed with a plurality of rigid
guides 465 (FIG. 5B) that protrude radially from the inner wall 750 towards the axial center
of the well 715. Such rigid guides 465 guide the tip 310 (FIGS. 8 and 9C) mounted on an
automated pipettor toward the axial center of the well 715 as the tip is lowered therein, and
may further serve to retain the lyophilized reagent 495 at, or adjacent to, the bottom 755 of
                                              32
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

the well 715. In various embodiments, each well 715 may be independently formed with 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 rigid guides protruding from the respective tapered well wall 750.
[000113] Additionally, in certain embodiments, the inner well walls 750 of each well 715
of the card 700 may include one or more retention features 800, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850,
860, 870 (FIGS. 8 and 9C-9D), as described above, configured to retain the lyophilized
reagent 495 at, or adjacent to, the bottom 755 of the well 715 when, for example a diluent is
deposited into the well 715 for reconstitution.        In various embodiments, the retention
features may include an annular ridge 800 formed above the area to be occupied by the
lyophilized reagent 495, and extending toward the axial center of the well 715. In various
embodiments, the retention features may also take the form of one or more solid extensions
810 formed over the area to be occupied by the lyophilized reagent 495. Such extensions
810 connect opposing areas of the well wall 750, thereby retaining the lyophilized reagent
495 at, or adjacent to, the bottom 755 of the well 715.       In various embodiments, the well
715 may include any of the various inserts 830, 850, 860, or 870, as discussed above.
Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the well wall 750 may be a vertical wall 840 or may be
formed to include a screw thread (i.e., a spiral channel) 820. Alternatively, or in addition
thereto, the bottom 755 of the well can be formed to include a rough surface, thereby
providing sufficient surface area to which the lyophilized reagent 495 will adhere upon
formation thereof. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the lyophilized reagent 495 will
adhere to the bottom 755 of the well 715 through a static electrical attractive force created
on the well wall 750 and/or bottom 755 of the well 715.
Cartridge With Communicating Wells
[000114] In another aspect of the disclosure, a cartridge 500 with communicating wells for
use in an automated process is shown in FIGS. 1OA and 10B, which depict different
alternative cartridge embodiments.       The cartridge 500 includes a casing 510 having a top
surface 517, a fluid chamber 520, and a fluid reservoir 515.        In various embodiment, the
fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515 comprise wells open at the top surface 517.
In various embodiments, as reflected in the drawings, the fluid chamber 520 has a smaller
volumetric capacity than the fluid reservoir 515. As further reflected in the drawings, the
perimeter of the open end of the fluid chamber 520 may be smaller than the perimeter of the
                                                33
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

open end of the fluid reservoir 515, and thus the exposed surface of a fluid in the fluid
chamber 520 would be smaller than the exposed surface of a fluid in the fluid reservoir 515.
[000115] The fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515 may contain the same liquid,
such as a diluent or a reconstitution solution for reconstituting the lyophilized reagent (e.g.,
lyophilized reagent 495).
[000116] The cartridge 500 may be provided with one or more fluid connections between
the fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515. Thus, in various embodiments, one or
more openings 525 and/or 527 between the fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515
may include one or more channels between the fluid reservoir 515 and the fluid chamber
520 to provide a path through which a liquid or gas may flow between the fluid chamber
520 and the fluid reservoir 515.      An opening, such as opening 527, between the fluid
chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515 may be provided by a slot or hole formed in a wall
separating the fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515.
[000117] In various embodiments, a first opening 525 is provided proximate a lower
portion of the fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515 (e.g., at a base of the casing
510) for fluid communication between the fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515,
and a second opening 527 is provided proximate an upper end (i.e., near the open ends) of
the fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515 for fluid communication between the fluid
chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515.
[000118] As shown in FIG. 10A, the cartridge 500 may also include a second fluid
reservoir 530 disposed within the casing and adjacent to the fluid chamber 520. The second
reservoir 530 can be utilized to store the same or a different liquid than is stored in reservoir
515. In certain embodiments the second reservoir 530 is not in fluid communication with
the fluid reservoir 515 or the fluid chamber 520. In certain embodiments the fluid reservoir
515 and the fluid chamber 520 contain a reconstitution solution, and the second reservoir
530 contains oil.
[000119] In various embodiments, each of the fluid chamber 520, fluid reservoir 515, and
second reservoir 530 may be sealed with a seal (not shown), such as a metallic foil (or foil
laminate). A seal over the fluid reservoir 515, the fluid chamber 520, and/or the second
                                               34
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

reservoir 530 may be provided to prevent spillage of fluid contents in case cartridge 500 is
tipped, dropped, shaken, or inverted. The seal also prevents or retards evaporation of the
fluid contents of the sealed reservoir or chamber by preventing or limiting exposure to
ambient atmosphere. The seal may further include a plastic liner, such as a thin veneer of
HDPE applied to one or both surfaces thereof. The seal may be secured using, for example,
a pressure sensitive adhesive or heat seal securing the foil to the top surface 517 securing
the seal about the perimeter of the opening of each reservoir or chamber. A plastic liner,
such as a thin veneer of HDPE applied to one or both surfaces of the seal, promotes
attachment of the frangible seal to the top surface 517 when a heat sealer is used. The one
or more openings (525, 527) may also be sealed with a frangible seal to prevent exposure to
the ambient atmosphere
[000120] The fluid reservoir 515 and the fluid chamber 520 and any connecting opening(s)
are configured so that as fluid is removed from the fluid chamber 520, replacement fluid
flows into the fluid chamber 520 from the fluid reservoir 515 (e.g., through an opening 525
provided proximate a lower portion of the fluid chamber 520 and fluid reservoir 515).
Moreover, if the fluid reservoir is sealed, one or more conduits may be provided to permit
air to flow into the fluid reservoir 515 (e.g., through an opening 527 provided proximate an
upper portion of the fluid chamber 520 and fluid reservoir 515) as fluid is drawn out of the
fluid reservoir 515 to thereby allow the pressure in the reservoir to equilibrate.
[000121] The chamber 520 is may be sealed with a frangible seal that is puncturable by a
pipette tip. The entire volume of fluid in the fluid chamber 520 and the fluid reservoir 515
is accessible to a fluid transfer apparatus, but a relatively small surface area of that fluid
e.g., corresponding to the width of the chamber 520 or to the size of a puncture hole formed
in a seal over the chamber 520 - is exposed to air. Thus, the configuration of the cartridge
500 retards evaporation of fluids contained therein.
[000122] An amount of liquid, such as reconstitution solution, may be removed from the
fluid chamber 520 within an automated pipettor and transferred to a well (e.g., well 430 or
715) to reconstitute a lyophilized reagent (e.g., lyophilized reagent 495), as described
below.
                                                35
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[000123] The cartridge 500 may be constructed of an injection molded plastic, such as the
plastics described above. As discussed above, the plastic used to form the cartridge 500
may be one having low permeability to air and/or moisture.
[000124] Any exterior surface of the cartridge 500 may further include one or more
identifying labels, such as a barcode, 2D barcode, quick response (QR) code, radio
frequency identification (RFID), or other human or machine readable indicia, disposed
thereon.            The information carried on such label may include identifying information
regarding the cartridge 500, including information regarding the liquids/reagents contained
therein, such as lot number, serial number, assay type, expiration date, etc.
Cartridge Rack
[000125] In another aspect, disclosed herein is a cartridge rack for use in an automated
process. With reference now to FIGS. 11 A-1 ID, the cartridge rack 600 includes a chassis
610 and a handle 620. A top surface 615 of the chassis 610 is configured for releasable
attachment of one or more multi-well trays 400 thereto, and therefore may include a
plurality of locking members 625 for releasably engaging the locking fingers 422 of the
multi-well tray 400 (see FIG. 6A). While the FIG. 11 B shows that two locking members
625 are provided for each multi-well tray 400, it should be understood that the number of
locking members 625 provided for each multi-well tray 400 will correspond with the
number of locking fingers 422 provided on the multi-well tray 400 to be attached thereto.
[000126] Disposed on a surface of the chassis 610 is a plurality of identifying labels such
as machine readable indicia 630, such as a barcode, 2D barcode, quick response (QR) code,
radio frequency identification (RFID), or other human or machine readable indicia, disposed
thereon.            The information carried on such label may include identifying information
regarding the cartridge rack 600, multi-well tray(s) 400 attached thereto, and/or the card
insert(s) 420 attached to the multi-well tray(s) 400, and/or the multi-well tray 400 position
on the rack. The machine readable indicia 630 may be readable through a direct contact
connection, a wired connection, or a wireless connection between the cartridge rack 600 on
the automated biochemical analyzer.
                                                  36
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[000127] In various embodiments, the chassis 610 is configured for releasable attachment
of two or more multi-well trays 400 thereto, and may further be configured for releasable
attachment to a cartridge with communicating wells 500.               Thus, in an exemplary
embodiment, five multi-well receptacles 400 and one cartridge 500 may be releasably
attached to the chassis 610 for use in an automated biochemical analyzer. However, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, or 8 multi-well trays 400, and/or 1, 2, 3, or 4 cartridges 500 may be attached to the
chassis 610.
System for Automated Reagent-Based Assay
[000128] In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a system for an automated
reagent-based assay. The system includes a multi-well tray 400 that includes a plurality of
wells 430, a cartridge with communicating wells 500, and an automated pipettor positioned
on a robot arm (not shown).        The system includes a housing within which each of the
components are located. Each well 430 of the multi-well tray 400 shown and discussed
above contains a lyophilized reagent 495 and is arranged in alignment with each other. The
wells 430 of the multi-well tray 400 may be sealed with a frangible seal. The multi-well
tray 400 may further include a plurality of additional wells 415, 416 provided for receiving
a receptacle 100 and a cap 200. When present, the additional wells are positioned in aligned
pairs, and the pairs are positioned in alignment with at least one well 430 containing a
reagent, such as a lyophilized reagent 495. Thus, the multi-well tray 400 may contain a
plurality of sets 435 of wells, where a first well 415 contains a cap 200, a second well 416
contains a receptacle 100, and a third well contains a reagent such as a lyophilized reagent
495.
[000129] The cartridge with communicating wells 500 includes a casing 510 having a top
surface 517, a fluid chamber 520. A first opening 527 is provided in the top surface of the
casing having at least one side wall surface extending to, or optionally forming at least a
portion of, the fluid chamber. A fluid reservoir 515 is disposed within the casing and in
fluid communication with the fluid chamber. In certain embodiments, the cartridge 500 will
also include a second reservoir 530 that is disposed within the casing 510 and adjacent to
the fluid chamber 520.
                                               37
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

[000130] The automated pipettor is positioned on a robot arm contained in an automated
biochemical analyzer. The automated pipettor is adapted to execute a retrieval and dispense
protocol for conducting biochemical reactions. The retrieval and dispense protocol may be
performed by a controller (not shown) electrically connected to the robot arm and/or the
automated pipettor to retrieve a portion of the reagent from the cartridge 500 and dispense
the portion of the reagent into one or more wells of the multi-well tray 400, 700 or into one
or more receptacles.               The retrieval and dispense protocol may then be repeated for
automated dispensing of the reagent into each of remaining wells of the multi-well tray 400.
[000131] In one exemplary embodiment, the automated pipettor will receive a command to
perform automated actions required for performing an automated reagent-based assay. The
automated pipettor is then moved by the robot arm to a position over an unused pipette tip
310 and is lowered to enable frictional attachment thereto. Once the automated pipettor,
having the pipette tip 310 attached thereto, is raised such that the pipette tip 310 is not
obstructed by additional unused tips and/or other components within the automated
biochemical analyzer, the robot arm moves the automated pipettor into a designated position
over a cartridge 500. The automated pipettor is thereafter lowered into the fluid chamber of
the cartridge 500. If present, a frangible seal covering the fluid chamber is punctured by the
pipette tip 310. The automated pipettor then withdraws a predetermined amount of diluent
and is raised such that the pipette tip 310 is unobstructed by the cartridge 500 and/or other
components within the automated biochemical analyzer.
[000132] The robot arm then moves the automated pipettor into a designated position over
a spatially indexed multi-well tray 400 and then lowers the pipettor such that the pipette tip
310 punctures a frangible seal 440 (if present) covering a well 430 disposed in the card
insert 420 attached to the base 410 of the multi-well tray 400. The diluent is then deposited
into the well 430 containing a lyophilized reagent 495 used in the reagent-based assay.
Optionally, the automated pipettor will repeatedly aspirate and the dispense the liquid
contained in the well 430 to allow sufficient time and fluidic pressure required to
reconstitute the lyophilized reagent 495.            The automated pipettor thereafter collects the
reconstituted reagent and withdraws the pipette tip 310 from the well 430 of the multi-well
tray 400 such that the pipette tip 310 is unobstructed by the well 430 and/or other
components within the automated biochemical analyzer. The robot arm then moves the
                                                     38

automated pipettor into a second designated position over the spatially indexed multi-well
tray 400. The second position is selected in accordance with the set 435 of wells to which
the well 430 of the card insert belongs. The automated pipettor is then lowered into a well
416 containing a receptacle 100, which may or may not contain a sample undergoing
analysis. Optionally, when a sample undergoing analysis is present in the receptacle 100,
the automated pipettor will repeatedly aspirate and then dispense the liquid contained in the
receptacle 100 to allow sufficient time and fluidic pressure required to mix the contents of
the receptacle 100 within the well 416, thereby creating a reaction mixture.
[000133] After optional mixing, the automated pipettor withdraws the pipette tip 310 from
the well 416, but leaves the reaction mixture within the receptacle 100. The robot arm then
moves the automated pipettor to a location over a waste receptacle and ejects the pipette tip
310.        After ejection, the robot arm moves the automated pipettor to a third designated
position over the spatially indexed multi-well tray 400. The third position is selected in
accordance with the set 435 of wells to which the first and second wells belong.               The
automated pipettor is then lowered into the third well 415 containing a cap 200 to enable
frictional attachment thereto.             Once the automated pipettor having the cap 200 attached
thereto is raised such that the cap 200 is not obstructed the well 415 and/or other
components within the automated biochemical analyzer, the robot arm moves the automated
pipettor into the second designated position over the well 416 containing the receptacle 100
containing the reaction mixture. The automated pipettor is then lowered such that the cap
200 is securably attached to the receptacle 100 as described above.               As the automated
pipettor withdraws from the well 416, the capped receptacle attached thereto is withdrawn
from the well 416 of the multi-well tray 400 for transport to, for example, a thermocycler
for automated incubation.
[000134] In another exemplary embodiment, the automated pipettor will receive a
command to perform automated actions required for performing an automated reagent
based assay. The automated pipettor is then moved by the robot arm to a position over an
unused pipette tip                 310, and is lowered to enable     frictional attachment thereto.
Simultaneously, prior to, or after such movement, a transport mechanism, such as a rotary
distributor (not shown) within the biochemical analyzer attaches to an arm 720 of a multi
                                                       39
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

well tray 700 and transports the multi-well tray 700 to a predetermined position for use in
the analysis.
[000135] Once the automated pipettor, having the pipette tip 310 attached thereto, is raised
such that the pipette tip 310 is not obstructed by additional unused tips and/or other
components within the automated biochemical analyzer, the robot arm moves the automated
pipettor into a designated position over a cartridge 500. The automated pipettor is thereafter
lowered into the oil chamber 530 of the cartridge 500. If present, a frangible seal covering
the oil chamber 530 is punctured by the pipette tip 310.            The automated pipettor then
withdraws a predetermined amount of oil and is raised such that the pipette tip 310 is
unobstructed by the cartridge 500 and/or other components within the automated
biochemical analyzer.
[000136] The robot arm then moves the automated pipettor into a designated position over
a spatially indexed multi-well tray 400 and/or over a receptacle 100, and the pipettor is
lowered such that the pipette tip 310 enters the open end 145 thereof. The oil is then
dispensed into the receptacle 100. Optionally, the procedure of withdrawing oil from the oil
chamber 530 of the cartridge 500 is repeated one or more times, depending on the number
of reactions to be performed.
[000137] Thereafter, the automated pipettor withdraws the pipette tip 310 from the
receptacle 100, and the robot arm moves the automated pipettor to a location over a waste
receptacle and ejects the pipette tip 310. After ejection, the robot arm moves the automated
pipettor to a position over a second unused pipette tip 310 and lowers the pipettor to enable
frictional attachment thereto.         Once the automated pipettor, having the second pipette tip
310 attached thereto, is raised such that the pipette tip 310 is not obstructed by additional
unused tips and/or other components within the automated biochemical analyzer, the robot
arm moves the automated pipettor into a designated position over a second receptacle 100
having therein a sample for analysis, and is lowered such that the pipette tip 310 enters the
open end 145 thereof.              The sample is then collected from the second receptacle and
transferred to the first receptacle 100. It should be understood that in certain embodiments,
the sample will have been previously dispensed into the receptacle prior to deposit of the oil
and/or the sample for analysis may be transferred from a material transfer unit (not shown)
                                                   40
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

within the biochemical analyzer. After depositing the sample into the first receptacle, the
automated pipettor withdraws the pipette tip 310 from the receptacle 100, and the robot arm
moves the automated pipettor to a location over a waste receptacle and ejects the pipette tip
310. After ejection, the robot arm moves the automated pipettor to a position over a third
unused pipette tip 310 and lowers the pipettor to enable frictional attachment thereto.
[000138] Once the automated pipettor having the third pipette tip 310 attached thereto is
raised such that the pipette tip 310 is not obstructed by additional unused tips, and/or other
components within the automated biochemical analyzer, the robot arm moves the automated
pipettor into the second designated position over the cartridge 500 and lowers the pipettor
into the fluid chamber 520 of the cartridge 500. If present, a frangible seal covering the
fluid chamber 520 is punctured by the pipette tip 310.              The automated pipettor then
withdraws a predetermined amount of diluent and is raised such that the pipette tip 310 is
unobstructed by the cartridge 500 and/or other components within the automated
biochemical analyzer.
[000139] The robot arm then moves the automated pipettor into a designated position over
a spatially indexed multi-well tray 700 and lowers the pipettor such that the pipette tip 310
punctures a frangible seal (if present) covering a well 715 disposed in the multi-well tray
700. The diluent is then deposited into the well 715 containing a lyophilized reagent 495
used in the reagent-based assay. Optionally, the automated pipettor will repeatedly aspirate
and dispense the liquid contained in the well 715 to allow sufficient time and fluidic
pressure required to reconstitute the lyophilized reagent 495.
[000140] The automated pipettor thereafter              collects the reconstituted reagent and
withdraws the pipette tip 310 from the well 715 of the multi-well tray 700 such that the
pipette tip 310 is unobstructed by the well 715 and/or other components within the
automated biochemical analyzer. The robot arm then moves the automated pipettor into the
designated position over the first receptacle 100 containing the dispensed oil and sample for
analysis.          The automated pipettor is then lowered into the open end 145 of the receptacle
100 to dispense the reconstituted reagent.              Optionally, the automated pipettor will
repeatedly aspirate and dispense the liquid contained in the receptacle 100 to allow
                                                    41
9959340_1 (GHMatters) P101239.AU.3

sufficient time and fluidic pressure required to mix the contents of the receptacle 100,
thereby creating a reaction mixture.
[000141] After optional mixing, the automated pipettor withdraws the pipette tip 310 from
the receptacle 100, but leaves the reaction mixture within the receptacle 100. The robot arm
then moves the automated pipettor to a location over the waste receptacle and ejects the
pipette tip 310. After ejection, the robot arm moves the automated pipettor to a designated
position over a well 415 containing a cap 200 to enable frictional attachment thereto. Once
the automated pipettor having the cap 200 attached thereto is raised such that the cap 200 is
not obstructed the well 415 and/or other components within the automated biochemical
analyzer, the robot arm moves the automated pipettor into the designated position over the
receptacle 100 containing the reaction mixture. The automated pipettor is then lowered
such that the cap 200 is securably attached to the receptacle 100. As the automated pipettor
is raised, the capped receptacle is lifted from a receptacle holder or well of a multi-well tray
400 for transport to, for example, a centrifuge and/or thermocycler for automated
incubation.
[000142] In certain embodiments, it is desirable to expedite the process of reconstitution of
the lyophilized reagent 495, mixing of the reagent with the test sample, and subsequent
capping of the receptacle 100 containing the reagent mixture. In such embodiments, more
than one robot arm and automated pipettor may be provided within the automated
biochemical analyzer, and may be independently controlled to expand the capabilities
thereof. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, the automated biochemical analyzer may
include one or more pick and place robots, which may be used to perform functions not
related to collection and/or deposit of liquids, such as capping of a receptacle 100
containing a reaction mixture and/or transport of the capped receptacle to a centrifuge
and/or thermocycler for automated incubation.
