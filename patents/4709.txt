                                 ADDITIVE FOR POLYMER
FIELD
The invention relates to an additive, specifically relating to a thermoplastic polymer additive,
preparation method thereof and composed of the polymer composition.
BACKGROUND
The above formula the tetra (Beta-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl-4 phenyl) propionyloxy methyl) methane
is an important commercial additive for thermoplastic polymers. For example, it protects the
organic material, in particular a thermoplastic polymer to degrade the resist heat, oxidation
and/or actinic. Generally, performing addition reaction of 2, 6-di-tertiary-butyl phenol and
methyl acrylate to generate beta-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl-4 phenyl) propionate, and then performing
ester exchange reaction with pentaerythritol. the formula of the tetra (beta-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl-4
phenyl) propionyloxy methyl) methane as an additive for polypropylene, polystyrene and other
polymers. With the enhanced public-health consciousness, people indoor smell and air quality
proposes higher requirements. polymer as appliances, OA, packaging materials, daily
necessities, toys, sports equipment, shoes, cable, instruments and meters, electronic component
and device, building material and automobile material and other fields using more material,
especially household appliances, OA, toy and car material, more strictly the smell and VOC
requirements. polymer melt stability in the synthesis, preparation, modification and forming
process, adding the auxiliary agent, especially tetra (Beta-(3,        5-di-tert-butyl-4 phenyl)
propionyloxy methyl) methane be challenge, the polymer will not emit out part of the volatile,
the source generally has a residual monomer, solvent and additive and degraded to generate
small molecular substance and so on.
At present, by adding stripping auxiliary devolatilizing method can obviously reduce polymer
of odour, residual monomer, solvent and VOC content. The R.J. polymer devolatilization using
singlescrew extruder and twin-screw extruder and method for introducing stripping agent for
devolatilization. Another example is U.S. Patent 5380822 and 5350813 describes removing

residual monomer in polymer method, it comprises to melt in water or suitable condensable
liquid, then making effluent flows through a flash tank. Chinese patent 98124504.8 discloses a
method of removing volatile material, comprising the nozzle device for foaming auxiliary agent
to be added therein and the composition stream opposite direction, lower without generating a
pressure foaming of the composition into a mixing device to mix; then extruding device for
extruding the mixture to devolatilization in the groove, making the polymer foaming the
coefficient B is 1.4 or higher the pressure and temperature lower as foaming product, thereby
removing volatile materials, the method can obtain low volatile material amount of polymer
composition, but because the stripping agent is directly added to the raw material, a large
amount of stripping agent cannot into the raw material into screw extruder difficult operation,
on the other hand, even if adding to the screw extruder, the extruder temperature is high,
stripping the easy to gasify and spill out, and cannot act the air lift effect, so it needs the special
injection nozzle with jet discharging function capable of adjusting the flow and, at the same
time, need to add pressure for improving agent distribution and limiting stripping steam
overflowing from the target exhaust space, in said method has high cost, difficult operation and
so on. melt stability of the polymer container the inventor through large research has
surprisingly been found that when the formula of the tetra [beta-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl--4 phenyl)
propionyloxy methyl) methane is added with certain amount of bromine-containing substance,
it can make the corresponding is obviously improved.
