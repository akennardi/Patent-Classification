                             STANDARD PATENT
                                     Invention Title
                                     Cleaning device
The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method
                          of performing it known to me/us:-

                                                la
            The present invention relates to a vacuum cleaner.
            Many people use vacuum cleaners to clean and tidy their homes. Normally
   vacuum cleaners are used to pick up dust and debris using a negative pressure.
 5 Dust and debris is entrained in an air flow and sucked into the body of the vacuum
   cleaner wherein the dust and debris are separated from the air flow. Once separated
   from the air flow, the dust and debris are collected and usually emptied in a dustbin
   at the user's convenience.
10          Some vacuum cleaners have complicated mechanisms for emptying the dirt
   container. For example EP 1 377 197 discloses a trigger mechanically coupled to a
   rod and latch release mechanism for a lid of the dust container. The user may not
   understand how to release the lid of the dust container and may damage the latch
   mechanism by attempting to prise the lid open.
15
            Another vacuum cleaner is shown in EP 1 594 386 whereby a hinged door
   allows the user to selectively access the dust container.       The hinged door may
   become clogged with dust over time hindering movement of the hinged door.
   Furthermore it is possible for the user to accidentally actuate the hinged door during
20 use because it is at the nozzle end of the vacuum cleaner. Furthermore the user has
   to place their hands in close proximity to the door to release the door and thereby
   getting their hands soiled when emptying the dust container.
            Embodiments described hereinafter aim to address the aforementioned
25 problems.
            According to an aspect of the present invention there is a vacuum cleaner
   comprising: a housing; a motor fan assembly arranged to generate an air flow; a
   detachable dirt container mountable to the housing; the dirt container having a dirty
   air inlet in fluid communication with the motor fan assembly; a filter for separating dirt
   from the air flow, the filter being mounted between the dirt container and the motor
   fan assembly; wherein the detachable dirt container comprises an emptying aperture
   in                                                                                      a

                                                  2
   wall of the dirt container, the emptying aperture being downstream in the air flow from
   the dirty air inlet and upstream of the filter, wherein the housing comprises an overlap
   portion for covering the emptying aperture in the dirt container and sealing the
   emptying aperture when the detachable dirt container is mounted to the housing.
            This means that the dirt bypasses the filter when emptying the dirt container.
   The user does not have to touch the filter or the soiled parts of the dirt container
   during a normal emptying action. This means that the user does not get dirt on their
 5 hands because the user only touches clean parts of the vacuum cleaner during the
   emptying action.
            Preferably the dirty air inlet is integral with the dirt container. Preferably the
   dirty air inlet is an integral nozzle protruding from the dirt container. Preferably the
10 housing comprises a first handle and the dirt container comprises a second handle
   for holding the dirt container. Preferably the integral nozzle comprises the second
   handle. This means that the user has a convenient gripping location which is also
   the nozzle.      This means that the user does not have to grip the dirt container
   anywhere near the dirty parts of the dirt container.
15
            Preferably the periphery of the emptying            aperture comprises a seal
   engageable with the overlap portion. Preferably the overlap portion comprises a
   recess for receiving the seal. This means that there is a good seal between the dirt
   container and the housing. This means that airflow only enters the vacuum cleaner
20 via the dirty air inlet.
            Preferably wherein the vacuum cleaner comprises a releasable latch
   mechanism for selectively releasing the dirt container from the housing.         Preferably
   the latch mechanism comprises a first portion of the latch mechanism on the housing
25 and a second reciprocal portion of the latch mechanism on the dirt container.
   Preferably the latch mechanism comprises a latch release button mounted in the
   housing for actuating the latch mechanism. Preferably the latch release button is
   mounted in the first handle and actuatable with a user's thumb. This means that the
   user is less likely to accidently detach the dirt container from the housing.
30

                                                  3
             Preferably the filter is removable from the dirt container. Preferably the filter is
   mountable on the dirt container and extends across a side of the dirt container
   opposite to the dirty air inlet. Preferably filter is a wall of the dirt container. Since the
   filter is removable it is replaceable and can be easily cleaned and maintained. The
 5 filter forms a wall of the dirt container and this makes a more compact vacuum
   cleaner requiring less parts and materials.
             Preferably the vacuum cleaner is a handheld vacuum cleaner.
10           Various other aspects and further embodiments are also described in the
   following detailed description and in the attached claims with reference to the
   accompanying drawings, in which:
             Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a vacuum cleaner;
15           Figure 2 shows partial perspective view of the vacuum cleaner;
             Figure 3 shows a side cross sectional view of the vacuum cleaner along the
   axis A-A; and
             Figure 4 shows a front cross sectional view of the vacuum cleaner along the
   axis B-B.
20
             Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a vacuum cleaner 100.             The vacuum
   cleaner 100 as shown in Figure 1 is a handheld vacuum cleaner, but in other
   embodiments the vacuum cleaner 100 may be an upright vacuum cleaner, a
   stickvac, a canister vacuum cleaner or any other type of vacuum cleaner.
25 References to vacuum cleaner 100 hereinafter will be in reference to the handheld
   vacuum cleaner as shown in the Figures.
             Vacuum cleaner 100 has a housing 102 which comprises two clam-shell
   halves fixed together.        A motor-fan assembly (not shown) is housed within the
30 housing 102. The motor fan assembly is arranged to create a negative pressure for
   creating an airflow for sucking up dirt and debris.
             The housing 102 comprises a first handle 104. The first handle 104 is integral
   with the housing 102 and the user grips the first handle when operating the vacuum
35 cleaner 100. The handle comprises an ON/OFF switch 106 for operating the vacuum

                                               4
   cleaner.     In some embodiments the handle comprises indicators for providing
   information about the vacuum cleaner 100 to the user. A battery indicator 108 is
   mounted on the handle for indicating to the user the charge level status of the
   battery. Further indicators (not shown) such as filter status indicators (filter blocked /
 5 filter cleared) can be mounted on the handle or elsewhere on the housing. In other
   embodiments the indicator 108 is a symbol indicating to the user where to charge the
   vacuum cleaner.
             A detachable dirt container 110 is mounted to the housing 102.              The
10 detachable dirt container 110 is coupled to the housing 102 via a latch mechanism
   302 which will be discussed in further detail in respect of Figure 3.           The latch
   mechanism 302 is actuated with a latch release button 112. The latch release button
   112 is mounted in the first handle 104. The latch release button 112 is mounted on a
   forward portion 114 of the first handle 104.      This means that the user is able to
15 actuate the latch mechanism with their thumb when they are gripping the first handle
   104.
             The detachable dirt container 110 comprises a first projecting side lip 116 and
   a second projecting side lip 118.       The first and second projecting side lips are
20 arranged to envelope a portion of the housing 102.           When the detachable dirt
   container 110 is mounted on the housing, the detachable dirt container is flush with
   the surface of the housing 102.
             The detachable dirt container 110 comprises a nozzle 120 having a dirty air
25 inlet 122. The nozzle 120 is hollow and comprises a conduit such that the dirty air
   inlet 122 is in fluid communication with the dirt container 110.      The nozzle 120 is
   integral with the detachable dirt container 110 and projects forwardly away from the
   housing 102.      In some embodiments the nozzle 120 can be a detachable and
   removable component of the dirt container 110.        In this case there are seals and
30 latches (not shown) for coupling the detachable nozzle.
             The vacuum cleaner 100 inherently has a directionality. There term "forward"
   refers to the nozzle 120 end of the vacuum cleaner. The term "rearward" refers to
   the back end of the vacuum cleaner where the motor fan assembly is housed in the
35 housing 102. The rearward end of the vacuum cleaner 100 is opposite the forward

                                                5
   end of the vacuum cleaner.        The term "top" refers to the upper side of vacuum
   cleaner where the first handle 104 is mounted.       When the user grips the first handle
   104, the vacuum cleaner 100 will naturally hang below the first handle 104.
 5          During operation of the vacuum cleaner 100, the motor fan assembly creates
   a negative pressure and sucks an air flow through the nozzle 120 and the dirt
   container 110.     The dirt is separated from the air flow when the air flow passes
   through the filter 202 (as shown in Figure 2). The direction of the airflow can be seen
   in Figure 3 whereby the air flow is represented by arrows. The clean air is then
10 exhaust from the motor fan assembly through side vents 126. The side vents 126
   guide the exhaust clean air rearward in a direction away from the nozzle 120 and
   generally from the vacuum cleaner 100.
            The nozzle 120 comprises a second handle 124. The second handle 124 is a
15 gripping portion of the projecting nozzle which is suitable for the user to wrap their
   fingers around. The diameter and cross section of the nozzle 120 is shaped so that a
   user's hand can wrap entirely or substantially around the nozzle 120. This means
   that the user can comfortably and securely grasp the nozzle 120 and the detachable
   dirt container 110.
20
            The detachable dirt container 110 will now be discussed in more detail in
   reference to Figure 2.     Figure 2 shows a perspective view of the detachable dirt
   container 110 removed from the housing 102. The detachable dirt container 110 is
   configured to be mountable on the housing 102. The detachable dirt container 110
25 comprises an exterior portion 204 which is exposed to the external environment
   when the detachable dirt container 110 is mounted on the housing 102. A portion of
   the dirt container 110 is an interior portion 206 which is inside the housing 102 and
   not exposed to the external environment when the dirt container 110 is mounted on
   the housing 102.
30
            The internal portion 206 comprises an internal top portion 208. The internal
   top portion 208 is the portion of the dirt container 110 that is immediately adjacent the
   housing 102 when the dirt container 110 is mounted on the housing 102.                 An
   emptying aperture 210 is located in the internal top portion 208 of the dirt container
   110. The emptying aperture 210 exposes the inside of the dirt container 110 to the

                                                6
   external
   environment when the dirt container 110 is separated from the housing 102.             The
   emptying aperture 210 allows dirt and debris which has been collected by the
   vacuum cleaner to be removed from the dirt container 110.
            A peripheral lip 212 of the emptying aperture comprises a peripheral seal 214
   for sealing against an interior surface of the housing 102. The peripheral seal 214 is
   engageable with the overlap portion 128.        In some embodiments the seal 214 is a
 5 resiliently deformable material. The seal 214 is mounted on the peripheral lip 212 but
   in other embodiments the seal 214 is mounted on the underside of the overlap
   portion 128.     In some embodiments the peripheral seal 214 a rubber material.
   Alternatively the seal is integral with the dirt container 110 and is a projecting
   member.      In some embodiments, no additional seal element is required because
10 engaging surfaces of the dirt container 110 and the housing 102 provide a suitably
   sufficient seal.    For example the negative pressure created by the motor fan
   assembly will suck the dirt container 110 against the housing 102.
            The internal top portion 208 has an inherent directionality because the top
15 portion 208 will face up away from the floor when detached from the housing 102.
   The internal top portion 208 is overlaid by an overlap portion 128 of the housing 102.
   The overlap portion 128 is best seen from Figures 1 and 3. The overlap portion 128
   is integral with the housing 102. The overlap portion 128 projects forwardly from the
   housing 102 towards the nozzle 120.
20
            By placing the emptying aperture 210 on the internal top portion 208, the user
   will detach the dirt container 110 with the emptying aperture 210 facing upwards.
   This means that the user will not spill the dirt from the dirt container on the floor when
   first removing the dirt container 110 from the housing 102.
25
            The mounting of the detachable dirt container 110 will now be discussed in
   reference to Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows a side cross section of the vacuum
   cleaner along the axis A-A (shown in Figure 1). Figure 3 shows the detachable dirt
   container 110 mounted on the housing 102. The nozzle 120 is partially shown and

                                               7
   the dirty air inlet 122 is not shown in Figure 3.     Figure 4 shows a forward cross
   section of the vacuum cleaner along the axis B-B (as shown in Figure 1)
           The overlap portion 128 shown in Figure 3 with dotted lines indicating the
 5 portion of the housing 102 which extends forward and overlaps the dirt container 110.
   As can be seen the first handle 104 is coupled to the overlap portion 128.
           When the dirt container 110 is mounted on the housing 102, the interior top
   portion 208 is adjacent to the interior surface 310 of the overlap portion 128.     The
10 peripheral seal 214 is received in a reciprocal recess 312. The reciprocal recess 312
   is the same shape as the peripheral lip 212 of the emptying aperture 210. When the
   peripheral seal 214 is seated in the reciprocal recess, the dirt container 110 is sealed
   against the housing 102. This means that there is no air flow path from the external
   environment to the dirt container 110 through the emptying aperture 210. This can
15 also be seen from Figure 4.
            In some embodiments the dirt container 110 comprises the reciprocal recess
   312 and the housing 102 comprises the seal 214.
20         The latching mechanism 302 and operation will now be described in further
   detail. The latch mechanism 302 is optional. For example in other embodiments the
   dirt container 110 is mounted on the housing 102 with other solutions such as
   resilient clips or a friction fit. In the embodiment shown in the Figures, the dirt
   container 110 is selectively releasable from the housing 102 with the latch
25 mechanism 302. The latch mechanism 302 comprises a first portion 304 and a
   second reciprocal portion 306. The first portion 304 is a resilient hook portion 304
   and the second portion 306 is a moveably biased latch portion 306. Figure 3 show
   the latch mechanism 302 in a locked position whereby the dirt container 110 is fixed
   to the hosing 102. The latch portion 306 moves between a release position and a
30 locked position. In the release position the latch portion 306 moves away clear from
   the hook portion 304. This means that the hook portion 304 is free to move out of the
   hole 314. The latch portion 306 is biased to the locked position. The latch portion
   306 is biased with a spring or any other suitable biasing means.

                                               8
           The latch mechanism 302 is actuated by the latch release button 112. The
   latch release button is mechanically coupled to the latch portion 306.            In some
   embodiments the latch portion is integral with the latch release button 112. The hook
   portion 304 comprises a cam surface 316.          When the dirt container is coupled
 5 together with the hosing 102 and the hook portion 304 is inserted into the hole 314,
   the cam surface 316 pushes the latch portion 306 away from the locked position.
   The latch portion 306 snaps back into the locked position when the cam surface 316
   moves past the latch portion 306.       This locks the hook portion 304 and the dirt
   container 110 in place.
10
           As mentioned above, the latch release button 112 is mounted on a forward
   portion 114 of the first handle 104. This means that the user is able to actuate the
   latch mechanism with their thumb when they are gripping the first handle 104. The
   latch release button 112 is mounted forward of the normal grip position of the first
15 handle 104. This means that the user must positively move their thumb and press
   the button 112 in order to release the dirt container 110. This means that the dirt
   container being accidentally released is less likely.
            In order to locate and seat the dirt container 110 accurately in the housing
20 102, the dirt container 110 optionally comprises a guide hole 216 on the underside of
   the dirt container 110. The guide hole 216 is on the side of the dirt container 110
   opposite to the latch mechanism 302. The guide hole 216 engages with a protruding
   tongue 308. The protruding tongue 308 is integral with the housing 102. Once the
   guide hole 216 engages with the protruding tongue 308, the dirt container 110 pivots
25 about the protruding tongue. The projecting side lips 116, 118 also guide the dirt
   container 110 around the housing 102 as the dirt container 110 pivots. This means
   that the hook portion 304 is aligned with the hole when the dirt container 110 is
   mounted to the housing. This reduces the chances of the dirt container 110 being
   misaligned by the user.
30
           The filter 202 will now be discussed in further detail. The filter 202 comprises
   a pleated filter material 320 for separating the dirt and debris form the dirty airflow.
   As shown in Figure 2, the filter 202 extends across the entire side of the dirt
   container 110 opposite the dirty are inlet 122. In this way the filter 202 fills the entire
35 cross section of the dirt container 110 at a rearward end of the dirt container 110.

                                                  9
   The filter 202 comprises a filter sealing edge 318.           The filter sealing edge 318
   comprises a resiliently flexible portion of material that is compressed when mounted
   in the dirt container 110.      The filter sealing edge 318 is urged against the inside
   surface of the dirt container 110 and seals thereagainst. This means that when the
 5 filter 202 is mounted in the dirt container 110, the air flow only passes through the
   pleated filter material 320.
             In some embodiments the filter 202 is wedged into the dirt container 110
   using a friction fit. In other embodiments, the filter 202 is mounted using other means
10 such as glue, or ribs which slot into rails or any other suitable mounting means. In
   some embodiments the filter 202 is removable and replaceable. This means that if
   the dirt container 110 needs a deep clean, the user can remove the filter 202 after
   removing the dirt container 110. This means that the user can gain access to the
   interior of the dirt container 110 when the filter 202 is removed.         This means for
15 example the user can run the dirt container 110 under the tap and / or clean the filter
   separately.
             The emptying operation of the vacuum cleaner 100 will now be described.
   The user grips the first handle 104 with their first hand. The user then grips the
20 second handle 124 on the nozzle 120 with their second hand. This means that the
   user is gripping both parts of the vacuum cleaner and they will not drop them when
   the housing 102 separates from the dirt container 110. The user then extends their
   thumb and presses the latch release button 112. The latch mechanism 302 is then
   moved into the release position and the hook portion 304 and the dirt container 110
25 are moveable with respect to the housing 102. The housing 102 and overlap portion
   128 are then lifted away from the dirt container 110 as the housing 102 pivots about
   the guide hole 216. Once the dirt container 110 is separated from the housing 102,
   the emptying aperture 210 is revealed.           The first and second handles 104, 124
   naturally mean that the user will always open the vacuum cleaner 100 with the
30 emptying aperture 210 facing upwards. The user can then move the dirt container
   110 to a dustbin and rotate it such that the emptying aperture faces downwards. In
   this position the dirt and debris in the dirt container will fall out of the emptying
   aperture 210. The user can tap the dirt container against the dustbin to dislodge the
   dirt if necessary.
35

                                                 10
           This means that the dirt bypasses the filter when emptying the dirt container.
   The use does not have to touch the filter or the soiled parts of the dirt container
   during a normal emptying action. This means that the user does not get dirt on their
   hands because the user only touches clean parts of the vacuum cleaner during the
 5 emptying action.
           In some embodiments the emptying aperture 210 is located on a side other
   than on the top side of the vacuum cleaner.           Similarly the overlap portion 128 is
   located at a similarly different location to still overlay over the emptying aperture 210.
10 For example the emptying aperture 210 can be located on the underside of the dirt
   container 110 and the overlap portion 128 is located on the underside of the housing
   102.
           In other embodiments the filter can be other types of dirt separation means.
15 For example the filter can be a pleated conical filter or a cyclonic separation
   apparatus. Alternatively the filter can be a bag filter.
           In another embodiment two or more embodiments are combined. Features of
   one embodiment can be combined with features of other embodiments.
