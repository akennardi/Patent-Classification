   Technical Field
    [0001]
           The  present     invention      relates    to   a polyunsaturated          fatty    acid
10 containing fat.       More particularly, the present                invention relates to a
   polyunsaturated       fatty     acid-containing          fat     which     has    realized      an
   improvement    in   oxidation      stability      required       for   a  food   containing       a
   polyunsaturated     fatty     acid-containing         fat,   and    a   food   containing      the
   same as well as a method for producing the same.

   Background Art
    [0002]
           In  recent   years,     effectiveness       of n-3      fatty    acid   serving as      an
   essential    fatty   acid    for health       has   been    widely     known,    and  a   demand
20 therefor has been increased.               Examples of the n-3 fatty acid include a
   linolenic      acid       (C18:3),         docosahexaenoic          acid      (DHA;     C22:6),
   eicosapentaenoic      acid     (EPA;     C20:5),    and    docosapentaenoic         acid     (DPA;
   C22:5).
    [0003]
25         Since   the   n-3    fatty     acid     contains    many      double    bonds    in    the
   constituent       fatty        acids,         a     fat        containing         n-3       fatty

                                                   2
   acid has poor stability, and deteriorates its taste quickly.
   Care     such     as   preservation           at   a   low      temperature       or     under
   light     shielding       is    needed,        and    for     this     reason,      intended
   use     as   a      general      edible         fat     is      limited,       and     a   fat
 5 containing a large amount of n-3 fatty acid and having high
   stability has been demanded.
    [0004]
           In addition, a polyunsaturated acid-containing fat has
   very     poor    oxidation       stability         as     compared       with    an    edible
10 fat such as soybean oil                 and rapeseed oil,              easily undergoes
   oxidation by oxygen, light, heat etc.                            When it is oxidized,
   it generates an          off-taste and off-flavor,                     or it produces a
   peroxide      which      concerns          to   give     an     adverse     influence       on
   health.        In    order    to   utilize        such     a   polyunsaturated           acid
15 containing         fat   which     is      remarkably        inferior       in    oxidation
   stability, various methods                    aiming at blocking contact with
   oxygen in       the air have been disclosed.                        Patent Documents           1
   to    8 disclose       a method of           formulation of           a polyunsaturated
   acid-containing          fat    into an        emulsion,         and   Patent     Documents
20 9 and     10 disclose        a method of powderization or                      capsulation
   of     a    polyunsaturated               acid-containing              fat.          When      a
   polyunsaturated          acid-containing             fat     is    formulated        into   an
   emulsion,        the    emulsion        becomes      cloudy        into   a    translucent
   state,      or      contains      water,        and      therefore,        intended        use
25 thereof     is    limited.        In     addition,        even     when   such     a  fat   is

                                                   3
   subjected      to    powderization              or     capsulation,            there     is    a
   problem  that      intended use           thereof        is  limited,         likewise      the
   emulsion.          In     view       of     such       a    technical           background,
   utilization of the conventional polyunsaturated fatty acid
 5 containing      fat     has      been     limited         only    to     an     application
   range such as health foods encapsulated, canned foods,                                    etc.
   However, the manufacturing operation is troublesome and the
   productivity         is     lowered;          and      in    capsulated            products,
   oxidization        has     already         progressed          in      steps,        and    the
10 majority    of      fats      inside       the      capsule       have      an     oxidative
   rancidity.         Also,       there      is     a   problem       that       in    order    to
   prevent     the       capsule         during          preservation             from      being
   destructed,       the     kind     of    the       capsule      which      is     usable     in
   foods and feedstuffs is limited.
15  [0005]
         Patent Document            11   discloses         a method of mixing a                fat
   containing      DHA    inferior        in    oxidation         stability          at   30% or
   more  with    another        fat   to   utilize         the mixture          as    an  edible
   fat composition for cooking with heat.                            However, in          such a
20 method,  a    blending         amount     of     DHA    is   extremely         as    small   as
   0.01  to 0.5%,       and it is        far from taking an amount which is
   said to be effective for health.
    [0006]
         It is    known that a refined polyunsaturated fatty acid
25 containing     fat    has      no   odor     and     does    not    contain        peroxide,

                                                    4
   but when oxidation occurs, the reaction progresses likewise
   a  chain    reaction,           and    generation          of   deteriorated           smell      or
   peroxide         occurs          quickly.                For        example,          after        a
   polyunsaturated             fatty       acid-containing               fat    is    used        in  a
 5 factory, it is necessary that the                         fat is poured into a can,
   that the can containing the fat is                          filled with nitrogen gas,
   and  that     the     can    is    tightly       closed;        that     is,    a  variety        of
   considerations are necessary for handling fat,                                   and intended
   use thereof itself has limitation.                           Many attempts have been
10 made      for      stabilizing              a    polyunsaturated                fatty         acid
   containing       fat by addition of a variety of antioxidants                                     or
   a  mixture       thereof,         but      they     have     not      reached       sufficient
   outcome     at     this      stage.           Contrary         to     a   demand       from      the
   markets,       it     cannot        be      said      that      development           of      foods
15 containing       a    polyunsaturated             fatty      acid-containing              fat    has
   sufficiently progressed.
    [0007]
          Heretofore, in order to improve oxidation stability of
   an   edible         fat,       addition         of      an     antioxidant           has        been
20 generally         performed.                   Specifically,               utilization            of
   tocopherol         serving         as      a    lipid-soluble             antioxidant,            or
   ascorbyl     palmitate           has    been     studied.            For    example,        Patent
   Document      2    discloses          a    method       of    emulsifying          an     aqueous
   ascorbic      acid       solution          for   addition,           Patent       Document        12
25 discloses       a method         of adding        tocopherol,           ascorbic        acid and

                                                    5
   tea     extract,         and    Patent   Document        13   discloses       a   method      of
   adding ascorbic               acid or a     salt thereof           and another        organic
   acid       or      a     salt     thereof;       but      those       methods       are      not
   satisfactory             as   a  method    of    improving        oxidation       stability

          As     a  method        of     improving             oxidation        stability            of  a
   polyunsaturated fatty                 acid-containing fat,                   Patent           Document
25 17  discloses        a   method        including             treating      a     fish        oil   with

   silica        gel;       deodorizing            the    oil      with   water      steam      under
   vacuum       in    the presence              of  a   rosemary       or   sage    extract;       and
   adding        ascorbyl             palmitate        or     mixed     tocopherol           thereto.
   This      overcomes            a   problem      of   an    aroma    peculiar       to     rosemary
 5 or sage, and proposes a fat having high oxidation stability.
   However,          oxidation             stability       of     a  polyunsaturated             fatty
   acid      obtained          by     this     method     is    merely     at   best     such     that
   rancidity stability at 100 C increases about three times by
   blending          of     an       antioxidant         at     3000    ppm,      and     oxidation
10 stability           is     still        low.      Patent       Document      18   discloses         a
   method of          adding catechin before purification, but also                                  in
   this       method,            it      cannot      be      said     that      improvement          in
   oxidation          stability            shown    by   the     degree     of   suppression         of
   an increase in peroxide value is sufficient.

             As    a   method         of     reducing     an    odor,     Patent      Document       19
   has      proposed         a     method      of   adding      a   milk-based        flavor,      and
   Patent Document                  20 has proposed a method of masking a                         fish
   smell by          adding         a   ginger     flavor,      but    since     oxidation        of   a
20 fat generates a peroxide which is harmful to the human body,
   masking treatment which does not suppress oxidation has not
   led to drastic solution of the problem.

                                              9
         As   described         above,    a     polyunsaturated                fatty         acid
   containing     fat     is    a  material       which         draws     attention           from
   effectiveness       of a polyunsaturated fatty acid on the human
   body, but since oxidation stability is inferior as compared
 5 with   the  conventional         edible     fat,        there      is  a   problem         that
   usage applications are limited.
    [0017]
         In order       to respond to the             above-mentioned demand, an
   object of the present invention is to sufficiently suppress
10 oxidation    of    a   polyunsaturated            fatty       acid-containing              fat,
   to   provide     a    polyunsaturated             fatty        acid-containing               fat
   which is   good in         taste and is       distributable in the markets
   in the form of a liquid like an ordinary edible oil such as
   soybean oil     or rapeseed oil,           and to          extend intended use to
15 foods fields.
    [0018]
         It is   important to obtain a good taste, as well as,                                     to
   improve     oxidation          stability,           in       foods       containing               a
   polyunsaturated         fatty    acid-containing                fat.       A     method         of
20 improving     oxidation         stability         of      a    fat     has      also       been
   disclosed,    but     as    described     above,          in   Patent      Documents            13
   to  15,  there     is    a  problem   that       a    taste      is   not     preferable,
   probably   because         addition  of     a    relatively           large      amount         of
   an emulsifier is          essential in order to make a water-soluble
25 antioxidant substance oil-soluble.                       In addition, the method

                                                       10
   disclosed            in    Patent       Document           16   does     not      include         an
   emulsifier, but includes                     green tea-derived hexane solubles,
   as    well       as   catechin.           Since       the    green     tea-derived         hexane
   solubles contain ingredients of bitterness and astringency,
 5 this       is    not    suitable       in     the     case    of     addition      of   a   large
   amount of catechin.
    [0019]
            An      object      of    the    present         invention      is    to   provide        a
   polyunsaturated                  fatty        acid-containing               fat      high         in
10 versatility having excellent oxidation stability and a good
   taste         by   dispersing        a    water-soluble             tea  polyphenol          in    a
   polyunsaturated                fatty      acid-containing              fat   with       an     easy
   method.
15 Means for Solving the Problems
    [0020]
             In     order      to    solve      the      aforementioned         problems,           the
   present          inventors       have     intensively          studied.        As    a   result,
   they found out that a polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing
20 fat      which       has     excellent         oxidation         stability        and     a    good
   taste        is   obtained by adding               a water-soluble           tea polyphenol
   originally           hard     to be     soluble        in   a  fat    to   a  fat    while       the
   water-soluble             tea     polyphenol           is    in    a   solution       state       by
   using         an   aqueous       medium.         The     present      invention        has     been
25 completed on the basis of these findings.

                                                    11

          The  water-soluble         tea    polyphenol     used      in  the   present
   invention     is     preferably        a    water-soluble        tea    polyphenol
 5 containing no oil-soluble              fraction     in a tea       extract.       This
   is   because     the    oil-soluble         fraction    in     the    tea   extract
   contains     ingredients        of   bitterness       and    astringency.            An

   an  aqueous     medium      such    as   hot   water   or    alcohol.        A   more
   preferable      example      thereof       may   include      aqueous     solution
   extraction.        By performing extraction not using an                    organic
   solvent but using an aqueous                solution,    a water-soluble tea
15 polyphenol containing almost no oil-soluble fraction may be
   obtained.      It    is  known that        a water-soluble         tea polyphenol
   contains      catechins          as     a     main    ingredient,          and        as
   representative         catechins,        eight    kinds     of     catechins        are
   present.            Examples         of       gallate       catechin        include
20 epigallocatechin          gallate,        epicatechin       gallate,      catechin
   gallate,     and     gallocatechin          gallate.        Examples      of      free
   catechin     include       epigallocatechin,          epicatechin,        catechin
   and   gallocatechin.          The    water-soluble      tea     polyphenol        also
   includes oxidized polyphenols                which are     generated from the
25 fermentation        state     of    tea     leaves,    in     addition      to      the

                                                  21
   catechins.           In  the   present       invention,           it   is    preferable         to
   use      a  water-soluble       tea      polyphenol          containing          one     or   more
   kinds of the catechins or polyphenols.                              Further preferably,
   a     commercially         available         water-soluble              tea      polyphenol
 5 containing           composition         in    which          the     concentration             of
   polyphenol         has   been    adjusted       in     a    certain       range       is     used.
   And, most preferably, a water-soluble product which has not
   been adjusted with an emulsifier etc. is used.                                    Examples of
   a      preferable         water-soluble              tea        polyphenol-containing

   by      Taiyo     Kagaku     Co.,     Ltd.;      and       product        name:        Sunfood,
   manufactured by Mitsubishi-Kagaku Foods Corporation.                                         Since
   the     composition may be effectively dispersed in a                                 fat at a
   high concentration, it is better as a content of polyphenol
15 in    the    water-soluble        tea      polyphenol-containing                  composition
   is higher, and it is             preferable          that the water-soluble                    tea
   polyphenol-containing              composition            contains        50% or        more    of
   the water-soluble tea polyphenol.

                                                   77
   of Example B1 to Example B12 in each of which the a/B value
   by GC-TOFMS          analysis after 3 days at                  60 C was 7 or less,           a
   good    result       was     also   obtained       in   taste      evaluation       after    3
   days at       60 0 C.
 5 -   In    Example          B4,    Example     B6      and    Example     B13,      a    taste
   immediately after preparation was slightly inferior to that
   of   Example        B1,     but   the  a/B   value      by     GC-TOFMS   analysis         was
   as good as 7 or              less,   and taste evaluation after 3 days                      at
   60 0 C was also good.
10 - Comparative Example B4 was considered to be difficult for
   use    due     to    intense       white   turbidity,           and  the   preservation
   test was not performed.
   * In Comparative Example B5, a water-soluble tea polyphenol
   which was         equal      to   those   of Examples           B1  and  B2 was       added,
15 but the       dispersibility          of   the water-soluble            tea    polyphenol
   was    deteriorated,              and   the     effect        corresponding          to    the
   addition amount of the water-soluble tea polyphenol was not
   obtained,         and       therefore,      the     preservation         test     was      not
   performed.
20 -   In    Comparative           Example     B6     to    Comparative        Example        B8,
   taste      evaluation            at   the    initial          stage    was     remarkably
   deteriorated, and the preservation test was not performed.
   -  In Example Bl,               the CDM stability time was               equal to         that
   of   Example        B2,     but   regarding      the    taste      evaluation       after    3
25 days at       60 0 C and the a/B value by GC-TOFMS, more preferable

                                                        -   78
   results than those of Example B2 were obtained.
    e  The     result      of taste       evaluation        after       3   days     at    60'C of Comparative
   Example       Bl,      in  which      the     a/P  value      by    GC-TOFMS        analysis         after     3  days
   at 60'C was 7.89, was determined to be not acceptable.
