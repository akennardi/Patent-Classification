    2-AMINOPYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF VIRAL
                                    INFECTIONS
The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
2014220717, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
This invention relates to 2-aminopyrimidine derivatives, processes for their
preparation, pharmaceutical compositions, and their use in treating viral
infections.
The present invention relates to the use of 2-aminopyrimidinederivatives in the
treatment of viral infections, immune or inflammatory disorders, whereby the
modulation, or agonism, of toll-like-receptors (TLRs) is involved. Toll-Like
Receptors are primary transmembrane proteins characterized by an extracellular
leucine rich domain and a cytoplasmic extension that contains a conserved
region. The innate immune system can recognize pathogen-associated
molecular patterns via theseTLRs expressed on the cell surface of certain types
of immune cells. Recognition of foreign pathogens activates the production of
cytokines and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on phagocytes. This
leads to the modulation of T cell behaviour.
It has been estimated that most mammalian species have between ten and
fifteen types of Toll-like receptors. Thirteen TLRs (named TLR1 to TLR13) have
been identified in humans and mice together, and equivalent forms of many of
these have been found in other mammalian species. However, equivalents of
certain TLR found in humans are not present in all mammals. For example, a
gene coding for a protein analogous to TLR10 in humans is present in mice, but
appears to have been damaged at some point in the past by a retrovirus. On the
other hand, mice express TLRs 11, 12, and 13, none of which are represented
in humans. Other mammals may express TLRs which are not found in humans.
Other non-mammalian species may have TLRs distinct from mammals, as
demonstrated by TLR14, which is found in the Takifugu pufferfish. This may
complicate the process of using experimental animals as models of human
innate immunity.

                                                -4e
   Compounds indicating activity on Toll-Like receptors have been previously
   described such as purine derivatives in WO 2006/117670, adenine derivatives
   in WO 98/01448 and WO 99/28321, and pyrimidines in WO 2009/067081.
   However, there exists a strong need for novel Toll-Like receptor modulators
 5 having preferred selectivity, higher potency, higher metabolic stability, and an
   improved safety profile compared to the compounds of the prior art.
   In accordance with the present invention a compound of formula (1)is provided
                  0 N'
      R-X          N       NH2
     2H                         ()
   or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, tautomer(s), stereo-isomeric forms,
10 solvate or polymorph thereof, wherein
   X represents S, S=O or O=S=O,
   R1 is hydrogen, (Ce)-alkyl, (C1-)-alkoxy or aryl,
   R2 is (C1- 3)-alkyl or (C3. 6)-cycloalkyl and
   n = 1 or 2.
15 The compounds of formula (1) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts,
   tautomer(s), stereo-isomeric forms, solvate or polymorph thereof have activity
   as pharmaceuticals, in particular as modulators of Toll-Like Receptors
   (especially TLR7 and/or TLR8 activity).
   In a further aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition
20 comprising a compound of formula (1)or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,
   tautomer, stereo-isomeric form, solvate or polymorph thereof together with one
   or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, diluents or carriers.
   Furthermore a compound of formula (1)or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,
   solvate, tautomer, stereo-isomeric form or polymorph thereof according to the
25 current invention, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising said compound
   of formula(l) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, tautomer, stereo
   isomeric form or polymorph thereof can be used as a medicament.

   Another aspect of the invention is that a compound of formula (1) or its
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, tautomer, stereo-isomeric form or
   polymorph thereof, or said pharmaceutical composition comprising said
   compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate,
 5 tautomer, stereo-isomeric form or polymorph thereof can be used accordingly
   in the treatment of a disorder where the modulation of TLR's, more specifically
   TLR7 and /or TLR8, is involved.
   The term "(Ci. 6)-alkyl" or "(C1-3)-alkyl refers to a straight-chain, branched-chain
   or cyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon containing the specified number of
10 carbon atoms.
   The term "aryl" means an aromatic ring structure optionally comprising one or
   two heteroatoms selected from N, 0 and S, in particular from N and 0. Said
   aromatic ring structure may have 4, 5, 6 or 7 ring atoms. In particular, said
   aromatic ring structure may have 5 or 6 ring atoms.
15 The term "(C1.,)-alkoxy refers to an alkyl (carbon and hydrogen chain) group
   singular bonded to oxygen like for instance a methoxy group or ethoxy group.
   The term "(C3s6)-cycloalkyl" means refers to a carbocyclic ring containing the
   specified number of carbon atoms.
   As used herein, any chemical formula with bonds shown only as solid lines and
20 not as solid wedged or hashed wedged bonds, or otherwise indicated as having
   a particular configuration (e.g. R, S) around one or more atoms, contemplates
   each possible stereoisomer, or mixture of two or more stereoisomers.
   The terms "stereoisomers", "stereoisomeric forms" or "stereochemically
   isomeric forms" hereinbefore or hereinafter are used interchangeably.
25 The invention includes all stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention
   either as a pure stereoisomer or as a mixture of two or more stereoisomers.
   Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of
   each other. A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a racemate or racemic
   mixture.
30 Diastereomers (or diastereoisomers) are stereoisomers that are not
   enantiomers, i.e. they are not related as mirror images. If a compound contains
   a double bond, the substituents may be in the E or the Z configuration. If a
   compound contains an at least disubstituted non-aromatic cyclic group, the
   substituents may be in the cis or trans configuration.

                                            -4
   Therefore, the invention includes enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates, E
   isomers, Z isomers, cis isomers, trans isomers and mixtures thereof, whenever
   chemically possible.
   The meaning of all those terms, i.e. enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates,
 5 E isomers, Z isomers, cis isomers, trans isomers and mixtures thereof are
   known to the skilled person.
   The absolute configuration is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog
   system. The configuration at an asymmetric atom is specified by either R or S.
   Resolved stereoisomers whose absolute configuration is not known can be
10 designated by (+) or (-) depending on the direction in which they rotate plane
   polarized light.       For instance, resolved enantiomers whose absolute
   configuration is not known can be designated by (+) or (-) depending on the
   direction in which they rotate plane polarized light.
   When a specific stereoisomer is identified, this means that said stereoisomer is
15 substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 50%, preferably less than 20%,
   more preferably less than 10%, even more preferably less than 5%, in
   particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1%, of the other
   stereoisomers. Thus, when a compound of Formula (1)is for instance specified
   as (R), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (S) isomer;
20 when a compound of Formula (1)is for instance specified as E, this means that
   the compound is substantially free of the Z isomer; when a compound of
   Formula (1) is for instance specified as cis, this means that the compound is
   substantially free of the trans isomer.
   Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (1)include the
25 acid addition and base salts thereof. Suitable acid addition salts are formed
   from acids which form non-toxic salts. Suitable base salts are formed from
   bases which form non-toxic salts.
   The compounds of the invention may also exist in unsolvated and solvated
   forms. The term "solvate" is used herein to describe a molecular complex
30 comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically
   acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol.
   The term "polymorph" refers to the ability of the compound of the invention to
   exist in more than one form or crystal structure.
   The compounds of the present invention may be administered as crystalline or
35 amorphous products. They may be obtained for example as solid plugs,

   powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze
   drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. They may be administered alone or
   in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in
   combination with one or more other drugs. Generally, they will be administered
 5 as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable
   excipients. The term "excipient" is used herein to describe any ingredient other
   than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient depends largely
   on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the
   excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.
10 The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be
   formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As
   appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed
   for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical
   compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound,
15 optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate
   admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a
   wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for
   administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary
   dosage form suitable, for example, for oral, rectal, or percutaneous
20 administration. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form,
   any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example,
   water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations
   such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions, and solutions; or solid carriers
   such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating
25 agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets.
   Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the
   most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical
   carriers are obviously employed. Also included are solid form preparations that
   can be converted, shortly before use, to liquid forms. In the compositions
30 suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a
   penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally
   combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which
   additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said
   additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for
35 preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered
   in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.
   The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via

   inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in
   the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the
   present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a
   suspension or a dry powder.
 5 It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical
   compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of
   dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units
   suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of
   active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in
10 association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit
   dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills,
   powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and
   the like, and segregated multiples thereof.
   Those of skill in the treatment of infectious diseases will be able to determine
15 the effective amount from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is
   contemplated that an effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50
   mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It
   may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more
   sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be
20 formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in
   particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.
   The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular
   compound of formula (1) used, the particular condition being treated, the
   severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical
25 condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may
   be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident
   that the effective amount may be lowered or increased depending on the
   response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the
   physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective
30 amount ranges mentioned above are therefore only guidelines and are not
   intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.

 5 Description of Biological Assays
   Assessment of TLR7 and TLR8 activity
   The ability of compounds to activate human TLR7 and/or TLR8 was assessed
   in a cellular reporter assay using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a
   TLR7 or TLR8 expression vector and NFiB-luc reporter construct.
10 Briefly, HEK293 cells were grown in culture medium (DMEM supplemented
   with 10% FCS and 2 mM Glutamine). For transfection of cells in 15 cm dishes,
   cells were detached with Trypsin-EDTA, transfected with a mix of CMV-TLR7
   or TLR8 plasmid (1700 ng), NFiB-luc plasmid (850 ng) and a transfection
   reagent and incubated for 48 h at 37*C in a humidified 5% C02 atmosphere.
15 Transfected cells were then washed in PBS, detached with Trypsin-EDTA and
   resuspended in medium to a density of 1.25 x 105 cells/mL. Forty microliters of
   cells were then dispensed into each well in 384-well plates, where 200 nL of
   compound in 100% DMSO was already present. Following 6 hours incubation

   at 37'C, 5% CO 2 , the luciferase activity was determined by adding 15 pL of
   Steady Lite Plus substrate (Perkin Elmer) to each well and readout performed
   on a ViewLux ultraHTS microplate imager (Perkin Elmer). Dose response
   curves were generated from measurements performed in quadruplicates.
 5 Lowest effective concentrations (LEC) values, defined as the concentration that
   induces an effect which is at least two fold above the standard deviation of the
   assay, were determined for each compound.
   Compound toxicity was determined in parallel using a similar dilution series of
   compound with 40 pL per well of cells transfected with the CMV-TLR7
10 construct alone (1.25 x 105 cells/mL), in 384-well plates. Cell viability was
   measured after 6 hours incubation at 370C, 5% CO 2 by adding 15 pL of ATP
   lite (Perkin Elmer) per well and reading on a ViewLux ultraHTS microplate
   imager (Perkin Elmer). Data was reported as CCso.
   In parallel, a similar dilution series of compound was used (200 nL of
15 compound in 100% DMSO) with 40 pL per well of cells transfected with NFKB
   luc reporter construct alone (1.25 x 105 cells/mL). Six hours after incubation at
   37*C, 5% C0 2 , the luciferase activity was determined by adding 15 pl of Steady
   Lite Plus substrate (Perkin Elmer) to each well and readout performed on a
   ViewLux ultraHTS microplate imager (Perkin Elmer). Counterscreen data is
20 reported as LEC.
   Activation of ISRE promoter elements
   The potential of compounds to induce IFN-1 was also evaluated by measuring
   the activation of interferon-stimulated responsive elements (ISRE) by
25 conditioned media from PBMC. The ISRE element of sequence
   GAAACTGAAACT is highly responsive to the STAT1 -STAT2-IRF9 transcription
   factor, activated upon binding of IFN-l to their receptor IFNAR (Clontech,
   PT3372-5W). The plasmid pISRE-Luc from Clontech (ref. 631913) contains 5
   copies of this ISRE element, followed by the firefly luciferase ORF. A HEK293
30 cell line stably transfected with pISRE-Luc (HEK-ISREluc) was established to
   profile the conditioned PBMC cell culture media.
   Briefly, PBMCs were prepared from buffy coats of at least two donors using a
   standard Ficoll centrifugation protocol. Isolated PBMCs were resuspended in
   RPMI medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum and 2 x 105 cells/well
35 were dispensed into 384-well plates containing compounds (70 pL total

                                        -1Ij
   volume). After overnight incubation, 10 pL of supernatant was transferred to
   384-well plates containing 5 x 103 HEK-ISREluc cells/well in 30 pL (plated the
   day before). Following 24 hours of incubation, activation of the ISRE elements
   was measured by assaying luciferase activity using 40 pL/well Steady Lite Plus
 5 substrate (Perkin Elmer) and measured with ViewLux ultraHTS microplate
   imager (Perkin Elmer). The stimulating activity of each compound on the HEK
   ISREluc cells was reported as LEC value, defined as the compound
   concentration applied to the PBMCs resulting in a luciferase activity at least two
   fold above the standard deviation of the assay. The LEC in turn indicates the
10 degree of ISRE activation on transfer of a defined amount of PBMC culture
   medium. Recombinant interferon a-2a (Roferon-A) was used as a standard
   control compound.
