                                           ABSTRACT
Apparatus and methods for preparing the                      interior of a bone                for
therapy.       The   therapy      may   include    therapy      for    a   bone     fracture.
The      apparatus       and    methods      may  involve      orienting          a   surgical
instrument        for proper       deployment      in  the    interior         of   the bone.
An     instrument        guide    may    be    positioned      and     retained         against
translation         along,      and   rotation      about    one      or    more     of    three
substantially           orthogonal       axes.    Apparatus       placed        exterior        to
the     bone   may     register     the     guide   to  a   region       inside      the      bone
that      is  designated        for  preparation       or   treatment.          One    or     more
broaching        members        may   be     used   to    prepare        the     region        for
treatment.        A    broaching      member     may   be    expandable           inside       the
bone. A broaching member may be flexible                       such that it broaches
bone       having    a    relatively        lower   density      and      it    leaves        bone
having a relatively higher density substantially intact.

FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY
 [02] Aspects of the disclosure relate to providing apparatus and
methods         for      repairing           bone       fractures.         In    particular,               the
disclosure         relates         to    apparatus         and    methods     for    repairing           bone
fractures utilizing a device that                            is inserted into a bone.
BACKGROUND
 [03]     Bone    fracture          fixation        may      involve      using    a    structure           to
counteract or partially counteract forces                                on a fractured bone or
associated         bone       fragments.           In     general,       fracture       fixation           may
provide         longitudinal              (along        the      long     axis     of      the       bone),
transverse          (across        the     long     axis      of   the   bone),     and      rotational
 (about the long axis of the bone) stability. Fracture

                                                     -    2
fixation        may         also       preserve             normal          biologic           and      healing
function.
 [04]  Bone fracture                fixation often                 involves addressing loading
conditions,          fracture          patterns,              alignment,            compression           force,
and   other       factors,           which         may      differ        for      different          types      of
fractures.            For       example,           midshaft           fractures           may    have      ample
bone material on either side                            of the fracture                 in which anchors
may    be     driven.                End-bone              fractures,             especially            on     the
articular           surface           may          have         thin        cortical            bone,        soft
cancellous          bone,           and     relatively               fewer        possible           anchoring
locations.             Typical          bone        fracture            fixation           approaches          may
involve      one     or both of:               (1)     a   device        that       is    within       the   skin
 (internal fixation);                 and       (2) a device that extends out                             of the
skin    (external fixation).
 [05]  Internal            fixation          approaches              typically            involve        one     or
both   of:      (a)      a    plate       that      is      screwed         to    the      outside        of   the
bone;    and     (b) an implant that                      is inserted inside the bone.
 [06]  Plates         are       often       characterized                 by     relatively            invasive
surgery,        support           of    fractured             bone       segments           from     one     side
outside      of     bone,         and     screws         that       anchor        into       the   plate       and
the bone.
 [07]  Implants          may       include         intramedullary                rods      or   nails,       such
as    those        used          in    mid         shaft          treatments.                  The      typical
intramedullary               rod      or      nail        is       fixed        in     diameter          and     is
introduced          into         the     medullary              canal        through          an     incision.
Flexible      intramedullary rod-like                            solutions           utilize structures
that    can     be      inserted           into       the       medullary            cavity      through         an
access     site      and then be made                    rigid.           The     flexible        structures
may   be    reinforced              with       polymers            or    cements.             Multi-segment

                                                 - 3
fractures,        of   either       the      midshaft       or     end-bone,            may    require
alignment       and   stability           in    a    manner     that      generates          adequate
fixation      in    multiple         directions.             Implants          may       be   used      to
treat midshaft fractures and end-bone fractures.
[08]     Implant-based therapies may involve removing bone tissue
from the interior of the bone to prepare the                                  interior for the
implant.       Preparation for the implant may involve providing a
space in the bone interior for reception of the implant.
[09]     Proper    location,         size,        shape,    orientation             and     proximity
to     bone    fragments          and        anatomical          features,             among       other
factors,     may     increase          the      therapeutic          effectiveness              of    the
implant.
[010]          It    would        be       desirable,           therefore,               to   provide
apparatus and methods for preparation of a bone interior.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[055]        Apparatus and methods for preparing the                                 interior of
a  bone  for       therapy        are     provided.           The     therapy       may      include
therapy   for      a bone       fracture.           The    apparatus        and     methods       may
involve orienting a             surgical instrument                 for proper deployment
in  the  interior           of    the     bone.        The     surgical       instrument          may
provide   access        from     outside        the    bone     to    the   interior          of  the
bone.    The      surgical         instrument         may     prepare       the     interior       to
receive    a   therapeutic             device.         The     surgical       instrument          may
include a therapeutic device.
[056]        Apparatus           and      methods       for     positioning           a    surgical
instrument        relative          to     exterior        features         of     a     bone     are
provided.      The apparatus may be a surgical instrument guide.
[057]        The       surgical            instrument         may       be    a      device       for
repairing      the      bone.             The    surgical          instrument          may     be    a
prosthetic      device.          For      example,      the     surgical      instrument          may
include one       or more of the              features      of devices         that are         shown
and   described            in      U.S.        Patent        Application             Publication
No. 2009/0182336A1,             which is        hereby incorporated by                   reference
herein  in    its     entirety.             The   surgical         instrument         may     be  for
accessing    an     interior         region      of    the    bone.        For     example,       the
surgical     instrument             may      be    a    bone        saw.         The       surgical
instrument      may     be    a    drill.        The     surgical        instrument           may  be
for  preparing        the     interior         region      of     the    bone     to    receive      a
therapeutic device.               For example,           the    surgical instrument may
be a broach.

                                                      - 9
[058]              The      surgical         instrument            may have           a  portion      that     is
configured            to     be    positioned           in    a     targeted          region     inside       the
bone.
[059]              The     bone may have              a     surface.            The     surface may have
a     normal         axis.             The       normal          axis        may       be    substantially
perpendicular                to      the     surface.                The      surface        may    have       an
anterior-posterior                    axis.           The       anterior-posterior                 axis       may
extend        in     a    direction           that       is     substantially              normal      to     the
anterior          and     posterior           sides        of    the       bone.         The   surface        may
have      a    proximal-distal                 axis.          The       proximal-distal            axis       may
extend       in     a    direction          that      is     substantially               along    the      bone.
The      bone       surface          may      have       curvature.                 The     curvature         may
define           a       curvature              axis.                 The        curvature          may        be
circumferential                 around       the     bone.            The    curvature         axis    may     be
parallel or near parallel with the proximal-distal axis.
[060]              The      surgical         instrument            guide        may     include     a   bottom
index.          The      bottom index            may provide               for    aligning       the    device
at    a   position            along      the      surface         normal         axis.        The   position
may     be    flush        with       the     surface.             The      bottom        index    may      be    a
bottom surface of the device.                               The bottom index may be one or
more      features            that     project         from        the      bottom        surface      of     the
device.
[061]              The     surgical         instrument guide may include first                                and
second       lateral           extensions.              The      first        lateral       extension         may
be    configured            to respond           to    an    anterior           contour       of the       bone.
The     anterior contour may be a contour on the anterior                                             side of
the     bone.         The      second      lateral          extension may be                 configured to
respond         to     a   posterior           contour         of      the     bone.        The   posterior
contour        may       be    a   contour         on   the      posterior            side    of  the      bone.

[0122]     In    some   embodiments,           the    broaching        member        may    have
a proximal   end that      is    fixed     to     the   rotator       and     a  distal      end
that  is free.
[0123]     In     some    embodiments,              the      broaching          member       may
include an edge of an open cell in a mesh.
[0124]     The broaching member may include a segment that has
any suitable form.        For example,             the segment may be straight,
circular,     rhombic,        square,         triangular,            oval,        ellipsoid,
spiral,    loop-shaped,           hoop-shaped,             teardrop-shaped,                 egg
beater-shaped,      football-shaped,             or   any     other     suitable         shape.
The   segment     may    be     a    closed         loop.           The     loop        may   be
asymmetric.
[0125]     The     segment     may    have      one    or     more    of     a   variety      of
transverse     cross     sections,          such       as      square,         rectangular,
octagonal,    contours        with     sharp        edges,       stranded         cable,      or
other     suitable         configurations                 to        facilitate              bone
displacement.
[0126]     The     segment     may    have      a   leading       edge.         The     leading
edge  may be    beveled     at    a  suitable         angle,       including         an   angle
from about 5' to      about 75'.          The     angle may cause              leading edge
2202 to be generally sharp or knife-like.
[0127]     The      segment     may     be     rigid.           The    segment          may   be
resilient.
[0128]     The broaching member may have one or more ends                                   that
are  attached to apparatus           such as a drive              shaft or a suitable
support, such as a hub.             The broaching member may have a free
end.    Broaching     members       with     free     distal        ends     may     have    any

                                               -    20
suitable     shape      at     the      tine        distal        ends,       such      as    pointed,
forked, rounded, blunt or truncated.
 [0129]       The    broaching            member            may     have       an     end     that       is
attached     to   apparatus          by     crimping,            welding,         set-screw,         snap
fit   or  any    other       suitable          fastening.               The     broaching         member
may   have   one    or    more       ends       that       are     of   unitary        construction
with the apparatus.
 [0130]          The     broaching           member           may    include        a    tine.         The
tine   may   be   resilient           or     stiff.            The    tine      may     have     an    end
that   is  attached        to a     drive        shaft.          The    tine     may have         a  free
end.
 [0131]       The broaching member may include a blade.
 [0132]       The       broaching               member            may        include          numerous
interconnected          cells.             The       cells        may      be     arranged          in    a
network.         The      cells         may       be       linked        such that          when       the
structure      is    stressed            (e.g.,          compressed)            at    a    point       the
stress    is    distributed            to    nearby           cells.          The    cells      may     be
constructed from laser-cut tube                          stock that          is expanded into a
suitable shape.
 [0133]       The    broaching           member           may     be    one      of    a   number        of
broaching      members        in     a    broaching             head.         For     example,         the
broaching head         may     have       one      broaching          member,        2-6    broaching
members,      7-20      broaching           members,             more      than       20    broaching
members,      100   broaching            members            or    any      suitable        number        of
broaching members.
[0134]When     a   large        number           (i.e.,         when      the     circumferential
density of broaching members is                          relatively high) of broaching
members    are   present        during        the       rotation        of    a   broaching         head,

                                            -  21
a    relatively           lower   torque       may      be     required        to     drive    the
broaching head.
[0135]             Broaching    member     may      rotate       in   a   bone      cavity    that
has     an     irregular       shape,     for     example,          nonround,        oblong,    or
angular.             The    cavity    may     be     smaller         than    a    diameter      of
broaching member.
[0136]             Broaching       member         may        include          any        suitable
structural           form   such   as   wire,      ribbon,        cable,     stranded        wire,
braided           wire,      braided      ribbon,          or       any     other        suitable
structural form.
[0137]             Broaching member may include any suitable material,
such       as   polymer,      metal,    composite,          stainless        steel,       Nitinol
 (shapeset, superelastic or                other Nitinol),              other alloy or any
other suitable material.
[0138]             The   broaching      member       may     be     supported        by    one  or
more reinforcements.
[0139]             The   reinforcement        may      be    sized      and    positioned       to
support          a    segment    of    the    broaching           member       in     a   desired
contour.               The    reinforcement           may      provide        bone-broaching
abrasiveness, momentum or both.
[0140]             The reinforcement may be a tube.
[0141]             The   reinforcement may be a brace.                     The brace may be
fixed        to    the    broaching      member,         for     example,       by      crimping,
welding or press-fit.                 The   brace may          include broaching edges
for     displacing         bone  material.           The    broaching        edges       may  have
any     suitable        form,   such    as    serrated,          saw-tooth,         knife-edge,
rectilinear edge or any other suitable form.

                                             -   22
[0142]      The     reinforcement                may       be     formed       from       polymer,
metal, alloy or any other suitable material.
[0143]      The   reinforcement may be formed from a pattern that
is cut into a metal tube.
[0144]      In   some      embodiments,               the     apparatus        may      include      a
distal hub.      The     broaching member may have a distal end that
is fixed to the distal hub.                     The distal hub may be configured
to move between        a  first        position          and a     second     position.           The
first   and      second          positions              may      be      located          along      a
longitudinal axis of the rotator.
[0145]      The     distal           hub       may       be    constructed            of      metal,
stainless    steel,       laser-cut             tube,        polymer,        ceramic        or    any
other suitable material.
[0146]      The   distal        hub     may      include       flutes.        The     distal hub
may include broaching edges.
[0147]      The   methods         may      include         a   method      for   broaching         an
interior region of          a bone.            The interior region may include a
bottom  surface.         The      bottom         surface       may     be   an   surface        of   a
portion  of    the   bone       that      is     opposite         an    access     hole      in   the
bone.
[0148]      The   method         may     include          expanding       a   bone       broaching
member   in    the     interior           region.             The      method     may       include
disaggregating       relatively              low-density            material         inside       the
bone using the member.                 The method may include deflecting the
broaching    member      away        from      relatively          high-density           material
inside the bone.

[0149]       In     some     embodiments,          the       method         may      include
rotating    the    bone    broaching       member      using         a    flexible       drive
shaft.
[0150]       In     some     embodiments,          the       method         may      include
changing    the   elevation      of   the bone      broaching           member     relative
to the bottom surface.
[0151]       In some embodiments,           the disaggregating may include
cutting the relatively low-density material.
[0152]       In some embodiments,           the disaggregating may include
displacing the relatively low-density material.
[0153]       In     some     embodiments,          the       method         may      include
registering       an    exterior        instrument           guide         to    the       bone
broaching     member;     visually       mapping      the       exterior        instrument
guide    to     the    interior       region;       and       deploying          the       bone
broaching member to the           interior region based on the                     exterior
instrument      guide.        The    exterior       instrument             guide     may     be
exterior to the bone.
[0154]       Apparatus      and   methods     for    treating           a  bone    interior
are provided.
[0155]       The    apparatus      may   include      a    flexible         sheath.         The
flexible sheath may include stress-relief features that                                  allow
bending    under     tension      and    compression.               The     stress-relief
features    may    include     slots     or   slot      patterns.             The    stress
relief features may be provided using laser-cutting.
[0156]       The     stress-relief        features         may       include       sintered
particles.          The    particles        may     include            metal,     polymer,
composite or any other suitable material.

 [0157]           The      flexible         sheath         may    have     a     first        configuration
and      a    second        configuration.                    The    second          configuration            may
have         a    smaller             radius          of       curvature              than        the      first

The      rotatable            shaft      may       extend         through          the       sheath.           The
apparatus           may       include        an      elongated          steering             member.           The
elongated          steering           member        may      be    configured             to    deflect        the
flexible         sheath         from     the       first        configuration               to    the    second

[0164]       In     some      embodiments,             the     elongated       member        may
include    a  substantially          spiral         segment.       The   spiral      segment
may   include    a   proximal      end       and     a  distal     end.     The     proximal
end may    be   disposed       at  a    first        radius     from the     longitudinal
axis.    The distal end may be disposed at a second radius from
the   longitudinal axis.           The       second radius may be at                least      as
great   as the     first radius.             The     second radius may be greater
than the first radius.
[0165]       In   some      embodiments,           the   elongated      member     may be       a
first elongated member and the apparatus may include a second
elongated member.            The  second elongated member may be curved
about the     longitudinal axis.                The    second elongated member may
be configured to rotate about the longitudinal axis.
[0166]       In    some      embodiments,            the    second    elongated        member
may include a substantially spiral                      second segment.
[0167]       In    some      embodiments,            the     proximal     end     may    be     a
first   proximal       end and    the       distal      end may     be   a  first      distal
end.    The   spiral      second segment may include a second proximal
end and a     second distal end.                  The   second proximal end may be

                                                   -   26
disposed          at    a   third       radius       from the         longitudinal            axis.          The
second distal end may be disposed at a fourth radius from the
longitudinal              axis.          The    fourth        radius         may    be     at    least        as
great      as the         third radius.               The    fourth radius may be greater
than the third radius.
[0168]             In      some       embodiments,             the       third        radius         may      be
substantially              the      same     as   the     first        radius;         and    the      fourth
radius may be substantially the same as the second radius.
[0169]             In     some      embodiments,           the      apparatus           may    include          a
circumferential offset.                        The     circumferential offset may be in
a circumferential direction about the longitudinal axis.                                                     The
circumferential offset may be between the                                     second proximal end
and    the      first       proximal         end.       The     circumferential               offset        may
be between the second distal end and the first distal end.
[0170]             In     some      embodiments,           the      apparatus           may    include          a
support.              The     support        may     include        a    proximal         support          end.
The     proximal           support          end   may      be     fixed        to     a    shaft.            The
apparatus may include a                      support segment.                 The support segment
may be        fixed       to    at    least     one     of    the     first       and    second        spiral
segments.              The    support         segment       may     conform         to    a   contour         of
the spiral            segment.
[0171]             The     methods          may   include         a    method       for      preparing          a
bone     interior.             The method may include providing access                                    to a
bone        intramedullary                  space.              The        method         may        include
introducing               into       the      intramedullary                space        an      elongated
member.          The elongated member may have a substantially spiral
segment.             The     spiral        segment       may     have       a   longitudinal             axis.
The     method          may       include       rotating          the       substantially              spiral

bone matter.
[0172]             In    some      embodiments,            the      elongated           member       may be   a
first      elongated           member,        the      substantially               spiral       segment     may
be     a  first       substantially              spiral        segment,           and      the    method    may
include         introducing             into      the     intramedullary                  space      a   second
elongated           member.            The     second         elongated           member        may    have   a
substantially               spiral          second         segment.                 The       substantially
spiral        second        segment         may      share       the       longitudinal            axis    with
the      first        substantially               spiral         segment.               The      method     may
include          rotating           the      substantially                 spiral         second       segment
about the longitudinal axis.
[0173]             In     some     embodiments,              the      first       spiral        segment     may
have      a     first       periodic          rotation          cycle.             The       second      spiral
segment         may       have      a     second        periodic            rotation           cycle.       The
second         periodic          rotation           cycle        may        lag     behind         the    first
periodic rotation cycle by a phase lag.                                        The phase          lag may be
about Pi radians.

are provided.               The bone may have a longitudinal bone axis.
[0175]            The      apparatus          may      include         a    bone      coring       saw.     The
bone coring saw may include a tooth.                                      The     tooth may include a
first      cutting         member        and    a    second       cutting         member.           The   first
cutting         member      may be         configured           to     cut bone when              the   coring
saw rotates            in    a   first       direction.              The      second cutting member
may be configured to                     cut bone when               the     coring         saw rotates      in
a second direction.                     The second direction may be rotationally
opposite from the first direction.

 [0176]           The bone coring                 saw may include           a cylindrical            tube.
The     cylindrical tube may define                        a tube      longitudinal direction
and a tube          radial direction.                   The bone coring saw may include
a saw tooth.               The     saw tooth may extend longitudinally from an
end      of    the     cylindrical             tube.       The    saw     tooth        may    include     a
cutting surface that is oblique to the tube radial direction.
 [0177]           The     methods         may      include     a  method        for     sawing     a  hole
in the bone.                The method may include                    forming a          substantially
cylindrical           passage          into      the   intramedullary             space      of  a   bone.
The       substantially              cylindrical           passage        may       extend      along     a
direction         that       is    at an       acute     angle     to   the      longitudinal         bone
axis.           The     method          may      include       removing         from       the    bone    a
substantially              cylindrical            plug    that     is   substantially            coaxial
with the passage.
 [0178]           In       some        embodiments,            the      forming           may    include
tunneling through the bone using a K-wire.
 [0179]           In      some         embodiments,            the     removing           may    include
sawing a hole using a rotary coring saw.
 [0180]           In       some         embodiments,            the      method          may     include
rotating the rotary coring saw about a portion of the K-wire.
 [0181]           In       some         embodiments,            the      method          may     include
sustaining          a    coaxial         relationship          between       the     K-wire      and   the
rotary        coring        saw.        The      sustaining       may include             rotating     the
rotary        coring       saw     about        a bushing.           The   K-wire,         the   bushing
and the rotary coring saw may be substantially coaxial.
 [0182]           In       some         embodiments,            the      method          may     include
translating            the      K-wire       relative       to   the     rotary         coring     saw  to
remove from the coring saw the cylindrical plug.

 [0183]             The     method         may       include       a    method        for       providing
access          to an     intramedullary               space    of a    bone.         The     method may
include          supporting         a    cylindrical           body    of   a    rotary        saw      at    an
acute         angle     to   a   surface           of   the   bone;     and    engaging          teeth        of
the rotary saw with the surface.
 [0184]             Apparatus and methods for accessing the inside of a
bone are provided.
 [0185]             The     apparatus            may      include      a   rotatable            saw       that
includes a cannula.                     The      apparatus may include a bushing that
is disposed in the cannula.                             The apparatus may include a wire
that        is    disposed       substantially               coaxially       with       the     rotatable
saw in the bushing.
 [0186]             In    some    embodiments,              the  wire     may     include         a   distal
end     that       is    configured           to penetrate          the    bone.          The    wire may
include a proximal end that is                             configured to receive torque.
 [0187]             In    some    embodiments,              the  wire     may     be    configured            to
drill         a  pilot      hole    in      the     bone.       The pilot        hole      may have           an
axis       that      forms     an acute          angle      with   a   surface        of the bone             at
the     opening          of   the     pilot        hole.        The   saw    may      include         teeth.
The       teeth        may    be     arranged            adjacent       a   distal         end      of       the
cannula.                The     bushing            may     be    configured           to      align          the
rotatable            saw    coaxially          with      the   axis    when     the     teeth       contact
the bone.
 [0188]             In    some     embodiments,              the   apparatus          may      include          a
biased member proximal the bushing.                                 The biased member may be
configured             to   urge      a     distal        end   of   the    bushing          toward          the
bone when the teeth have penetrated into the bone.

[0189]          In some embodiments, the bushing may be fitted into
the    cannula      with     a  tolerance          that       provides          friction           between
the    bushing      and    the   rotatable          saw.          The    friction           may     resist
proximally-directed             force        from       a    bone       core       in     the      cannula
while the teeth are cutting into the bone.
[0190]          In   some     embodiments,           the      rotatable           saw      may     include
a  cylindrical         body    having       a   wall       thickness          that       is    traversed
by    a    vent.        The    vent     may       be      configured            to     exhaust          bone
matter.
[0191]          In   some     embodiments,           the      wire      may     include          a  distal
diameter       and   a   proximal       diameter.             The     proximal diameter may
be greater than the distal                    diameter.             The wire may include a
shoulder        where      the     distal         diameter           adjoins           the       proximal
diameter.          The    shoulder       may      be     configured            to     be     translated
proximally relative to the                   rotatable saw to eject a bone                              core
from the cannula.
[0192]          The    apparatus may include an                      assembly for              accessing
the inside of a bone.
[0193]          The    assembly       may      include         an    arrangement              of    teeth.
The    teeth     may    be   supported         at    the     end     of    a    rotatable            frame.
The      frame      may     define         one       or      more        passageways.                      The
passageways        may     extend     from      a   cannula          inside        the      frame       to   a

[0194]          In    some     embodiments,             the      assembly           may       include        a
bushing.         The    bushing      may      be    disposed          in    the       cannula.             The
assembly       may     include       a     wire.            The     wire       may        be     disposed
substantially            coaxially         with         the       rotatable             saw        in      the
bushing.

[0195]           In   some      embodiments,        the    wire      may     be    configured       to
drill     a   pilot     hole      in   the   bone.       The pilot          hole      may have      an
axis    that      forms     an acute      angle     with     a   surface         of the bone        at
the    opening       of   the pilot       hole.       The busing may be                  configured
to    align     the    rotatable        saw     coaxially        with      the    axis      when   the
teeth contact the bone.
[0196]           Apparatus and methods for preparing a bone interior
are     provided.               The     apparatus        may        have       a     longitudinal
apparatus axis.
[0197]           The     apparatus        may     include        one     or     more      broaching
members.         The broaching members may be blades.                              A   first blade
may    be    linked      to    a   second     blade     by     a   linkage.            The     linkage
may be       configured         to be    rotated      about       the     longitudinal           axis.
The    linkage        maybe      configured        to   be     radially          displaced        from
the longitudinal apparatus axis.
[0198]           In   some embodiments,             at   least       one     of   the     first    and
second blades may be rigid.
[0199]           In   some embodiments,             at   least       one     of   the     first    and
second blades may include stainless steel.
[0200]           In   some embodiments,             at   least       one     of   the     first    and
second blades may include Nitinol.
[0201]           In some embodiments, the linkage may include a pin.
[0202]           In    some      embodiments,         the     linkage         may      be    a   first
linkage.            The      apparatus        may     include          an     actuator.            The
actuator         may     be     linked      to    the     first         blade       by     a    second
linkage.         The actuator may be linked to the second blade by a
third     linkage.           The     actuator     may     include        a   main       body.      The

                                             -  32
main      body      may     include     members       that       are     configured     to      be
displaced        relative to        each other.           One     of   the members may be
fixed relative to the main body.
[0203]           In some embodiments, at               least one of          the second and
third linkages may include a pin.
[0204]           In    some      embodiments,       the     third       linkage    is   distal
the second linkage.
[0205]           In some embodiments,             the actuator may be configured
to radially displace the                 first linkage by changing a distance
between the second linkage and the third linkage.
[0206]           In    some      embodiments,        the      actuator       may   include       a
first        elongated          actuator       member.            The      first    elongated
actuator        member       may   be   linked     to     the     second      linkage.         The
actuator may include a second elongated actuator member.                                       The
second       elongated        actuator     member     may      be    linked     to  the   third
linkage.             The      second     elongated         actuator         member     may      be
configured to radially displace the                        first      linkage by changing
a  longitudinal           offset    between      the    first      and     second   elongated
members.
[0207]           In      some      embodiments,            the       apparatus        may       be
configured          to    traverse      a   path    in     the     bone     interior.          The
apparatus         may    include      a   fourth     linkage        that     constrains        the
longitudinal          offset      based    on position          of    the   apparatus     along
the path.
[0208]           In    some      embodiments,      the      fourth       linkage    may    be    a
manual linkage.

                                             - 33
[0209]            In    some     embodiments,        the       longitudinal            offset    may
include a range of values.                    The range of values may include a
first       value.           The   first    value      may       correspond          to    a   first
linkage       first       radial     displacement.             The     range    of values        may
include a second value.                   The second value may correspond to a
first      linkage        second     radial    displacement.               The    second radial
displacement              may      be     greater         than         the      first         radial
displacement.
[0210]            In some embodiments,             the range may              include       a third
value.         The      third     value    may    correspond            to   a   first      linkage
third      radial        displacement.           The    first        linkage       third      radial
displacement may be less than the second radial displacement.
[0211]            In    some     embodiments,        the      apparatus         may      include    a
cutting surface.                The cutting surface may be disposed on one
of    the     first        and    second    blades.           At      the    first      and    third
radial       displacements,            the  cutting       surface         may be        disengaged
from the bone.
[0212]            In       some      embodiments,           at        the      second         radial
displacement,             the    cutting     surface        may      be    engaged        with    the
bone.
[0213]            In    some     embodiments,        the       first      blade      may     have   a
first bound portion.                   The first bound portion may be between
the    first       and      second    linkages.        The      first      blade       may have     a
first free portion.                 The first free portion may extend beyond
the     first        linkage        in   a   direction           away       from       the    second
linkage.
[0214]            In    some     embodiments,       the       second       blade      may    have   a
second       bound        portion.         The     second        bound       portion        may    be
between       the     first      and third      linkages.             The   second blade may

                                                  -  34
have       a   second       free       portion.           The       second        free    portion         may
extend beyond             the    first       linkage       in    a    direction         away    from the
third linkage.
[0215]            In some embodiments, the                      first bound portion may be
longer than the second bound portion.
[0216]            In     some    embodiments,             the      second        bound     portion        may
be longer than the first bound portion.
[0217]            In    some    embodiments,             the     first       free     portion      may be
longer than the second free portion.
[0218]            In some embodiments, the                      second free portion may be
longer than the first free portion.
[0219]            In     some     embodiments,             the      apparatus          may    include        a
cutting        surface.           The     cutting       surface          may be       disposed       on    at
least one of the              first and second blades.                          The    fourth linkage
may       be    programmed             to     position          the       cutting         surfaces         at
different         radial       displacements             along        the     path.       Each     of     the
radial         displacements               may       correspond              to     a     longitudinal
position on the path.
[0220]            In some embodiments,                  the fourth             linkage may control
the     longitudinal           offset        based      on    an     electronic          signal.          The
electronic            signal         may       be     based         on       a     set     of     digital
instructions.                The     digital        instructions              may     be   based       on    a
digitized image of the bone interior.
[0221]            In     some     embodiments,             the      apparatus          may    include        a
third blade.              The    apparatus          may     include        a    fourth blade.             The
third        blade     may    be      linked       to    the     fourth         blade     by   a    fourth
linkage.           The     fourth       linkage may be              configured          to be     rotated

                                          - 35
about     the    longitudinal         axis.       The     fourth      linkage       may    be
configured       to    be   radially       displaced       from      the    longitudinal
axis.      The     actuator      may be      configured        to   radially       displace
the    fourth      linkage       by     changing      the       longitudinal         offset
between the first and second elongate members.
[0222]        The methods may include a method for preparing the
bone   interior.          The    method     may    include       rotating       a   cutting
surface     inside      a bone     about     a  rotational        axis.        The   method
may   include      moving      a   control      member       from    a   first      control
position to a second control position.
[0223]        The    cutting      surface      may be     configured        to    occupy a
first    radial     position      that     corresponds        to   the   first      control
position.       The cutting surface may be configured                        to occupy a
second radial position that corresponds to the second control
position.       The cutting surface may be configured                        to occupy a
third    radial      position        that   corresponds          to   an    intermediate
control     position.        The     intermediate       control       position       may be
between     the   first     and     second     control     positions.           The   third
radial position may be              at a greater       radial distance            from the
rotational       axis    than     are    both    the   first       and   second      radial
positions.
[0224]        In    some    embodiments,         the   first      and    second      radial
positions may be at substantially the same distance                               from the
rotational axis.
[0225]        In some embodiments, when the cutting surface is at
one   or   both     of   the   first      and   second       radial    positions,         the
cutting     surface      may   be    disengaged      from the        bone.        When    the
cutting     surface is       at the third radial position,                   the cutting
surface may be engaged with the bone.

[0226]       Apparatus        and     methods         for     positioning      a    bone
fragment are provided.
[0227]       The      apparatus     may     include       a  probe    support.        The
probe support may have a proximal end and a distal end.                               The
apparatus     may include       a handle.           The    handle   may be    attached
to the proximal end.            The apparatus may include a probe.                    The
probe may be        attached     to the distal           end.     The probe    support
may    be configured        to   traverse         an   angled    access   hole     in   a
metaphyseal        bone     surface.             The     probe     support     may     be
configured       to    provide    mechanical          communication     between       the
handle    and     the    probe     when     the     handle     is   outside     a   bone
interior and the probe is inside the bone interior.
[0228]        In    some embodiments,            the probe      may have   a   conical
tip.
[0229]        In    some embodiments,            the probe      may have   a   rounded
tip.
[0230]        In   some embodiments,            the probe      support   may include
a   proximal      segment      and    a    distal       segment.       The   proximal
segment may extend          from the handle.               The  distal segment may
support the probe.
[0231]        In     some    embodiments,            the    proximal     and     distal
segments may define an obtuse angle.
[0232]        In   some embodiments,            the proximal       segment may have
a  first   flexibility.           The   distal       segment     may  have   a   second
flexibility.          The second     flexibility         may be greater      than the
first flexibility.

                                               -   37
[0233]          In    some      embodiments,            the   apparatus      may      include     an
intermediate           segment.             The        intermediate        segment         may    be
between       the   proximal        and     distal        segments.        The     intermediate
segment may include a curve.
[0234]          In    some     embodiments,            the   proximal     segment       may     have
a   first      flexibility.             The      intermediate         segment       may     have    a
second       flexibility.             The     distal        segment     may     have      a    third
flexibility.            The     second     flexibility          may be    greater        than    the
third flexibility.
[0235]          The     methods       may      include        a   method    for      treating       a
bone.       The bone may have a longitudinal bone axis.
[0236]          The     method      may       include        providing      a     hole      in   the
bone.       The    hole    may     be   at     an    angle     to  the   longitudinal           bone
axis.       The hole may provide access to                       a bone interior region.
The method may include advancing a probe                             through the hole and
into      the  interior         region.        The      method may include displacing
cancellous bone using the probe.
[0237]          In     some      embodiments,            the    displacing         may     include
identifying         a   spatial       distribution            of   low-density         matter     in
the interior region.
[0238]          In      some       embodiments,             the     method        may      include
displaying an image               of the interior region and the probe when
the probe       is inside the interior region.
[0239]          The methods may include another method for treating
the     bone.       The    method      may       include       providing      a    hole     in   the
bone.       The    hole    may     be   at     an    angle     to  the   longitudinal           bone
axis.       The hole may provide access to                       a bone interior region.
The method may include advancing a probe                             through the hole and

                                             - 38
into      the   interior        region.       The   method    may   include    displacing
bone matter using the probe.
 [0240]         In      some      embodiments,       the    displacing     may      include
identifying         a    spatial     distribution       of   cancellous     bone     in   the
interior region.
 [0241]         In some embodiments, the method may include displaying
an image of the interior region and the probe when the probe is
inside the interior region.
 [0242]         In      some      embodiments,       the    displacing     may      include
positioning a first               cortical bone fragment         relative to a second
cortical bone fragment.
 [0243]         In some embodiments, the method may include displaying
an image of the interior region and the probe when the probe is
inside the interior region.

device       may be        implanted.             Broach        head      124       may     be    driven          and
supported by broach control 126 and broach sheath 127.
[0252]             Guide     100     may include base                  102.          Alignment members
104     and     106     (shown      in      FIG.     10)     may      extend          from base            102     to
align      guide      centerline            CLG   of guide           100     with bone              centerline
CLBS     of the      top     surface         of bone B.              One     or both of               alignment
members         104      and     106      may      be      resilient.                  One      or      both       of
alignment members 104                   and 106 may be stiff.
[0253]             Alignment         members          104      and      106       may       be      relatively
free      to      slide      along        surfaces          of     bone        B.         Guide          100      may
include         contacts         108      and     110      (shown         in      FIG.       10)       that       may
engage        bone     B    along      centerline            CLBS-         Contacts             108      and      110
may extend          from a       bottom surface                 (shown      in      FIG.      10)       of guide

100.        Contacts         108    and      110      may    prevent        guide      centerline            CLG
from rotating out of alignment with bone centerline CLBS
[0254]             Contacts        108     and     110     may     assure       alignment          of     guide
100 with the             surface of bone B,                 because two points                  of contact
may be         stable      on   an     uneven         surface        even    in    circumstances               in
which 3, 4 or more contacts are not                                stable.
[0255]             Guide      100     may      include         lateral       cleats         112      and     114
 (shown       in     FIG.    10).        Lateral         cleats         112   and     114      may       engage
the      surface        of  bone      B   to    prevent          guide      100    from rotating               in
direction           0 about       guide       centerline            CLG.       Lateral         cleats        112
and 114 may be resilient to allow some sliding over bone B.
[0256]             When    a   practitioner             positions          guide      100      on     bone     B,
alignment           members      104     and     106     may be        the   first       components            of
guide       100      to   engage       bone      B.      Alignment           members        104       and    106
may       bring       guide      centerline             CLG       into     alignment            with       bone
centerline            CLBS    before        contacts           108     and    110     and      cleats        112
and 114         engage bone B.               Then,      in some embodiments, cleats 112
and 114 may engage bone B                       to inhibit rotation                   in direction 0.
Then,       in     some    embodiments,               contacts         108    and     110      may       engage
bone B        along      bone     centerline           CLBS-         Contacts        108     and 110         may
have       sharp        points        to     provide           further        resistance               to    de
alignment           of   guide      centerline           CLG      from bone         centerline            CLBS
In      some     embodiments,           there       may be        no    more     than      two      contacts
 (e.g.,       108     and   110)      to    ensure        that       the   contacts          are      in   line
with bone centerline CLBS-

practitioner              may        manually             grip        grip      118.           In         some
embodiments,            a   torque-limiter                 (not    shown)      may be      provided         to
limit the torque that                    the practitioner can apply via grip 118
to contacts 108              and 110.
[0258]            Guide       tube     120      may      receive        and    guide     any     suitable
instrument.              Guide      tube       120     may      be   oriented      at    angle       a   with
respect        to   handle        116.         In     some      embodiments,         angle     a     may be
fixed.         In    some      embodiments,              angle      a   may    be   adjustable.             In
some embodiments, templates                          130     and 132 may be fixed relative
to    guide        tube       120.          In     some        embodiments,          including            some
embodiments           in    which      a    is    adjustable            and   some    in    which        a  is
not    adjustable,             guide       tube       120     may     be   oriented       so    that       the
axis    LGT of guide             tube      120     intersects          bone B      at substantially
the    same      point       as   does       axis       LH    of   stem      116.     Grip      118      will
thus be positioned directly over the center of hole site H'.

p,    in     the   crotch       between         wire      1102      and     bone    B.      Teeth     1108
may      therefore       be     subjected            to    a    contact       force      from     bone     B
that      is   oblique      to a plane            defined by teeth                1108.        Centering
sleeve        1104   may support             teeth       1108     against       the    oblique       force
and      maintain      teeth        1108       at     a   substantially            constant        radius
from axis Ls during the formation of an access hole.
 [0295]           A spring        1116       (shown in FIG.              13)   may urge centering
sleeve 1104 distally to keep                          centering sleeve 1104                  at   or near
bone B as teeth 1108 penetrate into bone B.

[0296]              FIG.       12    shows      that     centering          sleeve     1104       may  be
coaxially arranged within cutting member 1106.                                        Wire      1102 may
be     coaxially          arranged         within       centering         sleeve     1104.         Collar
1202       of centering sleeve 1104 may be provided at a distal end
of centering sleeve 1104                       to provide a close tolerance between
wire 1102 and centering sleeve 1104.
[0297]              FIG.        13      shows      spring        1116        compressed          between
proximal           face      1302      of   centering        sleeve       1104     and   distal      face
1304 of torque adapter 1114.
[0298]              In some embodiments, wire 1102 may be used to drill
a    pilot       hole       in    bone     B   without       apparatus          such   as     centering
sleeve 1104             and cutting member                1106.         In such embodiments,             a
bushing          (not     shown)        may be      provided        in    a   guide    tube      such  as
guide        tube      120      (shown      in   FIG.     1) .     Wire       1102   may     be    placed
through         the      bushing         and    driven      by   a     torque     adapter        such  as
1114.         The bushing may have a bore                       that is        sized to stabilize
a K-wire driven in rotation by a surgical drill.
[0299]              It may be desirable thereafter to cut                             in the bone a
hole       that      is     substantially            coaxial       with      the    K-wire.         After
the K-wire            is drilled into the bone, in such embodiments,                                  the
bushing          (not      shown)         may   be    removed        from      the   guide       tube  to
allow a coring saw to advance through the guide tube.
[0300]              FIG.        14     shows      illustrative              apparatus        1400     for
cutting         in    bone       B   a   hole    that     is   substantially           coaxial       with
wire       1402.         FIG.      14     shows     a   relevant        portion      of    coring     saw
guide        1450.        Coring        saw    guide     1450    may     include      contacts       1452
for      engaging         a    surface       of   bone     B   (shown       in   FIG.    2) .      Coring
saw      guide       1450      may     include       handle-mounting             recesses        such  as
1454.            A      centering          sleeve        (not      shown)        may    be      disposed

                                           - 53
coaxially between wire 1402 and cutting member 1406.                                  In some
embodiments,         a cutting member such as               1406 may be engaged by
a    collar     (not       shown)     that    is    configured       for     delivery        of
torque.
[0301]         A proximal          end   of   wire     1402   may    be   engaged        in     a
hand drill       fitting        and rotatingly driven          into the bone as              it
is advanced distally through saw guide 1450.
[0302]         FIG.      15    shows   wire    1402.      Distal end       1502     of wire
1402     may have       a   first    diameter.         Proximal     end    1504     of wire
1402     may   have      a    second    diameter       that   is    greater       than      the
first diameter.             Step 1506 between the first diameter and the
second diameter            may be used as        a stop to limit the extent to
which wire 1402 may be driven into bone B.
[0303]         Proximal end 1504 of a wire such as 1402 may extend
along     and through         a cannula     in   an A-O type adapter while                  the
adapter      drives      a cutting member          such as    1408    distally         into a
bone.
[0304]         In      some      embodiments,       step    1506     may     be    used      to
distally      eject       a bone     plug   from     the   interior      of    distal       end
1405     of  cutting member           1406   after     a hole    is   cut and         cutting
member 1406 is withdrawn from the bone.
[0305]         In     some     embodiments,       a   soft-tissue       protector         (not
shown)      may    be     provided      to   keep     soft   tissue      proximate          the
access hole from becoming engaged by rotating apparatus.                                    The
protector       may      include      a   cannula      for   guiding       the     rotating
apparatus      into the hole.             The protector may include a flange
that     "funnels"       the apparatus        into the cannula and blocks                   the
soft tissue from approaching the apparatus.

 [0306]        FIG.       16      shows        a    portion            of     illustrative               cutting
member     1106       from      region         16    of      FIG.        11.        A    circumferential
tooth     1602      may     extend         into       one        or     more        of    vents         1110   to
engage bone on the inside of the cutter.
 [0307]        Tooth         1602       may      provide            friction            between          cutting
member     1106      and    the     bone       plug      and       may      facilitate            removal      of
the   bone     plug       upon       with       withdrawal              of     cutting         member        1106
from the      access         hole.          The     distal          end      of    the     bone       plug    may
not   be   severed         from      bone       B    native          tissue         by    cutting         member
1106.      Tooth        1602      may     provide          one      or     both        of   torsional         and
axial    force       to    sever       the      plug       from bone            B.        Vents       1110    may
include     vent       edges       1604.         Vent       edges        1604      may     cut     a    wall   of
the access hole.
 [0308]        Tooth         1602       may      provide            friction            between          cutting
member     1106       and      centering            sleeve          1104.            The     friction         may
resist proximal motion of centering sleeve 1104.
 [0309]        FIG       17     shows        illustrative                  teeth        1108       of     cutter
member 1106          (shown in          FIG.      11).          Illustrative tooth                    1702    may
include     cutting          edge       1704,       face        1706        and     back       1708.         Face
1706 and back 1708                may partially define adjacent gullets                                      1710
and   1712,     which       intervene           between           tooth       1702       and    neighboring
teeth     1714      and      1716,         respectively.                     Tooth        1702       may    have
thickness      t.        Tooth       1702       may    be       circumferentially                   set    apart
from neighboring              tooth       1716      by      pitch         Pt.       Cutting         edge     1704
may   be   angled        relative           to    saw       radial         direction           Rs     by   bevel
angle    #   (shown       on     a   different           tooth).             Cutting edge               1704   is
shown with        #   = 0',      but any suitable                   #   may be used.                Face     1706
may have longitudinal rake angle p.

[0310]         Larger      rake     angles         (e.g.,      positive)       may     produce
lower      forces,        but     smaller          included        tooth      angles,         and
therefore       lower     heat    capacity.             Smaller     rake     angles        (e.g.,
negative)        may     increase        heat       capacity        and    increase          heat
generated in shearing but increase cutting forces.
[0311]         Face     1706   is   shown      with      p =   0',   but  any     suitable        p
may be used.          Gullet 1710 may have gullet depth Dg.
[0312]         In    some   embodiments,            tooth     1702    may    include        facet
1718    (shown      in   broken      line) .         When    facet     1718    is     present,
tooth    face     1706 may be         shortened         by distance       h.      Facet 1718
may   have      a    normal       (not     shown)         that   is    oriented         at    any
suitable angle relative to axis Ls and radius Rs.
[0313]         FIG.     18   shows      teeth        1108     (shown in       FIG.       11)   as
viewed    along       lines    18-18      (shown       in   FIG.    17) .     Cutting        edge
1704   forms      angle    0 with saw outer wall                   1802.      Cutting        edge
1704  is     shown with 0             90,     but     any suitable        0 may be used.
For  example,         a  tooth     formed      by     cutting      along    chord      Chi may
create     a   cutting      edge     having       0 >      90'.      A  tooth      formed      by
cutting      along      chord     Ch 2   may      create      a   cutting      edge       having
0 < 900.
[0314]         In    some embodiments,             a cutting member may have bi
directionally cutting teeth.                     Each tooth such tooth may have
a right and a left cutting edge.                        When the coring saw rotates
clockwise,       a    right   edge     cuts.          When    the    coring     saw     rotates
counterclockwise, a left edge cuts.
[0315]         FIG.     19   shows     illustrative           instrument       guide        1900.
Illustrative          instrument        guide        1900    may     have     one     or     more

                                           - 56
features      in   common     with      one   or more         of    guide     100    (shown    in
FIG.   1)    and guide      900    (shown      in    FIG.     9).      Guide     1900 may be
used to guide an instrument                 into bone B at a site                  such as H'
or I' (shown in FIG. 2).
[0316]         Guide 1900 may include base 1902.                          Base 1902 may be
placed     against     bone    B    (shown       in    FIG.     2)    at   site     H' .     Base
1902 may include contacts                 (not shown),         alignment members             (not
shown),      cleats     (not    shown)       or     any    other      suitable       features.
Grip   1918     may extend       from base          1902.       Base 1902        may include
pivot     1904.       Pivot     1904      may     pivotably          support      guide      tube
1920.      Guide    tube    1920    centerline          CLGT'      may be positioned at
any   suitable      angle a'       relative         to   axis LH'        so that      saw    1950
may be     advanced through bone B                 (not shown)         at angle a' .          The
intersection        of axis LH' and CLGT'               may substantially              coincide
with    site     H'   or   site      I'    for      different         values      of    a'.      A
practitioner may change angle a' before or during penetration
of   saw    1950    into   bone      B.      For     example,        a   practitioner         may
initiate a pilot hole at a' ~ 0                      and then change a' to obtain
the desired angle for the access hole.
[0317]         Saw    1950     may       include        teeth       1952,      flutes       1954,
cannula      1956    or   any    other      suitable         features,        including       the
features      described      and    shown herein           in    connection        with other
saws.

700   taken along        lines 20-20          (shown      in   FIG.     7) .     Pin    703 may
be located near the            distal end of bracket 720.                        Pin    703 may
fix the position          of   the distal           end of broaching member                  704.
Pin   703    may support       cylindrical            form 705.           Cylindrical        form
705   may be      coaxially      mounted        on     pin    703.       Cylindrical         form

                                              -   57
705  may    support       a   spiral         segment        of   broaching          member          704.
One  or  more     distal       portions           of    broaching      member         704      may    be
welded or otherwise           suitably fixed to cylindrical form 705.
[0319]       Cylindrical           form         705     may    constrain          or      partially
constrain     the      orientation            of     distal      portions         of      broaching
member   704.       Cylindrical            form       705   may    be   fixed        relative         to
bracket   720.       Cylindrical            form      705   may be     rotatable            relative
to bracket 720.
[0320]       Broach head 702 may include end cap                             701.         Broaching
member   704    may     remove      tissue         that    is    generally         proximal          end
cap  701.     In   some     embodiments,              member     704   may expand             in    such
a  manner    as    to     extend        distally         of    end    cap     701.           In     such
embodiments,      the     broaching           member       may    remove      tissue          that    is
distal of end cap 701.
[0321]       Reducing         or     minimizing            the     distance         between          the
distal   end of broaching member 704                        and end cap          701     may allow
broaching       member        704        to       remove       tissue        that          is       more
immediately      proximal          end       cap       701.        End    cap       701       may     be
positioned at the distal end of bracket 720.                                 End cap          701 may
be  configured       to have       a    smooth,         atraumatic       surface.             Bracket
720 may be attached to drive shaft                        730.
[0322]       Shaft       assembly          714      may    include       drive         shaft        730.
Drive   shaft    730     may support bracket 720                    at union         732.         Drive
shaft   730   may     be    secured        to     bracket      720    by   pin      734.          Drive
shaft 730 may provide rotation to broach head 702.
[0323]       Proximal        ends      736       and    738   of    broaching          member        704
may be fixed to slide             740, which may be a tube.                        Proximal end
738 may be threaded through or                       keyed into windows               742     and 744
in  slide    740.        Proximal        end      736    may    be   threaded          through        or

                                          - 58
keyed   into     slots    746    and    748     in    slide        740.        Slide      740   may
slide    relative      to   drive      shaft        730     to     expand        and     contract
broaching member 704.              Slide       740    is     shown      in    the    "contract"
state,     in    which    broaching          member         704     is      drawn      close     to
bracket 720.        Slide cover 750 may slide with slide 740.                                   One
or  both    of   slide    740    and    slide       cover        750   may      be   translated
along   axis     Lc  by   control       hub     710      (shown       in     FIG.    7)     or  any
other suitable position controller.
[0324]        Slide    cover     750    may     remain          stationary         relative      to
drive shaft 730 when slide 740                  slides relative to drive shaft
730.       In    embodiments         in     which        slide       cover        750      remains
stationary       when   slide      740     moves,        distal        end      752     of    slide
cover   750    may   limit    the     radial       position         of broaching            member
704 at a fixed distance along drive shaft 730 and thus affect
the   deformation        of   broaching           member          704     in     the     expanded
state.
[0325]        Broaching      member        704     may      undergo         one    or    both    of
elastic and plastic deformation.
[0326]        FIG.   21   shows     a view of a distal                  portion        of broach
700 taken     along lines        20-20       (shown      in     FIG.     7)   when broaching
member 704      is  in   an expanded state.                  Broaching member 704                is
shown as mainly circular.                 However, any desired shape may be
able   to   be    imparted     in    the     expanded           state      such     as    but   not
limited     to:    square,     triangular,            oval,        ellipsoid,          teardrop,
football, or any other suitable shape.
[0327]        Different       shapes        may      be     obtained           using       several
methods,     such as utilizing            a pre-set          shape      in    a shape memory
alloy,    modifying       the     geometry         of     the      member       cross-section
(along    the    member    length)       such      that      it    preferentially             bends

                                         - 59
in a desired manner, constraining broaching member 704                                    (e.g.,
in force, shear or moment) in a way that forces the expansion
to take desired shape,           having the final              shape be that of the
expanded     geometry      and   the     reduced       or    collapsed          geometry       be
that   of     a  higher      strain       configuration,            and/or        any      other
suitable method of forming a desired shape.
[0328]        For   example,       largely        or    substantially             preventing
radial   movement       of   broaching        member        proximal         ends      736    and
738,   and    allowing     movement        of   the     distal       end      of    broaching
member      704    generally         about      pin       703     while         elastically
deforming broaching member proximal                     ends 736 and            738,     due to
reducing     the   distance      between        the     distal       end      and     proximal
ends   736    and   738    of   broaching         member       704,      may     modify       the
geometry     of   broaching      member       704    from      a  generally           straight
configuration to a generally eggbeater shape.
[0329]        The     deformation          may       relatively             increase          the
distance     between     (a)    sections        760    and      762    and      (b)    bracket
720.    As   this distance        is   increased,          the swept-out            volume     of
broaching       member      704,      as    broaching          member         704       rotates
generally      about   an    axis     such     as    LC     (shown      in     FIG.      8),   is
increased.
[0330]        In    some     embodiments,           a    broach         may       include        a
broaching      member   that    includes        one    or more        stiff      tines       (not
shown)   that is     joined to a drive             shaft.        The drive shaft may
have   a   longitudinal       axis.        The     tine      may    be      joined       to   the
drive   shaft    radially      close     to the       axis at       a proximal           end of
the  tine.       The   tine     may    have     a   distal       end     that      is     spaced
radially apart from the axis.                 The distal end of the tine may
be distal of the distal end of the drive shaft.                               There may be
numerous     tines   on   the drive        shaft.        Such     embodiments            may be

                                                     -    60

 (shown in FIG. 2) using high torque at low rotational speeds.
 [0331]             FIG.     22    shows broaching member 704                          in partial cross
section        from view           lines       22-22        (shown     in      FIG.     21).       Broaching
member       704      may     have       leading        edges      2202       and     2204    that       may be
rotated          in    direction           oc     by    drive      shaft         730     (shown       in    FIG.
21).        Broaching            member        704     may     sweep      out      a   space      in    bone     B
 (shown       in     FIG.      2)    based        on    radius       Rc,      which      corresponds          to
sections 760             and 762         (shown in FIG. 21).
 [0332]             Leading         edge       2202       may     be     beveled         at     angle       ac1
Angle      ac1      may be        any     suitable         angle,       including          an   angle       from
about      50     to about         750.       Angle       ac1    may cause leading                 edge 2202
to    be    generally             sharp       or    knife-like.               This      may    aid      in   the
broaching member's ability to remove tissue.
 [0333]             Leading         edge       2204       may     be     beveled         at     angle       ac2
Angle ac2           may be        any     suitable         angle,       including          an   angle       from
about      50     to about         750.       Angle       ac2 may cause leading                    edge 2204
to    be    generally             sharp       or    knife-like.               This      may    aid      in   the
broaching member's ability to remove tissue.
 [0334]             As     broaching             member          704      is       rotated         clockwise
generally            about        axis       Lc    leading         edges         2202      and      2204     may

come     in       contact         with     tissues         such      as     relatively          less       dense
cancellous           bone BCA           (shown      in     FIG.    2).         Sections       760      and 762
may     be     configured            to    be     sufficiently             flexible         such      that    if

sections          760      and     762      may        deflect            generally            radially            in

towards        axis     Lc   at any        location           along        the     length        of    sections
760     and     762     or    any     other        portion          of      broaching           member          704.
Deflection          or    deformation             of     sections            760     and      762     may      have
the affect of not disturbing the more dense tissues.
[0335]            Leading edges 2202                  and 2204 may be offset from axis
Lc by offsets Ai              and A 2       respectively.                   Appropriate magnitudes
of    offsets        Ai   and   A2     may be          selected.              In     some      embodiments,
offsets         A1     and     A2     may       be        constrained              by       the      collapsed

members        can broach         bone      of     a    relatively            lower        density         and be
deflected         by    bone    of     a    relatively             higher         density.             Sections
760     and 762       have displaced or removed some of cancellous bone
BcA    from     bone     B    by    rotating            in     direction            o,     about       axis       L,.
Sections         760     and     762      may      be       sufficiently               stiff        to     remove
cancellous          bone to radius R,                from axis Lc              in    the "top" portion
of    bone     B.      Because        of    the      placement             of   axis       L,    relative          to
the     bottom       portion       of     bone       B,     sections           760      and      762      contact
cortical bone            BCO at       the bottom of bone B.                            Sections          760      and

762    may be       sufficiently             flexible            to be       deflected            by    cortical
bone BCO.          Section        760     is     shown deflected in direction -o, by
bone    BCO.          Sections         760       and        762      thus      remove         bone       only     to
radius R,'        in    the "bottom" portion of bone B.
 [0337]          The       cavity       created              by      broach         700       may       thus      be
bounded        in     part       by     cancellous                bone       BCA       and       in     part      by
cortical       bone       BCO.       The       shape        of     the     cavity portion                 that    is
bounded      by     cancellous          bone BCA may                  be    governed          substantially
by the geometry and mechanical properties                                         of broach 700.                 The
shape    of     the     cavity portion                that       is    bounded          by    cortical          bone
BCO    may    be     governed         substantially                  by     the     native         anatomy        of
bone B.
 [0338]          FIG.      23    shows       a   view        of broach           700     along        lines      23
23    (shown in FIG 20).                 Broach 700                is   in the         contracted state.
Slide cover 750 has been removed.                                   Slots       746,      748 and 2302 in
slide     740      may      be    configured                to     coincide           with       features         on
proximal       end      736     (shown       in    FIG.        21)     of broaching               member        704.
When    proximal           end     736      is     engaged            with       slots        746,       748     and
2302,     slots         746,      748       and        2302         may      restrict           movement          of
proximal end 736               in either direction generally along axis Lc.
Slots    746,       748     and    2302        may      have       any     suitable           geometry          that
allows     for      the      engagement           and        axial       translation              of    proximal
end 736.
 [0339]          Slots       746,    748       and       2302      may be         of    sufficient             depth
that,    when      proximal         end      736      is     engaged         in    slots        746,      748    and
2302,    slide        cover      750     (shown          in    FIG.      20)      has     adequate          radial
clearance        with       respect        to proximal                end     736      and     slide        740   to
slide    over       slide       740    and      slots         746,      748     and      2302.          An     inner
surface      of     slide       cover       750      may       prevent         movement           of    proximal

                                              -   63
end 736      from moving          in    a direction          generally        away     from axis
Lc.
[0340]         Slide        740     may      include         slots     (not       shown)       that
correspond       to    proximal         end     738     (shown    in   FIG.     20)     and    have
one or more features in common with, slots 746, 748 and 2302.
[0341]         Broach       head     720    may      include     broaching         member      wrap
section     2304.         Pin    703     may     be   integrated        into     wrap     section
2304.     Wrap section 2304               may be       separate      from pin 703.             Wrap
section 2304 may be configured to allow wrapping of broaching
member     704    generally          around       wrap      section      2304.         Broaching
member    704     may     be    looped       in    wrap     section      2304.         Broaching
member 704 may be wrapped                   (as     shown in     FIG.     23)     at least one
full turn in wrap section 2304.                          Wrapping about wrap section
2304   may bias         segments        760     and    762    (shown     in    FIG.     21)    away
from axis Lc.
[0342]         FIG.     24    shows      a   cross      section,      viewed       along     lines
24-24    (shown      in    FIG.      8)   of     a portion       of broach         control      706
 (shown   in    FIG.     7) .     Expansion          control     hub    710    is    shown with
base    2402      at     position         Pe.         This     may    correspond          to    the
expanded      state      of broaching            member     704,    as    shown     in    FIG.   8.
Base   2402     may     be    moved      distally         to   position       pc.       This    may
correspond       to    the    contracted           state     of  broaching         member      704,
as shown in FIG. 7.               Expansion control hub 710 may operate in
connection       with      body      2408.         Body     2408    may     include       control
shaft    712     and      distal        stop      2410.        Control        shaft      712    may
include threads 2418.
[0343]         Expansion        control         hub    710   may include          outer     member
2412   and     inner       member       2414.         Outer     member       2412     and    inner

                                             -   64
member      2414    may   be   fixed      to    each      other.          Slide        pin    2404      may
be    captured      between     outer      member        2412      and     inner member              2414.
Inner      member      2414   may     include          threads          2416       for     engagement
with     threads      2418   on  control          shaft       712.        Slide        pin    2404      may
travel in slots 2405 and 2407                     in body 2408.
 [0344]         Expansion       control        hub      710     may     be    moved        along       axis
Lc    by   applying      force   to     expansion           control        hub       710.       In     some
embodiments,         expansion      control          hub     710    may be         advanced          axial
generally         along      axis       Lc      by       applying            rotational              force
generally        about     axis    Lc     to    expansion            control          hub     710      such
that      threads      2416   move      advance          or     retreat         through          threads
2418.
 [0345]         Axial      movement          of       expansion             control           hub       710
relative       to    body    2408    may      be     transferred             to     slide       740     and
slide      cover    750    while    drive       shaft        730     remains         axially         fixed
to     body   2408     by   pin   2406.          Slide        740     may      include         cut-outs
2430     and 2432.        Slide cover 750 may include cut-outs 2434                                     and
2436.         Cut-outs       2430,        2432,        2434       and      2436         may     provide
clearance        of    pin   2406     when       slide        740      and     slide        cover       750
travel axially.
 [0346]         When     expansion        control         hub      710     is     moved        axially,
proximal       ends     736   and    738       (shown        in    FIG.       20)      of    broaching
member      704   thus move      axially.            Distal        end 780          (shown in          FIG.
7)     of   broaching       member      704      may      be     axially         fixed        to     drive
shaft      730,    which     may    be     fixed         to     body     2408.            Thus,       when
expansion         control      hub      710       moves         distally,             the      distance
between      (a) proximal ends            736 and 738             and;      (b) distal end 780
decreases       and     broaching      member         704      expands.            When      expansion
control      hub     710   moves     proximally,              the     distance           between         (a)

                                       -    65
proximal    ends    736   and   738;    and      (b)   distal      end 780    increases
and broaching member 704 contracts.
[0347]       Distal     stop   2410    and proximal             stop   2420   may   limit
axial    movement      of   expansion          control        hub    710.      Although
proximal     stop    2420   is    shown       as   being      part    of   handle     708,
proximal stop 2420 may be separate from handle 708.
[0348] Handle     708   may     transfer         rotational         motion    generally
about   axis    Lc  to   control     shaft       712.       Control     shaft   712    may
transfer    the    rotation    to   slide pin          2404     and drive     shaft pin
2406.     Slide pin 2404       may transfer           the rotation        to slide 740
and slide     cover 750.        Drive       shaft pin 2406 may transfer                the
rotation to drive shaft 730, which may drive broaching member
704   (shown in FIG. 21).
[0349]       Distal     stop    2410     is    shown     as     being    integral    with
body 2408,     but distal      stop may be a separate element                    that is
attached    to    control    shaft     712      or   a   different       part   of   body
2408.
[0350]        Pin   2406    may     extend        into      recess      feature     2422.
Recess    feature     2422    may   be      a   through-hole.            Pin   2406    may
extend    through     the   through       hole     to    a    location     external     to
body 2408.
[0351]        Pin   2404    may     extend        into      recess      feature     2424.
Recess    feature     2424    may   be      a   through-hole.            Pin   2404    may
extend    through     the   through-hole           to   a     location     external     to
body     outer     member      2412.            Recess        feature      may    extend
circumferentially         about    axis       Lc.       If     recess     feature     2424
extends    circumferentially          about       axis      Lc,    expansion     control

                                        -  66
hub   710    may     rotate      about     axis    Lc     substantially          without
restricting, or being restricted by, pin 2404.
[0352]       Body 2408       may include        circumferential          recess     2426.
Recess 2426 may be sized to engage O-ring 2428.                            Recess 2426
may prevent      axial movement         between body 2408            and 0-ring 2428
generally along axis Lc.              O-ring 2428 may be sized to provide
an interference fit with outer member 2412.                         The interference
fit  may    produce      friction      between     0-ring      2428    and    expansion
control    hub    710.      The    friction     may    allow      expansion      control
hub   710    to    be   lightly      locked     at   any      rotational       position
relative to body 2408, generally about axis Lc.

 [0356]         Broach          head      2525       may     be    driven        about     axis     LE    by
rotating        drive         shaft       2540.           Broach      head       2525     may    include
broaching member 2524,                    which may have one or more                       features in
common      with      broaching member                 704      (shown      in    FIG.    7) .    Broach
head 2525 may include distal                           hub 2526        and proximal hub 2528.
One      or  both       of     distal        hub      2526      and    proximal         hub    2528     may
transfer       rotation           to    broaching          member      2524.         One    or   both     of
distal      hub     2526       and     proximal         hub      2528    may     support      broaching
member 2524.
 [0357]         Drive         shaft       2540       may     extend      within        broach      sheath
2527.        Drive         shaft        2540      may      be     supported         in    rotation        by
bushing 2530 at the end of broach sheath 2527.
 [0358]          Illustrative              elevator          ribbon      2552      may    be    anchored
to      broach        sheath          2527       at      fixation          2532.          When       axial
compressive           force,          generally          along      axis       LE,    is    applied       to
elevator       ribbon         2552,       elevator          ribbon      2552      may    buckle      along
its      length.        For example,             elevator         ribbon 2552          may buckle at
or     near   section          2534.         Section         2536    may      be   used     to   support
broach      sheath          2527       at    an    elevation          relative         to    cancellous
bone BCA or cortical bone BCO in bone B                                 (shown in FIG. 2).
 [0359]          Portions          of    elevator          ribbon      2552     may    extend      inside
broach      sheath         2527       and    pass      through       slots       2542     and    2544     to
section       2534.            In     some      embodiments,            there       may    be    contact
between      drive        shaft        2540     and     elevator        ribbon       2552.       In    some
embodiments, there may be no                          contact between drive shaft                      2540
and elevator ribbon 2552.
 [0360]         Elevator            ribbon        2552,       when     compressed,           may     apply
tension       to     adjacent          portion         2538      of   broach       sheath      2527     and

                                                -   68
compression           to   opposite       portion         2540     of broach         sheath       2527.
One     or both of the             tension        of   adjacent       portion        2538    and    the
compression           of opposite         portion        2540     may cause broach sheath
2527 to curve generally about an axis such as LF
[0361]             One   or both       of    adjacent         portion       2538     and    opposite
portion          2540    may    include        stress-relief           features        that       allow
bending          under     tension       and      compression.              The     stress-relief
features          may    include       slots       or    slot     patterns.           The    stress
relief         features       may    be    provided          using     laser-cutting.               The
stress-relief            may provide          an equilibrium curvature                    such     that
broach sheath 2527 is curved at rest.
[0362]             The    stress-relief             features        may       include       sintered
particles.               The      particles           may      include         metal,      polymer,
composite or any other suitable material.
[0363]             FIG.    27    shows     illustrative            laser-cut        pattern        2700
for     a broach         sheath      such     as     927     (shown     in     FIG.    9)    or    2527
 (shown       in    FIG.    26) .      Pattern        2700,      which     is    shown     flat     for
illustration,            may     be    cut     in    a    cylindrical          tube    to    relieve
compression           on    one   side     of     the     tube     and   relieve       tension       on
the other          side of the tube.                 For example,          compression relief
pattern         2740    may be      provided         along      opposite        portion      2540    of
broach         sheath      2527.         Tension         relief      pattern         2738     may    be
provided          along    adjacent       portion         2538     of broach         sheath       2527.
Tension           and      compression             relief        may      be      increased          by
lengthening            lengths        Lpi     and      Lp2 ,     respectively.               Bending
stiffness may be               reduced by increasing                 pattern widths             wi  and
w2.        Increasing          kerf     and     decreasing          inter-cut         spacing       may
also      decrease        bending       stiffness.             In   some      embodiments,          the
tube       may      have     an    outer      diameter          of   0.108       in.        In     some

                                      -   69
embodiments, the tube may have an outer diameter of 0.125 in.
Any suitable outer diameter may be used.
[0364]       FIG.   28   shows      illustrative          elevator       control     body

end   of   broach    sheath      2527.         Drive     shaft    2540      may   extend
through    control    body     2860    to     torque      adapter     2808.       Torque
adapter 2808 may be cannulated.                 Torque adapter 2808 may be a
cannulated A-O type adapter.                Torque adapter 2808 may have a
"D"-shaped extension for engagement by a D-shaped chuck.
[0365]       Torque   adapter      2808    may be       torqued by any          suitable
source of rotational energy.
[0366]       Control    body      2860     may    include       housing        2862   and
actuator    2866.     Handle      2864    may    be    used    to   rotate      actuator
                         6
2866 through angle         E about axis LTE relative to housing 2862.
                                                    6
When   actuator    moves     through      angle       E,    shaft    2868     may   drive
shuttle 2870 in slot 2872.              The distal end of elevator ribbon
2552 may be fixed to the shuttle, for example, by screw 2874.
When   the   shuttle    is    in   a   distal      position,       elevator       ribbon
2552   is expanded     (as shown in FIG.            26).      When the shuttle is
in  a   proximal    position,       elevator      ribbon       2552    is    contracted
toward axis LE
[0367]       Actuator     2866 may       include      face     member      2890.     Face
member    2890   may   be    fixed    relative         to    housing      2862.      Face
member 2890 may include recess 2892.                     Recess 2892 may "catch"
a  projection     such   as    2894    to     act   as    a   detent.        Projection
2894   may  be   one   of   several       projections         that   provide      detent
positions.        For    example,       three      detent       positions        may   be
provided:      forward,      neutral       and     back.          In      the    forward

position,             elevator          ribbon         2552        is      extended.             In     the     back
position, elevator ribbon 2552                                 is   compressed.               In the neutral
position,            elevator          ribbon        2552       is     in    a    partially          compressed
state.
[0368]               Housing         2862     may       be      configured            to     house      a    torque
limiter           (not       shown) .         The       torque        limiter          may     couple        torque
adapter 2808               to drive         shaft 2540 and may be used to                              limit the
torque         that        is    applied         to     broach         head       2525       (shown       in    FIG.
25).         If      broach         head    2525        were       to     jam     in    bone     B     (shown     in
FIG.       2),      the      torque      limiter          may      cap      or    reduce       the     torque     on
broaching head 2525 to prevent damage to broaching head 2525,
other elements                 of apparatus 2500,                   other involved apparatus                      or

broaching           members        such        as      3114.        Broaching            member        3102    may
include numerous                 interconnected cells                     such as cell              3116.      The
cells      may be        defined by             one or more             broaching           members.          Some

3412.       The brace may help               segment 3412          retain its shape under
forces      of   rotation        and    broaching         resistance.             The     brace       may
include       loops       such    as    3418       and    3416.          The    loops      may      pass
around        the       circumference              of    segment           3412.           In       some
embodiments,          loops     3418 and 3416 may encompass                      only a portion
of    the   circumference.             In     some embodiments,               the brace may be
fixed      to   segment       3412,     for      example,        by    crimping,       welding         or
press-fit.
[0407]          The        brace       may         support        broaching           edges           for
displacing        bone      material        in    bone    B     (shown      in   FIG.      2) .       The
broaching edges may have any suitable                             form, such as           serrated,
saw-tooth,        knife-edge,         rectilinear           edge      or   any other        suitable
form.
[0408]          The     brace    may be        formed      from a       pattern      that      is     cut
into a metal tube.

broaching         member         3502.            During      rotation,          broaching          member
3502      may   expand         axially           along      axis     LG    and    draw     distal         hub
3504      proximally         relative            to      drive    shaft       3510.       Contraction
may      occur,      for       example,            when      distal       hub       3504    encounters
resistant material.

[0420]            Distal     hub   3504    may     be   fixed      to    drive     shaft        3510.
Broaching            member      3502      may       be     driven         rotationally             by
application            of   torque      to  proximal          ends      3514      and      3516     of
broaching member             3502.       Broaching       member        3502     may   be      driven
rotationally by application of torque to distal portions 3518
and 3520 of broaching member 3502.
[0421]            Proximal       ends    3514      and    3516      of     broaching         member
3502 may be affixed to drive shaft                       3510 by proximal hub 3506.
Proximal         hub    3506   may    engage     proximal        ends      3514    and     3516     by
crimping,         welding,      set-screw,        snap    fit     or    any     other     suitable
fastening.
[0422]            Proximal       hub     3506       may    include          or    rotate         with
respect       to     a  bearing     (not   shown).         The bearing may be                 seated
in     the   distal       end   of   broach      sheath       3508.        Thus,    when       drive
shaft      3510      rotates broaching member                3502,      broach     sheath         3508
and      the    bearing       do   not    rotate.         The     orientation            at    which
proximal         ends     3514    and    3516       of  broaching           member       3502      are
fixed      to    proximal      hub    3506   may provide           or    retain     a    shape      of
broaching member 3502.
[0423]            Distal     hub     3504   may      extend       a    distance       E     in     the
distal       direction       away     from   distal      portions          3518    and     3520     of
broaching member 3502.                  Distal hub 3504 may thus                  contact bone
material          inside     bone      B   (shown       in     FIG.      2)     before        distal
portions 3518 and 3520 contact the material.                                  If the material
is     dense,        such   as    cortical       bone,      the     material        may       resist
distal advancement of distal hub 3504.                            Broaching member 3502
may     thus be        prevented     from broaching            or   interacting          with      the
material.

broaching         edges    3630      and     3632,       respectively.                 The      broaching
edges       may    broach    bone       inside       bone      B     (shown       in    FIG.        2)     when

[0442]        Broaching       head 4100     may be    contracted      toward drive
shaft   4110     and     withdrawn    into    a   broach   sheath     (not    shown).
The broach      sheath may be        inserted in      a hole such as         H (shown
in  FIG.    2) .      Broaching      head    4100   may   then    be   deployed     by
retracting the broach sheath.                 Broaching members 4102 may be
sufficiently       resilient      to be     contracted     and   may expand       away
from drive shaft 4110 when the broach sheath is retracted.
[0443]        Broaching members 4102 may include free distal ends
such as distal end 4104.               Broaching members with free distal
ends may be supported at their proximal ends near the central
axis of broaching head 4100.
