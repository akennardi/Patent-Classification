        IMMUNE REGULATORY OLIGONUCLEOTIDE (IRO) COMPOUNDS TO
           MODULATE TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR BASED IMMUNE RESPONSE
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         This application is a divisional of AU <removed-apn>, which is a divisional of AU
2011329668, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Field of the invention
[0001]          The invention generally relates to the field of immunology and immunotherapy,
and more specifically to immune regulatory oligonucleotide (IRO) compositions and their use for
inhibition and/or suppression of Toll-like Receptor-mediated immune responses. In particular,
the invention relates to antagonists of Toll-Like Receptors 7 (TLR7) and/or TLR9 that uniquely
inhibit cytokines normally produced through TLR7 and/or TLR9 stimulation.
Summary of the related art
[00021          Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are present on many cells of the immune system and
have been shown to be involved in the innate immune response (Hornung, V. et al., (2002) J.
Immunol. 168:4531-4537). In vertebrates, or mammals, this family consists of ten proteins
called TLR1 to TLR1O, which are known to recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns
from bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (Poltorak, a. et al. (1998) Science 282:2085-2088;

Immunol. 173:5935-5943). TLRs are a key means by which mammals recognize and mount an
immune response to foreign molecules and also provide a means by which the innate and
adaptive immune responses are linked (Akira, S. et al. (2001) Nature Immunol. 2:675-680;
Medzhitov, R. (2001) Nature Rev. Immunol. 1:135-145). TLRs have also been shown to play a
role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including autoimmunity, infectious disease, and
inflammation (Cook, D.N. et al. (2004) Nature Immunol. 5:975-979) and the regulation of TLR
mediated activation using appropriate agents may provide a means for disease intervention.

[0003]          Some TLRs are located on the cell surface to detect and initiate a response to
extracellular pathogens and other TLRs are located inside the cell to detect and initiate a
response to intracellular pathogens. Table 1 provides a representation of TLRs, their cellular
location, and the known agonists therefore (Diebold, S.S. et al. (2004) Science 303:1529

[0004]          Certain unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial and synthetic DNA have
been shown to activate the immune system and induce antitumor activity. (Tokunaga T et al.,
J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (1984) 72:955-962; Shimada S, et al., Jpn. H cancer Res, 1986, 77, 808
816; Yamamoto S, et al., Jpn. J. Cancer Res., 1986, 79, 866-73). Other studies using
antisense oligonucleotides containing CpG dinucleotides have been shown to stimulate
immune responses (Zhao     Q, et al. (1996) Biochem.Pharmacol. 26:173-182). Subsequent
studies demonstrated that TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial and
synthetic DNA (Hemmi, H. et al. (2000) Nature 408:740-745). Other modifications of CpG
containing phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can also affect their ability to act as modulators
of immune response through TLR9 (see, e.g., Zhao et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. (1996)

and novel DNA-based compounds that induce specific immune response profiles that are

[0005]          The selective localization of TLRs and the signaling generated therefrom,
provides some insight into their role in the immune response. The immune response involves
both an innate and an adaptive response based upon the subset of cells involved in the
response. For example, the T helper (Th) cells involved in classical cell-mediated functions
such as delayed-type hypersensitivity and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are
Th1 cells. This response is the body's innate response to antigen (e.g. viral infections,
intracellular pathogens, and tumor cells), and results in a secretion of IFN-gamma and a
concomitant activation of CTLs. Alternatively, the Th cells involved as helper cells for B
cell activation are Th2 cells. Th2 cells have been shown to be activated in response to
bacteria and parasites and may mediate the body's adaptive immune response (e.g. IgE
production and eosinophil activation) through the secretion of IL-4 and IL-5. The type of
immune response is influenced by the cytokines produced in response to antigen exposure
and the differences in the cytokines secreted by Th1 and Th2 cells may be the result of the
different biological functions of these two subsets.
[0006]          While activation of TLRs is involved in mounting an immune response, an
uncontrolled stimulation of the immune system through TLRs may exacerbate certain
                                                 3

diseases in immune compromised subjects. In recent years, several groups have shown the
use of synthetic oligodeoxyoligonucleotides (ODNs) as inhibitors of inflammatory cytokines
(Lenert, P. et al. (2003) DNA Cell Biol. 22(10):621-631).
[0007]          Using certain synthetic ODNs, Lenert et al. report the ability to produce
inhibitory ODNs (Lenert, P. et al. (2003) DNA Cell Biol. 22(10):621-631). These inhibitory
ODN require two triplet sequences, a proximal "CCT" triplet and a distal "GGG" triplet. In
addition to these triplet-containing inhibitory ODNs, several groups have reported other
specific DNA sequences that could inhibit TLR-9-mediated activation by CpG-containing
ODNs. These "inhibitory" or "suppressive" motifs are rich in poly "G" (e.g. "GGGG") or
"GC" sequences, tend to be methylated, and are present in the DNA of mammals and certain
viruses (see e.g.,; Chen, Y., et al., Gene Ther. 8: 1024-1032 (2001); Stunz, L.L., Eur. J.
Immunol. 32: 1212-1222 (2002). Duramad, 0., et al., J. Immunol., 174: 5193-5200 (2005)
and Jurk et. al (US 2005/0239733), describe a structure for inhibitory DNA oligonucleotides
containing a GGGG motif within the sequences. Patole et al. demonstrate that GGGG
containing ODNs will suppress systemic lupus (Patole, P. et al. (2005) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol.
16:3273-3280). Additionally, Gursel, I., et al., J. Immunol., 171: 1393-1400 (2003), describe
repetitive TTAGGG elements, which are present at high frequency in mammalian telomeres,
down-regulate CpG-induced immune activation. Shirota, H., et al., J. Immunol., 173: 5002
5007 (2004), demonstrate that synthetic oligonucleotides containing the TTAGGG element
mimic this activity and could be effective in the prevention/treatment of certain Th 1
dependent autoimmune diseases.
[0008]          In contrast, some studies have called into question the view that poly G
containing ODNs are acting as antagonists of TLRs. For example, US 6,426,334, Agrawal et
al., demonstrate that administering CpG oligonucleotides containing GGGG strings have
potent antiviral and anticancer activity and that administration of these compounds will cause
an increase in serum IL-12 concentration. Further, CpG oligos containing polyG sequences
are known to induce immune responses through TLR9 activation (Verthelyi D et al, J
Immunol. 166, 2372, 2001; Gursel M et al, J Leukoc Biol, 71, 813, 2001, Krug A et al, Eur J
Immunol, 31, 2154, 2001) and show antitumor and antiviral activities (Ballas GK et al, J
Immunol, 167, 4878, 2001; Verthelyi D et al, J Immunol, 170, 4717, 2003). In addition,
polyG oligonucleotides are known to inhibit HIV and Rel A (McShan WM, et al, J Biol
Chem., 267(8):5712-21, 1992; Rando, RF et al., J Biol Chem, 270(4):1754-60, 1995;
Benimetskaya L, et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 25(13):2648-56, 1997); and ODNs containing an
                                                 4

immune stimulatory CpG motif and 4 consecutive G nucleotides (known as class A ODNs)
induce interferon-y production and a ThI shift in the immune response. Moreover, in
preclinical disease models, Class A ODNs have been shown to induce a TLR-mediated
immune response.
[0009]           As an additional limitation, oligonucleotides containing guanosine strings
have been shown to form tetraplex structures, act as aptamers, and inhibit thrombin activity
(Bock LC et al., Nature, 355:564-6, 1992; Padmanabhan, K et al., J Biol Chem.,
268(24):17651-4, 1993). Thus, it is not clear whether single-stranded or multiple-stranded
structures are effective at suppressing TLR9 activation.
[0010]           Kandimalla et al. (11/549,048) describe a novel class of TLR antagonists that
do not require a polyG sequence. Kandimalla et al. also describes the application of these
novel compositions to treating and preventing various diseases and disorders (11/549,048;
11/743,876; 12/140,334; 12/140,338; 12/244199). However a challenge remains to develop
additional TLR antagonists that do not require a polyG sequence and thus do not present the
problem of forming secondary structures. This challenge may be solved through the design
of new oligonucleotide-based compounds and compositions that can act as unique inhibitors
of TLRs 7 and/or 9. Such new custom compounds and compositions will find use in many
clinically relevant applications, including treating and preventing diseases and disorders with
an immune stimulatory component.

                         BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0011]          The inventors have surprisingly discovered that uniquely modifying the
nucleic acid sequence on the 5'-side of a core immune stimulatory dinucleotide, the nucleic
acids within the core immune stimulatory dinucleotide, the linkages between nucleotides or
the linkers connecting two or more oligonucleotides produces novel antagonists of TLR7
and/or TLR9 that distinctly antagonize, inhibit, suppress or prevent the in vitro and in vivo
cytokine and chemokine profiles normally generated through TLR7 and/or TLR9 stimulation.
This ability to antagonize, inhibit suppress or prevent the cytokine and chemokine response to
a TLR7 and/or TLR9 agonist provides the ability to prevent and/or treat various disease
conditions in a disease-specific and even a patient-specific manner.
[0012]          Thus, the invention provides immune regulatory oligonucleotides (IRO)
compounds that act as distinct antagonists of TLR7 and/or TLR9 and methods of using such
compounds to antagonize, inhibit, suppress or prevent TLR7- and/or TLR9-mediated immune
stimulation. These IRO compounds comprise an immune stimulatory motif and would be
immune stimulatory but for one or more chemical modifications in the nucleic acid sequence
on the 5'-side of the immune stimulatory motif and/or in the immune stimulatory motif. The
IRO compounds and compositions that preferentially antagonize, inhibit, suppress or prevent
the activity of TLR7 and/or TLR9 have the structure 5-Nm - N3 N2N 1CGN N N           - Nm -3',
wherein CG is an oligonucleotide motif selected from CpG, C*pG, C*pG* or CpG* wherein
C is cytosine, C* is a cytosine analog or derivative, G is a guanine and G* is a guanine
analog or derivative; N 1-N 3, at each occurrence, is independently a nucleotide or nucleotide

prevents the activity of the oligonucleotide motif; and further provided that the compound
contains less than 4 consecutive guanosine nucleotides and preferably less than 3 consecutive
guanosines, wherein the immune stimulatory activity of the oligonucleotide motif is
antagonized, inhibited, suppressed or prevented by the nucleotide derivative; and wherein m
is a number from 0 to about 30.

nucleotide to nucleotide linkage at their 3' ends through the 3' positions of the sugars or
                                                 6

through a modified sugar or modified nucleobase or via a non-nucleotide linker at their 3'
ends through the 3' positions of the sugars or through a modified sugar or modified
nucleobase. In preferred aspects of this embodiment, at least one of oligonucleotides of the
IRO compound has the structure 5'-Nm - N 3N 2N 1CGN N N         -  N m-3', wherein Nm, N 1, N 2,

compound. In more preferred aspects of this embodiment, at least two of the
oligonucleotides of the IRO compound have the structure 5'-Nm - N3N 2N 1CGN N N           -  Nm

3', wherein Nm, N 1, N 2 , N 3, C, G, N , N , N and Nm are as described above for the general
structure of the IRO compound. Such an IRO compound may have the structure 5'-Nm
                          m
N3N2N1CGN 1N23N - Nm-3'         - X - 3'-N m - N 321
                                                  N N GCN 1 N2 N3 - Nm-5', wherein X is a
                                                                             1   2   3

          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0031]           The present invention relates to the therapeutic use of novel oligonucleotide
based compounds as immune modulatory agents for immunotherapy applications. The
invention provides novel oligonucleotide-based compounds that provide distinct immune
inhibition profiles through their interaction with TLR7 and/or TLR9. Specifically, the
invention provides Immune Regulatory Oligonucleotide (IRO) compounds as antagonists of
toll-like receptors (TLRs) to inhibit and/or suppress a TLR-mediated immune response.
These IROs have chemical modifications, and/or internucleotide linkages, and/or linkers
between oligonucleotides that provide their inhibition or suppression of TLR7- and/or TLR9
mediated signaling in response to endogenous and/or exogenous TLR ligands or agonists.
The references cited herein reflect the level of knowledge in the field and are hereby
incorporated by reference in their entirety. Any conflicts between the teachings of the cited
references and this specification shall be resolved in favor of the latter.
[0032]           The invention further provides methods for suppressing an immune response
caused by TLRs and can be used for immunotherapy applications such as, but not limited to,
treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders, asthma, respiratory allergies, food allergies, skin
allergies, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), arthritis, pleurisy, chronic infections,
inflammatory diseases, inflammatory bowel syndrome, sepsis, and bacteria, parasitic, and
viral infections in adult and pediatric human and veterinary applications. Thus, the invention
provides IRO compounds having optimal levels of immune modulatory effect for
immunotherapy and methods for making and using such compounds. In addition, IRO
compounds of the invention are useful in combination with, for example, vaccines, antigens,
antibodies, allergens, chemotherapeutic agents (both chemotherapy and targeted therapies),
and/or antisense oligonucleotides for prevention and treatment of diseases.
DEFINITIONS
[0033]           The term "oligonucleotide" generally refers to a polynucleoside comprising a
plurality of linked nucleoside units. Such oligonucleotides can be obtained from existing
nucleic acid sources, including genomic or cDNA, but are preferably produced by synthetic
methods. In preferred embodiments each nucleoside unit can encompass various chemical
modifications and substitutions as compared to wild-type oligonucleotides, including but not
limited to modified nucleoside base and/or modified sugar unit. Examples of chemical
modifications are known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in
                                                 11

Synthesis and Properties & Synthesis and Analytical Techniques, S. Agrawal, Ed, Humana
Press, Totowa, USA 1993; and Hunziker, J. et al. (1995) Mod. Syn. Methods 7:331-417; and
Crooke, S. et al. (1996) Ann.Rev. Pharm. Tox. 36:107-129. The nucleoside residues can be
coupled to each other by any of the numerous known internucleoside linkages. Such
internucleoside linkages include, without limitation, phosphodiester, phosphorothioate,
phosphorodithioate, alkylphosphonate, alkylphosphonothioate, phosphotriester,
phosphoramidate, siloxane, carbonate, carboalkoxy, acetamidate, carbamate, morpholino,
borano, thioether, bridged phosphoramidate, bridged methylene phosphonate, bridged
phosphorothioate, and sulfone internucleoside linkages. The term "oligonucleotide" also
encompasses polynucleosides having one or more stereospecific internucleoside linkage (e.g.,
(Rp)- or (Sp)-phosphorothioate, alkylphosphonate, or phosphotriester linkages). As used
herein, the terms "oligonucleotide" and "dinucleotide" are expressly intended to include
polynucleosides and dinucleosides having any such internucleoside linkage, whether or not
the linkage comprises a phosphate group. In certain preferred embodiments, these
internucleoside linkages may be phosphodiester, phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate
linkages or combinations thereof.
[0034]           The term "2'-substituted ribonucleoside" or "2'-substituted arabinoside"
generally includes ribonucleosides or arabinonucleosides in which the hydroxyl group at the
2' position of the pentose moiety is substituted to produce a 2'-substituted or 2'-0-substituted
ribonucleoside. In certain embodiments, such substitution is with a lower hydrocarbyl group
containing 1-6 saturated or unsaturated carbon atoms, with a halogen atom, or with an aryl
group having 6-10 carbon atoms, wherein such hydrocarbyl, or aryl group may be
unsubstituted or may be substituted, for example, with halo, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, cyano,
nitro, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxy, carboxyl, carboalkoxy, or amino groups. Examples of 2'-0
substituted ribonucleosides or 2'-0-substituted-arabinosides include, without limitation 2'
amino, 2'-fluoro, 2'-allyl, 2'-O-alkyl and 2'-propargyl ribonucleosides or arabinosides, 2'-0
methylribonucleosides or 2'-0-methylarabinosides and 2'-0-methoxyethoxyribonucleosides
or 2'-0-methoxyethoxyarabinosides.
[0035]           The term " 3' " , when used directionally, generally refers to a region or
position in a polynucleotide or oligonucleotide 3' (downstream) from another region or
position in the same polynucleotide or oligonucleotide.
                                                12

[0036]           The term " 5' " , when used directionally, generally refers to a region or
position in a polynucleotide or oligonucleotide 5' (upstream) from another region or position
in the same polynucleotide or oligonucleotide.
[0037]           The term "about" generally means that the exact number is not critical. Thus,
the number of nucleoside residues in the oligonucleotides is not critical, and oligonucleotides
having one or two fewer nucleoside residues, or from one to several additional nucleoside
residues are contemplated as equivalents of each of the embodiments described above.
[0038]           The term "agonist" generally refers to a substance that binds to a receptor of a
cell and induces a response. An agonist often mimics the action of a naturally occurring
substance such as a ligand.
[0039]           The term "antagonist" generally refers to a substance that attenuates, inhibits
or suppresses the effects of an agonist or ligand.
[0040]           The term "adjuvant" generally refers to a substance which, when added to an
immunogenic agent such as vaccine or antigen, enhances or potentiates an immune response
to the agent in the recipient host upon exposure to the mixture.
[0041]           The term "airway inflammation" generally includes, without limitation,
asthma.
[0042]           The term "allergen" generally refers to an antigen or antigenic portion of a
molecule, usually a protein, which elicits an allergic response upon exposure to a subject.
Typically the subject is allergic to the allergen as indicated, for instance, by the wheal and
flare test or any method known in the art. A molecule is said to be an allergen even if only a
small subset of subjects exhibit an allergic immune response upon exposure to the molecule.
[0043]           The term "allergy" generally refers to an inappropriate immune response
characterized by inflammation and includes, without limitation, food allergies and respiratory
allergies.
[0044]           The term "antigen" generally refers to a substance that is recognized and
selectively bound by an antibody or by a T cell antigen receptor, resulting in induction of an
immune response. Antigens may include but are not limited to peptides, proteins,
nucleosides, nucleotides, and combinations thereof. Antigens may be natural or synthetic and
generally induce an immune response that is specific for that antigen.
                                                 13

[0045]          The terms "autoimmune disease" and autoimmune disorder" generally refer to
diseases or disorders in which "self" components undergo attack by the immune system.
[0046]          The term "TLR-mediated disease" or TLR-mediated disorder" generally
means any pathological condition for which activation of one or more TLRs is a contributing
factor. Such conditions include but are not limited, cancer, autoimmune diseases or
disorders, airway inflammation, inflammatory diseases or disorders, infectious diseases, skin
disorders, allergy, asthma or diseases caused by a pathogen.
[0047]          The term "physiologically acceptable" generally refers to a material that does
not interfere with the effectiveness of an IRO compound or composition according to the
invention and that is compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue or
organism. Preferably, the biological system is a living organism, such as a vertebrate, or
mammal.
[0048]          The term "carrier" generally encompasses any excipient, diluent, filler, salt,
buffer, stabilizer, solubilizer, oil, lipid, lipid containing vesicle, microspheres, liposomal
encapsulation or other material well known in the art for use in pharmaceutical formulations.
It will be understood that the characteristics of the carrier, excipient or diluent will depend on
the route of administration for a particular application. The preparation of pharmaceutically
acceptable formulations containing these materials is described in, for example, Remington's
PharmaceuticalSciences, 18th Edition, ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA,
1990.
[0049]          The term "co-administration" generally refers to the administration of at least
two different substances sufficiently close in time to modulate, suppress or inhibit an immune
response. Co-administration refers to simultaneous administration, as well as temporally
spaced order of up to several days apart, of at least two different substances in any order,
either in a single dose or separate doses.
[0050]          The term "complementary" generally means having the ability to hybridize to
a nucleic acid. Such hybridization is ordinarily the result of hydrogen bonding between
complementary strands, preferably to form Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen base pairs, although
other modes of hydrogen bonding, as well as base stacking can also lead to hybridization.
[0051]          The term an "effective amount" or a "sufficient amount" generally refers to an
amount sufficient to affect a desired biological effect, such as beneficial results. Thus, an
"effective amount" or "sufficient amount" will depend upon the context in which it is being
                                                    14

administered. In the context of administering a compound or composition that modulates an
immune response to a co-administered antigen, an effective amount of an IRO compound or
composition according to the invention and antigen is an amount sufficient to achieve the
desired modulation, inhibition or suppression as compared to the immune response obtained
when the antigen is administered alone. An effective amount may be administered in one or
more administrations.
[0052]           The term "in combination with" generally means in the course of treating a
disease or disorder in a patient, administering an IRO compound or composition according to
the invention and an agent useful for treating the disease or disorder that does not diminish
the immune inhibitory effect of the IRO compound or composition according to the
invention. Such combination treatment may also include more than a single administration of
an IRO compound or composition according to the invention and/or independently an agent.
The administration of the IRO compound or composition according to the invention and/or
the agent may be by the same or different routes.
[0053]           The term "individual" or "subject" or "vertebrate" generally refers to a
mammal. Mammals generally include, but are not limited to, humans, non-human primates,
rats, mice, cats, dogs, horses, cattle, cows, pigs, sheep, and rabbits.
[0054]           The term "kinase inhibitor" generally refers to molecules that antagonize or
inhibit phosphorylation-dependent cell signaling and/or growth pathways in a cell. Kinase
inhibitors may be naturally occurring or synthetic and include small molecules that have the
potential to be administered as oral therapeutics. Kinase inhibitors have the ability to rapidly
and specifically inhibit the activation of the target kinase molecules. Protein kinases are
attractive drug targets, in part because they regulate a wide variety of signaling and growth
pathways and include many different proteins. As such, they have great potential in the
treatment of diseases involving kinase signaling, including cancer, cardiovascular disease,
inflammatory disorders, diabetes, macular degeneration and neurological disorders.
Examples of kinase inhibitors include sorafenib (Nexavar@), Sutent@, dasatinib,
Dasatinib TM, Zactima TM, Tykerb TM and ST1571.
[0055]           The term "nucleoside" generally refers to compounds consisting of a sugar,
usually ribose or deoxyribose, and a purine or pyrimidine base.
[0056]           The term "nucleotide" generally refers to a nucleoside comprising a phosphate
group attached to the sugar.
                                                 15

[0057]          As used herein, the term "pyrimidine nucleoside" refers to a nucleoside
wherein the base component of the nucleoside is a pyrimidine base (e.g., cytosine (C) or
thymine (T) or Uracil (U)). Similarly, the term "purine nucleoside" refers to a nucleoside
wherein the base component of the nucleoside is a purine base (e.g., adenine (A) or guanine
(G)).
[0058]          The terms "analog" or "derivative" can be used interchangeable to generally
refer to any purine and/or pyrimidine nucleotide or nucleoside that has a modified base and/or
sugar. A modified base is a base that is not guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymine or uracil. A
modified sugar is any sugar that is not ribose or 2'deoxyribose and can be used in the
backbone for an oligonucleotide.
[0059]          The term "inhibiting" or "suppressing" generally refers to a decrease in or a
prevention of a response or qualitative difference in a response, which could otherwise arise
from eliciting and/or stimulation of a response.
[0060]          The term "non-nucleotide linker" generally refers to any linkage or moiety that
can link or be linked to the oligonucleotides other than through a phosphorous-containing
linkage. Preferably such linker is from about 2 angstroms to about 200 angstroms in length.
[0061]          The term "nucleotide linkage" generally refers to a direct 3'-5' linkage that
directly connects the 3' and 5' hydroxyl groups of two nucleosides through a phosphorous
containing linkage.
[0062]          The terms "oligonucleotide motif' means an oligonucleotide sequence,
including a dinucleotide selected from CpG, C*pG, C*pG* or CpG*. The terms CpG, C*pG,
C*pG* and CpG* refer to oligonucleotide motifs that are immune stimulatory wherein C is
cytosine, C* is a cytosine analog or derivative, G is a guanine and G* is a guanine analog or
derivative.
[0063]          An "oligonucleotide motif that would be immune stimulatory, but for one or
more modifications" means an oligonucleotide motif which is immune stimulatory in a parent
oligonucleotide, but not in a derivative oligonucleotide, wherein the derivative
oligonucleotide is based upon the parent oligonucleotide, but has one or more modifications.
In other words, an "oligonucleotide motif that would be immune stimulatory, but for one or
more modifications" refers to a TLR9-inducing moiety that would have TLR9 agonistic
activity but for that fact that it has been functionally blocked or inhibited from inducing
TLR9 mediated immune response through modification(s) of the TLR9-inducing moiety
                                                  16

 itself and/or by one or more chemical modification within the oligonucleotide based
 compound. Modifications that inhibit the activity of a TLR9-inducing moiety include, but
 not limited to, 2'-OMe-ribonucleosides, 3'-OMe-ribonucleosides, 3-nitropyrrole, 5
 nitroindole, dU, $-L-deoxynucleosides, a-deoxynucleosides, abasic nucleoside, propanediol
 linker, amino linker, isopropoxyl, glycerol linker, 2'-5'-DNA, 2'-5' RNA, and P-Me DNA,
[0064]           The term "treatment" generally refers to an approach intended to obtain a
beneficial or desired results, which may include alleviation of symptoms and/or delaying
and/or ameliorating the progression of a disease or disorder.
[0065]           Certain IROs according to the invention are shown in Table 2. In this table, the
IRO compounds have all phosphorothioate (PS) linkages, except where indicated with 'o'.
Except where indicated, all nucleotides are deoxyribonucleotides.

[0066]           In a first aspect, the invention provides immune regulatory oligonucleotide
(IRO) compounds. The term "IRO" refers to an immune regulatory oligonucleotide-based
compound that is an antagonist for TLR7- and/or TLR9, wherein the compound comprises an
oligonucleotide motif and at least one modification, wherein the oligonucleotide motif would
be immune stimulatory but for the one or more modifications that functionally block or
inhibit the activity of the oligonucleotide motif, provided that the compound contains less
than 4 consecutive guanosine nucleotides and preferably less than 3 consecutive guanosine
nucleotides. Such modifications may be in the oligonucleotide 5' terminus, in the 5'
sequence flanking the oligonucleotide motif, and/or within the immune stimulatory
oligonucleotide motif. These modifications result in an IRO compound that antagonize,
inhibit, suppresses or prevent TLR7- and/or TLR9-mediated immune stimulation. Such
modifications can be to the bases, sugar residues and/or the phosphate backbone of the
nucleotides/nucleosides flanking the immune stimulatory oligonucleotide motif or within
such oligonucleotide motif.
[0067]           The general structure of the IRO compound has the structure 5'-Nm
N 3N 2N1CGNlN2N' - Nm-3' wherein CG is an oligonucleotide motif selected from CpG,
C*pG, C*pG* or CpG* wherein C is cytosine, C* is a cytosine analog or derivative, G is a
                                                  22

guanine and G* is a guanine analog or derivative; N1 -N 3 , at each occurrence, is independently
                                               1   3
a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative; N -N , at each occurrence, is independently a
nucleotide or nucleotide derivative; Nn and N', at each occurrence, is independently a
nucleotide, nucleotide derivative or non-nucleotide linker; provided that at least one of N 1,

administering to the mammal an IRO compound according to the invention. In some
embodiments, the mammal is a human. In preferred embodiments, the IRO compound is
administered to a mammal in need of immune suppression.
[0098]          According to this aspect of the invention, an IRO compound is capable of
suppressing a TLR-based immune response to a further TLR ligand or TLR agonist. As
discussed further in the Examples below, the activation of a TLR-based immune response by a
TLR agonist or TLR ligand (for example, an immune stimulatory oligonucleotide) can be
antagonized, inhibited, suppressed or prevented by the simultaneous, pre- or post-administration
of an IRO compound, and such antagonism, inhibition, suppression or prevention may be
maintained for an extended period of time (for example, days) after administration. This
beneficial property of the current invention has a unique advantage for the prevention and/or
treatment of a disease or disorder. For example, application of certain TLR-agonists in the
course of treating the disease may cause unwanted immune stimulation that an IRO compound
could antagonize, suppress, inhibit or prevent. Administration of the IRO simultaneously, pre
and/or post administration of the TLR-agonist may allow therapeutic benefits from the TLR
agonist while antagonizing, suppressing, inhibiting or preventing the unwanted side effect(s).
Additionally, pre-administration of an IRO compound according to the invention could
antagonize, suppress, inhibit or prevent an immune response (for example, an allergic reaction)
to a subsequent or later challenge by a TLR-agonist. Preferably a TLR7 and/or TLR9 agonist
[0099]          In the methods according to this aspect of the invention, administration of IRO
compound according to the invention can be by any suitable route, including, without limitation,
parenteral, mucosal delivery, oral, sublingual, transdermal, topical, inhalation, intragastric,
intranasal, aerosol, intraocular, intratracheal, intrarectal, vaginal, by gene gun, dermal patch or in
eye drop or mouthwash form. Administration of the therapeutic compositions of IRO compound
can be carried out using known procedures at dosages and for periods of time effective to reduce
symptoms or surrogate markers of the disease. When administered systemically, the therapeutic
                                                    32

composition is preferably administered at a sufficient dosage to attain a blood concentration of
IRO compound from about 0.0001 micromolar to about 100 micromolar. More preferably,
systemic administration would be at a sufficient dosage to attain a blood concentration of the
IRO compound from about 0.001 micromolar to about 10 micromolar. For localized
administration, much lower concentrations than this may be effective, and much higher
concentrations may be tolerated. Preferably, a total dosage of IRO compound ranges from about
0.001 mg per patient per day to about 200 mg per kg body weight per day. It may be desirable to
administer the IRO compound according to the invention daily, every second day, every third
day, every fourth day, every fifth day, every sixth day or weekly. It may be desirable to
administer simultaneously, or sequentially, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of
the IRO containing therapeutic compositions of the invention to an individual as a single
treatment episode.
[00100]         The IRO compound may optionally be linked to one or more allergens and/or
antigens (self or foreign), an immunogenic protein, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH),
cholera toxin B subunit, or any other immunogenic carrier protein. IRO can also be used in
combination with other compounds (for example, adjuvants) including, without limitation, TLR
agonists (e.g. TLR2 agonists, TLR4 agonists, and TLR9 agonists), Freund's incomplete
adjuvant, KLH, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), alum, Merck alum adjuvant (MAA), and
saponins, including QS-21 and imiquimod, or combinations thereof.
[00101]         The methods according to this aspect of the invention are useful for model studies
of the immune system. The methods are also useful for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment
of human or animal disease. For example, the methods are useful for pediatric, adult, and
veterinary vaccine applications.

[00104]          In any of the methods according to the third, fourth or fifth aspect of the
invention, the IRO compound can be administered in combination with any other agent useful
for treating or preventing the disease or condition that does not abolish the immune antagonist,

             Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing Immune Regulatory Moieties.
[00106]         All IRO compounds of the invention were synthesized according to standard
procedures (see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040097719).
[00107]         Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 1 [tM scale using an automated DNA
synthesizer (Expedite 8909; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, Mass.), following standard
linear synthesis or parallel synthesis procedures (see e.g. FIGS. 5 and 6 of U.S. Patent
Publication No. 20040097719).
[00108]         Deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidites were obtained from (Aldrich-Sigma, St
Louis, Mo). 1',2'-dideoxyribose phosphoramidite, propyl-1-phosphoramidite, 2-deoxyuridine
phosphoramidite, 1,3-bis-[5-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)pentylamidyl]-2-propanol phosphoramidite
and methyl phosponamidite were obtained from Glen Research (Sterling, Va.). .beta.-L-2'
deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidite, .alpha. -2'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidite, mono
DMT-glycerol phosphoramidite and di-DMT-glycerol phosphoramidite were obtained from
ChemGenes (Willmington, Mass.). (4-Aminobutyl)-1,3-propanediol phosphoramidite was
obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, Calif.). Arabinoguanosine, was obtained from Reliable
Pharmaceutical (St. Louis, Mo.). Arabinoguanosine phosphoramidite was synthesized at Idera
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.) (Noronha et al. (2000) Biochem., 39:7050-7062).
[00109]         All nucleoside phosphoramidites were characterized by    31
                                                                           P and 1H NMR spectra.
Modified nucleosides were incorporated at specific sites using normal coupling cycles. After

[00111]         C57BL/6 mice were used in this study. Mouse splenocytes were cultured for
24hrs (at 37'C, 5% C0 2 ) with TLR7/TLR9 antagonists over a dose range 0.3, 1, 5, 10 mg/ml (A)
or at a single dose, 10mg/ml (B) in the presence of a TLR7 agonist (200mg/ml) or in the
presence of a TLR9 agonist (1mg/ml) or in the presence of PBS. Supernatants were collected and
cytokine/chemokine responses were then evaluated in supernatants by multiplex assays using the
Luminex xMAP system. Samples were assayed in duplicate (SD). Results are shown in
Figures 3 and 4.

[00112]         Female C57BL/6 mice (2/group) were s.c injected with 1, 5 or 15 mg/kg
antagonist compound at 0 hr in the right flank. The mice were then injected with TLR7 agonist
(10 mg/kg) or with TLR9 agonist (0.25 mg/kg) at 24 hrs in the left flank. Blood was collected by
orbital bleeding 2 hrs post the agonist administration. The serum samples were then analyzed by
IL-12 ELISA. Results are shown in Figures 5 and 6.
[00113]         Additionally, female C57BL/6 mice (2/group) were s.c injected with 5 mg/kg
antagonist compound at day 0 in the right flank. The mice were then injected with TLR7 (10
mg/kg) agonist at days 1, 2, 4, 9 and 11 or with TLR9 (0.25 mg/kg) agonist at days 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
and 11 in the left flank. Blood was collected by orbital bleeding 2 hrs post the agonist
administration. The serum samples were then analyzed by IL-12 ELISA. Results are shown in
Figures 7 and 8.
[00114]         Female C57BL/6 mice (2/group) were also s.c injected with 5 mg/kg antagonist
compound at 0 hr in the right flank. The mice were then injected with TLR9 (0.25mg/kg) or
TLR7 (10 mg/kg) agonists at 24 hrs in the left flank. Blood was collected by orbital bleeding 2
hrs post the agonist administration. Cytokine/chemokine responses were then evaluated in serum
samples by multiplex assays using the Luminex xMAP system. Results are shown in Figure 9.
[00115]         Finally, female C57BL/6 mice (2/group) were s.c injected with 5 mg/kg
antagonist compound at 0 hr in the right flank. The mice were then injected with TLR3 (10
                                                 40

mg/kg) or TLR5 (0.25 mg/kg) agonists at 24 hrs in the left flank. Blood was collected by orbital
bleeding 2 hrs post the agonist administration. Cytokine/chemokine responses were then
evaluated in serum samples by multiplex assays using the Luminex xMAP system. Results are
shown in Figure 10.
