Technical Field
[001]    The present invention relates to power sockets and in particular, although not exclusively,
this invention relates to a power socket for use with a power plug having three pins.
Background
[002]    In today's modern world, people around the globe are dependent on electrical appliances
for numerous tasks. In other words, from homes and kitchens to workplace, everywhere people
are surrounded by electrical appliances like television, home theatres, refrigerators, ovens, toasters,
personal computers, chargers (for mobiles or laptops) etc. Almost all the electrical appliances
require electrical energy that is provided by inserting the plug of the electrical appliance in the
electrical socket (electrical wall outlets commonly found in households). Hence, the electrical
energy is transferred from the socket to the appliance and the appliance becomes operational.
Electrical sockets commonly have three pin holders i.e. active, neutral and earth. Some sockets
offer extra live and neutral pins holders for receiving plugs of different size.
[003]    Existing electrical sockets comprise an active pin holder to receive an active pin of a plug
of an appliance, a neutral pin holder to receive a neutral pin of the plug, and an earth pin holder to
receive an earth pin of the plug. Further, when the plug is inserted in the socket, the active pin
holder comes in contact with an active tenninal; the neutral pin holder contacts the neutral terminal
and earth pin holder contacts an earth terminal to complete the circuit. The above mentioned
components are assembled in a receptacle designed to receive the components.
[004]    In a typical power socket, the neutral terminal comprises a contact plate and a contact post.
But it is neither cost effective nor easy to manufacture the contact post of the particular shape and
then connect the contact plate with the contact post. Additionally, this type of socket requires a
conductive wire to be provided for connecting the active terminal and another contact post. This
complicates the assembly. Also, the earth terminal extends between the active pin holder and the
neutral pin holder. This leads to a longer earth terminal that uses more the material and increases
the complexity of the circuitry and cost of the socket.
[005]    Accordingly, there is a need for an improved power socket which does not suffer from
above mentioned deficiencies.
[006]    Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the words "comprise",
"comprises" and "comprising" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated step or element

                                                     2
or group of steps or elements but not the exclusion of any other step or element or group of steps
or elements.
[007]    Any one of the terms: "including" or "which includes" or "that includes" as used herein is
also an open term that also means including at least the elements/features that follow the term, but
not excluding others.
[008]    Any discussion of the background art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such background art is prior art nor that such background art is
widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field in Australia or
worldwide.
Summary
[009]    There is provided a power socket for use with a power plug having three pins. The power
socket comprises a first pin holder to hold a first pin of the power plug, the first pin holder including
a first free contact end; a second pin holder to hold a second pin of the power plug, the second pin
holder including a second free contact end; a third pin holder to hold a third pin of the power plug;
a first terminal including a first contact plate and a first connection plate, at least part of the first
contact plate being configured to be able to effectively contact the first free contact end of the first
pin holder if the first pin of the power plug is held by the first pin holder and the first connection
plate being configured to be connected to an active wire; a second terminal including a second
contact plate and a second connection plate. at least part of the second contact plate being
configured to be able to effectively contact the second free contact end of the second pin holder if
the second pin of the power plug is held by the second pin holder and the second connection plate
being configured to be connected to a neutral wire; a third terminal connected to the third pin
holder and configured to be connected to an earth wire; and a receptacle to securely receive the
first pin holder, the second pin holder, the third pin holder, the first terminal, the second terminal
and the third terminal. Further, the first contact plate and the first connection plate are formed by
bending a first sheet material having a first shape, and the second contact plate and the second
connection plate are formed by bending a second sheet material having a second shape.
[010]    It is an advantage of the present invention that, as the first terminal and the second terminal,
including their respective contact plates and connection plates, are formed by bending a sheet
metal to a desired shape, the present invention offers the advantages of cost-effective
manufacturing and easy installation over the prior art. Also, as no contact post is needed in the
present invention, no additional wire is required in the circuitry for making connections between

                                                     3
the contact post and the contact plates. Additionally, the third terminal is connected to the third
pin holder resulting in a shorter third (earth) terminal. This present invention uses less material
and enables simpler connections within the socket as compared to the prior art.
 [011]   The receptacle may comprise a substrate, and a first protrusion substantially vertically
extending from the substrate, the first protrusion including a first groove, wherein the first contact
plate is detachably received in the first groove substantially vertically relative to the substrate.
 [012]   The first protrusion may include a first side wall and a second side wall. The first side wall
and the second side wall may be substantially vertical relative to the substrate and may define the
first groove therebetween to receive the first contact plate.
 [013]   The first shape of the first sheet material may include at least one "L" shaped corner having
two legs, and the first contact plate and the first connection plate may be formed by bending one
of the two legs of the "L" shaped corner to allow the first contact plate to be received in the first
groove substantially vertically relative to the substrate.
 [014]   The first contact plate may further include one or more bends to enhance stability of the
first contact plate received in the first groove of the first protrusion.
 [0151   The first connection plate of the first terminal may further include a first connection
member to be securely connected to the active wire.
 [016]   The receptacle may comprise a second protrusion substantially vertically extending from
the substrate. The second protrusion may include a second groove, wherein the second contact
plate may be detachably received in the second groove substantially vertically relative to the
substrate.
 [017]   The second protrusion may include a third side wall and a fourth side wall. The third side
wall and the fourth side wall may be substantially vertical relative to the substrate and may define
the second groove therebetween to receive the second contact plate.
 [018]   The second shape of the second sheet material may include at least one "L" shaped corner
having two legs, and the second contact plate and the second connection plate may be formed by
bending one of the two legs of the "L" shaped corner to allow the second contact plate to be
received in the second groove substantially vertically relative to the substrate.
 [019]   The second contact plate may further include one or more bends to enhance stability of the
second contact plate received in the second groove of the second protrusion.

                                                    4
[020]    The second connection plate of the second terminal may further include a second
connection member to be securely connected to the neutral wire.
[021]    The third terminal may extend from the third pin holder and may not extend between the
first pin holder and the second pin holder to substantially minimise a length of the third tenninal.
[022]    The third terminal may further include a third connection member to be securely connected
to the earth wire.
[023]    The power socket may further comprise a lighting device connected between the first pin
holder and the second pin holder.
[024]    The power socket may further comprise a base including an opening to receive the substrate
of the receptacle; and a cover connected to the base. The base and the cover may be configured to
enclose the receptacle therebetween.
[025]    The cover may further comprise a first hole, a second hole and a third hole. The first hole,
the second hole and the third hole may be aligned with the first pin holder, the second pin holder
and the third pin holder, respectively, to allow the first pin, the second pin and the third pin of the
power plug to be held by the first pin holder, the second pin holder and the third pin holder,
respectively.

Description of Embodiments
[028]   Figure 1 illustrates an outer assembly 101 of a power socket 100 for use with a power plug
(not shown) having three pins, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Power
plugs and sockets are devices that allow the electrical appliances to connect to power supply in
households, workplaces, industries etc. As shown in Figure 1, the power supply includes an active
wire 102, a neutral wire 104 and an earth wire 106. However, in many countries, it is not
uncommon for power supplies having a single phase, to combine the neutral and the earth into a
single conductor. In those scenarios, the power supply may include only two wires, i.e., the active
wire 102 and a neutral/earth wire (not shown). The power socket 100 comprises a base 110 and a
cover 108 connected to the base 110. The base 110 and the cover 108 are designed in a manner to
house or hold inner components of the power socket 100 and exemplary embodiments of the base
110 and the cover 108 can be found in the discussion below.

                                                   6
 [029]   Figure 2 illustrates the cover 108 of the power socket 100, in accordance with an
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 2, the cover 108 comprises a first hole
2022, a second hole 2024 and a third hole 2026. The first hole 2022 is configured to receive a first
pin (active pin) of the power plug (not shown) of the electrical appliance. The second hole 2024 is
configured to receive a second pin (neutral pin) of the power plug and the third hole 2026 is
configured to receive a third pin (earthing pin) of the power plug. The design and orientation etc.
of the first hole 2022, the second hole 2024 and the third hole 2026 may vary as per different
jurisdictions in accordance with their applicable standards. For Example: AS/NZS 3112 standard
is followed in Australia and New Zealand for AC power plugs and sockets. As per the standard,
the first hole 2022 and the second hole 2024 form an inverted V-shape and each of the first hole
2022 and the second hole 2024 is oriented at an angle of 300 from the vertical. The third hole 2026
has a vertical orientation. The first hole 2022, second hole 2024 and the third hole 2026 are
arranged at 1200 angles around a common midpoint, with the first hole 2022 and the second hole
2024 centred 7.92 mm (5/16 inch) from the midpoint, and the third hole 2026 centred 10.31 mm
(318 inch) away from the midpoint.
 [030]   Additionally, the first hole 2022, the second hole 2024 and the third hole 2026 may have a
rectangular shape to receive the flat pins of the power plug (as per standard in Australia and New
Zealand). However, a skilled addressee would appreciate that the design of the first hole 2022, the
second hole 2024 and the third hole 2026 is not limited to the discussion about standard AS/NZS
3112 discussed above. Many variations are possible for the design of the first hole 2022, the second
hole 2024 and the third hole 2026 depending upon applicable standard in a particular jurisdiction.
 [031] Additionally, the cover 108 may have a stepped structure having an upper step 202 and
two lower steps 204, 206 on either side of the upper step 202. The upper step 202 may extend,
substantially in a middle portion of the cover 108, to a predetermined height, for example, 15 mm,
from the lower step. The first hole 2022, the second hole 2024 and the third hole 2026 may be
provided on the upper step 202. A first circular hole 2042is provided on a lower step 204 on one
side of the upper step 202. Similarly, a second circular hole 2044is provided on the lower step 204
on the same side as the first circular hole 2042. Moreover, a third circular hole 2062is provided on
a lower step 206 on another side of the upper step 202. The first circular hole 2044, the second
circular hole 2044 and the third circular hole 2062 have been provided to access connection
members (such as screws, studs and spring loaded retainers etc.) for tight connections with the
active wire, the neutral wire and the earth wire, respectively. Additional holes 2028 may be
provided in the cover 108 to receive a lighting device.

wire 104 (not shown in Figure 3) from the power supply and the third cavity 306 is adapted to
receive the earth wire 106 (not shown in Figure 3) from the power supply. The base 110 further
comprises an opening 308 to receive a receptacle 400 (as shown in Figure 4) of the power socket
100. The base 110 and the cover 108 are configured to enclose the receptacle 400 therebetween.
The receptacle 400, as will be discussed below, is a member of the power socket 100 for receiving
various other electrical components in the power socket 100. The base 110 and the cover 108 may
be attached using a connection mechanism such as, but not limited to, a plurality of screws and
snap-fit arrangements etc. The plurality of screws may be received in the plurality of threaded
openings 310 provided on the corners of the base 110. When connected, the base 110 and the cover
108 form the outer assembly 101 of the power socket 100.
[033]   Figure 4 illustrates a receptacle 400 of the power socket 100, in accordance with an
embodiment of the present invention. The receptacle 400 comprises a substrate 402. The substrate
402 acts as a support structure on which the other parts of the receptacle 400 are formed. The
substrate 402 is adapted to be received in the opening 308 of the base 110. The substrate 402 may
be held in opening 308 of the base 110 using a connection mechanism such as, but not limited to,
snap fit mechanism or a plurality of screws. The receptacle 400 may be specifically designed for
receiving a plurality of components of the power socket 100. The plurality of components (not
shown in Figure 4) may include, but not limited to, a plurality of pin holders, a plurality of
terminals and one or more lighting devices. The receptacle 400 further comprises a first protrusion
404. The first protrusion 404 extends substantially vertically from the substrate 402 and also
includes a first groove 4042. Additionally, the first protrusion 404 has a first side wall 4044 and a
second side wall 4046, which are substantially vertical relative to the substrate 402 and thereby
define the first groove 4042 therebetween. The first side wall 4044 and the second side wall 4046
have a first predetermined profile. The first predetermined profile may include at least a portion
of the first side wall 4044 extending from a first edge 4022 of the substrate 402 and including
predetermined inwards bends and at least a portion of the second side wall 4046 extending

                                                    8
substantially parallel to the first side wall 4044 at a predetermined distance, for example, 1 to 2
mm from the first side wall 4044.
[034]    Additionally, the receptacle 400 comprises a second protrusion 406. The second protrusion
406 is substantially vertical and extends from the substrate 402. The second protrusion 406 also
includes a second groove 4062. The second protrusion 406 has a third side wall 4064 and a fourth
side wall 4066, which are substantially vertical relative to the substrate 402 and thereby define the
second groove 4062 therebetween. The third side wall 4064 and the fourth side wall 4066 have a
second predetermined profile (particularly, symmetric with the first predetermined profile). The
predetermined profile may include at least a portion of the third side wall 4064 extending from a
second edge 4024 of the substrate 402 and including predetermined inwards bends and at least a
portion of the fourth side wall 4066 extending substantially parallel to the third side wall 4064 at
a predetermined distance, for example, I to 2 mm from the third side wall 4064. The receptacle
400 also comprises a plurality of supporting elements 408 extending substantially vertically
relative to the substrate 402, to hold the plurality of components to be received, in a position.
[035]    In various embodiments, the cover 108, the base 110 and the receptacle 400 may be made
from a same material. In various alternate embodiments, the receptacle 400 may be made from a
different material as compared to the cover 108 and the base 110. Desirable properties of such
materials however may be, but not limited to., good insulating properties, predetermined toughness
(not easily breakable), formability, ability to be moulded and extruded, resistance to chemicals and
temperature variations and recyclability. The base 110, the cover 108 and the receptacle 400 may
be manufactured by, but not limited to, moulding such as injection moulding the material in a
predesigned shape. The material may be, but not limited to, plastic such as PVC (Poly Vinyl
Chloride), ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), polypropylene etc.
[036]    Figure 5 illustrates an example of an inner assembly 500 of the power socket 100, in
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The inner assembly 500 of the power
socket 100 comprises the first pin holder 502 configured to hold the first pin or the active pin of
the power plug (not shown) of the electrical appliance. The first pin holder 502 is aligned with the

to enhance stability of the first contact plate 5082 received in the first groove 4042 of the first
protrusion 404 of the receptacle 400. In the present invention, the first contact plate 5082 and the
first connection plate 5084 are formed by bending a first sheet material having a first shape.
[040]    Figure 7B illustrates the first sheet material having the first shape, in accordance with an
embodiment of the present invention. In order to manufacture the first terminal 508, a stamping or
pressing process is applied to a conductive sheet material (for example, a copper sheet) to form
the first sheet material having the first shape, as shown in Figure 7B.The first shape of the first
sheet material includes at least one "L" shaped corner 702 having two legs 7022, 7024. For
description purposes only, a plurality of bend markings 7026, 7027, 7028 and 7029 are shown on
the first sheet material. The leg 7022 of the corner 702 is bent at the bend marking 7027 away
from the reader of the specification, which transforms the first sheet material being substantially a
planar member into a 3-dimensional member. Bending along the bend marking 7027 forms the

                                                  10
first contact plate 5082 and the first connection plate 5084. The bending allows the first contact
plate 5082 to be detachably received in the first groove 4042 of the receptacle 400 substantially
vertically relative to the substrate 402. This achieves a compact and secure installation of the first
contact plate 5082. However, due to the size of the particular example receptacle 400, part of the
first connection plate 5084 below the bend marking 7026 is bent at the bend marking 7026 towards
the reader of the specification in order to match the profile of the receptacle 400, particularly,
allowing the part of the first connection plate 5084 to extend along the substrate 402 of the
receptacle 400 when the first terminal 508 is received in the receptacle 400. The first contact plate
5082 is further bent at the bend markings 7028 and 7029 to form the one or more bends 5088 in
order to fit in the first groove 4042. This enhances stability of the first contact plate 5082 when
received in the first groove 4042.
[041]   Figure 7C illustrates the second terminal 510, in accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention. The second tenninal 510 has a second contact plate 5102 and a second
connection plate 5104. At least part 5106 of the second contact plate 5102 is configured to be able
to effectively contact the second free contact end 5042 of the second pin holder 504 if the second
pin of the power plug is held by the second pin holder 504. The second contact plate 5102 further
includes one or more bends 5108 to enhance stability of the second contact plate 5102 when
received in the second groove 4062 of the second protrusion 406 of the receptacle 400. In the
present invention, the second contact plate 5102 and the second connection plate 5104 are formed
by bending a second sheet material having a second shape.
[042]   Figure 7D illustrates the second sheet material having the second shape, in accordance with
an embodiment of the present invention. In order to manufacture the second terminal 510, a
stamping or pressing process is applied to a conductive sheet material (for example. a copper sheet)
to form the second sheet material having the second shape, as shown in Figure 7D. The second
shape of the second sheet material includes at least one "L" shaped corner 704 having two legs
7042, 7044. For description purposes only, a plurality of bend markings 7046, 7047, 7048, 7049
are shown on the second sheet material. The leg 7042 of the corner 704 is bent at the bend markings
7047 away from the reader of the specification, which transforms the second sheet material being
substantially a planar member into a 3-dimensional member. Bending along the bend marking
7047 forms the second contact plate 5102 and the second connection plate 5104. The bending
allows the second contact plate 5102 to be detachably received in the second groove 4062 of the
receptacle 400 substantially vertically relative to the substrate 402. This achieves a compact and
secure installation of the second contact plate 5102. However, due to the size of the particular

                                                   11
example receptacle 400, part of the second connection plate 5104 below the bend marking 7046 is
bent at the bend marking 7046 towards the reader of the specification in order to match the profile
of the receptacle 400, particularly, allowing the part of the second connection plate 5104 to extend
along the substrate 402 of the receptacle 400 when the second terminal 510 is received in the
receptacle 400. The second contact plate 5102 is further bent at the bend markings 7048 and 7049
to form the one or more bends 5108 in order to fit in the second groove 4062. This enhances
stability of the second contact plate 5102 when received in the second groove 4062.
 [043]   Referring to Figures 5 and 6, the first connection plate 5084 is configured to be connected
to the active wire 102 of the power supply using a first connection member 514. The first
connection member 514 may include, but not limited to, an assembly of a first conducting loop
5142 with a first threaded hole 5144 and a first screw 5146 that may be tightened in the first
threaded hole 5144, using a screw driver to securely connect the first connection plate 5084 to the
active wire 102. The first screw 5146 may be accessed via the first circular hole 2042 after the
assembly of the power socket 100 and may allow a user to tighten or loosen the first screw 5146
and thereby the active wire, without having to disassemble the power socket 100.
 [044]   The second connection plate 5104 is configured to be connected to the neutral wire 104
using a second connection member 516. The second connection member 516 may include, but not
limited to, an assembly of a second conducting loop 5162 with a second threaded hole 5164 and a
second screw 5166 that may be tightened in the second threaded hole 5164, using a screw driver,
to securely connect the second connection plate 5104 to the neutral wire 104. The second screw
5166 may be accessed via the second circular hole 2044 after the assembly of the power socket
 100 and may allow the user to tighten or loosen the second screw 5166 and thereby the neutral
wire, without having to disassemble the power socket 100.
 [045]   The first terminal 508 and the second terminal 510 as shown in Figure 7A and Figure 7C,
respectively, may be manufactured using sheet metal operations. In general, sheet metal is metal
formed by an industrial process into thin, flat piece of sheet or coil. The sheet metal may be cut
and bent into a variety of shapes as per the requirement. Processes that may be performed on sheet
metal include bending, curling, decambering, deep drawing, expanding, hemming and seaming,
hydroforming, incremental sheet forming, laser cutting, photochemical machining, perforating,
punching, blanking etc. Manufacturing of the first terminal 508 and the second terminal 510 by
bending sheet material simplifies the manufacturing process and the electrical circuitry inside the
power socket 100. The present invention reduces the number of steps or processes required to
manufacture the first terminal 508 or the second terminal 510 as there is no need to join a separate

                                                  12
contact post with the contact plate. This reduces the manufacturing cost as compared to prior art
and enables a compact configuration as well as easy installation of the first contact plate 5082 and
second contact plate 5102.
 [046]   Figure 7E illustrates the third terminal 512, in accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention. As can be seen from figure 7E that the third terminal 512 is a strip of conducting
material with a short length for easy and cost-efficient manufacturing. Also can be seen in Figures
5 and 6, the third terminal 512 is connected to the third pin holder 506. Referring to Figures 5 and
6, the third terminal 512 is configured to be connected to the earth wire 106 using a third
connection member 518. The third connection member 518 may include, but not limited to., an
assembly of a third conducting loop 5182 with a third threaded hole 5184 and a third screw 5186
that may be tightened in the third threaded hole 5184, using a screw driver, to securely connect the
third terminal 512 to the earth wire 106. The third screw 5186 can be accessed via the third circular
hole 2062 after the assembly of the power socket 100 and may allow the user to tighten or loosen
the third screw 5186 and thereby the earth wire 106, without having to disassemble the power
socket 100. As showing in Figures 5, and 7E, the third tenninal 512 extends from the third pin
holder 506 and does not extend between the first pin holder 502 and the second pin holder 504.
This provides an advantage of substantially minimising a length of the third terminal 512. Such a
configuration saves material and thereby the cost. This also leads to simplified electrical
connections and less complexity.
 [047]   The material and the processes used to manufacture the first terminal 508, the second
terminal 510 and the third terminal 512 may be same. Desirable properties of the material may
include, but not limited to, good conductive characteristics, hardness, resistance to wear &
corrosion, ability to withstand high temperatures and formability. Other factors affecting the
selection of the sheet material may include, but not limited to, easy and cheap availability. The
sheet material may be, but not limited to., conductors such as copper and its alloys etc. Moreover,
the first conducting loop 5142, the second conducting loop 5162 and the third conducting loop
5182 of the first 514, the second 516 and the third 518 connection members may be welded/brazed
or soldered to the first connection plate 5084, the second connection plate 5104 and the third
terminal 512, respectively, for making efficiently conductive contacts.
 [048] Also can be seen from the Figures 5 and 6, the inner assembly of the power socket 100
further comprises a lighting device 520. The lighting device 520 may be connected between the
first pin holder 502 and the second pin holder 504 via conductive wires. The lighting device 520
is turned on if the power plug is received in the power socket 100 and electrical power is being

                                                     13
supplied to the power plug, allowing an operator or a personnel to be aware that the power socket
 100 is currently operating. The lighting device 520 may be, but not limited to, an LED light.
 [049]   Figure 8 illustrates the example of the power socket 100 in an exploded view, in accordance
with an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 8 shows each of the plurality of components
of the power socket 100 as discussed in the specification, individually arranged in an orientation
in which they are to be assembled.
 [050]   While in use, the active wire 102 is connected at the first connection plate 5084 of the first
terminal 508. the neutral wire 104 is connected at the second connection plate 5104 of the second
terminal 510 and the earth wire 106 is connected to the third terminal 512. The power plug having
three pins is received in the power socket 100. The first pin (active), the second pin (neutral) and
the third pin (earth) are received in the first pin holder 502, the second pin holder 504 and the third
pin holder 506 through the first hole 2022, second hole 2024 and the third hole 2026, respectively.
The first pin, the second pin and the third pin push the first free contact end 5022, the second free
contact end 5042 and the third pin holder 506 respectively to effectively contact the first contact
plate 5082, the second contact plate 5102 and the third terminal 512 respectively. This completes
the electrical circuit and power from the power supply is received via the active wire 102 connected
with the first terminal 508 and is supplied to the electrical appliance via the power socket 100. The
lighting device 520 lights up indicating electrical power being supplied to the power plug. While
the third terminal 512 connected with the earth wire ensures the safety (shock-proof transmission
of electricity) of a user in case of insulation failure.
 [051]   The present invention offers a number of advantages. Firstly, the present invention offers
the advantages of cost-effective and easy manufacturing and installation over the prior art as prior
art requires manufacturing a contact plate and a separate contact post which is neither cost effective
nor easy to assemble. Also, no additional conductors are required in the circuitry for making
connections between the contact post and the terminals for receiving power supply. Additionally,
the third terminal is connected to the third pin holder resulting in a shorter third (earth) terminal.
This offers the advantages of less material requirement and simpler arrangement of connections
within the socket as compared to the prior art.
