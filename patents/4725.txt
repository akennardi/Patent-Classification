        A SYSTEM AND A METHOD FOR DEPLETABLE, NATURAL ASSET
                   MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING AND ANALYSIS
[0001]     This     application   is    related    to     International    Application    No.
PCT/ZA2014/000036 filed July 21, 2014 which claims the benefit of South African
Application No. 2013/05515 filed July 22, 2013, all of which are incorporated herein
by reference in their entireties.
                                  Field of the Invention
[0002]     The invention relates to a system and a method for translating non
renewable, natural resources and reserves, such as mineral deposits, and biological
natural resources and reserves that are depletable through unsustainable harvesting
or biological reproduction, into inventory and stock items that are manageable within
an inventory management system, and generating inventory management system
transactions based on physical state and/or logical status changes of the resources
and reserves and the corresponding assets.
                              Background to the Invention
[0003]     Proper management and exploitation of non-renewable natural resources
and reserves and of biological natural resources and reserves that are depletable
through    unsustainable     harvesting   or   biological    reproduction,  require    proper
assessment of the state and/or status of such resources and reserves. For purposes
of this specification, the term "depletable" shall be used to refer to natural resources
and reserves that are either inherently non-renewable or are depletable through
unsustainable harvesting or biological reproduction, and the term "reserve" shall be
used to refer to the portion of a resource that is technologically or economically
feasible to exploit and shall be deemed to include a so-called "recoverable reserve"
or "proved reserve"
[0004]     Correspondingly, the term "mineral resource" shall be used to refer to
mineral bearing material of economic interest in or on the earth's crust, whereas a
"mineral reserve" is the portion of such mineral resource that can be mined
economically at present, while the cognate term "oil and gas reserves" would define
volumes of gas and oil that can be recovered commercially. Unlike the tangible
product inventory of a manufacturing company, many natural resources and
                                              1

1002078083
reserves are physically located underground or underwater or are spread out over
vast or inaccessible territories and can therefore not easily be inspected, assessed
or quantified, requiring estimates based on the evaluation of technical data that
provides evidence of the amount, volume or concentration of such natural resource
or reserve present.
[0005]       In the mining industry specifically, suitable technical data has its origins in
a variety of information toolsets available to and used by disparate, professional
mining technical disciplines. Such mining technical disciplines are typically classified
under      so-called    Geosciences,    Survey,    Planning,    Rock    Engineering,   Mine
Environmental, Mine Design & Schedule, Mining, Engineering, Metallurgy, Sales &
Marketing and Rehabilitation (green environmental) Divisions, with supporting divisions
such as Enterprise Strategy, Financial Management, Asset Management, Human
Resources, Safety, Health & Environment, Risk Management, Information Technology,
Corporate Affairs, Logistics and Material Management. The mining technical data from
these disciplines likewise could be reported in technical parameters for material based
values such as ore tonnages, slurry densities and mineral grades & recoveries,
operational based values such as power consumptions, geological based values
such as interpretation of major geological faults & loss factors, and other values such
as commodity prices, mine call factors, geological losses, mining overbreaks and
labor efficiencies.
[0006]       Historically,  mining  technical    data   remained     unamalgamated      and
untransformed into a globally standardized format that could render the data
substantially more available for further multi-disciplinary visualization and analysis. In
the mining industry, specifically, information management with such amalgamation
and transformation could provide for enhanced decision making based on an
understanding of the financial consequences of mining technical activity or
observation resulting in changes to the state and/or status of a mineral deposit and
thus to that of the corresponding mineral asset in the hands of its right, title or
interest holder.
[0007]      The modern mining industry has widely adopted enterprise resource
planning ("ERP") systems typically for integrating information from a range of internal
and      external       systems    across      the     entire    organization,    including
finance/accounting, supply       chain,   sales    and     service, customer   relationship
management, etc., albeit in models where the use of such ERP systems is largely
                                              2

1002078083
limited to aspects of the business that exclude the mining technical management of
the mineral assets. The ERP systems are primarily limited to financial and
transactional management of the business and related resources and the associated
supply chain, offering only nominal benefit to the core business of the mining
industry in general and, more particularly, its technical disciplines such as
Geosciences, Mine Planning, Mining, Mining Engineering and Survey, and their
related supporting disciplines respectively.
[0008]      Unlike ERP systems, mining technical systems based management of
mineral assets is typically performed within disparate, expert and usually proprietary
mining technical systems, applications and solutions, typically implemented with the
assistance of similarly proprietary application software, specifically designed to
service the discrete needs of specific mining technical disciplines within mining
operations. These systems and software typically provide a single expert discipline
perspective of a mineral asset, without integration to and amalgamation of data from
other separate mining technical disciplines related to the mineral asset.
The non-integrated nature of the mining technical systems and services domain thus
leaves significant areas, including mineral asset valuation, open to discrete
interpretation   by   different  technical   and   commercial    disciplines, generally
represented by a competent or qualified person within each, often disparate mining
organization.
[0009]      The lack of suitable systems and methods as well as the limited software
integration internationally between mining technical systems and ERP systems are
demonstrations of the technical complexity and disparate nature of the mining
technical systems domain and the fact that there are limited processes where the
activities from a mining technical perspective have a clear one-to-one relationship
with a financial or commercial transaction.
[0010]      The fact that modern mining companies only report on mineral resources
and reserves once per annum is a further demonstration of the technical complexity
and diversity as well as time consuming nature of the data collecting and
assessment process, often comprising of manually integrating and interpreting the
various technical data bundles from the mining technical disciplines and their
supporting divisions that describe the state of mineral assets. Decisions regarding the
application of capital to the mineral assets are accordingly impeded by the lack of
                                            3

1002078083
integration between the financial and mining technical domains, as is the tracking
and reporting against capital projects at a granular level.
[0011]      In this specification, the term "big data" shall be used to refer to a
collection of large and/or very complex data or data sets of a magnitude that is not
containable in or manageable with relative ease by common, traditional or on-hand
data processing platforms, management tools or processing applications.
                                  Object of the Invention
[0012]      It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a system and a method
for managing natural resources and reserves, particularly mineral assets, as
inventory and/or stock within an inventory management system through the
amalgamation and translation of mining technical data and related activities into
commercial transactions that are managed and executed within such inventory
management system and complementing such transactions through the translation
of related technical attributes into inventory or stock descriptors for analytical
purposes, in order to optimize the management of such mineral resources and
reserves and the exploitation of the specific mineral assets.

illustrated in Figure 2.
                                  Detailed Description
[0052]      The invention comprises of a system for and method of managing the
mineral asset in a mining organization by means of a so-called mineral resource
inventory system, whereby the mineral asset is managed as inventory and/or stock
in one or more implementations of a commercially available inventory management
application system.
[0053]      The mineral resource inventory management system and associated
process involve the integration of data from disparate expert proprietary mining
technical systems and applications and solutions designed to service the discrete
needs of specific mining technical disciplines within mining operations and the
amalgamation       of such data     into   a  single  spatially-indexed data  structure
encapsulating all spatial, design, descriptive and quantification attributes related to
the source data, providing a perspective that reflects a multi-disciplinary perspective
on any given spatial location.
[0054]      Figure 1, reflecting a process map key, shows the conventional IDEFO
modeling tool commonly used to produce a model or structured representation of the
functioning of a system and of the information and objects which tie that functioning
together. Typically, each sequential process 5 will have inputs 2, and value added
outputs 6, constrained by one or more controls 1. Each process is able to call 3 on
other mechanisms 4 to enable the process.
[0055]      Figure 2, reflecting a proprietary mineral asset inventory management
system model according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, describes the
sequential flow of mining technical information with value adding methods applied to
provide improved business decisions in the context of mineral asset management.
The Figure shows the extraction 7 of mining technical discipline spatial geometries
                                             10

1002078083
and attributes of such geometries that are potential modifying factors to the geology
from disparate expert proprietary mining technical systems and applications and
solutions. The Figure further shows the deconstruction of the dimension and fact
data contained within such disparate expert software applications and solutions,
based on a configurable selection 8 of such potential modifying factors, into:
     1. one or more spatial databases containing all spatial references, collections of
        space and shapes related to mining and applies a common spatial reference
        system to locate all spatial data within a common reference system; and
    2. a collection of all technical descriptions, annotations, features and properties
        data contained within the disparate expert proprietary mining technical
        systems and applications and solutions from which data are extracted,
        amalgamated 9 and translated to attributes that describe the collective
        disciplines' perspective on the mineral asset, contained within a collective
        amalgamated database.
[0056]      The amalgamation 9 of mining technical information performs a spatial
mining method based intersection 11 of all geometries in line with the configured
attribute boundaries specified for the spatial database and mining feature attribute
set 10 and introduces a spatial reporting constant 8, overlaid on the amalgamated
dataset and able to support a composite geo-x cube 12, which adopts a level of
granularity required to encapsulate the necessary level of reporting detail as needed
for any specific volume of responsibility.
[0057]      Figure 3 illustrates the method implemented in the determination of the
required granularity in a contiguous division of space to the level of granularity
required to encapsulate an element at the required granular spatial representation,
demonstrated in 29 through 33A, using any instance or combination of the platonic
shapes.
[0058]      Figure 5 contains a list of mining technical and support disciplines and
depicts potential inventory journal transactions that may result from technical
activities they may perform in their daily operational capacity in accordance with the
invention.
[0059]      Figure 7 reflects a mineral parameter meter, exposing many important
variables required to provide a routine and comprehensive understanding of the
interaction between mining methods and ore body. It caters for the routine
monitoring of identified resource and reserve modifying factors, tracking the relevant
                                             11

1002078083
parameters as any changes become known, assessed as to current acceptability
and related to historical trends.
[0060]      Figure 8 reflects a mining features database, a collection of features
contributed by multiple mining technical disciplines such as Geology, Mine Design &
Scheduling and Survey each with its properties and attributes, etc. Attributes can
infer characteristics such as confidence classification, tonnes, grade, volume of
responsibility, period of mining, etc., with relevance defined by the mining company's
requirements and reporting codes. Analytical possibilities are opened up due to
ability to utilize existing business intelligence tools and methods on inventory and
stock.
[0061]      Figure 9 addresses the core principles related to the manner in which
mineral assets are spatially handled, as the key to the amalgamation 9, translation
and creation of transactions to process as inventory journal transaction equivalents
of spatial geometry, with a stated level of attributed confidence. As more information
becomes available, changes to size and shape are acknowledged, and the
amalgamation of new information will result in a series of translations based on
intersecting geometries.
[0062]      The following is a demonstration of the manner in which spatial geometries
reflect the current understanding, based on the extent and maturity of information
available, as to the constitution of the mineral asset as it relates to the specific
geometry:
        Portion of mineral asset recognized as waste 60;
        Portion of mineral asset recognized as ore 61;
        Delineation boundary between defined ore and waste 63;
        Planned boundary for mining excavation 64;
        Mined out volume 65;
        Volume of mineral asset undergoing update based on new information 66;
        and
        Planned mining volume based on updated mineral asset knowledge 67.
[0063]      Figure 6 is a schematic representation of the manner in which modifying
factors 34 to 39 are introduced by the various individual parties/disciplines who
and/or which may have an impact on the overall confidence in terms of classifying
the potential to exploit the mineral asset. The system is aware of the permutated
                                             12

1002078083
cross-discipline impact on the mineral asset, the principle of which is explained
above.
[0064]     The permutated geo-x effect on resources and reserves is the net result of
the application of mining technical sciences to the sum of mineral asset knowledge,
including consideration of multiple geo-sciences together with consideration of
mining,    metallurgical,   economic, marketing,   legal, environmental,   social and
government factors, deemed as modifying factors which influence the confidence in
terms of resource and reserve classifications.
[0065]      Inter-operability  between  disparate expert     proprietary systems and
applications and solutions reverses the deconstruction process by extracting and
reconstituting both spatial and attribute data from the amalgamated databases into
the file format and structure required by the specific expert proprietary software
system or application or solution.
[0066]     The system interrogates the composite geo-x cube 12 at the lowest level
of applied granularity in terms of 29-33A, i.e. per geo-x block, within 55, 56 the
bounds and definitions 13 of the relevant regulatory reporting code 56 and extended
to include the company information requirements 58 required for further inventory
and stock analysis 57, based on books of standards 53 & 54 mapped as the filters to
the amalgamated attributes relevant to the mining technical disciplines, persisted 59
in the mining features database 52. The resultant attributes are persisted 59 as
inventory or stock descriptive and quantification data.
[0067]     The system contains a spatial database 10 and mining feature attribute
set, which implements a configuration capability as a mineral parameter meter that
sets firm perspectives on variables which are acceptable between specific bounds
40, relative to an academic mean 41. This includes parameters such as density 42,
interpretation 43 of major faults as geological loss factors, commodity price 44, mine
call factor 45, pothole losses 46, mining overbreak 47, labor efficiency 48, etc. This
relates to a configurable interpretation of mining factors that becomes a constant
through which translation occurs. This allows it to be configurable per ore body,
commodity or legal entity such as a company to align classification of inventory and
stock in an inventory management application platform to the related resource and
reserve reporting codes.
[0068]     The system derives a classification of inventory or stock through analysis
utilizing emergent 14 big data analytics technology at a geo-x block level,
                                           13

1002078083
interrogating the current state and status of the block, represented by a permutated
interpretation of the attributes in the amalgamated database, which describe the
features of the geology as mapped to the spatial constant 8, creating a data set from
which the detailed requirements for creating an inventory journal transaction can be
constructed.
[0069]      The system creates journal transactions for execution within an inventory
management system to place a reference to the specific geo-x block, based on the
classification of inventory or stock which is derived, in a storage bin location within
the inventory system along with associated attributes defined in 54, 55, 56. This step
relates to translating 15 a set of attributes and attribute information into a financial
journal transaction 16, passed to the inventory management application for
execution as the initial population of the inventory management application. Journal
transactions 16 are processed in one of five transaction types 17, and are extensible
to more if needed. This process, at take-on, is repeated for each relevant geo-x
block within the database.
[0070]      Figure 10 illustrates how the mineral inventory or stock storage bin
definition is derived, based on the common principles across the various resource
and reporting codes. The definitions for the matrix in diagram 10 are:
        Axis for increasing confidence of classification within mineral asset 68;
        Axis for increasing grade categories within mineral asset 69;
        Portion of mineral asset designated as in situ resource inventory 70;
        Portion of mineral asset designated as in situ reserve inventory 71;
        Portion of mineral asset designated as in progress reserve stock 72;
        Increasing grade categories 73 to 77; and
        Increasing confidence of classification categories 78 to 82.
[0071]      Storage bins are defined by considerations of mineral content quality
ranges and information confidence levels. While mineral content quality ranges must
suit the mining company's purposes such as determining commercial grade cutoffs,
information confidence levels relate to resource and reserve classifications as per
the relevant reporting code.
[0072]      Continuous real-time monitoring of the attributes within the amalgamated
database, at a level of granularity where a relevant attribute changes within a single
geo-x block, initiates a re-intersection of the related/affected blocks and an update to
the database through the process of 17 journal processing. Mining technical
                                             14

1002078083
disciplines that interact with the mineral asset in a manner that may affect attributes
that have an influence / impact on the mineral asset are listed in Figure 4, elaborated
in terms of their impact across the mining value chain as depicted in the open group
exploration & mining business process reference model.
[0073]     Based on the processing of journal transactions within the inventory
management application, the mineral resource inventory is populated, and one can
report 21 on mineral asset status at any level of granularity. Reporting principles are
subject to the relevant regulatory reporting code and company analysis requirements
18. Geo-x blocks are stored within inventory/stock storage bin locations in a
hierarchy that reflects the resource and reserve code based classifications from
lowest confidence 50 to highest, and lowest grade 51 to highest in any combination
dependent on the configured reporting code. Reporting takes into consideration
current and historical status records 20 and is aware of the latest reporting block
updates 19, which have been processed as journal transactions 17. The mineral
asset status 21 is updated by calling on each affected reporting block update 19 to
provide the current and historical status records 20 with regard to changes in the
mineral asset statuses.
[0074]     Intersecting the spatial reporting constant 8 with the current and historical
status records 20 (historical attributes) that had previously effected changes to the
mineral asset allows for a time based status (logical, e.g. specific grade) and/or state
(physical - e.g. faulting or mined out) analysis of the mineral asset and the ability to
interrogate the mineral asset in a time series analysis, which is introduced to
geological analyses in this invention. The system overlays the amalgamated
geological data over the reporting cube and derives the individual versions of mineral
asset change through reference and/or reconciliation to the original reporting cube
and subsequent attribute updates through expert mining technical systems and
applications. In this manner it handles history and the traceability and auditability
through retaining a full transactional record of how and where attributes changed to
effect a change in inventory.
[0075]     Resource and reserve reporting can now be performed on resource and
reserves 22 as attributed inventory and stock, up to date to reflect the latest 19
reporting block updates, subject to the attribute configuration relative to the book of
standards 8.
                                            15

1002078083
[0076]      The emergence of big data analytics technologies, and the future
technologies in this space, enables the ongoing real-time update of the mineral asset
inventory as changes are made to the attributes in the various expert mining
technical systems and applications and updated to the amalgamated database. The
system 26 accounts for the financial impact of changed states and statuses of
mineral assets using standard analytical tools and techniques 24, guided in design
by mineral asset accounting and valuation principles 23, leading to a clear
understanding of the financial consequences 25 of technical activities and allowing
the execution of reporting scenarios to enable 27 enhanced business decision
making.
[0077]      The system processes changes to the mineral asset within the mineral
asset inventory by iterating through the steps in the system and method, with the
exception that the focus is on changed attributes versus a complete re-population of
the mineral inventory, thus reiterating 28 the process as and when new activities and
information occur.
[0078]      The completely integrated process of the geo-financial integration is
illustrated in figure 11, comprising of the sub-processes of (a) amalgamation of the
aboriginal data, (b) intersection of the affected volume of interest, (c) creation of
journal transactions, (d) reporting on mineral asset status, and (e) accounting for
financial impact of changed status of mineral Asset.
[0079]      In an industry application, as reflected in Figure 11, the geo-financial
integration process is applied holistically, in accordance with the invention, reflecting
all the functions from the amalgamation of aboriginal data to accounting for the
financial   impact of changed       state and status of the mineral        asset under
management. The systems and methods being introduced are unique in the
integration that the invention brings about in the mining industry, crossing over
mining technical, financial accounting and administration boundaries in a broad
integration of known technologies and application domains, to create an objective
information source underlying the mineral asset and provide comprehensive
auditability and traceability of changes to the state and/or status of the mineral asset
in a real-time mode leveraging the emergence of capabilities to service big data
volumes with performance increased by orders of magnitude.

[0080]     Figure 12 is a schematic diagram of some of the physical componentry
incorporated in a computer-implemented system and method for depletable, natural
asset management, accounting and analysis in accordance with the invention.
[0081]     The computer-implemented system includes a non-transitory computer
readable storage medium (not shown), storing computer-executable instructions,
capable of extracting, amalgamating, translating and integrating big volumes of multi
disciplinary mining technical information/data from the disparate expert technical
systems and applications, including computer developed or generated data, into the
common, spatially-referenced database for use by the inventory management
application to provide integrated mineral asset management in the mineral resource
and reserve inventory of the preferred embodiment.
[0082]     The computer-implemented system effectively bridges the divide between
the complexity of multi-disciplinary mining technical information and the methodical
world of reporting, analysis, simulation and optimization through translating technical
interactions and observations in the relevant commercial context.
[0083]     The system further includes a non-transitory computer accessible extractor
100 as means for extracting the data. The extractor extracts the aboriginal data,
inclusive of its appropriate spatial geometries and mindful of the industry generic and
geological and mining environment specific modifying factors as they relate to the
regulated definition of resources and reserves for various mineral occurrences.
[0084]     The    system further includes a non-transitory computer accessible
amalgamator 101 as means for amalgamating multi-disciplinary mining technical
information. The amalgamator 101 transforms the extracted information into a
globally standardized format, thereby making the resultant data available for further
multi-disciplinary visualization and analysis, enabling accounting for the financial
impact of mining technical activity resulting in changes to the state and status of the
mineral asset.
[0085]     The    system further includes a non-transitory computer accessible
translator 102 as means for translating the amalgamated data, and hence the
corresponding natural resources and reserves, into inventory and stock items and
transactions manageable within an inventory management system. The translator
102 leverages real-time, big data computing capabilities in order first, to track over
time any changes in the source data, as contained in any of the mining technical
systems and applications and hence, any change in the logical status or physical
                                            17

1002078083
state of the related resources and reserves, at a granular, spatially indexed level,
and second, to translate such data changes in real time into conventional inventory
management transactions capable of being processed in an inventory management
application as commercial transactions.
[0086]     Retaining the available detail associated with multi-disciplinary mining
technical activities requires dealing with large mining technical datasets at various
levels of granularity. This is accommodated by use of the composite reporting
constant in its smallest geometric configuration containing the amalgamated
aboriginal data of interest.
[0087]     The system further includes a non-transitory computer accessible analyzer
103 as means for analyzing at least some of the technical descriptions, annotations,
features and properties data being configured within the mineral resource inventory
system for analytical and descriptive purposes, based on the requirements of a
customer organization.
[0088]     The analyzer 103 conducts activities such as reporting, analyzing,
simulating, optimizing and performing       analytics and modeling the impact of
interaction and observation by the various technical disciplines on the mineral asset,
as performed within business intelligence and analytics platforms.
[0089]     Timely supply of information for reporting and analytical requirements is
accomplished by leveraging the ability to process large volumes of data in an
efficient manner, employing current and future big data platforms such as in-memory
databases.
[0090]     The combination of well managed data and efficient processing is
fundamental to the successful translation from mining technical activities as
described by mining technical professionals to inventory transaction terminology and
format as understood by accounting professionals.
[0091]     Mining technical activity and observations of the mineral asset by any
technical and associated disciplines that effect changes to the logical status or
physical state of the mineral asset at any given spatial location can therefore be
executed against the inventory of mineral resources and reserves as inventory
orientated transactions such as accrual (mimicking procure or acquire transactions),
depletion (mimicking stock or inventory issue transactions), shrinkage (mimicking
theft or removal processing), ullage (mimicking write-off of stock due to waste or
                                           18

1002078083
damage, etc.), and move (mimicking simple relocation of stock without further
processing).
[0092]     More particularly, the invention translates mining technical transactions
from a wide range of disparate, proprietary expert applications into inventory
transactions through integrating data across the total mining technical systems
domain and amalgamates such data into a single source; then transacts all mining
activities within any commercially available inventory management application in
order to manage the mineral asset within the bounds of generally accepted best
practices. The invention enables both the commercial management competencies
and the mining technical competencies within a mining organization to collaborate in
the management of the mineral asset to its maximum value as if within a single,
controlled technology domain and chart of accounts. The invention enables
commercial modeling and scenario management through the application of standard
business intelligence tools and techniques to the amalgamated model.
[0093]     The invention also instantiates a discrete spatial constant against which
mining technical activities are translated to commercially oriented             inventory
transactions, thereby introducing an advanced level of objectivity into the valuation of
mineral assets.
[0094]     The invention further translates geological and other mining technical
activities impacting the mineral asset into conventional inventory transactions,
managed in any commercially available inventory management application, thus
introducing the ability to include the mineral asset in the chart of accounts of a
mining company. History of changes driven by technical activities is managed within
the inventory application and enables auditability and traceability and extends to
versioning reporting across timelines. The total lifecycle, technical and commercial,
can be audited from a single point and platform.
[0095]     The novelty of the invention thus also resides in the fact that it introduces
totally new systems and methods of amalgamating, integrating and processing
technical and financial data and methods of interpretation and, accordingly, novel
systems and methods of managing natural resources and reserves such as mineral
resources and reserves, including mineral assets, particularly from a technical and a
financial perspective. The capabilities introduced by this invention are of a sufficient
quantum to make a material and invaluable difference in the technical and financial
                                           19

assessment, reporting and valuation of mineral resources and reserves, including
mineral assets, and therefore of the corresponding mining companies.
[0096]     It will however be appreciated that many variations in detail are possible
without departing from the scope and/or spirit of the inventions as claimed in the
claims hereinafter, such as its implementation both as an application system and as
an integration of multiple systems as described hereinabove, and can also be
extended to implement as audit and consulting systems and methodologies, thus
adding value to the technical aspects of mining and financial auditing, as well as the
broader investor community and the management of other depletable natural
resources.
