                   IMPROVEMENTS IN BEVERAGE CONTAINER LIDS
 [0001]      The present invention relates to lids for beverage containers, and more
particularly, to decorative effects applied to lids of disposable take-away drink cups.
BACKGROUND
 [0002]      Disposable drink cup lids are purely functional items with little to attract the
interest, particularly of child consumers but also adult consumers of takeaway coffee and
takeaway carbonated beverages. Since the primary function of such lids is to secure the
beverage contained in the cups between purchase and consumption, they must be leak-proof
and do not easily lend themselves to the incorporation of any promotional give-away items.
To date the only option of including a branded message, promotional mechanism or
advertising material has been by the application of a sticker which has inherent issues of cost
associated with post production application.
[0003]       Disposable beverage containers are produced in huge numbers, Typically
disposable beverage containers are provided with a lid which clips over the container to avoid
spillage prior to consumption of the beverage.
 [0004]      The generally circular, flat central surface of such lids, potentially provides space
for indicia and imagery, either for the purpose of promoting a brand name or providing useful
information to a consumer. Typically, imagery to make the purchase of the beverage more
attractive is restricted to embossing of the cap surface or by applying a self adhesive label. A
disadvantage of the manufacturing process of known plastic lids is that this embossed
imagery is restricted to the colour of the plastic material in which the lid is moulded or
vacuum formed. Further the process of vacuum forming a lid or injection moulding a lid
typically tends to distort any graphics that were able to printed onto the lid material prior to
vacuum forming.
 [0005]      It is an object of the present invention to address or at least ameliorate some of
the above disadvantages.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
First Preferred Embodiment
[00059]      The invention provides for the application of an image to a generally circular, flat
central surface of a beverage container lid.
[00060]      With reference to Figure 1, a pre-distorted image 14 is applied 21 to a surface of a
substrate 11. The substrate is then subjected to a heating and thernoforming process 22
resulting, in this instance, in a shaped product 10 having on a top surface thereof a final
image 24. As elsewhere described in the specification the pre-distorted image 14 is distorted
in such a way as to allow for the distortions that occur in the thermoforming process thereby
to result in a true final image 54.
 [00061]     Now referring to Figures 1 and 2, the lids 10 are typically provided with a raised
rim 12 around the central surface 14, with a drinking orifice 16 provided in the rim. A
 peripheral skirt 18 is adapted to releasably attach the lid to a disposable beverage cup 20.

                                                -7
[00062]      Preferably, the image to be applied is printed on a substrate. In a further form, the
image to be applied to the lid is pre-distorted. Preferably, pre-distortion of the image allows
for printing the image so that once thermoforned, the images appear true.
[00063]      Preferably, the substrate comprises polymer material.
[00064]      Preferably, the polymer material may vary and different thickness can be used.
Examples of suitable polymer materials include, but are not limited to, high impact
polystyrene, oriented polystyrene, polypropylene, high density polyethylene, polyethylene
terephthalate and olefms,
 [00065]     Preferably, the inks used to print the indicia to be applied have properties to allow
them to resist cracking and image distortion.
 [00066]     In one form, the image to be applied to the beverage container lid may comprise a
single or multi-colour image.
 [00067]     In a further form, the image may be printed in lenticular form so as to present the
illusion of a three-dimensional image. Examples of suitable lenticular technologies that may
be used include, but are not limited to "two phase lenticular", Ultra 3D Lenticular, multiphase
lenticular, morph lenticular and zoom lenticular. The image printed on the substrate may
further include holographic images.
 [00068]     In another form, image to be applied to the beverage container lid may comprise
 information such as a promotional alphanumeric code or a "smart phone" readable bar or QR
 code for example.
 [00069]     In yet a further form, image to be applied to the beverage container lid may
 comprise a polymeric film having a removable scratch off layer.
 [00070]      Preferably, the substrate is purchased is sheet form.
  [00071]     Preferably, the substrate is purchased is roll form.

                                               -8
[00072]     In a second step of the process, the beverage container lid is then produced in a
thermoforming process.
[00073]     In one form, a positive thermoforming process is used.
[00074]     In another form, a negative thermoforming process is used.
[00075]     Preferably, the substrate with the printed image is heated to a softened plasticised
thermoformable state. Preferably, the substrate is placed over lid forming element. A vacuum
and/or physical pressure is then applied to generate the shape of the beverage container lid.
[00076]     Preferably, the image is printed generally on a circular flat central portion of the
lid.
 [00077]    With reference to Figure 3, there is illustrated various beverage container lids 20,
30, 40, 50 formed in accordance with at least one embodiment of the current invention. The
image printed on the lid may be centred and formed 30, 40. In an alternate form, the image
may substantially cover the lid 20, 50.
 [00078]     Preferably during the printing process, a special mark added to the substrate. In
one form, the special mark is used by the thermofonning process to match the lid forming
elements of the thermoforming. This ensures that the printed surface is lined up exactly so
that when the printed roll is thermofonned, it is accurately placed.
 [00079]     Referring to Figure 4, there is illustrated a template 60, Preferably, the template
 comprises individual beverage container lid sub-templates 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66. Preferably,
template 60 enables an artist to allow for distortion in the image and appropriately lay up the
 image prior to thermoforming.

                                                 -9
Second Preferred Embodiment
[00080]       A variation on the above described embodiments can include the application of a
tab to the lid with the lid having indicia applied to it as well or as an alternative to application
of the indicia to the main body of the lid.
[00081]       With reference to Figures 5 and 6, an augmented beverage container lid 10 for a
disposable beverage container 12 is comprised of a lid portion 14 provided at a periphery 16
of the lid portion with an integrally formed projecting tab 18. Preferably, though not
necessarily, the tab 18 projects outwardly from the periphery 16 with the tab lying
substantially in a plane defined by the periphery 16, as best seen in Figure 6.
[00082]          The tab 18 is a break-away tab, detachable from the periphery 16 of the lid
portion 14 by provision of a weakened junction line 20 between the lid portion and the tab 18
at the periphery 16.
[00083]          As best seen in Figure 6, junction line 20 is formed with a cross section of
thinner material relative the lid portion 14 and the tab 18. In an alternative preferred
arrangement, the junction line 20 may comprise a line of perforations extending along the
periphery 16 between the tab 18 and lid portion 14.
[000841          Preferably, the tab extends along the periphery 16 of the lid position 14 so as to
subtend and angle at the centre of the lid portion between 15 and 30 degrees.
 [00085]         The break-away tab 18 is provided with indicia 22 on at least its upper surface.
The indicia may comprise advertising material related to the beverage contents provided in
the beverage container 12, or may be in the form of a decorative pattern, but more preferably
will relate to some offer of benefit to the consumer of the beverage provided in the beverage
container 12. Alternatively, the indicia may comprise advertising material relating to
products.
 [00086]         The tab 18, by virtue of its being detachable from the lid portion 14, the tab
may be retained by the consumer for tendering to a sponsoring entity for example, for
redemption of the benefit indicated by the indicia on the tab.
 [00087]         As well known in the industry, beverage container lids for disposable beverage
 containers are thermofoined of a thin polymer material. To form the lid portion 14 into the
typical shape as shown in the cross section view of Figure 6, an initially flat sheet of a
 suitable polymer material is laid over a male mould conforming to the internal surfaces of the
 lid portion. The application of heat (the thermoforming process) then causes the polymer

                                                 - 10
material to soften and form onto the mould. After cooling, a cutting die is applied to cut the
periphery of the lid, separating the formed lid from the polymer sheet.
[00088]          For the augmented beverage container lid of the invention, the process is
identical except that in this instance the cutting die includes provision for the outwardly
projecting tab 18 and an arcuate element to fonn the weakened junction line 20 between the
tab and the lid portion.
 [00089]       The provision of indicia 22 on the tab 18 may be any technique common in the
art of printing indicia on polymer substrate, and may include any one of screen printing, ink
jet printing or offset printing.
 [00090]         In at least one preferred form of the augmented beverage container lid of the
invention, portions of both the lid portion 14 and the tab 18 may be provided with indicia.
 [00091]          In still another preferred form, the tab 18 need not be flat or be bounded by the
 geometric edges as shown in Figure 5, but may take the outline and shape of a celebrity or
 other well know figure for example. In this case the male thermofonning mould will include
 a raised patterned portion defining the underside surface of the tab.
 Third Preferred Embodiment
 [00092]      In this further preferred embodiment, the process of forming the lids proceeds as
 follows.
 [00093]      With reference to figures 7 to 9, in a thermoformed, image decorated takeaway
 lid production method, firstly sheets of either Hipps, PP or PS polymer are prepared in
 standard sheet sizes ranging from A4 to AO, in thicknesses ranging from 0.3 to 1mm. In one
 preferred process using inks that are food safety compliant, the art work that is to appear on
 the takeaway lids is printed directly onto the selected polymer sheets. If non-food compatible
 inks are used, the printed substrate is subsequently laminated with a clear polymer sheet to
 encapsulate the printing ink between the substrate and the clear polymer sheet.
  [00094]     In another preferred option, the art work is reverse printed on the underside of
  clear Hipps, PP or PS polymer sheets. This clear sheet is then laminated to a base polymer
  sheet. This further alternative process ensures likewise that the printing ink is secured
  between the base polymer sheet and the clear sheet thus eliminating any issues of food safety
  which may arise from the use of some printing inks.
  [00095]      The artwork as it appears on a still flat sheet after printing in either process, is
  distorted to take into account and counteract the distortion that occurs during the subsequent
  thernoforining of the lids. Included in the printing stage are images of registration marks to

                                              - 11
ensure proper alignment of the printed sheet with the thermoforming tool and die cutting of
the lids, as further explained below.
[00096]       The combination of printing a distorted image and ensuring registration with the
thermoforming die, ensures that the takeaway lids are formed with an undistorted, accurately
placed image on the lids.
[00097]       The actual printing may be by any known process, including web, offset, silk
screen, dye sublimation or digital direct to substrate. Of these the preferred process is digital
printing to a substrate of either Hipps, PP or PS, either directly or in reverse as set out above.
 [00098]      An important advantage of digital printing is that the images appearing on lids
can be varied as desired within a printing and thermoforming run.
[00099]       A further important element of the present embodiment of the invention is the use
of a printed sensor strip along one or both edges of the printed sheet. As a sheet progresses
through the printing, thennoforming and die cutting stages, sensors monitor the sensor strip/s
providing correcting information to feeding mechanism to maintain accurate registration of
the image with the thermoforming tool and the die cutting tool which releases the formed lids
from the polymer sheet.
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
 [000100]        Aside from the tab 18 providing a vehicle for indicia, it can materially assist in
the removal of the lid portion 14 from the container 12. Many users of take-away beverages
prefer to drink from the lip of the beverage cup rather than through the orifice 24 in the rim
 26 of the lid. This is sometimes awkward to do from a container full of hot liquid and the tab
 18 provides a useful grasping portion to manage removal of the lid.
 [000101]     The above describes only some embodiments of the present invention and
 modifications, obvious to those skilled in the art, can be made thereto without departing from
 the scope of the present invention.
