                          A CHONDRICHTHYAN REPELLING SYSTEM
DIVISIONAL APPLICATION
 10001]            This application is a divisional of Patent Application 2014273839 filed on 30
May 2014, the contents which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
 10002]            The following publications are referred to in the present application and their
contents are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety:
                   United States Patent No. 5,566,643 titled "Control of Sharks" (also published as
Australian Patent No. 669806) assigned to Natal Sharks Board.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 10003]            The present application relates to a chondrichthyan repelling system using
electrical fields generated by an electrical signal generator.
BACKGROUND
 10004]            Recorded shark attacks have steadily increased in recent times, while at the same
time the desire to offer conservation and protection to sharks has also increased as populations
dwindle significantly.
 10005]            It is known that all chondrichthyans such as predatory sharks have highly
sensitive electrical receptors called the "Ampullae of Lorenzini" located in their snouts. These
tiny gel filled sacs sense electrical current from prey, but only at very close distances, typically
less than one meter.
 10006]            Conventional shark repelling devices are arranged to generate a localised
electrical field that causes the ampullae to spasm and consequently the shark to move away from
the generated field.
 100071           A typical such conventional device includes a 2.2m trailing antenna provided
with two electrical contacts in electrical communication with the surrounding water, and an
electric field generator arranged to generate an electric field across the contacts of sufficient
intensity to produce the desired effect to the ampullae of a shark that is sufficiently close to the
antenna.

                                                    2
 100081           However, this type of shark repelling device tends to generate drag during use of
the surfboard, which inhibits performance of the surfboard.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
10076]            Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a chondrichthyan repelling system 100
according to one aspect described herein. At a broad level, the chondrichthyan repelling system
100 comprises at least one fin 10 for attachment to a watercraft (not shown). The fin 10 comprises
at least one electrically conductive electrode 11. The repelling system 100 also comprises an

                                                    8
electrical signal generator 20 for electrical connection to the electrode 11 of the fin 10 and for
generating electrical signals that will cause electrode 11 to radiate an electric field that will in use,
repel chondrichthyans as previously described.
 100771           It will be understood that numerous variations of this broad arrangement are
possible. In one embodiment, the repelling system 100 comprises a fin 10 comprising two
electrodes being first electrode 11 and second electrode 12. Each electrode 11 and 12 is in use,
electrically connected to a respective first terminal 23 and second terminal 24 of electric signal
generator 20. In one such embodiment, the electrodes 11 and 12 are disposed on opposite sides of
the fin 10 as shown in Figure 2 (electrode 12 is not visible in this view, being on the right side of
the fin 10). In this embodiment, the repelling electric field is able to be generated using a single
fin.
 10078]           In another embodiment as shown in Figure 3, repelling system 100 comprises
two fins 10 and 10', with fin 10 comprising first electrode 11 and fin 10' comprising second
electrode 12. In this embodiment, the first electrode 11 of fin 10 is connected to the first output
terminal 23 of signal generator 20 and the second electrode 12 of fin 10' is connected to the
second output terminal 24 of signal generator 20. In this view, signal generator 20 is shown to
comprise a pulse generator 21 and a battery 22 for powering the pulse generator. The function of
the pulse generator 21 will be described in more detail below.
 100791           In another embodiment as shown in Figure 4, repelling system 100 comprises the
signal generator 20 with two fins 10, 10' with each fin comprising two electrodes. Fin 10 has first
electrode 11 and second electrode 12 and the second fin 10' has first electrode 11' and second
electrode 12'. In this arrangement, each of the first electrodes 11, 11' is connected to the first
output terminal 23 of signal generator 20 and each of the second electrodes 12, 12' is connected
to the second output terminal 24 of the signal generator 20.
 10080]           In another embodiment as shown in Figure 5, repelling system 100 comprises
three fins 10, 10' and 10", with each fin comprising two electrodes 11, 12; 11',12' and 1 1",12"
respectively. Each of the first electrodes 11, 11' and 11" is connected to the first output terminal
23 of signal generator 20 and each of the second electrodes 12, 12' and 12" is connected to the
second output terminal 24 of the signal generator 20.
 10081]           In yet another embodiment, repelling system 100 comprises three fins 10, 10' and
 10" but in this embodiment, each fin has only one electrode. In the arrangement shown in Figure
6, two of the fins 10 and 10" has a first electrode 11 and 11', each connected to the first output

                                                    9
terminal 23 of signal generator 20, while fin 10' has a second electrode 12, connected to the
second output terminal 24 of signal generator 20.
 10082]           Any other suitable combinations are also possible, including the use of 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9 and 10 or more fins. In some embodiments, one or more of these fins will have one electrode
and in other embodiments, one or more of these fins will have two electrodes. In other
embodiments still, one or more fins will have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more electrodes. Any
combination of the above is also possible.
 10083]           In another aspect, the repelling system 100 is applied to a watercraft, to provide a
chondrichthyan repelling field around the watercraft. The repelling system 100 is applicable to
any watercraft which has one or more fins, or to which one or more fins may be attached. The
various embodiments described herein are described in the context of the watercraft being a
surfboard, however any other watercraft such as a canoe, kayak, raft, boat, ship, ski board or other
watercraft (even if they do not ordinarily have a fin) can equally benefit from the various aspects
described herein.
 10084]           Figure 7 shows a general arrangement of a watercraft, in this embodiment, being
a surfboard 30. Repelling system 100 is applied to the surfboard 30 as shown. In this
embodiment, fin 10 is attached to the body 31 of surfboard 30 by any suitable means (some
examples of which will be described in more detail below). Fin 10 supports at least first
conductor 11 as previously described. In some embodiments, fin 10 is already incorporated into
the surfboard 30 and is not detachable. Electrode 11 will then be applied to fin 10 by any suitable
means.
 100851           Signal generator 20 is mounted to or in relation to, surfboard 30 by any suitable
means, examples of which will be described in more detail below.
 100861           Figures 8A to 8D show different embodiments of connecting the electrodes
(illustrated using first electrode 11) to signal generator 20. In Figure 8A, signal generator 20 is
located above the body 31 of surfboard 30 and fin 10 is located below the body 31 and under
signal generator 20. In this arrangement an aperture or hole is provided through the body 31
through which an electrical connector 27 is provided to connect first electrode 11 to the signal
generator. In Figure 8B, fin 10 is attached to body 31 via a fin connector 14 (described in more
detail below), and electrical connector 27 passes through a different region of the body 31. In
Figure 8C, electrical connector 27 does not pass through the body 31 of the surfboard 30, but
rather runs along its surface to connect first electrode 11 to signal generator 20. In Figure 8D,

                                                    10
signal generator 20 is located underneath body 31 and connected to first electrode 11 via
electrical connector 27 underneath the body 31. In this arrangement, a suitable cover can be
provided over signal generator 20 to reduce any detrimental hydrodynamic effects of having the
signal generator 20 located underneath the body 31.
100871            Figure 9 shows an embodiment of watercraft or surfboard 30 with three fins 10,
10' and 10", connected to signal generator 20 (housed within a waterproof housing 32), and
connected to respective electrodes (not visible in this view) by electrical connectors 27.
10088]            Figure 10 shows another embodiment of surfboard 30 with two fins 10 and 10'
and shows a representation of the electric field 200 generated between the two electrodes (not
visible in this view) on the fins 10 and 10', with the water surrounding the fins 10 and 10' acting
as the conductive medium, when in use.
100891            Figure 11 shows a cross section of the surfboard 30 of Figure 10 along the lines
A-A', showing the connection of the fins 10 and 10' to the body 31 of surfboard 30. Also shown
is kicker 32 acting as the housing for signal generator 20 and grip pad 33 which can be used to
cover or incorporate the electrical connectors 27 to connect signal generator 20 to the electrodes
on the fins as described above.
10090]            Figure 12 shows an example embodiment of a specific implementation for
connection of fins 10 and 10' to respective terminals of the signal generator 20. In this example,
fins 10 and 10' are connected via electrical connectors 27 and via a conductive path provided by
fin plugs 40 as will be described in more detail further below.
10091]            Figure 13 shows a more detailed arrangement of an embodiment of connecting
the electrodes to the signal generator 20. In this embodiment, electrical connector 27 described
previously, is provided by three different electrical connectors along the path from the signal
generator 20 to the electrode 11 or 12.
10092]            As seen in Figure 13, first electrode 11 on fin 10 is connected to signal generator
20 via first signal generator electrical connector 25, connected to first output terminal 23 of the
signal generator 20 and via first plug electrical connector 44 provided by a conductive element
within plug 40, and via first fin electrical connector 15 associated with or incorporated within fin
10.

                                                   11
 100931           Second electrode 12 on fin 10 is connected to signal generator 20 via second
signal generator electrical connector 26, connected to second output terminal 24 of the signal
generator 20 and via second plug electrical connector 45 provided by a conductive element within
plug 40, and via second fin electrical connector 16 associated with or incorporated within fin 10.
 10094]           Figure 14 shows another embodiment with a similar electrical connection
arrangement, in which there are two fins 10 and 10', each with a single electrode 11 and 12
respectively. In this arrangement, first electrode 11 on fin 10 is connected to signal generator 20
via first signal generator electrical connector 25, connected to first output terminal 23 of the
signal generator 20 and via first plug electrical connector 44 provided by a conductive element
within plug 40, and via first fin electrical connector 15 associated with or incorporated within fin
 10.
 10095]           Second electrode 12 on fin 10' is connected to signal generator 20 via second
signal generator electrical connector 26, connected to second output terminal 24 of the signal
generator 20 and via second plug electrical connector 45 provided by a conductive element within
plug 40, and via second fin electrical connector 16 associated with or incorporated within fin 10'.
 10096]           In other embodiments, there may be no, or only one or two parts to electrical
connector 27. For example, where there is no plug 40, there will be no plug electrical connector
44,45. In embodiments where fin connector 14 extends to make direct contact with output
terminals 23, 24 of signal generator 20, and is itself a part of the electrode 11 or 12, there may be
no separate signal generator electrical connector 25, 26, no separate plug electrical connector and
no separate fin electrical connector 15, 16.
 100971           In the case where the entire fin 10 acts as the electrode, and is connected to
surfboard 30 via plug 40, there may be no separate fin electrical connector.
 10098]           According to another aspect described herein, there is provided a fin for use in a
chondrichthyan repelling system, wherein at least a portion of the fin is an electrically conductive
electrode for electrical connection to a first output terminal of an electrical signal generator for
generating an electric field about the fin that repels chondrichthyans. Figure 15 shows a broad
embodiment of this aspect, showing fin 10 with a single electrode 11. In Figure 16, fin 10 is
shown made entirely from an electrically conductive material such as stainless steel or
aluminium. In this embodiment, the entire fin 10 acts as the electrode 11. In the embodiment of
Figure 17, the fin 10 has a surface coating or sheet applied to an electrically non-conductive
substrate or base portion to thereby provide the fin 10 whose entire surface forms electrode 11.

                                                     12
 10099]            Figures 18A and 18B show opposite sides of the same fin 10, showing that the fin
 10 can support two electrodes to generate the electric field from a single fin. In this arrangement,
first electrode 11 and second electrode 12 are supported by an electrically non-conductive
substrate or base portion 13.
 100100]                    Figure 19 shows a cross sectional view of the fin 10 of Figure 18B along
the line A-A'. As can be seen in this figure, first electrode 11 and second electrode 12 are
supported by non-conductive substrate or base portion 13. Substrate or base portion 13 can be
made of any suitable material such as fiberglass or plastic, or any suitable composite that may be
used to construct surfboards.
 100101]          Another embodiment of fin 10 is shown in Figure 20. In this embodiment, a
conductive insert is provided for the leading edge fin tab where the grub screw of a plug (see
further below) will make contact upon attachment of the fin 10 to the body 31, to thereby provide
an electrical connection and provide the electrode 11. In this embodiment, it will be appreciated
that the fin connector 14 acts as the first fin electrical connector 15 to provide an electrical
connection to the first electrode 11.
 100102]           Figure 21 shows yet another embodiment of fin 10 with electrode 11, in which a
stainless steel leading edge is blended into the traditionally molded fin 10 to provide electrode 11.
 100103]           In another embodiment of fin 10, as shown in Figure 22, first fin electrical
connector 15 is provided by a metal insert shaped to conform to the shape of an existing fin
design, and to receive the grub screw of plug 40 as described further below. When in place, the
metal insert makes electrical contact with first electrode 11 at the leading edge of fin 10.
 100104]           In another embodiment of fin 10 as shown in Figures 23A and 23B, sheets of
electrically conductive material with bent tabs to receive the fin connectors 14, are placed on top
of the fin 10 to be in electrical contact with first electrode 11 and second electrode 12 to form first
fin electrical connector 15 and second fin electrical connector 16. As seen in Figure 23B, when in
place first fin electrical connector 15 and second fin electrical connector 16 are received in plugs
40 to provide an electrical path to the signal generator (not shown) through plugs 40.
 100105]           In yet another embodiment as shown in Figures 24A and 24B , fin 10 is
constructed with first electrode 11 provided as a flat sheet of electrically conductive material such
as stainless steel to provide an electrically conductive core 17, with tabs to provide fin connectors
 14 to connect to a fin plug (not shown). Two outer electrically non-conductive portions 18 with at

                                                    13
least one aperture 19 cover the core 17. The region of the core 17 under the aperture 19 is exposed
to the surrounding water in use, thereby providing electrode 11. The outer electrically non
conductive portions 18 are affixed to the core 17 by any suitable means including gluing or
molding.
 100106]          In some embodiments, there is only one aperture between both electrically non
conductive portions 18. In other embodiments, each electrically non-conductive portion has an
aperture, and in other embodiments, each electrically non-conductive portion has 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10 or more apertures, or combinations of the above.
 1001071          The finished fin 10 of this embodiment is shown in Figure 24B.
 100108]          In a further embodiment, a fin 10 of the form shown in Figures 24A and 24B can
be formed in which there are two electrodes 11 and 12 provided by respective electrically
conductive sheets forming respective cores. These sheets will be separated by a further non
conductive substrate or base portion 13 with non-conductive portions 18 with respective
apertures covering the electrically conductive cores 17. In this arrangement a single fin 10 will
have two electrodes, first electrode 11 and second electrode 12.
 100109]          It will be appreciated that the electrically conductive material used to provide the
electrodes can be any suitable material, including metal, stainless steel, aluminium, alloys and
other materials such as graphene and carbon fibre.
 100110]          In the case where fin 10 is detachable from watercraft 30, fin 10 can be attached
to watercraft 30 by any suitable means. One common means is to use a plug 40 as previously
described. One form of plug 40 is shown schematically in Figure 25. In this embodiment, plug 40
comprises a plug connector 41 (which could be a slot or a protrusion) for engaging with a fin
connector 14 (not shown) (which could also be a reciprocal protrusion or slot) to thereby connect
the fin 10 to the body 31 of the watercraft 30. Plug 40 also has a fixing element 42 (not shown)
(for example a screw (known as a grub screw) or a pin) for fixing the connected fin to the body 31
of the watercraft 30, and at least one plug first electrical connector 44 for providing an electrical
connection between a first terminal of the electrical signal generator (not shown) and the at least
one electrically conductive electrode of the fin 10 (not shown). In some embodiments the first
plug connector is provided by the fixing element such as the screw or pin. In other embodiments,
the first plug connector is provided by an electrically conductive wire 44 as shown in the cutaway
portion 43.

                                                    14
 100111]          In the embodiment shown in Figure 25, fixing element 42 is received in plug
fixing aperture 46.
 100112]          In some embodiments, plug 40 also comprises a second plug electrical connector
45 (not shown in this view) to allow connection to a second electrode 12.
 100113]          Figure 26 shows one embodiment of an arrangement for retro-fitting a surfboard
30 with the repelling system described herein. In one embodiment, the fibreglass top deck of the
surfboard 30 is pierced above the existing plug 40 to expose a plastic screw that is in place to seal
the thread made to receive the plug 40 from the resin of the surfboard body 31. The plastic screw
is removed and a conductive screw 34 is inserted into the fin plug thread in which the plastic
screw had been screwed. This now forms a conductive pathway from the top of the surfboard to
the metal plug 40 and to the grub screw 42 which will itself make electrical contact with the
electrode 11 of the fin 10 (not shown) when in place.
 100114]          An electrically conductive wire 35 can then be attached to the top of the
electrically conductive screw 34 to together, form the first or second signal generator electrical
connector 25, 26.
 100115]          Figure 27 shows an embodiment of a watercraft 30 (in this case a surfboard)
comprising a body 31, at least one fin 10 and a housing 32 for the electrical signal generator (not
shown). The housing in this embodiment is a kicker, which is provided on a surfboard to provide
a footing for the surfer when riding the surfboard.
 100116]          As shown in Figure 28, a flap 36 is provided to allow access to a cavity within
kicker 32 in which the electrical signal generator 20 (not shown) can be housed. The output
terminals 23, 24 of electrical signal generator 20 can then be connected to the first and second
electrodes 11, 12 on the one or more fins 10 by any suitable means as previously described.
 1001171          Any suitable electrical signal generator can be used, such that it will generate
electrical signals to a first electrode 11 and a second electrode 12 that will radiate an electric field
therebetween that will repel chondrichthyans. An example of one such suitable signal generator is
described in detail in US patent No 5,566,643 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
 100118]          In an example of suitable signals generated, the voltage pulses generated may
have a duration of between about 0. 1ms and 200ms, a frequency between about 1Hz and 60Hz, a

                                                    15
pulse rise time that is less than about 0.001 pas and a voltage magnitude between about 24V and
72V.
 100119]          In some embodiments, the pulses are produced in pulse trains, with each pulse
train comprising several pulses and each pulse having a duration of between about 0. 1ms and 2
ms, a spacing between adjacent pulses in a pulse train of between about Ims and 30ms, and the
pulse trains repeating at a period of between about 1OOms and 1000ms.
 100120]          Example voltage pulses 50, 52 produced by the electrical signal generator 20 are
shown in Figure 29A. In this example, the pulses are substantially square type with alternating
positive and negative pulses 50, 52.
 100121]          Since the system is often operated during use in sea water that has a lower
electrical resistance than fresh water, the signal generator 20 may be arranged to limit the current
produced by the signal generator 20 and thereby protect the circuitry of the signal generator 20.
 100122]          Alternative example voltage pulses 54, 56 produced by the signal generator 20
are shown in Figure 29B. In this example, the pulses are substantially saw tooth shaped. With
this arrangement, a lower amount of energy is imparted to the electric field generated in the water
than the voltage pulses 50, 52 shown in Figure 29A.
 100123]          In a particular example shown in Figure 29C, a pulse waveform that includes
alternating positive 60 and negative 62 pulse trains is shown. Each pulse train includes 3
substantially square wave pulses 64, 66, each pulse train is repeated every 200ms. Also, each
pulse 64, 66 has a duration of about 0.5ms, is repeated every 20ms and has a magnitude of about
48V.
 100124]          In a broad sense, the above has described a chondrichthyan repelling system for
repelling chondrichthyans from a watercraft having at least one fin, the repelling system
comprising an electrical signal generator for connection to at least two electrodes and for
generating electrical signals to cause the at least two electrodes to generate an electric field
therebetween to, in use, repel the chondrichthyans, wherein at least one of the electrodes is
provided by at least a portion of the at least one fin of the watercraft.

                                                    16
"including" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but

as, an acknowledgement of any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common
general knowledge.
