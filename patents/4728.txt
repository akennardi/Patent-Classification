   Detailed Description
15
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller having components that enable the
   implementation by the gaming system of advantageous
   jackpot awarding techniques. In one aspect, the game
20 controller is configured so that a jackpot is awarded when
   a defined number of columns of symbol display positions
   are completely occupied by jackpot symbols. In another
   aspect, the game controller is configured so that the
   value of a jackpot award is affected by whether the
25 jackpot symbols that caused the jackpot award include a
   jackpot multiplier symbols. In an advantageous embodiment,
   both aspects are combined.
   General construction of gaming system
30
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
35
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 8
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
 5 game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
10 architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
15
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
20 gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
25 skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
30 60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
35 outcomes.
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 9
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
 5 and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions             (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
10 The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
15 program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
20 or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory   and generating outputs   (for example on
25 the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
30 array  (FPGA).
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
35 displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
                                             10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 10
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
 5 mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.  Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
10 such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
15 example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
20 by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
   to insertion of the player tracking device.
25
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.          Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
30 panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
35 liquid crystal display.   The display 14 may any other
                                             10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

   suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display or
   the visible portion of an electromechanical device.                   The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
   same type as the display 14, or of a different type.

   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
10 The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.  Typically, the
15 gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
20 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
25 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
30 skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
35 controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
 5 included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
10 input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
15 devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
20 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
25 controller, central controller, server or database.                    In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
30 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                 The RAM
35 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
                                             10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 13
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
 5 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
10 gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
15 alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
20 operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
25 or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
30 The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
35 In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
 5 collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
10 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
15 most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
20 these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
25 computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
30
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
35 relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 15
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
 5 systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
10 accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
15 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
20 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
25 The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager which will be evaluated by the gaming system for
   this play of the game and initiates a play of the game by
   the gaming system. Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that a player's wager can be varied from game
30 to game dependent on player selections. In most spinning
   reel games, it is typical for the player's wager to be
   made up of a selection as to how the game outcome will be
   evaluated by specifying what parts of the game outcome
   will qualify for winning outcomes and a multiplier that
35 will apply to each winning outcome.  For example, a player's
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 16
   wager may be based on how many lines they play in each
   game - e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum number
   of lines allowed by the game  (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
 5 and an amount per line - e.g. one, two or five credits.
   Winning outcomes on an activated win line may be evaluated
   based on a pay table that specifies the amount awarded for
   a one credit per line wager multiplied by the amount
   wagered per line.
10
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
15
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
   outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a player's selection of pay lines.
20
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may selecting a number of reels to
   play. Games of this type are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and
25 are also known as "ways" to win games. The selection of
   the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel can
   be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
   display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
   at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
30 reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated, symbol display positions of the
   other reels. For example, if there are five reels and
   three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
35 symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 17
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
   the total  number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reels, the active display positions being all display
 5 positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
   reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.
10 In  the embodiment described below, the display positions
   of the symbol display are arranged in a rectangular matrix
   comprising a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows.
   However, other arrangements are known in the gaming
   industry and could be employed in embodiments of the
15 invention. For example, in some arrangements there are
   more symbols in some columns than others, such as 3-4-3-4
   3 arrangement of seventeen display positions corresponding
   to respective ones of five reels. In such arrangements,
   the columns of four symbols can be arranged so that they
20 are off-set or staggered relative to the columns having
   three symbols so that the middle two symbols in the
   columns of four symbols share boundaries with two symbols
   of each neighbouring reel.
25 In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
   code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that one or more of the modules could
   be implemented in some other way, for example by a
30 dedicated circuit.
   These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
   operates, in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
35 the game, to generate a game outcome which will then be
                                             10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 18
   evaluated by outcome evaluator 623. The outcome generator
   622 forms the game outcome using a symbol selector 622A to
   select symbols from a set of symbols specified by symbol
   data 641 using random number generator 621. The selected
 5 symbols are advised to the display controller 624 which
   causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set of
   display positions.
   One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
10 selector 622A to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets defining reel strips
   corresponding to respective ones of a plurality of
   spinning reels. The reel strips 641 specify a sequence of
   symbols for each reel. In an embodiment, each of the reel
15 strips is configured so that it has a group or "stack" of
   jackpot symbols. At least one stack of jackpot symbols is
   long enough to occupy all the display positions of the
   column of symbol display positions associated with the
   respective reel strip. In the example below, the stacks of
20 jackpot symbols are four symbols long and there are five
   columns of symbol display positions, each having four
   symbol display positions. At least one stack of jackpot
   symbols is composed of jackpot multiplier symbols, "JPxN",
   where N is a positive value greater than 1 (typically a
25 positive integer such as 2, 3 or 4). Different multipliers
   may be assigned to different stacks of jackpot multiplier
   symbols. In an embodiment, one or more of the reels may
   have more than one stack of jackpot symbols.          In such an
   embodiment, the different stacks may have different
30 multipliers or one stack may have a multiplier and another
   may not.
   In an embodiment, the symbol selector 622A selects the
   symbols for display by selecting a stopping position in
35 the sequence. In one example, four symbols of each of five
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 19
   reels are displayed such that symbols are displayed at
   twenty display positions on display 54 under control of
   the game controller 60. In another example, three symbols
   of each of five reels are displayed such that symbols are
 5 displayed at fifteen symbol display positions.            It is
   known to use a probability table stored in memory 64 to
   vary the odds of a particular stop position being
   selected. Other techniques can be used to control the odds
   of particular outcomes occurring to thereby control the
10 return to player of the game.
   Once the symbols are selected by symbol selector 622A,
   outcome evaluator 623 determines whether to make any
   awards based on pay table 642. In an embodiment, the
15 outcome evaluator includes a jackpot awarder 623A
   configured to determine whether the selected symbols
   correspond to an award of one of a plurality of available
   different jackpot categories 642A which form part of pay
   table 642.   In an embodiment, the jackpot awarder 623A
20 determines how many columns of symbol display positions
   are completely occupied by a stack of jackpot symbol.
   Different numbers of full columns of stacks of jackpot
   symbols are associated with different categories of
   jackpot awards.   Typically, each category of jackpot award
25 is given a name such as "mini", "minor", "major", or
   "grand".   In one example, different categories of jackpots
   can be awarded for between 2 and 5 stacks of jackpot
   symbols.
30 In another embodiment, different categories of jackpot
   awards may be associated with 3 to 5 stacks of jackpot
   symbols.
   In the embodiment, as described above, at least one of the
35 stacks of jackpot symbols on one of the reel strips is
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 20
   formed by jackpot multiplier symbols.   If one of the
   stacks that results in the award of a jackpot by the
   jackpot awarder 623A is a stack of jackpot multiplier
   symbols, the jackpot awarder 623A of outcome evaluator 623
 5 makes an award of the relevant category of jackpot
   multiplied by the multiplier of the jackpot multiplier
   symbols.
   Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method 700 of an
10 embodiment.   The method involves the gaming system
   receiving 710 a wager from a player and the player
   initiating a play of the game. The symbol selector 622A of
   game controller 60 then selects symbols 720 and the
   display controller 625 controls the display to display the
15 symbols in a plurality of columns corresponding to
   respective ones of the plurality of reels.        The jackpot
   awarder 623A of game controller 60 determines whether to
   award a jackpot by determining 740 whether there is a
   threshold number of stacks. If not, the jackpot evaluation
20 stops.   If there is more than a threshold number of
   stacks, the game controller awards 750 a jackpot category
   based on the number of stacks of jackpot symbols.                 The
   game controller 60 determines 760 whether a stack includes
   jackpot multiplier symbols. If not, the game controller
25 awards a jackpot 770 and the game ends 790.         If a stack
   includes a jackpot multiplier symbol, the jackpot awarder
   623A awards a jackpot multiplied by the multiplier
   associated with the respective jackpot multiplier symbol
   780 and the game ends 790.
30
   In some embodiments, an eligibility criterion may be
   applied by the game controller for the stacks of jackpot
   symbols to be available or for the JPxN symbols to be
   added. For example that the player has made a certain
35 sized wager, made an ante bet, selected all win lines,
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 21
   played sufficient games, or the player is a member of a
   loyalty program.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
 5 above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
10 description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
15 programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
20 As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
    (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
25 a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
30 instructions executable by the processor.
   Example
   In this example, jackpots are triggered in the gaming
35 system by "landing" stacks of Jackpot   ("JP") symbols. A
                                             10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 22
    stack "lands" when all symbol positions of the symbol
    display positions of a given reel are occupied by the
    Jackpot symbol. For this to occur, the Jackpot symbols are
    arranged in a group or "stack" on the respective reel
  5 strips.
    A "Mini" Jackpot is awarded with any 2 stacks of JP.
    A "Minor" Jackpot is awarded with any 3 stacks of JP.
10
    A "Major" Jackpot is awarded with any 4 stacks of JP.
    A "Grand" Jackpot is awarded with 5 stacks of JP.
15  For example: the symbol selection shown in Table 1 will
    award a Minor jackpot.
     P1  JP  A    JP  JP
     A   JP   K   JP  JP
     K   JP   P2  JP  JP
     J   JP   Q   JP  JP
    Table 1
20
    In this example, the symbol JPxN substitutes for JP with
    the added benefit of the game controller awarding more
    jackpots if a full stack lands coinciding with other JP
    stacks.
25
    N Mini Jackpots are awarded for 1 stack of JP xN and 1
    stack of JP.
    N Minor Jackpots are awarded for 1 stack of JPxN and 2
30  stack of JP.
                                            10245815_1 (GHMatters) P100580.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 23
   N Major Jackpots are awarded for 1 stack of JP xN and 3
   stack of JP.
   N Grand Jackpots are awarded for 1 stack of JPxN and 4
 5 stack of JP.
   For example: The symbol display of Table 2 will award N of
   the Minor jackpots.
    P1  JP  A    JP  JP xN
    A   JP   K   JP  JP xN
    K   JP   P2  JP  JP xN
    J   JP   Q   JP  JP xN
10
   Table 2
   In another example, more than one stack of JPxN may
   appear. The total number of jackpots awarded by the game
15 controller is be either the sum or product of the N's for
   each stack, depending on the embodiment.
   While these examples requires stacks to trigger jackpots,
   the JP xN, jackpot multiplier symbols, could be applied to
20 any symbol driven jackpot game where different conditions
   are used to evaluate whether a jackpot is awarded.
