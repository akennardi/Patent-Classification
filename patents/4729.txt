associated with abnormalities in intraocular pressure and/or tissue hydration, myocardial
ischemia, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, myocardial hypoxia,

                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]       Aquaporins are cell membrane proteins that act as molecular water channels to
mediate the flow of water in and out of the cells.        While there is some degree of passive
diffusion or osmosis of water across cell membranes, the rapid and selective transport of water
in and out of cells involves aquaporins.       These water channels selectively conduct water
molecules in and out of the cell, while blocking the passage of ions and other solutes, thereby
preserving the
                                                  1

     WO 2013/169939                                                          PCT/US2013/040194
membrane potential of the cell. Aquaporins are found in virtually all life forms, from bacteria to
plants to animals. In humans, they are found in cells throughout the body.
[0004]          Cerebral edema (CE) is a major contributor to stroke damage, as it can result in
increased intracerebral pressure (ICP), a corresponding decrease in cerebral perfusion, and
potentially permanent or fatal brain damage. Edema also contributes to CNS damage in, for
example, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, glioma, meningitis, acute mountain sickness,
epileptic seizures, infections, metabolic disorders, hypoxia, water intoxication, hepatic failure,
hepatic encephalopathy, diabetic ketoacidosis, abscess, eclampsia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
and lupus cerebritis. Patients surviving the period of maximal ICP, usually the three days
following a stroke or traumatic brain injury, are likely to survive. Unfortunately, only a few
treatment options are available for CE, and these are of limited efficacy.
[0005]          Hyponatremia, characterized by serum sodium levels <135 mM, is the most
common form of electrolyte imbalance with hospitals nationwide reporting an incidence of 15
20%. The associated fluid retention is symptomatic of heart failure (HF), liver cirrhosis,
nephrotic disorder, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
Various diuretics are used to treat congestion associated with HF. By inhibiting the Na/K/Cl
cotransporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle, loop diuretics cause natriuresis by decreasing
Na' and Cl- reabsorption from the urine. An alternative therapy for hyponatremia is the use of
vasopressin receptor antagonists, which inhibit water reabsorption by inhibiting the vasopressin
induced trafficking of AQP2. Unfortunately, both loop diuretics and vasopressin receptor
antagonists act indirectly toward a desired physiological outcome. An ideal drug would block
water reabsorption directly, thus minimizing potential side-effects caused by upstream effectors,
but no such drugs are currently known.
[0006]          Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizures occur
because of disturbed brain activity resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction.
Seizures may cause uncontrollable shaking and loss of consciousness but, more commonly, a
person experiencing a seizure stops moving or becomes unaware of what is happening.
Anticonvulsants may be used to treat epilepsy, however anticonvulsants are not effective for all
people with epilepsy.

      WO 2013/169939                                                         PCT/US2013/040194
[0007]          Ischemia is a condition characterized by an interruption or inadequate supply of
blood to tissues. Retinal ischemia occurs due to a deficient supply of blood to the retina.
Vascular occlusion, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy are associated with retinal ischemia and
can produce retinal edema and ganglion cell death leading to visual impairment and blindness.
AQP4 is expressed in the Miller cells in the retina. Due to relatively ineffectual treatment,
retinal ischemia remains a common cause of visual impairment and blindness.
[0008]          Myocardial ischemia is a condition caused by a blockage or constriction of one
more of the coronary arteries, such as can occur with atherosclerotic plaque occlusion or rupture.
Myocardial infarction, a heart attack, occurs when myocardial ischemia exceeds a critical
threshold and overwhelms myocardial cellular repair mechanisms designed to maintain normal
operating function and homeostasis. Myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality worldwide. Compounds effective in treating myocardial ischemia, myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure would be useful
pharmaceuticals.
[0009]          Phenylbenzamide compounds are known as pharmaceuticals. Phenylbenzamides
include compounds such niclosamide (5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2
hydroxybenzamide), an antihemintic agent used to treat tapeworms, but are not known to have
any effect on aquaporins. US Patent Publication US 2010/0274051 Al (the contents of which
are incorporated herein by reference) describe certain phenylbenzamides as being useful to
inhibit NF-KB via selective inhibition of IKK-P, while US 7,626,042 (also incorporated herein by
reference) discloses O-acyl derivatives of such compounds, while US 7,700,655 (also
incorporated herein by reference) describe certain phenylbenzamides as being useful to treat
allergic diseases. These patent applications, however, do not disclose anything about cerebral
edema or water imbalance (aquaresis) or aquaporins.
[0010]          In a 2004 paper, a group purportedly investigated the efficacy of N-(3,5-Bis
trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxy-benzamide in IKB phosphorylation blockade in a rat
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury model. Onai, Y. et al., "Inhibition of
IKB Phosphorylation in Cardiomyocytes Attenuates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury,"
Cardiovascular Research, 2004, 63, 51-59. The group reported some activity. However,
subsequently, the activity effect could not be confirmed and accordingly N-(3,5-Bis
                                                  3

trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxy-benzamide was not pursued for this indication in
humans.
[0011]       Prior to this invention, there are have been no known specific, validated inhibitors
of aquaporins, for example AQP4 or AQP2. Certain antiepileptic or sulfonamide drugs (e.g.,
acetylsulfanilamide, acetazolamide, 6-ethoxy-benzothiazole-2-sulfonamide, topiramate,
zonisamide, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and sumatriptan) were at one point reported to be possible
inhibitors of AQP4, but this later proved to be incorrect. Yang, et al., Bioorganic & Medicinal
Chemistry (2008) 16: 7489-7493. No direct inhibitors of AQP2 have been reported. The
search for therapeutically useful aquaporin inhibitors has been hampered by a lack of effective
high throughput screening assays, as well as by a lack of highly selective inhibitors to develop
and validate the assays and to serve as positive controls or binding competitors.
[0012]       There is a great need for improved approaches to treating and controlling diseases
of water imbalance, such as edema, for example cerebral edema, and water retention and
hyponatremia, as well as diseases such as epilepsy, retinal ischemia, myocardial ischemia,
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, myocardial hypoxia,
congestive heart failure, sepsis, and neuromyelitis optica, as well as migraines.

in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence
of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence of one or
more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereof.

[0033]           The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in
nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.
[0034]           Expression of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is upregulated in animal models of trauma,
stroke and water intoxication as well as around human malignant brain tumors. Aquaporin-4
(AQP4) has been shown to play a critical role in the development of cerebral and spinal cord
edema. AQP4 provides the primary route for water movement across the BBB and glia limitans.
AQP4 knockout mice, without the APQ4 gene, have improved survival compared to wild-type
mice in models of ischemic stroke, water toxicity, bacterial meningitis, and spinal cord

[0035]           Cerebral edema (CE) is generally divided into 2 major categories: vasogenic and
cytotoxic. Vasogenic cerebral edema may occur when a breach in the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
allows water and solutes to diffuse into the brain. It has been reported that AQP4-null mice have
increased brain edema in a model of subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggesting that AQP4 may be
required for the clearance of water collected in intercellular space. In contrast, cytotoxic cerebral
edema may be initiated by ischemia which results in reduced plasma osmolality rather than a
disrupted BBB. Ischemia may to a drop in ATP levels which is thought to slow the Na-K
ATPase pump resulting in an uptake of Nay and Cl through leakage pathways. The net effect
may be a cellular osmotic imbalance, drawing H2 0 into cells - astrocytes more so than neurons
and leading to increased ICP. Mouse models for ischemic stroke, water toxicity, bacterial
meningitis, and spinal-cord compression fall into this category. In these models, AQP4-null
mice have reduced CE pointing to AQP4 as the central pathway for water movement into the
brain during the formation of cytotoxic CE. However, cytotoxic and vasogenic edema are not
sharply divided categories; an injury that initially causes cytotoxic edema may be followed later,
e.g., within the next hours to days, by vasogenic edema. This may suggest different treatments
for cerebral edema at different times.
[0036]           It has been reported that propensity to epileptic seizures is related to relative
cellular and extracellular space (ECS) volume. Hyperexcitability and increased epileptiform
activity results from hypotonic exposure which decreases ECS volume, while attenuated
epileptiform activity results from hyperosmolar medium. Furosemide, which blocks seizure
induced cell swelling, has been reported to inhibit epileptiform activity in vitro and in vivo.
AQP4 knockout mice were reported to have lower seizure susceptibility to the convulsant
pentylenetetrazol and a greater electrographic seizure threshold when seizures were induced by
electrical stimulation in the hippocampus. It was also reported that AQP4 knockout mice had
more prolonged hippocampal-stimulation evoked seizures compared to wild type mice.
[0037]           AQP4 is expressed in the Miller cells in the retina. Studies have implicated
Miller cells in the pathogenesis of retinal injury after ischemia. It has been reported that AQP4
deletion in mice conferred significant preservation of retinal function and architecture after
retinal ischemia.

[0038]           AQP4 is reportedly found in mammalian hearts. It has been reported that AQP4
expression in the human heart is present at both the mRNA and protein level. Water
accumulates in the myocardium as a result of ischemia, when ischemic tissue becomes
hyperosmolar and attracts water from the capillary lumen. The water is transported into the
myocardial cells, for example, into cardiomyocytes. Reperfusion delivers normoosmolar blood
to the hyperosmolar cells, which leads to further cell swelling, which may even involve cells
outside the risk area. This water accumulation leads to a pronounced depression of cardiac
function, and aggravates effects of shortage in oxygen and nutrient supply. Myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury refers to damage caused by ischemia followed by reperfusion in the
heart. It has been reported that AQP4 knockout mice had reduced infarct size after both ex vivo
ischemia-reperfusion and after in vivo ischemia without reperfusion. It was concluded that the
AQP4 knockout genotype conferred increased tolerance to ischemic injury.
[0039]          Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease that
primarily affects optic nerve and spinal cord. A feature of NMO is the presence of serum
antibodies directed against extracellular epitopes on AQP4. It has been reported that most, if not
all, NMO patients are seropositive for AQP4 autoantibodies (NMO-IgG). It is thought that
NMO-IgG binding to AQP4 in astrocytes initiates an inflammatory cascade and the consequent
neuroinflammation and myelin loss produce neurological deficits. Blocking binding of those
antibodies to AQP4 could prevent the initiation of the inflammatory cascade.
[0040]           In one embodiment, the invention provides methods of treating edema mediated
by aquaporin, e.g., AQP4, wherein the edema is consequent to hypoxia, e.g., general systemic
hypoxia, e.g., hypoxia caused by an interruption of blood perfusion, for example wherein the
edema is cerebral edema consequent to hypoxia caused by cardiac arrest, stroke, or other
interruption of blood perfusion to the brain, or wherein the edema is cardiac edema consequent to
cardiac ischemia or other interruption of blood flow to the heart. Hypoxia can lead to
development of metabolic acidosis (e.g. lactic acidosis), which in turn leads to edema, and the
edema itself can then reduce blood perfusion, leading to cell death and poorer outcomes,
particularly in tissues where swelling is physically constrained, for example within the skull or
within the pericardium. This hypoxia is believed to be why, for example, patients who have
been rescued from cardiac arrest may subsequently exhibit brain swelling, as well as damage to
the cardiac tissue. Blocking aquaporin channels, e.g., AQP4, e.g., by administering an

aquaporin-inhibiting compound as described herein, inhibits or controls this edema, thereby
limiting further damage to the affected tissue.
[0041]           Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is the primary route of water movement at the collecting
duct in the kidney. Blocking this water channel would lower water reabsorption without
incurring electrolyte imbalances or interfering with vasopressin receptor-mediated signaling.
Evidence that an AQP2 blocker would not produce electrolyte imbalances, and instead be an
effective treatment for hyponatremia, comes from patients with diabetes insipidus who lack
functional AQP2. They exhibit chronic aquaresis but - if normal hydration is maintained - do
not demonstrate any other consequence of their long term loss of AQP2 function.
[0042]           The invention thus provides the use of aquaporin inhibitors in controlling diseases
or conditions of water imbalance, including edema, particularly edema of the brain and spinal
cord, e.g., following trauma or ischemic stroke, as well as the edema associated with glioma,
meningitis, acute mountain sickness, epileptic seizures, infections, metabolic disorders, hypoxia,
water intoxication, hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, and diabetic ketoacidosis by
inhibiting water uptake through the BBB, and also useful in treating and controlling
hyponatremia and excessive fluid retention, by inhibiting water uptake at the kidneys. This
invention also provides the use of aquaporin inhibitors in controlling diseases or conditions
including epilepsy, retinal ischemia and other diseases of the eye associated with abnormalities
in intraocular pressure and/or tissue hydration, myocardial ischemia, myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, myocardial hypoxia, congestive heart failure,
sepsis, neuromyelitis optica, and migraines.

EXAMPLE 1 - Phenylbenzamide-AQP Structure-Activity Relationship
[0066]          Structure activity relationships (SARs) are determined by assaying analogues of
selected hits to guide chemistry for the preparation of new molecules to be tested for improved
potency. For this iterative process we use a quantitative kinetic assay - the Aquaporin-Mediated
Cell Volume Change Assa - in a 96-well multiplate reader. It detects changes in light scattering
by a monolayer of CHO cells expressing the desired AQP as they shrink when exposed to
hypertonic solution (300 mOsm -> 530 mOsm). Figure 1 depicts the aquaporin-mediated cell
volume change assay with AQP4 expressing cells (Figure 1A) and AQP2 expressing cells
(Figure IB). The cells expressing aquaporins shrink more rapidly than control cells, due to
enhanced water flow, which shrinkage can be inhibited by a compound that inhibits the
aquaporin.

      WO 2013/169939                                                          PCT/US2013/040194
[0067]           In Figure 1, aquaporin-expressing cells are shown in the presence of DMSO
(triangles) or in the presence of the test compound (here, Compound 3) at 10 piM (squares), along
with CHO-CD81 expressing control cells in the presence of DMSO (diamonds). Each curve
represents an average of 16 wells in the 96-well plate.
[0068]           In Figure 1A, when the AQP4b cells treated with DMSO are exposed to
hypertonic shock, the cells show rapid shrinking, giving a rise in light scattering (increasing
relative change in absorbance, Abs/Abso) followed by a decay as cells detach from the plate.
The CHO-AQP4b cell line shows a 4.5-fold increase in the rate of shrinking compared to CHO
CD81 control cells (fitted to a double exponential model). CHO-AQP4b cells treated with the
Compound 3 analogue at 10 piM (squares) show a slower rate of shrinking (55% inhibition) as
seen by characteristic 'unbending' of the light scattering curve. Similarly, Figure 1B depicts an
experiment comparing CHO-AQP2 treated with DMSO or with Compound 3 at 10 piM.
Aquaporin-2 has a lower intrinsic water permeability than AQP4 as observed here. CHO-AQP2
cell lines treated with DMSO (Figure 1B, triangles) show a 1.7-fold increase in the rate of
shrinking compared to CHO-CD81 control cells (diamonds) also treated with DMSO (fitted to a
double exponential model) (Figure IB). CHO-AQP2 cells treated with Compound 3 at 10 piM
(squares) show a slower rate of shrinking (810% inhibition), when comparing the relative change
in Abs (Abs/Abso) (Figure 1B).
[0069]           The data indicates that in this assay, Compound 3 is capable of significantly
inhibiting AQP2 and AQP4 activity, e.g. by greater than 50%, at concentrations of 10 piM.
EXAMPLE 2 - Aquaporin Specificity of the phenylbenzamide compounds
[0070]           The specificity of the compounds is tested against the most closely related of the
13 known aquaporins: AQP1, AQP2, AQP5 and both splice variants of AQP4 (A and B). A
stable CHO cell line is created for each of the above aquaporins and the inhibition of water
permeability using the Aquaporin-Mediated Cell Volume Change Assay with 10 ptM Compound
3 is tested. Compound 3 inhibits AQP2 and 4, while it poorly inhibits AQP1 and 5 (Figure 2).

[0071]           To support the mechanism of action by which phenylbenzamides directly block
AQP4, we perform in vitro binding studies using purified AQP4b and Compound 4 radiolabeled
with 3H. Using a Hummel-Dryer style assay, a gel filtration column is equilibratrated with
buffer containing detergent, to maintain solubility of AQP4b, and 1 iM [3 H]-Compound 4.
AQP4b is diluted to 250 iM in this column buffer and incubated at RT for 30 min. The sample
is then applied to the column, fractions collected and the presence of [3H]-Compound 4 detected
by liquid scintillation counting. Figure 3 shows the elution profile of [3H]-Compound 4 from the
gel filtration column with the elution positions of tetrameric and monomeric AQP4b indicated.
The rise in [3H]-Compound 4 from a baseline value of 1 iM represents binding to each of these
proteins. Although no monomeric AQP4b can be readily detected in our highly purified AQP4b
by conventional means, this assay reveals the presence of a small, albiet vanishing, amount of
monomer. The relative affinities for Compound 4 are ~100 piM and less than 1 iM for tetramer
and monomer, respectively. This assay shows relatively weak binding of Compound 4 to
solubilized AQP4b; nevertheless, it clearly demonstrates that this phenylbenzamide directly
interacts with AQP4b.
EXAMPLE 4 - Pharmacological Proof-of-Concept
[0072]           Mouse Water Toxicity Model - Survival Curves: The in vivo efficacies of the
compounds are tested using the mouse water toxicity model, where a mouse is injected with
water at 20% of its body weight. Manley, G. T. et al. Aquaporin-4 deletion in mice reduces
brain edema after acute water intoxication and ischemic stroke. Nat Med 6, 159-163 (2000);
Gullans, S. R. & Verbalis, J. G. Controlof brain volume during hyperosmolar and hypoosmolar
conditions. Annual Review of Medicine 44, 289-301 (1993). The resulting euvolemic
hyponatremia rapidly leads to CE, making this a practical model to test an inhibitor of the CNS
aquaporin, AQP4b.
[0073]           The ability of mice to survive H 2 0 toxicity is determined in three experiments
using 10-12 mice each (16-19 weak old male/female). Deionized water is prepared for injection
with either 0.39 mg/kg phenylbenzamide (placebo) or 0.76 mg/kg with test compound. Figure 4

survival of the Compound 1 cohorts improves 3.2 fold and the time to 50% survival for animals
treated with Compound 1 is improved by roughly 52 min.
[0074]           Mouse Water Toxicity Model - Brain Water Content: Compounds are also tested
for the ability to reduce CE in mice exposed to the water shock by examining brain water
content. Mice are treated with a water bolus as described above, then sacrificed at 30 minutes.
Brain water content is assessed by fresh/dry weight ratio, i.e. the brains are weighed immediately
then desiccated in an oven at 100 C for 24h and dry weights measured (brain water percentage      =
100 x dry weight/fresh weight). At 30 minutes, mice treated with 0.76 mg/kg and 7.6 mg/kg
Compound 1 show an 11.2% and 15.9% reduction in CE, respectively (Figure 5).
[0075]           Mouse Water Toxicity Model - Brain Volume by Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI): MRI is used to measure changes in brain volume in response to water shock, using the
water toxicity model. As described for the survival and brain water content studies above, mice
are injected, IP, with a water bolus alone or water bolus and test compound at 0.76 mg/kg, and
changes in brain volume as detected by MRI are monitored. Mouse brain volumes are assessed
using MRI scans collected with a 9.4T Bruker Biospec MRI scanner at the Case Center for
Imaging Research at Case Western Reserve University. This imaging method is found to
provide sufficient contrast and resolution to sensitively detect changes in total brain volume in
the mouse water toxicity model for cerebral edema. High resolution T2-weighted sagittal scans
(resolution  = 0.1mm x 0.1mm x 0.7mm) of the mouse head are obtained prior to water injection,
5.67 min post water injection, and then every 5.2 minutes until the animal expires from the water
loading. Each scan contains twenty-five 0.7 mm contiguous imaging slices of which 14-15 slices
contain a portion of the brain. The cross sectional area of the brain in each imaging slice is
measured by manual region-of-interest selection using ImageJ. Brain volumes are then
calculated for each scan by summing the individual cross sectional brain areas and multiplying
by the slice thickness (0.7 mm).
[0076]           Treatment with Compound 1 at 0.76 mg/kg reduces the rate of CE development
from 0.081 to 0.032 min-' (or 2.5-fold) fit to a single exponential model (Figure 6). Also, the
extent of CE during the period of observation is reduced (Figure 6). Moreover, plasma levels in
the same assay are found to range between 0.03-0.06 [tg as determined by LC-MS/MS
                                                  60

(performed at Lerner Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) and are sufficient to show
efficacy in this model for CE.
 [0077]           The brain volume by magnetic resonance imaging experiment is also conducted
with phenylbenzamide (0.39 mg/kg) and Compound 4 (0.83 mg/kg). Compound 4 reduces the
rate of CE development from 0.081 to 0.022 min-' (Table 1). Phenylbenzamide fails to show
reduction in the rate of CE in mice (Table 1).

EXAMPLE 5 - High throughput screening assay
 [0078]           Under hypotonic shock, both untransfected cells and cells expressing an unrelated
transmembrane protein (CD8 1, at levels equivalent to AQP4b) swell slowly but remain intact.
These observations are used to develop our high-throughput screening assay (HTS).
 10079]           After hypotonic shock in a 384 well plate format, we return osmolality to normal
(300 mOSM) by adding 2x concentrated phosphate buffered saline supplemented to 2 pM with a
nonfluorescent acetoxymethyl derivative of calcein (calcein-AM) to each well. Intact cells take
up calcein-AM and convert it to the fluorescent dye calcein-giving a quantitative measure of
the remaining intact cells. Burst cells do not convert the precursor to the dye. Water uptake by
AQP4-expressing cells is relatively rapid, with most test cells bursting within 4 min of hypotonic
shock, whereas most cells expressing CD8 1 remain viable after 8 min. Intracellular conversion
of calcein-AM provides a strong and easily detectable signal at 535 nM in our assay (Figure 7).

reach 100% confluence. Culture medium was replaced with H 2 0 for 5:30 min (osmotic shock).
Osmolality is then normalized with the addition of 2x PBS plus 2 gM calcein-AM. Cells are
then incubated at 37'C for an additional 30 min and fluorescence measured on a plate-reader.
Rows 1-22 are seeded with CHO-AQP4 cells, and rows 23-24, with CHO-CD81 cells (384 well
plate). Note, all plate edges are discarded. Relative Fluorescence Intensity is calculated as the
fluorescence intensity (FI) of each well divided by the mean FI of AQP4 cells treated with
DMSO (control). Criteria for a successful assay: coefficients of variation (CVs) < 15%, and Z
factors > 0.5. Statistical analysis shows that 5.5 min of osmotic shock provides the optimal
signal-to-noise ratio.

[00811          As will be observed, the signal for the CD81 cells is ca. 5x higher than the signal
for the APQ4 cells, because by 5.5 mins, most of the AQP4 cells have burst, while most of the
CD81 cells remain intact. Inhibition of AQP4 would therefore be expected to provide a higher
signal, more like the CD81 cells.
[0082]          This assay is applied in a pilot screen of the MicroSource GenPlus 960 and the
Maybridge DiversityTM 20k libraries (approximately 21,000 compounds tested, each compound
at 10-20 gM).
[0083]          From this assay, a specific chemical series is identified, phenylbenzamides, which
represents 3 out of the top 234 hits.
[0084]          Hits from the HTS are validated using the same assay using a different plating
arrangement. In Figure 8, we show this validation assay used to examine Compound 3. Cells
are seeded in a 96 well multiplate format with the plates edges omitted (lanes 1 and 24) and an
entire column (n= 16) is used to test the ability of a compound to block AQP4-mediated cell
bursting upon H 2 0 shock. CHO cells expressing CD81 are seeded in lanes 2-3 as a control, and
CHO cells expressing AQP4, in lanes 4-23. Cells are treated with 0.1% DMSO in 10% FBS,

DMEM (even numbered columns) or 10 gM Compound 1 (odd number columns) in 0.1%
DMSO, 10% FBS, DMEM for 30 minutes. The cells are shocked with H 2 0 for 5:30 minutes,
then osmolality returned to 300 mOSM in the presence of 1 gM calcein-AM, as described above.
The cells are incubated at 37 0 C for 30 minutes and the relative fluoresence measured (ex 495/em
535 nM) on a fluoresence multiplate reader. The data in Figure 8 represents the average relative
fluoresence units (RFU  SEM, n=16).
EXAMPLE 6 - Water Toxicity Model for CE: Intracranial Pressure (ICP)
[0085]          ICP is monitored using a Samba 420 Sensor, pressure transducer, with a Samba
202 control unit (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). This ICP monitoring system consists of a
0.42 mm silicon sensor element mounted on an optical fiber. A 20-gauge syringe needle is
implanted through the cisterna magna to a depth of ~1 cm. The needle then acts as a guide for
insertion of the Samba Sensor and the site of implantation and the open end of the needle are
sealed with 100% silicone sealant. A baseline ICP reading is established followed by a water
bolus IP injection (20% weight of animal) with or without Compound 1. ICP is monitored until
the animal expires from the water load.
[0086]          Adjusting for the slight rise in ICP observed in the animals when they are
monitored without the water bolus injection (Figure 9, No Water Toxicity), Compound 1 at 0.76
mg/kg reduces the relative rate of ICP rise by 36%, from 3.6 x 10-3 min-' to 2.3 x 10-3 min-' (n =
6 mice/treatment, mean+SEM).
EXAMPLE 7 - Conversion of Compound 5 to Compound 1
[0087]          Plasma or serum levels of Compound 1 are measured by LC-MS/MS at the Mass
Spectrometry II Core facility at the Lerner Research Institute of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
Measurements are taken at 15 minutes and 24 hours after a 10 mg/kg i.p. loading dose and 1
mg/ml at 8 lil/h maintenance dose (delivered by an Alzet i.p. osmotic pump, Durect Corp.,
Cupertino, CA) of Compound 5 (n = 5 mice/time point, mean+SEM) (Figure 10). After initial
processing to remove proteins (75% acetonitrile extraction), Compound 3 is introduced to
improve quantitation using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Samples are analyzed by
tandem LC-MS/MS using C 18 reversed-phase chromatography and mass analysis with a triple
                                                   63

      WO 2013/169939                                                        PCT/US2013/040194
quadrapole mass spectrometer. The LC method is sufficient to separate Compound 1 from
Compound 3 and subsequent MRM gave reliable quantitation with a linear response from 0.004
0.4 ng of Compound 1 for its most abundant daughter ion. The dashed line in Figure 10 is the
relative effective plasma concentration of Compound 1 observed in the mouse water toxicity
model. Inclusion of an Alzet osmotic pump (Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA) containing
Compound 5 in the peritoneum was sufficient, in conjunction with an initial loading dose, to
sustain Compound 1 above the expected efficacious plasma concentration of 20 ng/ml for 24
hours (Figure 10).
[0088]           The solubility of Compound 1 in water is 3.8 [tg/ml. The solubility of Compound
5 in water is 1 mg/ml. Initial experiments show rapid bioconversion of Compound 5 to
Compound 1 when added to mouse plasma in vitro. Less than 5 minutes at 20'C is sufficient to
render Compound 5 undetectable. In addition, Compound 1 is undetectable in plasma samples
taken from mice injected IP with Compound 5. Instead, Compound 1 is detected at a
concentration consistent with good bioavailability and near-complete conversion of Compound
5. With compound 5, doses of 10 mg/kg and IP injection volumes in saline (0.5 ml for a 30 g
mouse), that give serum concentrations of Compound 1 in excess of 400 ng/ml (Figure 10) can
be used. Key PK parameters for Compound 5 are: rate of absorption 0.12 min-'; rate of
elimination 0.017 min-1.
EXAMPLE 8 - Animal Stroke Model
[0089]           Most ischemic strokes (~ 80%) occur in the region of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). To mimic this injury in mice, an intraluminal monofilament model of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) is used. Occlusion is achieved by inserting a surgical filament into the
external carotid artery (ECA) and threading it forward into the internal carotid artery (ICA) until
the tip blocks the origin of the MCA. The resulting cessation of blood flow gives rise to
subsequent brain infarction in the MCA territory (Longa, E.Z. et al., Reversible Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion Without Craniectomv in Rats, Stroke, 20, 84-91 (1989)). This technique is
used to study a temporary occlusion in which the MCA was blocked for one hour. The filament
is then removed allowing reperfusion to occur for 24 hours before the animal's brain was imaged
using T2-weighted scans in a 9,4T Bruker MRI scanner at the Case Center for Imaging Research
(Figure 11). Figure 11 shows a single slice from a T2-weighted MR image depicting the center

shift in the MCAo brain due to cerebral ederma. Solid line highlights the region of infarct in the
MCAo brain.
[0090]          Survival - Mice are treated with Compound 5 using a 2 mg/kg i.p. loading dose
and 1mg/ml at 8 gl/h maintenance dose (delivered by an i.p. osmotic pump) of Compound 5, or
given saline (controls; n =  17) using an identical approach. In this model, we observed a 29.4%
improvement in overall survival at 24h when animals are treated with Compound 5 (X2(1)
4.26; P < 0.05).
[0091]          CerebralEdema - Mice are given saline or treated with Compound 5 by multi
dosing at 5 mg/kg i.p. every three hours (n = 8 per treatment). This dosing regimen is sufficient
to maintain a plasma concentration of Compound 1 > 10 ng/ml for the duration of the study.
Ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheric volume is measured from the T2-weighted MR images
of mice 24 hours post-icus. Relative change in hemispheric volume is calculated as a percent of
the difference between ipsilateral brain volume (Vi) and contralateral brain volume (Vc) relative
to the contralateral brain volume (Percent Change in Hemispheric Brain Volume      = ((Vi - Vc)/Vc)
x 100%.
[0092]          Control animals show swelling in the ipsilateral hemisphere with a relative
change in ipsilateral brain volume of 13.4%  1.9%, while animals given Compound 5 show a
4.2  1.7% change (P = 0.003,  SEM, see Figure 12). This represents a 3.2-fold reduction in
brain swelling after MCAo.
[0093]          Neurological Outcome - In the same experiment as above, animals are scored for
neurological outcome on a simple 5 point scale described in Manley, G.T. et al., Aquaporin-4
Deletion in Mice Reduces Brain Edema After Acute Water Intoxication and Ischemic Stroke,
Nature Medicine, 6, 159-163 (2000). An improvement in neurological outcome is observed for
animals given Compound 5. Control animals have an average neurological score of 2.77  0.66,
while animals given Compound 5 have an average score of 0.88  0.31 (Figure 13, inset, P      =
0.025, n  = 9 per treatment). Animals given Compound 5 did not progress into a state of severe
paralysis or death.
