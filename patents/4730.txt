   FIELD OF THE ART
                   [0002] The present disclosure generally relates to gel compositions and wellbore
   treatment fluids for use in hydraulic fracturing applications.
15 BACKGROUND
                   [0003] In the drilling, completion, and stimulation of oil and gas wells, well treatment
   fluids are often pumped into well bore holes under high pressure and at high flow rates
   causing the rock formation surrounding the well bore to fracture. A type of well treatment
   commonly utilized for stimulating hydrocarbon production from a subterranean zone
20 penetrated by a well bore is hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing, also referred to as
   fracing (or fracking), is used to initiate production in low-permeability reservoirs and re
   stimulate production in older producing wells. In hydraulic fracing, a fluid composition is
   injected into the well at pressures effective to cause fractures in the surrounding rock
   formation. Fracing is used both to open up fractures already present in the formation and
25 create new fractures. Proppants, such as sand and ceramics, are used to keep induced fractures
   open both during and after fracturing treatment. To place the proppants inside the fracture, the
   proppant particles are suspended in a fluid that is pumped into the subterranean formation.
   Generally, this fluid has a viscosity sufficient to maintain suspension of the particles.
                   [0004] For ideal performance, a hydraulic fracturing fluid should be sufficiently
30 viscous to create a fracture of adequate width and be able to transport large quantities of
   proppants into the fracture. The viscosity of the fluid can be enhanced or modified by addition
   of synthetic and/or natural polymers, or other rheology modifiers. Examples of polymer
   enhanced fluids used to increase the viscosity of hydraulic fracturing fluids include
                                                                1

    WO 2014/134541                                                         PCT/US2014/019599
slickwater systems, linear gel systems, and crosslinked gel systems. Of these, crosslinked
gel systems are the most viscous.
         [0005] In a crosslinked gel system, a linear polymer or gel, for example, a fluid
based on guar or modified guar, is crosslinked with added reagents such as borate,
zirconate, and titanate in the presence of alkali. The most common version of crosslinked
gel is known in the art as guar-borate gel. The crosslinked gel fluid increases the viscosity
of the fracturing fluid, such that proppants can be effectively suspended.
         [0006] Once the hydraulic fracturing fluid has delivered proppant to the fracture or
delivered sand in gravel packing or frac packing operations, it is often desirable to lower the
viscosity of the fracturing fluid such that the fluid can be recovered from the formation
using minimal energy. The removal of the spent fracturing fluids from the subterranean
formation is typically required to allow hydrocarbon production. This reduction in viscosity
of the fracturing fluid is often achieved using a breaker, i.e., a compound that breaks the
cross-linking bonds within the gel.
         [0007] Synthetic polymers, for example polyacrylamide (PAM) polymers, can form
permanent gels under acidic conditions with metal crosslinking agents, such as aluminum-,
chromium-, zirconium- and titianium-based complexes. Such gels can be used, for example,
to control conformance in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications, where subsequent
breaking to significantly reduce viscosity is not necessary. However, for fracing fluid
applications, the acidity of the formation in hydraulic fracturing is usually not high, and
breaking of the crosslinked gel improves fluid recovery.

                                           SUMMARY
         [0008] Disclosed herein are gel compositions comprising an acrylamide polymer or
copolymer having a charge between about 5% to about 35%, or more specifically about
15% to about 20%, and dialdehyde. The gel composition is formed by combining the
acrylamide polymer or copolymer and dialdehyde in an aqueous solution at a pH in the
range of about 7.5 to about 11, wherein the molar ratio of dialdehyde to monomers of the
acrylamide polymer or copolymer is in the range of about greater than about 0.2 to about
2.0.
         [0009] Methods to produce the gel composition, methods of treating a wellbore
comprising injecting the gel composition into a wellbore, and well treatment fluids
comprising the gel composition are also disclosed herein.
         [0010] Further, methods of treating a wellbore comprising injecting a composition
comprising an acrylamide polymer or copolymer having a charge between 15% to 20% into
a wellbore; injecting a composition comprising dialdehyde into the wellbore, and injecting a
pH modifying agent into the wellbore in an amount sufficient to produce a downhole
solution pH in the range of about 7.5 to about 11, to produce an in-situ gel composition
comprising an acrylamide polymer or copolymer crosslinked with dialdehyde.
         [0011] Wellbore treatment fluids comprising an acrylamide polymer or copolymer
and dialdehyde are also disclosed herein. The wellbore treatment fluid may be formed (in
whole or in part) prior to injection into the wellbore or in situ, where the acrylamide
polymer/copolymer and the crosslinker are added to the wellbore separately. The wellbore
treatment fluid may optionally comprise one or more additional components, such as
proppants and pH control agents.

                              BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES
        [0013] Figure 1 provides a graph showing the results of the viscosity analyses for
exemplary gels according to the embodiments and a guar gel.
        [0014] Figure 2 provides a graph showing the relationship between charge and
viscosity for anionic copolymers at various charges.
                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        [0015] The present disclosure provides cross-linked gel compositions         which
comprise an acrylamide polymer or copolymer and dialdehyde. The gel compositions are
useful for increasing the viscosity of hydraulic fracturing fluids. In particular, the gel
compositions have a charge (mole percent) within a specific range that is especially useful
for viscosifying wellbore treatment fluids, enhancing delivery of proppants into fractures.
The exemplary gel compositions may break under certain conditions, which can increase
fluid recovery in hydraulic fracturing applications. The exemplary gel compositions can be
used as a synthetic replacement for crosslinked guar compositions in hydraulic fracturing
applications, with comparable performance. Like guar gels, the exemplary gel compositions
provide high viscosity with a relatively low amount of active polymer in the composition.
Exemplary gel compositions may be easier to manufacture, and of a more reliable quality,
than guar gels.

wellbore fluid composition is formed in situ, the components of the well fluid composition
may be injected into the wellbore simultaneously or sequentially, in any order.

by injecting (i) a composition comprising an acrylamide polymer or copolymer and a pH
modifying agent and (ii) a composition comprising dialdehyde, where the injection of (i)

composition comprising dialdehyde may be combined; and (iii) a composition comprising a
pH modifying       agents, wherein the injection of (i)-(iii) occurs simultaneously or
sequentially, in any order.
         [0052] In exemplary embodiments, the pH modifying agent is any suitable pH
modifying agent and may be in the form of an aqueous solution, for example an aqueous
solution comprising a base, an acid, a pH buffer, or any combination thereof. In exemplary
embodiments, the pH modifying agent is a potassium carbonate and potassium hydroxide
mixture    or a sodium bicarbonate       and    sodium carbonate    mixture.    In exemplary

compositions, or dialdehyde and acrylamide polymer or copolymer compositions for
forming the gel compositions, can be used in any well treatment fluid where viscosification
is desired including but not limited to stimulation and completion operations. For example,
the wellbore treatment fluid can be used for hydraulic fracturing applications. In these
applications, the fracturing fluid, i.e. wellbore treatment fluid, can be configured as a gelled
fluid, a foamed gel fluid, acidic fluids, water and potassium chloride treatments, and the
like. The fluid is injected at a pressure effective to create one or more fractures in the
subterranean formation. Depending on the type of well treatment fluid utilized, various
additives may also be added to the wellbore fluid to change the physical properties of the
fluid or to serve a certain beneficial function. In one embodiment, a propping agent such as
sand or other hard material is added which serves to keep the fractures open after the
fracturing operation. Also, fluid loss agents may be added to partially seal off the more
porous sections of the formation so that the fracturing occurs in the less porous strata. Other
oilfield additives that may also be added to the wellbore treatment fluid include antifoams,
scale inhibitors, H2 S and or 02 scavengers, biocides,      surface tension reducers, breakers,
buffers, surfactants and non-emulsifiers, fluorocarbon surfactants, clay stabilizers, fluid loss
additives, foamers, friction reducers, temperature stabilizers, diverting agents, shale and
clay stabilizers, paraffin/asphaltene inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors.
         [0055] In exemplary embodiments, the wellbore treatment fluid may optionally
further comprise additional additives, including, but not limited to, acids, fluid loss control
additives, gas, corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors, catalysts, clay control agents, biocides,
friction reducers, combinations thereof and the like. For example, in some embodiments, it
may be desired to foam the storable composition using a gas, such as air, nitrogen, or carbon
dioxide.

        [0004] Exemplary gels were prepared by the following protocol. About 0.4 wt% of
active acrylamide polymer in water was stirred for about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes at
room temperature. Once the solution was thoroughly blended, the pH of the solution was

0.65 wt. % of glyoxal was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred until the glyoxal
was well incorporated. The viscosity of each of the resulting gels was measured on a Grace
Instrument M5600 HPHT Rheometer at 180'F.

sample is maintained with an oil bath which runs from ambient to 500'F. The gel is also
subjected to pressure with nitrogen gas to prevent boiling off the solvent. After 20 minutes
of shear conditioning, the gel is subjected to a shear sweep which can be programmed in the
software that accompanies the Rheometer. The data acquired from the computer is
processed and plotted as desired.

         [0011] Based on viscosity under the testing conditions (shear rate 100 sec-' at 180F),
there is an influence of charge on gel viscosity and performance. An optimum range of the
charge appears to be in the 15-20 mole % range. This charge effect is unexpected because one
would expect to have increasingly better performance (viscosity) with decreasing charge
(which means more acrylamide units available for the crosslinking reaction with glyoxal). To
the contrary, an optimum range of the charge appears to be in the 15-20 mole % range. The
results of the charge-viscosity analysis are shown graphically in Figure 2.
