                                                           ABSTRACT
IL-18 participates in both innate and acquired immunity. The bioactivity of IL-18 is
negatively regulated by the IL-18 binding protein (IL18BP), a naturally occurring and
highly specific inhibitor. This soluble protein forms a complex with free IL-1 8 preventing its
interaction with the IL-18 receptor, thus neutralizing and inhibiting its biological activity.
The present invention discloses binding molecules, in particular antibodies or fragments
thereof, which bind IL-18 and do not bind IL-18 bound to IL-18BP (IL-18/IL-18BP
complex). Apart from its physiological role, IL-18 has been shown to mediate a variety of
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The binding molecules of the inventions may be
used as therapeutic molecules for treating IL-18-related autoimmune and inflammatory
diseases or as diagnostic tools for characterizing, detecting and/or measuring IL-18 not
bound to IL-1 8BP as component of the total IL-1 8 pool.

Field of the Invention
The present invention concerns binding molecules, more particularly immunoglobulins
such as antibodies or fragments thereof, which bind with the cytokine Interleukin 18 (IL
18) but do not bind IL-18 in complex with the Interleukin 18 binding protein (IL-18BP)
endogenous inhibitor. The present invention also concerns polynucleotide encoding said
binding molecules, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said binding molecules,
methods of treating and/or preventing diseases using said binding molecules and method
for detecting and/or measuring the presence and/or amount of IL-18 not bound to IL
18BP. Other aspects, objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent
from the description below.
Background of the Invention
Interleukin-18 (IL-18) was originally described in 1989 as interferon-gamma inducing
factor (IGIF). IL-18 is related to the IL-1 family and is structurally related to IL-1
(Okamura H et al. (1995) Nature; 378:88-91). IL-18 is primarily produced by macrophages
and T cells as a precursor protein (pro-IL-18) and secreted as an active protein following
cleavage by caspase-1 (Dinarello CA et al (1999) J Allergy Clin Immunol; 103:11-24). In
normal physiology IL-18, in synergy with IL-12, is associated with induction of cell
mediated immunity following infection with microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) (Sareneva T et al (2000) J Immunol; 165(4):1933-8). After stimulation with IL-18,
natural killer (NK) cells and T cells release the cytokine interferon gamma (INF-y) which
plays an important role in activating macrophages and other cells. IL-18 has also various
functions in addition to an ability to induce interferon gamma. These biological properties
include activation of NF-KB, Fas ligand expression, the induction of both CC and CXC
chemokines, and increased production of competent human immuno-deficiency virus. Due
to the ability of IL-18 to induce INF-y production in T cells and macrophages, it plays an
important role in Th1-type immune responses and participates in both innate and acquired
immunity.

                                                     2
   IL-18 binds with high affinity and signals through the IL-18 receptor (IL-18R), a heteromeric
   complex of alpha and beta chains encoded by the genes IL18R1 and IL18RAP, respectively
   (Torigoe K et al (1997) J Biol Chem; 272(41):25737-42). The bioactivity of IL-18 is negatively
   regulated by the IL-18 binding protein (IL18BP), a naturally occurring and highly specific
 5 inhibitor. This soluble protein forms a complex with free IL-18 preventing its interaction with the
   IL-18 receptor, thus neutralizing and inhibiting its biological activity (Dinarello CA (2000) Ann
   Rheum Dis; 59 Suppl 1:i17-20). IL-18BP is a constitutively secreted protein with high affinity
   binding to IL-18. Alternate mRNA splicing variants of IL-18BP result in four isoforms. The
   prominent 'a' isoform is present in the serum of healthy humans at 20-fold molar excess
 0 compared with IL-18 (Dinarello and Kaplanski (2005) Expert Rev Clin Immunol, 1(4), 619-632).
   Apart from its physiological role, IL-18 has been shown to mediate a variety of autoimmune and
   inflammatory diseases. It has been demonstrated that IL-18 expression is up-regulated in
   several autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
   sclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (Braddock et al. (2004) Expert Opin Biol Ther; 4(6):847
 5 860). IL-18 is also up-regulated in certain inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) (Imaoka et al. (2008) Eur Respir; J31:287-297), idiopathic
   pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (Kitasato et al. (2004) Am J Resp Cell Mol Biol; 31:619-625),
   macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (Dinarello and Kaplanski (2005) Expert Rev Clin
   Immunol; 1(4): 619-632), adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) (Arlet JB et al. (2006) Ann Rheum
 0 Dis 65(12):1596-601) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) (Akashi et al. (1994) Br J
   Haematol; 87(2):243-50).
   Recent studies have shown that high amounts of IL-18 and INF-y in both inherited and acquired
   forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is characterized by activated
   lymphocytes and histiocytes secreting high amounts of inflammatory cytokines (Janka GE et al
25 (2007) Eur J Paediatr; 166:95-109) and by impaired function of NK cells and cytotoxic T-cells.
   Most important, it has been shown that both forms are characterized by dis-regulation of IL-18
   (Mazodier et al (2005) Immunobiology 106(10):3483-89).
   Developing therapeutic molecules for targets such as IL-18 which are regulated by natural
   inhibitors can be very challenging. The presence of an increased amount of systemic or local
30 total IL-18 does not always reflect the level of biologically active protein (IL-18 free of IL-18BP).
   A therapeutic compound binding both free IL-18 and IL-18 in complex to IL-18BP, although

                                                     3
   potentially capable of neutralizing the activity of IL-18, would be required in higher dose than
   one which can selectively bind only biologically active free IL-18. Therapeutic compounds which
   need to be administered in high dose may lead to more pronounced side effects or become
   immunogenic. High dosages also translate into high production costs.
 5 Therapeutic compounds competing for IL-18 when bound to IL18BP may disturb the delicate
   balances of free/active IL-18 and IL-18BP bound/inactive IL-18 existing in patients stricken with
   diseases/disorders characterized by IL-18 dis-regulation.
   Finally, investigating diseases characterized by dis-regulation of IL-18 free, in the absence of a
   diagnostic tool capable of detecting and/or measuring IL-1 8 free from IL-1 8BP as component of
 0 the total IL-18 would be very difficult.

   Detailed Description of the Invention.
   1. Definitions
   For purposes of interpreting this specification, the following definitions will apply and whenever
   appropriate, terms used in the singular will also include the plural and vice versa. Additional
 0 definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description.
   The term "IL-18" is synonym to IL-18 polypeptide, Interleukin-18 polypeptide, IFN-gamma
   inducing factor or Interferon-gamma-inducing-factor or INF-y inducing factor. The term "IL-18"
   refers to human IL-18 comprising amino acids 37 to 193 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Throughout this
   specification, the term IL-18 encompasses both pro-IL-18 (precursor of mature IL-18 prior
 5 protease cleavage) and mature IL-18 (post protease cleavage) interchangeably unless it is
   specified that the pro- or mature form is meant.
   The term cm IL-18 refers to cynomolgus monkey IL-18 comprising amino acids 37 to 193 of
   SEQ ID NO:2.
   The term "antibody" refers to an intact immunoglobulin or a functional fragment thereof.
20 Naturally occurring antibodies typically comprise a tetramer which is usually composed of at
   least two heavy (H) chains and at least two light (L) chains. Each heavy chain is comprised of a
   heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region,
   usually comprised of three domains (CH1, CH2 ad CH3). Heavy chains can be of any isotype,
   including IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subtypes), IgA (IgAl and IgA2 subtypes), IgM and
25 IgE. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL)
   and a light chain constant region (CL). Light chain includes kappa chains and lambda chains.
   The heavy and light chain variable region is typically responsible for antigen recognition, whilst
   the heavy and light chain constant region may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to

        WO 2014/037899                                                           PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    20
   host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the
   first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. The VH and VL regions can be
   further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions
   (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR).
 5 Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino-terminus to
   carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The
   variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an
   antigen.
   The term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody (or simply "antigen portion"), as used herein,
 0 refers to full length or one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically
   bind to IL-18. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be
   performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed
   within the term "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody include a Fab fragment, a monovalent
   fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; a F(ab)2 fragment, a bivalent
 5 fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd
   fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH
   domains of a single arm of an antibody; a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature; 341:544
   546), which consists of a VH domain; and an isolated complementarity determining region
   (CDR).
 o Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by
   separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a flexible linker that
   enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form
   monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al., (1988) Science
   242:423-426; and Huston et al., (1988) Proc Natl Acad Sc;. 85:5879-5883). Such single chain
25 antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antigen-binding portion" of an
   antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those
   of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact
   antibodies.
   The term "isolated" means throughout this specification, that the immunoglobulin, antibody or
30 polynucleotide, as the case may be, exists in a physical milieu distinct from that in which it may
   occur in nature.

        WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    21
   An isolated antibody that specifically binds the IL18 polypeptide may, however, have cross
   reactivity to other antigens, such as IL18 from other species (e.g. cynomolgus monkey (cm) IL
   18). Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or
   chemicals.
 5 Throughout this specification, complementarity determining regions ("CDR") are defined
   according to the Kabat definition unless specified that the CDR are defined according to the
   Chothia definition or by both definitions together. The Kabat definition is a standard for
   numbering the residues in an antibody and it is typically used to identify CDR regions (Kabat et
   al., (1991), 5th edition, NIH publication No. 91-3242). The Chothia definition is similar to the
 0 Kabat definition but it takes into account positions of certain structural loops (Chothia et al.,
   (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-17; Al-Lazikani et al., (1997) J.Mol.Biol. 273:927-948).
   By convention, the CDR regions in the heavy chain are typically referred to as H-CDR1, H
   CDR2 and H-CDR3 and in the light chain as L-CDR1, LCDR2 and L-CDR3. They are numbered
   sequentially in the direction from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.
 5 The terms "monoclonal antibody" or "monoclonal antibody composition" as used herein refer to
   a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody
   composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope.
   The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable
   regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human
 0 origin. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is
   derived from such human sequences, e.g., human germline sequences, or mutated versions of
   human germline sequences or antibody containing consensus framework sequences derived
   from human framework sequences analysis, for example, as described in Knappik, et al., (2000)
   J Mol Biol; 296:57-86).
25 The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human
   sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by
   somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term "human antibody", as used herein, is not intended
   to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian
   species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                   22
   The term "human monoclonal antibody" refers to antibodies displaying a single binding
   specificity which have variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are
   derived from human sequences.
   The term "recombinant human antibody", as used herein, includes all human antibodies that are
 5 prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated
   from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for human
   immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, antibodies isolated from a host cell
   transformed to express the human antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, antibodies isolated from
   a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library, and antibodies prepared, expressed,
 0 created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of all or a portion of a human
   immunoglobulin gene. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable regions in which the
   framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In
   certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies can be subjected to in vitro
   mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic
 5 mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant
   antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL
   sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.
   The phrases "an antibody recognizing an antigen" and "an antibody specific for an antigen" are
   used interchangeably herein with the term "an antibody which binds specifically to an antigen".
 o As used herein, a binding molecule that "specifically binds to IL-18" is intended to refer to a
   binding molecule that binds to human IL-18 with a KD of a 1OOnM or less, 1OnM or less, 1nM or
   less.
   A binding molecule that "cross-reacts with an antigen other than IL-18 is intended to refer to a
   binding molecule that binds that antigen with a KD of a 1 OOnM or less, 1 OnM or less, 1 nM or
25 less. A binding molecule that "does not cross-react with a particular antigen" is intended to refer
   to a binding molecule that exhibits essentially undetectable binding against these proteins in
   standard binding assays.
   As used herein, the term "antagonist" is intended to refer to a binding molecule that inhibits IL
   18 dependent signalling activity in the presence of IL-18 in a human cell assay such as IL-18
30 dependent Interferon-gamma (IFN-y) production assay in human blood cells. Examples of an IL-

        WO 2014/037899                                                              PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     23
   18 dependent IFN-y production assay in human blood cells are described in more details in the
   examples below.
   As used herein, an antibody with "no agonistic activity" is intended to refer to a binding molecule
   that does not significantly increase IL-18 dependent signalling activity in the absence and/or
 5 presence of IL-18 in a cell-based assay, such as human blood cells IFN-y production assay.
   Such assays are described in more details in the examples below.
   The term "Kassoc" or "Ka", as used herein, is intended to refer to the association rate of a
   particular binding molecule -antigen interaction, whereas the term     "Kdis" or "Kd," as used herein,
   is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular binding molecule -antigen interaction.
 0 The term "KD", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which is
   obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka (i.e. Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M).     KD
   values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. A method for
   determining the   KD of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance, such as a Biacore@
   system.
 5 As used herein, the term "affinity" refers to the strength of interaction between binding molecule
   and antigen at single antigenic sites.
   As used herein, the term "high affinity" for an antibody refers to an antibody having a KD of 1nM
   or less for a target antigen.
   As used herein, the term "subject" includes any human or non-human animal.
20 The term "non-human animal" includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such
   as non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cats, horses, cows, chickens, amphibians, reptiles, etc.
   As used herein, the term, "optimized nucleotide sequence" means that the nucleotide sequence
   has been altered to encode an amino acid sequence using codons that are preferred in the
   production cell or organism, generally a eukaryotic cell, for example, a cell of Pichia pastoris, a
25 Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO) or a human cell. The optimized nucleotide sequence is
   engineered to retain completely the amino acid sequence originally encoded by the starting
   nucleotide sequence, which is also known as the "parental" sequence. The optimized
   sequences herein have been engineered to have codons that are preferred in CHO mammalian

       WO 2014/037899                                                                 PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                      24
   cells; however optimized expression of these sequences in other eukaryotic cells is also
   envisioned herein.
   The term "identity" refers to the similarity between at least two different sequences. This identity
   can be expressed as a percent identity and determined by standard alignment algorithms, for
 5 example, the Basic Local Alignment Tool (BLAST) (Altshul et al., (1990) J Mol Biol; 215:403
   410); the algorithm of Needleman et al., (1970) J Mol Biol; 48:444-453 or the algorithm of
   Meyers et al., (1988) Comput Appl Biosci; 4:11-17). A set of parameters may be the Blosum 62
   scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty
   of 5. The percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences can also be
 0 determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller, (1989) CABIOS; 4(1):1-17) which
   has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM 120 weight residue
   table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The percent identity is usually
   calculated by comparing sequences of similar length.
   The term "immune response" refers to the action of, for example, lymphocytes, antigen
 5 presenting cells, phagocytic cells, granulocytes, and soluble macromolecules produced by the
   above cells or the liver (including antibodies, cytokines, and complement) that results in
   selective damage to, destruction of, or elimination from the human body of invading pathogens,
   cells or tissues infected with pathogens, cancerous cells, or, in cases of autoimmunity or
   pathological inflammation, normal human cells or tissues.
 o A "signal transduction pathway" or "signaling activity" refers to a biochemical causal relationship
   generally initiated by a protein-protein interaction such as binding of a growth factor to a
   receptor, resulting in transmission of a signal from one portion of a cell to another portion of a
   cell. In general, the transmission involves specific phosphorylation of one or more tyrosine,
   serine, or threonine residues on one or more proteins in the series of reactions causing signal
25 transduction. Penultimate processes typically include nuclear events, resulting in a change in
   gene expression.
   The term "neutralises" and grammatical variations thereof means throughout this specification,
   that the biological activity of the target is reduced either totally or partially in the presence of the
   binding protein or antibody, as the case may be.

       WO 2014/037899                                                               PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     25
   The term "nucleic acid" or "polynucleotide" refers to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic
   acid (RNA) and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically
   limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides
   that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a
 5 manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular
   nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof
   (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions), alleles, orthologs, SNPs, and complementary sequences
   as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may
   be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all)
 0 codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid
   Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985); and Rossolini et al.,
   Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98 (1994))
   The nucleotide in the "polynucleotide" or "nucleic acid" may comprise modifications including
   base modifications such as bromouridine and inosine derivatives, ribose modification such as
 5 phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate,
   phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoraniladate and phosphoroamidate.
   The term "vector" means any molecule or entity (e.g. nucleic acid, plasmid, bacteriophage or
   virus) that is suitable for transformation or transfection of a host cell and contains nucleic acid
   sequences that direct and/or control (in conjunction with the host cell) expression of one or more
 0 heterologous coding regions operatively linked thereto.
   A "conservative variant" of a sequence encoding a binding molecule, an antibody or a fragment
   thereof refers to a sequence comprising conservative amino acid modifications. "Conservative
   amino acid modifications" are intended to refer to amino acid modifications that do not
   significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the antibody containing the amino acid
25 sequence. Such conservative modifications include amino acid substitutions, additions and
   deletions. Conservative amino acid substitutions are ones in which the amino acid residue is
   replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues
   having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with
   basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid,
30 glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine,
   threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine,

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     26
   isoleucine, praline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine,
   valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).
   Modifications can be introduced into a binding protein of the invention by standard techniques
   known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis.
 5 Conservative amino acid substitution can also encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid
   residues which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis
   in biological systems. Non-naturally occurring amino acids include, but are not limited to,
   peptidomimetic, reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.
   The term "epitope" is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system , such as
 0 an antibody or a fragment thereof. Within the present specification, the term "epitope" is used
   interchangeably for both conformational epitopes and linear epitopes. A conformational epitope
   is composed of discontinuous sections of the antigen's amino acid sequence, whilst a linear
   epitope is formed by a continuous sequence of amino acids from the antigen.
   The term "treat", "treating", "treatment", "prevent", "preventing" or "prevention" includes
 5 therapeutic treatments, prophylactic treatments and applications in which one reduces the risk
   that a subject will develop a disorder or other risk factor. Treatment does not require the
   complete curing of a disorder and encompasses the reduction of the symptoms or underlying
   risk factors.
 0 2. Binding molecules
   The term "binding molecule" as used herein means any protein or peptide that binds specifically
   to the IL-18 polypeptide. "Binding molecule" includes, but it is not limited to, antibodies and
   fragments thereof, such as immunologically functional fragments. The term "immunologically
   functional fragment" of an antibody or immunoglobulin chain as used herein is a species of
25 binding protein comprising a portion (regardless of how that portion is obtained or synthesized)
   of an antibody that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full-length chain but
   which is still capable of specifically binding the IL-18 polypeptide. Such fragments are
   biologically active in that they bind the IL-18 polypeptide. "Binding molecule" refers to proteins
   which specifically bind the IL-18 polypeptide and which might additionally neutralize the
30 interaction of the IL-18 polypeptide with the IL-18 receptor.

        WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     27
    The term "binding molecule" as used herein also excludes the naturally occurring IL-18 binding
    protein and the isolated IL-18BP, for instance as described in W02001/085201.
    The binding molecule of the present invention specifically binds IL-18, wherein the binding
    molecule does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex and wherein the
  5 binding molecule is not IL-18BP.
    As used herein, the term "does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex" is
    intended to refer to a binding molecule that binds to the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP)
    complex with a KD of 1 x 10 5 M or greater.
    One way to assess whether a binding molecule binds IL-18 but does not bind the IL-18/IL-18
 0  binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex is described herein in the Exemplification, section 9.
    In another aspect of the present invention, the binding molecule specifically binds IL-18, wherein
    the binding molecule does not compete with IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) for binding to IL-18
    when IL-18BP is bound to IL-18.
    The terms "compete", "competing" and "cross-compete" and grammatical variations thereof are
  5 used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of a binding molecule to compete with the IL
    18BP for binding IL-18 when the IL-18BP is already bound to IL-18. The binding molecules of
    the invention, such as an antibody or a fragment thereof do not compete in this sense.
    Competition between binding molecules is determined by an assay in which the binding
    molecule is tested for specific binding to IL-18 when IL-18 is bound to IL-18BP. For the
/0  avoidance of any doubt, if a binding molecule can displace IL18 from an IL-18/IL-18BP complex,
    then that binding molecule competes with the IL-18 BP for binding IL-18.
    The binding molecule according to the invention is not IL-18BP, either isolated or naturally
    occurring IL-18BP.
    The binding molecule may be selected from the following scaffolds: an antibody, a fragment of
25  an antibody, a single variable domain antibody, a bi- or multi-specific antibody, a multivalent
    antibody, a dual variable domain antibody, an immuno-conjugate, a fibronectin molecule, an
    adnectin, a DARPin, an avimer, an affibody, an anticalin, an affilin, a protein epitope mimetic or
    combinations thereof and as described herein below.

                                                    28
   Preferably the IL-18 comprises from amino acid 37 to amino acid 193 of SEQ ID NO:1 (human
   IL-18) or SEQ ID NO:2 (cynomolgus monkey IL-18).
   IL-18BP structure is characterized by a single Ig-like domain and resembles the extracellular
   segment of cytokine receptors with Ig-like structures. Human IL-18BP has been identified in four
 5 different isoforms. IL-18BP isoform a (IL-18BPa) exhibited the greatest affinity for IL-18 with a
   rapid on-rate, a slow off-rate, and a dissociation constant (KD) of 399 pM. IL-18BP isoform c (IL
   18BPc) shares the Ig domain of IL-18BPa except for the last 29 amino acids at the C-terminus.
   The   KD of IL-18BPc is 10-fold less (2.94 nM) than IL-18BPa. Nevertheless, IL-18BPa and IL
   18BPc neutralize IL-18 >95% at a molar excess of two. IL-18BP isoforms b and d lack a
 o complete Ig domain and lack the ability to bind or neutralize IL-18. Murine IL-18BP is known in
   two isoforms, c and d isoforms, possessing identical Ig domains and also neutralizing >95%
   murine IL-18 at a molar excess of two. However, murine IL-18BPd, which shares a common C
   terminal motif with human IL-18BPa, also neutralizes human IL-18 (Kim et al. (2000) Proc Natl
   Acad Sci, 97(3):1190-1195).
 5 Throughout this specification, the term "IL-18BP" refers to human, murine or viral IL-18 binding
   proteins in every isoform, whether naturally occurring, isolated or engineered such as the IL
   18BP disclosed in W02001/085201 which describes analogues of IL-18BP ("muteins") wherein
   one or more amino acids are inserted, replaced by different conservative substitutions or
   deleted, IL-18BP fused protein (e.g. fused protein of an IL-18BP and an immunoglobulin heavy
 0 chain region or Fc) and functional derivatives such as PEG-ylated IL-18BP.

   2.1) Human antibodies
25 As used herein, a human antibody or a fragment thereof comprises heavy or light chain variable
   regions or full length heavy or light chains that are "the product of" or "derived from" a particular
   germline sequence if the variable regions or full length chains of the antibody are obtained from
   a system that uses human germline immunoglobulin genes. Such systems include immunizing a

       WO 2014/037899                                                          PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    32
   transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes with the antigen of interest or
   screening a human immunoglobulin gene library displayed on phage with the antigen of interest.
   A human antibody or fragment thereof that is "the product of" or "derived from" a human
   germline immunoglobulin sequence can be identified as such by comparing the amino acid
 5 sequence of the human antibody to the amino acid sequences of human germline
   immunoglobulins and selecting the human germline immunoglobulin sequence that is closest in
   sequence (i.e., greatest % identity) to the sequence of the human antibody. A human antibody
   that is "the product of" or "derived from" a particular human germline immunoglobulin sequence
   may contain amino acid differences as compared to the germline sequence, due to, for
 0 example, naturally occurring somatic mutations or intentional introduction of site-directed
   mutation. However, a selected human antibody typically is at least 90% identical in amino acids
   sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene and
   contains amino acid residues that identify the human antibody as being human when compared
   to the germline immunoglobulin amino acid sequences of other species (e.g., murine germline
 5 sequences). In certain cases, a human antibody may be at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or at
   least 95%, or even at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the
   amino acid sequence encoded by the germline immunoglobulin gene. Typically, a human
   antibody derived from a particular human germline sequence will display no more than 10 amino
   acid differences from the amino acid sequence encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin
 0 gene. In certain cases, the human antibody may display no more than 5, or even no more than
   4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference from the amino acid sequence encoded by the germline
   immunoglobulin gene.
   Human antibodies may be produced by a number of methods known to those of skill in the art.
   Human antibodies can be made by the hybridoma method using human myeloma or mouse
25 human heteromyeloma cells lines (Kozbor, J Immunol; (1984) 133:3001; Brodeur, Monoclonal
   Isolated Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp51-63, Marcel Dekker Inc, 1987).
   Alternative methods include the use of phage libraries or transgenic mice both of which utilize
   human variable region repertories (Winter G; (1994) Annu Rev Immunol 12:433-455, Green LL,
   (1999) J Immunol Methods 231:11-23).
30 Several strains of transgenic mice are now available wherein their mouse immunoglobulin loci
   has been replaced with human immunoglobulin gene segments (Tomizuka K, (2000) Proc Natl

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     33
   Acad Sci , 97:722-727; Fishwild DM (1996) Nature Biotechnol 14:845-851; Mendez MJ, (1997)
   Nature Genetics 15:146-156). Upon antigen challenge such mice are capable of producing a
   repertoire of human antibodies from which antibodies of interest can be selected. Of particular
   note is the Trimera T M system (Eren R et al, (1988) Immunology 93:154-161) where human
 5 lymphocytes are transplanted into irradiated mice, the Selected Lymphocyte Isolated antibody
   System (SLAM, Babcook et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci (1996) 93:7843-7848) where human (or other
   species) lymphocytes are effectively put through a massive pooled in vitro isolated antibody
   generation procedure followed by deconvoluted, limiting dilution and selection procedure and
   the XenomouseTM (Abgenix Inc). An alternative approach is available from Morphotek Inc using
 0 the Morphodoma T M technology.
   Phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and fragments thereof,
   (McCafferty; (1990) Nature, 348:552-553 and Griffiths AD et al (1994) EMBO 13:3245-3260).
   According to this technique, isolated antibody variable domain genes are cloned in frame into
   either a major or minor coat of protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd
 5 and displayed (usually with the aid of a helper phage) as function isolated antibody fragments
   on the surface of the phage particle. Selections based on the function properties of the isolated
   antibody result in selection of the gene encoding the isolated antibody exhibiting these
   properties. The phage display technique can be used to select antigen specific antibodies from
   libraries made from human B cells taken from individuals afflicted with a disease or disorder or
 0 alternatively from unimmunized human donors (Marks; J Mol Bio (1991) 222:581-591,). Where
   an intact human isolated antibody is desired comprising an Fc domain it is necessary reclone
   the phage displayed derived fragment into a mammalian expression vectors comprising the
   desired constant regions and establishing stable expressing cell lines.
   The technique of affinity maturation (Marks; Biotechnol (1992) 10:779-783) may be used to
25 provide binding affinity wherein the affinity of the primary human isolated antibody is improved
   by sequentially replacing the H and L chain variable regions with naturally occurring variants
   and selecting on the basis of improved binding affinities. Variants of this technique such as
   'epitope imprinting' are now also available (WO 93/06213; Waterhouse; Nucl Acids Res (1993)
   21:2265-2266).

   such "mixed and matched" antibodies can be tested using the binding assays in the Examples
   (e.g., ELISAs). When VH CDR sequences are mixed and matched, the CDR1, CDR2 and/or
 5 CDR3 sequence from a particular VH sequence should be replaced with a structurally similar
   CDR sequence(s). Likewise, when VL CDR sequences are mixed and matched, the CDR1,
   CDR2 and/or CDR3 sequence from a particular VL sequence should be replaced with a
   structurally similar CDR sequence(s). It will be readily apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan
   that novel VH and VL sequences can be created by substituting one or more VH and/or VL CDR
 0 region sequences with structurally similar sequences from the CDR sequences shown herein for
   human antibodies of the present invention (Figures 1 and 2).

   2.2) Humanized or chimeric antibodies

        WO 2014/037899                                                           PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     60
   An obvious alternative to the invention disclosed herein is the use of humanized or chimeric
   antibodies in place of human antibodies.
   The use of intact non-human antibodies in the treatment of human diseases or disorders carries
   with it the potential for the now well established problems of immunogenicity. That is, the
 5 immune system of the patient may recognise the non-human intact isolated antibody as non-self
   and mount an antibody response. This is particularly evident upon multiple administration of the
   non-human isolated antibody to a human patient. Various techniques have been developed over
   the years to overcome these problems and generally involve reducing the non-human
   immunogenicity signature in the intact isolated antibody whilst retaining the relative ease in
 0 obtaining non-human antibodies from an immunised animal, e.g. mouse, rat or rabbit. Broadly
   two approaches have been used to achieve this. The first are chimeric (sometimes "chimaeric")
   antibodies, which generally comprise a non-human (e.g. rodent such as mouse) variable
   domain fused to a human constant region. Because the antigen-binding site of an isolated
   antibody is localised within the variable regions the chimeric isolated antibody retains its binding
 5 affinity for the antigen but acquires the effector functions of the human constant region and are
   therefore able to perform effector functions such as described supra. Chimeric antibodies are
   typically produced using recombinant DNA methods. DNA encoding the antibodies (e.g. cDNA)
   is isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes
   that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the
 0 isolated antibody of the invention. Hybridoma cells serve as a typical source of such DNA. Once
   isolated, the DNA is placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells
   such as E.coli, COS cells, CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce
   immunoglobulin protein to obtain synthesis of the isolated antibody. The DNA may be modified
   by substituting the coding sequence for human L and H chains for the corresponding non
25 human (e.g. murine) H and L constant regions (Morrison; PNAS 81, 6851 (1984)).
   The second approach involves the generation of humanized antibodies wherein the non-human
   content of the isolated antibody is reduced by humanizing the variable regions. Two techniques
   for humanization have gained popularity. The first is humanization by CDR grafting. CDRs build
   loops close to the isolated antibody's N-terminus where they form a surface mounted in a
30 scaffold provided by the framework region. Antigen-binding specificity of the isolated antibody is
   mainly defined by the topography and by the chemical characteristics of its CDR surface. These

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                   61
   features are in turn determined by the conformation of the individual CDRs, by the relative
   disposition of the CDRs, and by the nature and disposition of the side chains of the residues
   comprising the CDRs. A large decrease in immunogenicity can be achieved by grafting only the
   CDRs of a non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies ('donor' antibodies) onto human framework
 5 ('acceptor framework') and constant regions (Jones et al (1986) Nature 321:522-525 and
   Verhoeyen M et al (1988) Science 239:1534-1536). However, CDR grafting per se may not
   result in the complete retention of antigen-binding properties and it is frequency found that some
   framework residues (sometimes referred to as 'backmutations') of the donor isolated antibody
   need to be preserved in the humanised compound if significant antigen-binding affinity is to be
 0 recovered (Queen C et al., (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci 86:10029-10033, Co, M et al (1991)
   Nature 351, 501-502). In this case, human variable regions showing the greatest sequence
   homology to the non-human donor isolated antibody are chosen from a database in order to
   provide the human framework (FR). The selection of human FRs can be made either from
   human consensus or individual human antibodies. Where necessary, key residues from the
 5 donor isolated antibody are substituted into the human acceptor framework to preserve CDR
   conformations. Computer modelling of the isolated antibody may be used to help identify such
   structurally important residues.
   Alternatively, humanisation may be achieved by a process of 'veneering'. A statistical analysis
   of unique human and murine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions revealed
 0 that the precise patterns of exposed residues are different in human and murine antibodies, and
   most individual surface positions have a strong preference for a small number of different
   residues (Padlan EA, et al; (1991) Mol Immunol 28:489-498 and Pedersen JT et al (1994) J Mol
   Biol 235:959-973). Therefore it is possible to reduce the immunogenicity of a non-human Fv by
   replacing exposed residues in its framework regions that differ from those usually found in
25 human antibodies. Because protein antigenicity may be correlated with surface accessibility,
   replacement of the surface residues may be sufficient to render the mouse variable region
   'invisible' to the human immune system (also Mark GE et al (1994) in Handbook of Experimental
   Pharmacology vol 113: The pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies, Springer-Verlag, pp 105
   134). This procedure of humanisation is referred to as 'veneering' because only the surface of
30 the isolated antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed.

   2.3) Isolated antibody fragments and single variable domain antibodies
   In another embodiment of the invention, the binding molecule is a fragment of an antibody or a
   single variable domain antibody which binds IL-18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding
   protein (IL-18 BP) complex. Preferably, the binding molecule is a Fab, a Fab', a F(ab') 2, a Fv, a
 5 scFv, a dAb or a VHH
   Traditionally, such fragments are produced by the proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies by
   e.g. papain digestion (see for example WO 94/29348) but may be produced directly from
   recombinantly transformed host cells. In addition, isolated antibody fragments may be produced
   using a variety of engineering techniques as described below.
 o Fv fragments appear to have lower interaction energy of their two chains than Fab fragments.
   To stabilise the association of the VH and VL domains, they have been linked with peptides
   (Bird et al, (1988) Science, 242:423-426, Huston et al, (1998) PNAS, 85:5879-5883), disulphide
   bridges (Glockshuber et al, (1990) Biochemistry, 29:1362-1367) and 'knob in hole' mutations
   (Zhu et al (1997), Protein Sci, 6:781-788). ScFv fragments can be produced by methods well
 5 known to those skilled in the art (Whitlow et al (1991), Methods companion Methods Enzymol,
   2:97-105 and Huston et al (1993) Int Rev Immunol 10:195-217). ScFv may be produced in
   bacterial cells such as E.coli but are more preferably produced in eukaryotic cells. One
   disadvantage of scFv is the monovalency of the product, which precludes an increased avidity
   due to polyvalent binding, and their short half-life. Attempts to overcome these problems include
 0 bivalent (scFv') 2 produced from scFv containing an additional C terminal cysteine by chemical
   coupling (Adams et al (1993) Can Res 53:4026-4034 and McCartney et al (1995) Protein Eng,
   8:301-314) or by spontaneous site-specific dimerization of scFv containing an unpaired C
   terminal cysteine residue (Kipriyanov et al (1995) Cell. Biophys 26:187-204). Alternatively, scFv
   can be forced to form multimers by shortening the peptide linker to 3 and 12 residues to form
25 'diabodies' (Holliger et al PNAS (1993), 90:6444-6448). Reducing the linker still further can
   result in scFv trimers ('triabodies', see Kortt et al (1997) Protein Eng, 10:423-433) and tetramers
   ('tetrabodies', Le Gall et al (1999) FEBS Lett, 453:164-168). Construction of bivalent scFv
   compounds can also be achieved by genetic fusion with protein dimerzing motifs to form
   'miniantibodies' (Pack et al (1992) Biochemistry 31:1579-1584) and 'minibodies' (Hu et al
30 (1996), Cancer Res. 56:3055-3061). ScFv-sc-Fv tandems ((scFv)2) may also be produced by
   linking two scFv units by a third peptide linker, (see Kurucz et al (1995) J Immunol, 154:4576-

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     63
   4582). Bispecific diabodies can be produced through the noncovalent association of two single
   chain fusion products consisting of VH domain from one isolated antibody connected by a short
   linker to the VL domain of another isolated antibody, (see Kipriyanov et al (1998), Int J Can
   77:763-772). The stability of such bispecific diabodies can be enhanced by the introduction of
 5 disulphide bridges or 'knob in hole' mutations as described supra or by the formation of single
   chain diabodies (ScDb) wherein two hydrid scFv fragments are connected through a peptide
   linker (see Kontermann et al (1999) J Immunol Methods 226:179-188). Tetravalent bispecific
   compounds are available by e.g fusing a scFv fragment to the CH3 domain of an IgG compound
   or to a Fab fragment through the hinge region (see Coloma et al (1997) Nature Biotechnol,
 0 15:159-163). Alternatively, tetravalent bispecific compounds have been created by the fusion of
   bispecific single chain diabodies (see Alt et al (1999) FEBS Lett 454:90-94). Smaller tetravalent
   bispecific compounds can also be formed by the dimerization of either scFv-scFv tandems with
   a linker containing a helix-loop-helix motif (DiBi miniantibodies, see Muller et al (1998) FEBS
   Lett 432:45-49) or a single chain compound comprising four isolated antibody variable domains
 5 (VH and VL) in an orientation preventing intramolecular pairing (tandem diabody, see Kipriyanov
   et al, (1999) J Mol Biol 293:41-56). Bispecific F(ab') 2 fragments can be created by chemical
   coupling of Fab' fragments or by heterodimerization through leucine zippers (see Shalaby et al
   (1992) J Exp Med 175:217-225 and Kostelny et al (1992), J Immunol 148:1547-1553).
   The term "single variable domain antibody" refers to an antibody variable domain (VH,      VHH, VL)
 0 that specifically binds an antigen or epitope independently of a different V region or domain. A
   single variable domain antibody can be present in a format (e.g., homo- or hetero-multimer) with
   other, different variable regions or variable domains where the other regions or domains are not
   required for antigen binding by the single variable domain (i.e., where the single domain
   antibody binds antigen independently of the additional variable domains). A "domain antibody"
25 or "dAb" is the same as a "single variable domain antibody" which is capable of binding to an
   antigen as the term is used herein. A single variable domain antibody may be a human antibody
   variable domain, but also includes single antibody variable domains from other species such as
   rodent (for example, as disclosed in WO 00/29004), nurse shark and camelid        VHH  dAbs.
   Camelid   VHH  are single variable domain polypeptides that are derived from species including
30 camel, llama, alpaca, dromedary, and guanaco, which produce heavy chain antibodies naturally
   devoid of light chains. Such   VHH domains may be humanised according to standard techniques

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     64
   available in the art, and such domains are still considered to be "domain antibodies" according
   to the invention. As used herein "VH" includes camelid      VHH domains.
   2.4) Homoloqous antibodies or fragments thereof and conservative variants
 5 In another embodiment of the present invention, the binding molecule is an antibody or a
   fragment thereof which has variable region heavy and light chain amino acid sequences or
   heavy and light chain amino acid sequences that are homologous to the amino acid sequences
   of the antibodies described herein, and wherein the homologous antibodies or fragment thereof
   retain the desired functional properties of the binding molecule according to the invention.
 0 For example, the invention provides an isolated antibody or fragment thereof comprising a VH
   and a VL, wherein: the VH is at least 80%, or at least 90% identical to an amino acid sequence
   selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:14; 18; 22; 25; 28; 31; 34; 37; 40; 83; 87; 90;
   93; 112; 130 or 138; the VL is at least 80%, or at least 90% identical to an amino acid sequence
   selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:16; 20; 85; 114; 132; 140; 147 or 153,
 5 wherein the homologous antibody specifically binds to IL18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18
   binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex. The homologous antibody may exhibit at least one
   additional functional properties such as inhibiting IL18 binding to IL18R or inhibiting IL18
   dependent IFN-y production.
   In other embodiments, the VH and/or VL amino acid sequences may be 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,
z0 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the sequences set forth above. In other
   embodiments, the VH and/or VL amino acid sequences may be identical except an amino acid
   substitution in no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acid positions. An antibody having VH and VL
   regions having high (i. e., 80% or greater) identity to the VH and VL regions of SEQ ID NOs 14;
   18; 22; 25; 28; 31; 34; 37; 40; 83; 87; 90; 93; 112; 130 or 138 and SEQ ID NOs 16; 20; 85; 114;
25 132; 140; 147 or 153 respectively, can be obtained by mutagenesis (e.g., site-directed or PCR
   mediated mutagenesis) of nucleic acid molecules encoding SEQ ID NOs: 15; 19; 23; 26; 29; 32;
   35; 38; 41; 84; 88; 91; 94; 113; 131; 139; 146 or 152 and 17; 21; 24; 27; 30; 33; 36; 39; 42; 86;
   89; 92; 95; 115; 133; 141; 148 or 154, respectively, followed by testing of the encoded altered
   antibody for retained function (i. e., the functions set forth above) using the functional assays
30 described herein.

        WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     65
    The homologous antibody can be, for example, a human antibody, a humanized antibody or a
    chimeric antibody. Preferably the antibody is a fully human silent IgG1 antibody.
    As used herein, the percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of
    identical positions shared by the sequences (i. e., % identity = # of identical positions/total # of
  5 positions x 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which
    need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of
    sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished
    using a mathematical algorithm, as described below.
    The percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the algorithm
 0  of E. Meyers and W. Miller, (1988) Comput. Apple. Biosci 4:11-17 which has been incorporated
    into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length
    penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. Alternatively, the percent identity between two amino acid
    sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J Mol Biol 48:444-453,
    algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package
  5 (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a
    gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    2.5) Dual Variable Domain antibodies
    Dual variable domain (DVD) antibodies comprise two or more antigen binding sites and are
/0  tetravalent or multivalent antibodies, as for example divalent and tetravalent. The multivalent
    antibody is particularly engineered to have two or more antigen binding sites, and is generally
    not a naturally occurring antibody. The DVD antibodies may be capable of binding two or more
    related or unrelated targets. Such DVD antibodies may be monospecific, i.e capable of binding
    one antigen or multispecific, i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens. In some embodiments
25  the DVD antibody comprises two heavy chains and two light chains. Each heavy chain and light
    chain comprises two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable
    domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per
    antigen binding site.

       WO 2014/037899                                                               PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     66
   In one embodiment, the binding molecule of the present invention is a dual variable domain
   (DVD) antibody which binds IL-18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP)
   complex.
   Particularly the dual variable domain antibody according to the invention is capable of binding
 5 IL-18 and a second target. The second target can be selected from IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12,
   IL-17, IL-25, IL-33, IL-1p, TNF alpha/beta and IFN-7.
   2.6) Bispecific and multispecific molecules and antibodies
   In one embodiment, the binding molecule of the present invention is an isolated bispecific
 0 antibody or fragment thereof comprising a first specificity to IL-1 8 and a second specificity to
   another polypeptide, e.g. IL-12; wherein the bispecific antibody does not bind the IL-18/IL-18
   binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
   Particularly the bispecific antibody according to the invention is capable of binding IL-18 and a
   second target. The second target can be selected from IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-12, IL-17, IL-25,
 5 IL-33, IL-1p, TNF alpha/beta and IFN-7.
   In yet another aspect, the present invention provides for a binding molecule which is an isolated
   multispecific antibody or fragment thereof comprising a first specificity to IL-18, a second
   specificity to another polypeptide, e.g. IL-12 and at least a third specificity to an another
   polypeptide, wherein the multispecific antibody does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL
20 18 BP) complex.
   Particularly the multispecific antibody according to the invention is capable of binding IL-18, a
   second and a third target. The second and third targets can be selected from IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL
   11, IL-12, IL-17, IL-25, IL-33, IL-1p, TNF alpha/beta and IFN-7.
   A bispecific isolated antibody is an isolated antibody having binding specificities for at least two
25 different epitopes. Methods of making such antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the
   recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two
   immunoglobulin H chain-L chain pairs, where the two H chains have different binding
   specificities, (see Millstein et al, (1983) Nature 305:537-539, W093/08829 and Traunecker et al,

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    67
   (1991) EMBO 10:3655-3659). Because of the random assortment of H and L chains, a potential
   mixture of ten different isolated antibody structures are produced of which only one has the
   desired binding specificity. An alternative approach involves fusing the variable domains with
   the desired binding specificities to heavy chain constant region comprising at least part of the
 5 hinge region, CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the CH1 region containing the site
   necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNA encoding these
   fusions and, if desired, the L chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors and are then
   co-transfected into a suitable host organism. It is possible though to insert the coding
   sequences for two or all three chains into one expression vector. In one preferred approach, the
 0 bispecific isolated antibody is composed of an H chain with a first binding specificity in one arm
   and an H-L chain pair, providing a second binding specificity in the other arm, see W094/04690.
   Also see Suresh et al, Methods in Enzymology 121, 210, 1986.
   Bispecific and multispecific antibodies of the invention can be derivatized or linked to another
   functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein (e.g., another antibody or ligand for a
 5 receptor) to generate a bispecific molecule that binds to at least two different binding sites or
   target molecules. An antibody of the invention may in fact be derivatized or linked to more than
   one other functional molecule to generate multi-specific molecules that bind to more than two
   different binding sites and/or target molecules; such multi-specific molecules are also intended
   to be encompassed by the term "bispecific molecule" as used herein. To create a bispecific
 0 molecule of the invention, an antibody of the invention can be functionally linked (e.g., by
   chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other
   binding molecules, such as another antibody, antibody fragment, peptide or binding mimetic,
   such that a bispecific molecule results.
   In one embodiment, the bispecific molecules of the invention comprise as a binding specificity at
25 least one antibody, or an antibody fragment thereof, including, e.g., an Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 , Fv, or
   a single chain Fv. The antibody may also be a light chain or heavy chain dimer, or any minimal
   fragment thereof such as a Fv or a single chain construct as described in Ladner et al. U.S.
   Patent No. 4,946,778.
   Other antibodies which can be employed in the bispecific molecules of the invention are murine,
30 chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies.

       WO 2014/037899                                                           PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    68
   The bispecific and multispecific molecules of the present invention can be prepared by
   conjugating the constituent binding specificities, using methods known in the art. For example,
   each binding-specificity of the bispecific molecule can be generated separately and then
   conjugated to one another. When the binding specificities are proteins or peptides, a variety of
 5 coupling or cross-linking agents can be used for covalent conjugation. Examples of cross-linking
   agents include protein A, carbodiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), 5,5'
   dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), o-phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N-succinimidyl-3-(2
   pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1
   carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g., Karpovsky et al (1984) J Exp Med; 160:1686; Liu, MA et al
 0 (1985) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA; 82:8648). Other methods include those described in Paulus
   (1985) Behring Inst Mitt; 78:118-132; Brennan et al (1985) Science ; 229:81-83), and Glennie et
   al (1987) J Immunol; 139:2367-2375. Conjugating agents are SATA and sulfo-SMCC, both
   available from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL).
   When the binding specificities are antibodies, they can be conjugated by sulphydryl bonding of
 5 the C-terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a particular embodiment, the hinge
   region is modified to contain an odd number of sulfhydryl residues, for example one, prior to
   conjugation.
   Alternatively, both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and expressed and
   assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful where the bispecific
 0 molecule is a mAb x mAb, mAb x Fab, Fab x F(ab')2 or ligand x Fab fusion protein. A bispecific
   molecule of the invention can be a single chain molecule comprising one single chain antibody
   and a binding determinant, or a single chain bispecific molecule comprising two binding
   determinants. Bispecific molecules may comprise at least two single chain molecules. Methods
   for preparing bispecific molecules are described for example in U.S. Patent Number 5,260,203;
25 U.S. Patent Number 5,455,030; U.S. Patent Number 4,881,175; U.S. Patent Number 5,132,405;

   U.S. Patent Number 5,258,498; and U.S. Patent Number 5,482,858.
   Binding of the bispecific molecules to their specific targets can be confirmed by, for example,
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), FACS analysis,
30 bioassay (e.g., growth inhibition), or Western Blot assay. Each of these assays generally

   detects the presence of protein-antibody complexes of particular interest by employing a labeled
   reagent (e.g., an antibody) specific for the complex of interest.
   2.7) Multivalent antibodies
 5 In another aspect, the present invention provides multivalent antibodies comprising at least two
   identical or different antigen-binding portions of the antibodies of the invention binding to IL-18
   and not binding the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
   In one embodiment, the multivalent antibody provides at least two, three or four antigen-binding
   portions of the antibodies described herein. The antigen-binding portions can be linked together
 0 via protein fusion or covalent or non covalent linkage. Alternatively, methods of linkage have
   been described for the bispecific molecules. Tetravalent compounds can be obtained for
   example by cross-linking antibodies of the invention with an antibody that binds to the constant
   regions of the antibodies of the invention, for example the Fc or hinge region.
 5 2.8) Immunoconjuqates
   In another embodiment, the binding molecule of the present invention is an antibody or a
   fragment thereof which binds to IL-18 but does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18
   BP) complex, wherein the antibody or fragment thereof is conjugated to a therapeutic moiety,
   such as a cytotoxin, a drug (e.g., an immunosuppressant) or a radiotoxin.
20 Such conjugates are referred to herein as "immunoconjugates". Immunoconjugates that include
   one or more cytotoxins are referred to as "immunotoxins." A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent
   includes any agent that is detrimental to (e.g., kills) cells. Examples include taxol, cytochalasin
   B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine,
   vinblastine, t. colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone,
25 mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1 -dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine,
   lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents
   also include, for example, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine,
   cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), ablating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thiotepa

   antibiotics (e.g., dactinomycin (formerly actinomycin), bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin
 5 (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine).
   Other examples of therapeutic cytotoxins that can be conjugated to an antibody of the invention
   include duocarmycins, calicheamicins, maytansines and auristatins, and derivatives thereof. An
   example of a calicheamicin antibody conjugate is commercially available (Mylotarg TM; Wyeth
   Ayerst).
 o Cytotoxins can be conjugated to antibodies of the invention using linker technology available in
   the art. Examples of linker types that have been used to conjugate a cytotoxin to an antibody
   include, but are not limited to, hydrazones, thioethers, esters, disulfides and peptide-containing
   linkers. A linker can be chosen that is, for example, susceptible to cleavage by low pH within the
   lysosomal compartment or susceptible to cleavage by proteases, such as proteases
 5 preferentially expressed in tumor tissue such as cathepsins (e.g., cathepsins B, C, D).

   Antibodies of the present invention also can be conjugated to a radioactive isotope to generate
   cytotoxic radiopharmaceuticals, also referred to as radioimmunoconjugates. Examples of
   radioactive isotopes that can be conjugated to antibodies for use diagnostically or
25 therapeutically include, but are not limited to, iodinel3l, indium111, yttrium90, and lutetium177.
   Methods for preparing radioimmunoconjugates are established in the art. Examples of
   radioimmunoconjugates are commercially available, including Zevalin TM (DEC Pharmaceuticals)
   and BexxarTM (Corixa Pharmaceuticals), and similar methods can be used to prepare
   radioimmunoconjugates using the antibodies of the invention.

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     71
   The antibody conjugates of the invention can be used to modify a given biological response,
   and the drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents.
   For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological
   activity. Such proteins may include, for example, an enzymatically active toxin, or active
 5 fragment thereof, such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; or growth
   factors.
   Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known, see, e.g.,
   Amon et al "Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy", in
   Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. (eds.), pp. 243-56 (Alan R. Liss, Inc.
 0 1985); Hellstrom et al "Antibodies For Drug Delivery", in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.),
   Robinson et al (eds.), pp. 623-53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, "Antibody Carriers Of
   Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review", in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And
   Clinical Applications, Pinchera et al. (eds.), pp. 475-506 (1985); "Analysis, Results, And Future
   Prospective Of The Therapeutic Use Of Radiolabeled Antibody In Cancer Therapy", in
 5 Monoclonal Antibodies For Cancer Detection And Therapy, Baldwin et al. (eds.), pp. 303-16
   (Academic Press 1985), and Thorpe et al., "The Preparation And Cytotoxic Properties Of
   Antibody-Toxin Conjugates", (1982) Immunol Rev; 62:119-58.
   2.9) Heteroconjuqate antibodies
 0 Heteroconjugate antibodies also form an embodiment of the present invention. Heteroconjugate
   antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies formed using any convenient
   cross-linking methods, wherein at least of the joined antibodies is an antibody according to the
   invention which binds IL-18 but does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP)
   complex. See, for example, US 4,676,980.
25
   2.10) Framework enqineerinq
   Engineered antibodies of the invention include those in which modifications have been made to
   framework residues within VH and/or VL, e.g. to improve the properties of the antibody.
   Typically such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     72
   antibody. For example, one approach is to "backmutate" one or more framework residues to the
   corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic
   mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the
   antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework
 5 sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived. To return the
   framework region sequences to their germline configuration, the somatic mutations can be
   "backmutated" to the germline sequence by, for example, site-directed mutagenesis or PCR
   mediated mutagenesis. Such "backmutated" antibodies are also intended to be encompassed
   by the invention.
 o Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the
   framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T cell -epitopes to
   thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to
   as "deimmunization" and is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Publication No.
   20030153043 by Carr et al.
 5
   2.11) Other modifications
   In addition or alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions, antibodies
   of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc region, typically to
   alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement
 0 fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an
   antibody of the invention may be chemically modified (e.g., one or more chemical moieties can
   be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation, again to alter one or more
   functional properties of the antibody. Each of these embodiments is described in further detail
   below. The numbering of residues in the Fc region is that of the EU index of Kabat.
25 In one embodiment, the hinge region of CH 1 is modified such that the number of cysteine
   residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. This approach is described
   further in U.S. Patent No. 5,677,425 by Bodmer et al. The number of cysteine residues in the
   hinge region of CH1 is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains
   or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody.

       WO 2014/037899                                                              PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                      73
   In another embodiment, the Fc hinge region of an antibody is mutated to decrease the biological
   half-life of the antibody. More specifically, one or more amino acid mutations are introduced into
   the CH2-CH3 domain interface region of the Fc-hinge fragment such that the antibody has
   impaired Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) binding relative to native Fc-hinge domain SpA
 5 binding. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,165,745 by Ward et al.
   In another embodiment, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half-life. Various
   approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be
   introduced: T252L, T254S, T256F, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,277,375 to Ward.
   Alternatively, to increase the biological half life, the antibody can be altered within the CH1 or
 0 CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 domain
   of an Fc region of an IgG, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,869,046 and 6,121,022 by Presta
   et al.
   In yet other embodiments, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue
   with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector functions of the antibody. For example,
 5 one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the
   antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the
   parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be, for example, an Fc
   receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in further detail in
   U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260, both by Winter et al.
 o Inanother embodiment, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues can be
   replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered Clq binding
   and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is
   described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,194,551 by Idusogie et al.
   In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues are altered to thereby alter the ability
25 of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO
   94/29351 by Bodmer et al.
   In yet another embodiment, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to
   mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the
   antibody for an Fcy receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. This approach is described
30 further in PCT Publication WO 00/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgG1

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                      74
   for FcyRI, FcyRlI, FcyRlIl and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding
   have been described (see Shields, R.L. et al, (2001) J Biol Chem 276:6591-6604).
   In certain embodiments, the Fc domain of IgG1 isotype is used. In some specific embodiments,
   a mutant variant of IgG1 Fc fragment is used, e.g. a silent IgG1 Fc which reduces or eliminates
 5 the ability of the fusion polypeptide to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
   and/or to bind to an Fcy receptor. An example of an IgG1 isotype silent mutant wherein Leucine
   residue is replaced by Alanine residue at amino acid positions 234 and 235 as described by
   Hezareh et al, J. Virol (2001); 75(24):12161-8.
   In certain embodiments, the Fc domain is a mutant preventing glycosylation at position 297 of
 0 Fc domain. For example, the Fc domain contains an amino acid substitution of asparagine
   residue at position 297. Example of such amino acid substitution is the replacement of N297 by
   a glycine or an alanine.
   In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an
   aglycosylated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can
 5 be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. Such
   carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by; for example, altering one or more sites of
   glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions
   can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation
   sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity
 0 of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos.
   5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al.
   Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation,
   such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody
   having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been
25 demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can
   be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered
   glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the
   art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to
   thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et
30 al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    75
   transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation.
   Therefore, in one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are produced by recombinant
   expression in a cell line which exhibit hypofucosylation pattern, for example, a mammalian cell
   line with deficient expression of the FUT8 gene encoding fucosyltransferase. PCT Publication
 5 WO 03/035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lecl3 cells, with reduced ability to
   attach fucose to Asn(297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies
   expressed in that host cell (see also Shields, R.L. et al., 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740).
   PCT Publication WO 99/54342 by Umana et al. describes cell lines engineered to express
   glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferases (e.g., beta(1,4)-N acetylglucosaminyltransferase Ill
 0 (GnTIIl)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting
   GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see also Umana
   et al., 1999 Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180). Alternatively, the antibodies of the invention can be
   produced in a yeast or a filamentous fungi engineered for mammalian-like glycosylation pattern,
   and capable of producing antibodies lacking fucose as glycosylation pattern (see for example
 5 EP1297172B1).
   Another modification of the antibodies herein that is contemplated by the invention is pegylation.
   An antibody can be pegylated to, for example, increase the biological (e.g., serum) half-life of
   the antibody. To pegylate an antibody, the antibody, or fragment thereof, typically is reacted with
   polyethylene glycol (PEG), such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG, under
 0 conditions in which one or more PEG groups become attached to the antibody or antibody
   fragment. The pegylation can be carried out by an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction
   with a reactive PEG molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer). As used herein,
   the term "polyethylene glycol" is intended to encompass any of the forms of PEG that have
   been used to derivatize other proteins, such as mono (C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene
25 glycol or polyethylene glycol-maleimide. In certain embodiments, the antibody to be pegylated is
   an aglycosylated antibody. Methods for pegylating proteins are known in the art and can be
   applied to the antibodies of the invention. See for example, EP 0 154 316 by Nishimura et al.
   and EP 0 401 384 by Ishikawa et al.
   Another modification of the antibodies that is contemplated by the invention is a conjugate or a
30 protein fusion of at least the antigen-binding region of the antibody of the invention to serum

        WO 2014/037899                                                          PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                   76
   protein, such as human serum albumin or a fragment thereof to increase half-life of the resulting
   molecule. Such approach is for example described in Ballance et al. EP0322094.
   3. Grafting antiqen-bindinq domains into alternative frameworks or scaffolds
 5 A wide variety of antibody/immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds can be employed so long as
   the resulting polypeptide includes at least one binding region which specifically binds to IL18
   and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex and wherein the binding
   molecule is not IL-18BP. Such frameworks or scaffolds include the 5 main idiotypes of human
   immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof (such as those disclosed elsewhere herein), and include
 0 immunoglobulins of other animal species, preferably having humanized aspects. Single heavy
   chain antibodies such as those identified in camelids are of particular interest in this regard.
   Novel frameworks, scaffolds and fragments continue to be discovered and developed by those
   skilled in the art.
 5 3.1) Non-immunoqlobulin frameworks
   Known or future non-immunoglobulin frameworks and scaffolds may be employed, as long as
   they comprise a binding region specific for IL-18 and not binding the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein
   (IL-18 BP) complex and wherein the binding molecule is not IL-18BP. Such compounds are
   referred herein as "polypeptides comprising a target-specific binding region". Known non
20 immunoglobulin frameworks or scaffolds include, but are not limited to, adnectins (Adnectins@
   Compound Therapeutics, Inc., Waltham, MA), DARPins, avimers, Affibodys@ (Affibody AG,
   Sweden), anticalins (Pieris Proteolab AG, Freising, Germany), Affilins@ (gamma-crystallin or
   ubiquitin; Scil Proteins GmbH, Halle, Germany) and protein epitope mimetics (PEM; Polyphor@
   Ltd, Allschwil, Switzerland).
25
   3.2) Fibronectin molecules and adnectins
   In one aspect of the invention the binding molecule is a fibronectin molecule. The fibronectin
   molecule has a scaffold based preferably on fibronectin type Ill domain (e.g., the tenth module

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     77
   of the fibronectin type Ill (10 Fn3 domain)). In one embodiment the binding molecule is an
   adnectin (Adnectins@).
   The fibronectin type Ill domain has 7 or 8 beta strands which are distributed between two beta
   sheets, which themselves pack against each other to form the core of the protein, and further
 5 containing loops (analogous to CDRs) which connect the beta strands to each other and are
   solvent exposed. There are at least three such loops at each edge of the beta sheet sandwich,
   where the edge is the boundary of the protein perpendicular to the direction of the beta strands
   (US 6,818,418).
   These fibronectin-based scaffolds are not an immunoglobulin, although the overall fold is closely
 0 related to that of the smallest functional antibody fragment, the variable region of the heavy
   chain, which comprises the entire antigen recognition unit in camel and llama IgG. Because of
   this structure, the non-immunoglobulin antibody mimics antigen binding properties that are
   similar in nature and affinity to those of antibodies. These scaffolds can be used in a loop
   randomization and shuffling strategy in vitro that is similar to the process of affinity maturation of
 5 antibodies in vivo. These fibronectin-based molecules can be used as scaffolds where the loop
   regions of the molecule can be replaced with CDRs of the invention using standard cloning
   techniques.
   Accordingly, in one embodiment the binding molecule is a fibronectin molecule that binds (e.g.
   specifically binds) to IL18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
 o Inanother embodiments the binding molecule is an adnectin that binds (e.g. specifically binds)
   to IL18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
   3.3) DARPins
   The technology is based on using proteins with ankyrin derived repeat modules as scaffolds for
25 bearing variable regions which can be used for binding to different targets. The ankyrin repeat
   module is a 33 amino acid polypeptide consisting of two anti-parallel a-helices and a     B-turn
   Binding of the variable regions is mostly optimized by using ribosome display.

       WO 2014/037899                                                           PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                   78
   Accordingly, in one embodiment the binding molecule is an ankyrin/DARPins that binds (e.g.
   specifically binds) to IL18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
   3.4) Avimers
 5 Avimers are derived from natural A-domain containing protein such as LRP-1. These domains
   are used by nature for protein-protein interactions and in human over 250 proteins are
   structurally based on A-domains. Avimers consist of a number of different "A-domain"
   monomers (2-10) linked via amino acid linkers. Avimers can be created that bind to the target
   antigen using the methodology described in, for example, US20040175756; US20050053973;
 0 US20050048512; and US20060008844.
   Accordingly, in one embodiment the binding molecule is an avimer that binds (e.g. specifically
   binds) to IL18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
   3.5) Affibody@
 5 Affibody@ are small, simple proteins composed of a three-helix bundle based on the scaffold of
   one of the IgG-binding domains of Protein A. Protein A is a surface protein from the bacterium
   Staphylococcus aureus. This scaffold domain consists of 58 amino acids, 13 of which are
   randomized to generate Affibody@ libraries with a large number of ligand variants (See e.g., US
   5,831,012). Affibody@ molecules mimic antibodies; they have a molecular weight of 6 kDa,
20 compared to the molecular weight of antibodies, which is 150 kDa. In spite of its small size, the
   binding site of Affibody@ molecules is similar to that of an antibody.
   Accordingly, in one embodiment the binding molecule is an affibody that binds (e.g. specifically
   binds) to IL18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
25 3.6) Anticalins@
   Anticalins@ are products developed by the company Pieris ProteoLab AG. They are derived
   from lipocalins, a widespread group of small and robust proteins that are usually involved in the

        WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     79
   physiological transport or storage of chemically sensitive or insoluble compounds. Several
   natural lipocalins occur in human tissues or body liquids.
   The protein architecture is reminiscent of immunoglobulins, with hypervariable loops on top of a
   rigid framework. However, in contrast with antibodies or their recombinant fragments, lipocalins
 5 are composed of a single polypeptide chain with 160 to 180 amino acid residues, being just
   marginally bigger than a single immunoglobulin domain.
   The set of four loops, which makes up the binding pocket, shows pronounced structural
   plasticity and tolerates a variety of side chains. The binding site can thus be reshaped in a
   proprietary process in order to recognize prescribed target compounds of different shape with
 0 high affinity and specificity.
   One protein of the lipocalin family, the bilin-binding protein (BBP) of Pieris Brassicae has been
   used to develop anticalins by mutagenizing the set of four loops. One example of a patent
   application describing "anticalins" is PCT WO 199916873.
   Accordingly, in one embodiment the binding molecule is an anticalin that binds (e.g. specifically
 5 binds) to IL18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex.
   3.7) Affilin@
   Affilin@ molecules are small non-immunoglobulin proteins which are designed for specific
   affinities towards proteins and small molecules. New Affilin@ molecules can be very quickly
20 selected from two libraries, each of which is based on a different human derived scaffold
   protein.
   AffilinTM molecules do not show any structural homology to immunoglobulin proteins. Scil
   Proteins employs two AffilinTM scaffolds, one of which is gamma crystalline, a human structural
   eye lens protein and the other is "ubiquitin" superfamily proteins. Both human scaffolds are very
25 small, show high temperature stability and are almost resistant to pH changes and denaturing
   agents. This high stability is mainly due to the expanded beta sheet structure of the proteins.

25 The polynucleotide may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or may be in a partially
   purified or substantially pure form. A polynucleotide is "isolated" or "rendered substantially pure"
   when purified away from other cellular components or other contaminants, e.g., other cellular
   nucleic acids or proteins, by standard techniques, including alkaline/SDS treatment, CsCI
   banding, column chromatography, agarose gel electrophoresis and others well known in the art.

   See, F. Ausubel, et al., (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and
   Wiley Interscience, New York. A polynucleotide of the invention can be, for example, DNA or
   RNA and may or may not contain intronic sequences. In an embodiment, the polynucleotide is a
   cDNA molecule. The polynucelotide may be present in a vector such as a phage display vector,
 5 or in a recombinant plasmid vector.
   Polynucleotides of the invention can be obtained using standard molecular biology techniques.
   For antibodies expressed by hybridomas (e.g., hybridomas prepared from transgenic mice
   carrying human immunoglobulin genes as described further below), cDNAs encoding the light
   and heavy chains of the antibody made by the hybridoma can be obtained by standard PCR
 0 amplification or cDNA cloning techniques. For antibodies obtained from an immunoglobulin
   gene library (e.g., using phage display techniques), polynucleotides encoding the antibody can
   be recovered from various phage clones that are members of the library.
   Once DNA fragments encoding VH and VL segments are obtained, these DNA fragments can
   be further manipulated by standard recombinant DNA techniques, for example to convert the
 5 variable region genes to full-length antibody chain genes, to Fab fragment genes or to an scFv
   gene. In these manipulations, a VL- or VH-encoding DNA fragment is operatively linked to
   another DNA molecule, or to a fragment encoding another protein, such as an antibody constant
   region or a flexible linker. The term "operatively linked", as used in this context, is intended to
   mean that the two DNA fragments are joined in a functional manner, for example, such that the
 0 amino acid sequences encoded by the two DNA fragments remain in-frame, or such that the
   protein is expressed under control of a desired promoter.
   The isolated DNA encoding the VH region can be converted to a full-length heavy chain gene by
   operatively linking the VH-encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding heavy chain
   constant regions (CH1, CH2 and CH3). The sequences of human heavy chain constant region
25 genes are known in the art (see e.g., Kabat, E. A., el al., (1991) Sequences of Proteins of
   Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH
   Publication No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by
   standard PCR amplification. The heavy chain constant region can be an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3,
   IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant region. In some embodiments, the heavy chain contstant
30 region is selected among IgG1 isotypes. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the VH-

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                   84
   encoding DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule encoding only the heavy
   chain CH1 constant region.
   The isolated DNA encoding the VL region can be converted to a full-length light chain gene (as
   well as to a Fab light chain gene) by operatively linking the VL-encoding DNA to another DNA
 5 molecule encoding the light chain constant region, CL. The sequences of human light chain
   constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g., Kabat, E. A., et al., (1991) Sequences of
   Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human
   Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can
   be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or a
 0 lambda constant region.
   To create an scFv gene, the VH- and VL-encoding DNA fragments are operatively linked to
   another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino acid sequence (Gly4
   Ser)3, such that the VH and VL sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single-chain
   protein, with the VL and VH regions joined by the flexible linker (see e.g., Bird et al., 1988
 5 Science 242:423-426; Huston et at., (1988) Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883;
   McCafferty et al., (1990) Nature 348:552-554).
   The polynucleotide according to any one of embodiments 89 to 93 may be in-vitro modified in
   such a way that when injected into a mammalian cells, it prevents digestion of the
   polynucleotide and allows the translation machinery of the mammalian cell to produce an
 0 antibody starting from the modified polynucleotide (such as described in U.S. Pat. No.
   8,278,036 B2 to Kariko et al.). Such an in vitro-synthesized modified RNA can then be injected
   into a mammalian cells or into a patient as part of a gene therapy.
   Hence, another aspect of the present invention encompasses a method for inducing a
   mammalian cell to produce an antibody as described herein, the method comprising: contacting
25 said mammalian cell with in vitro-synthesized modified RNA derived from a polynucleotide
   according to any one of embodiments 89 to 93, wherein said in vitro-synthesized modified RNA
   comprises one or more modification as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,278,036 B2.

   Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be produced by a variety of techniques, including
   conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g., the standard somatic cell hybridization
   technique of Kohler and Milstein, (1975) Nature 256: 495. Many techniques for producing
   monoclonal antibody can be employed e.g., viral or oncogenic transformation of B lymphocytes.
 5 Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are
   known in the art. Fusion partners (e.g., murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures are also
   known.
   Chimeric or humanized monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can be prepared based
   on the sequence of a murine monoclonal antibody prepared as described above. DNA encoding
 0 the heavy and light chain of immunoglobulins can be obtained from the murine hybridoma of
   interest and engineered to contain non-murine (e.g.,. human) immunoglobulin sequences using
   standard molecular biology techniques. For example, to create a chimeric antibody, the murine
   variable regions can be linked to human constant regions using methods known in the art (see
   e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et al.). To create a humanized antibody, the murine
 5 CDR regions can be inserted into a human framework using methods known in the art. See e.g.,
   U.S. Patent No. 5225539 to Winter, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5530101; 5585089; 5693762 and
   6180370 to Queen et al.
   Human monoclonal antibodies can be generated using transgenic or transchromosomic mice
   carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic
 0 and transchromosomic mice include mice referred to herein as HuMAb mice and KM mice,
   respectively, and are collectively referred to herein as "human Ig mice."
   The HuMAb mouse@ (Medarex, Inc.) contains human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that
   encode un-rearranged human heavy (p and y) and        K light chain immunoglobulin sequences,
   together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous p and    K chain loci (see e.g.,
25 Lonberg et al (1994) Nature; 368(6474): 856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced
   expression of mouse IgM or    K, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy
   and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high
   affinity human IgGK monoclonal (Lonberg, N et al (1994) supra; reviewed in Lonberg, N (1994)

   In one embodiment, human antibodies according to the invention can be raised using a mouse
   that carries human immunoglobulin sequences on transgenes and transchomosomes such as a
   mouse that carries a human heavy chain transgene and a human light chain transchromosome.
 5 Such mice, referred to herein as "KM mice", are described in detail in PCT Publication WO
   02/43478 to Ishida et al.
   Still further, alternative transgenic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin genes are
   available in the art and can be used to raise antibodies of the invention. For example, an
   alternative transgenic system referred to as the Xenomouse (Abgenix, Inc.) can be used. Such
 0 mice are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,939,598; 6,075,181; 6,114,598; 6, 150,584 and
   6,162,963 to Kucherlapati et al.
   Moreover, alternative transchromosomic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin
   genes are available in the art and can be used to raise antibodies of the invention. For example,
   mice carrying both a human heavy chain transchromosome and a human light chain
25 tranchromosome, referred to as "TC mice" can be used; such mice are described in Tomizuka
   et al., 2000 Proc. NatI. Acad. Sci. USA 97:722-727. Furthermore, cows carrying human heavy
   and light chain transchromosomes have been described in the art (Kuroiwa et al., 2002 Nature
   Biotech 20:889-894).
   Human recombinant antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using phage display
30 methods for screening libraries of human immunoglobulin genes. Such phage display methods

   for isolating human antibodies are established in the art or described in the examples below.
   See for example: U.S. Patent Nos. 5,223,409; 5,403,484; and 5,571,698 to Ladner et al.; U.S.
   Patent Nos. 5,427,908 and 5,580,717 to Dower et al.; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,969,108 and
   6,172,197 to McCafferty et al.; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,885,793; 6,521,404; 6,544,731;
 5 6,555,313; 6,582,915 and 6,593,081 to Griffiths et al.
   Human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using SCID mice into
   which human immune cells have been reconstituted such that a human antibody response can
   be generated upon immunization. Such mice are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.
   5,476,996 and 5,698,767 to Wilson et al.
 o Antibodies of the invention also can be produced in a host cell transfectoma using, for example,
   a combination of recombinant DNA techniques and gene transfection methods as is well known
   in the art (e.g., Morrison, S. (1985) Science 229:1202).
   For example, to express the antibodies, or antibody fragments thereof, DNAs encoding partial or
   full-length light and heavy chains, can be obtained by standard molecular biology techniques
 5 (e.g., PCR amplification or cDNA cloning using a hybridoma that expresses the antibody of
   interest) and the DNAs can be inserted into cloning or expression vectors such that the genes
   are operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control sequences. In this context, the
   term "operatively linked" is intended to mean that an antibody gene is ligated into a vector such
   that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector serve their intended
 0 function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The cloning or
   expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the
   expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can
   be inserted into separate vector or, more typically, both genes are inserted into the same
   expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector by standard
25 methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment and
   vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present). The light and heavy chain variable
   regions of the antibodies described herein can be used to create full-length antibody genes of

   constant and light chain constant regions of the desired isotype such that the VH segment is

   expression vector can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain
   from a host cell. The antibody chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal
   peptide is linked in frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide
   can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide (i.e., a signal peptide
 5 from a non-immunoglobulin protein).
   In one aspect, the invention provides a cloning or expression vector comprising one or more
   polynucleotides according to the invention.
   Embodiment 94:The cloning or expression vector which comprises at least one polynucleotide
   selected from: SEQ ID NO: 44 or SEQ ID NO: 48 or SEQ ID NO: 51 or SEQ ID NO: 54 or SEQ
 0 ID NO: 57 or SEQ ID NO: 101 or SEQ ID NO: 159 or SEQ ID NO: 97 or SEQ ID NO: 104 or
   SEQ ID NO: 117 or SEQ ID NO: 143 or SEQ ID NO: 135 or SEQ ID NO: 149 or SEQ ID NO:

   NO: 119 or SEQ ID NO: 145 or SEQ ID NO: 137 or SEQ ID NO: 151 or SEQ ID NO: 157.
 5 In addition to the polynucleotides encoding the antibody chains, the cloning or expression
   vectors of the invention carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody
   chain genes in a host cell. The term "regulatory sequence" is intended to include promoters,
   enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals) that control the
   transcription or translation of the antibody chain genes. Such regulatory sequences are
 0 described, for example, in Goeddel (Gene Expression Technology. Methods in Enzymology
   185, Academic Press, San Diego, CA 1990). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
   the design of the expression vector, including the selection of regulatory sequences, may
   depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression
   of protein desired, etc. Regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral
25 elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells, such as promoters
   and/or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV), Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus
   (e.g., the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP)), and polyoma. Alternatively, nonviral
   regulatory sequences may be used, such as the ubiquitin promoter or P-globin promoter. Still
   further, regulatory elements composed of sequences from different sources, such as the SRa
30 promoter system, which contains sequences from the SV40 early promoter and the long

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     89
   terminal repeat of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (Takebe, Y. et al., 1988 Mol. Cell. Biol.
   8:466-472).
   Furthermore, the cloning or expression vectors of the invention may carry additional sequences,
   such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of
 5 replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of
   host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216,
   4,634,665 and 5,179,017, all by Axel et al.). For example, typically the selectable marker gene
   confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin or methotrexate, on a host cell into
   which the vector has been introduced. Selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate
 0 reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr- host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification)
   and the neo gene (for G418 selection).
   For expression of the light and heavy chains, the expression vector(s) encoding the heavy and
   light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term
   "transfection" are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the
 5 introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g., electroporation,
   calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. It is theoretically
   possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells.
   Expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells, for example mammalian host cells, yeast or
   filamentous fungi, is discussed because such eukaryotic cells, and in particular mammalian
 0 cells, are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and
   immunologically active antibody. Prokaryotic expression of antibody genes has been reported to
   be ineffective for production of high yields of active antibody (Boss, M. A. and Wood, C. R.,
   1985 Immunology Today 6:12-13).
   Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing vectors encoding antibodies of the invention are
25 prokaryotic, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Suitable prokaryotic cells include eubacteria e.g.
   enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia e.g. E.coli (for example ATCC 31, 446; 31, 537;
   27,325), Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella proteus, Salmonella e.g. Salmonella typhimurium,
   Serratia e.g. Serratia marcescens and Shigella as well as Bacilli such as B. subtilis and B.
   licheniformis (see DD 266 710), Pseudomonas such as P. aeruginosa and Streptomyces. Of the
30 yeast or fungi host cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
   Kluyveromyces (e.g. ATCC 16,045; 12,424; 24178; 56,500), Yarrowia (EP402, 226), Pichia

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317

   Trichoderma reesei (EP244234), Penicillium, Tolypocladium and Aspergillus hosts such as A.
   nidulans and A. niger are also contemplated.
   Although prokaryotic and yeast host cells are specifically contemplated by the invention,
 5 preferably however, host cells of the present invention are higher eukaryotic cells.
   Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention provides for a host cell comprising one or more
   cloning or expression vectors comprising the polynucleotides as described herein.
   In another aspect, the invention provide a stably transformed or transfected host cell comprising
   one or more polynucleotides as described herein.
 0 Embodiment 95: A stably transformed host cell comprising a vector encoding a heavy chain
   and/or light chain of the isolated antibody or fragment thereof according to any one of
   embodiments 1 to 88. Preferably such host cells comprise a first vector encoding the light chain
   and a second vector encoding said heavy chain.
   Suitable higher eukaryotic host cells include mammalian cells such as COS-1 (ATCC No.CRL
 5 1650) COS-7 (ATCC CRL 1651), human embryonic kidney line 293, baby hamster kidney cells
   (BHK) (ATCC CRL.1632), BHK570 (ATCC NO: CRL 10314), 293 (ATCC NO.CRL 1573),
   Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO (e.g. CHO-K1 , ATCC NO: CCL 61 , DHFR-CHO cell line
   such as DG44 (see Urlaub et al, (1986) Somatic Cell Mol.Genet.12, 555-556)), particularly
   those CHO cell lines adapted for suspension culture, mouse Sertoli cells, monkey kidney cells,
/O African green monkey kidney cells (ATCC CRL-1587), HELA cells, canine kidney cells (ATCC
   CCL 34), human lung cells (ATCC CCL 75), Hep G2 and myeloma or lymphoma cells e.g. NSO
   (see US5807715), Sp2/0, YO.
   Preferably, the mammalian host cells for expressing the binding molecule of the invention
   include mammalian cell lines deficient for FUT8 gene expression, for example as described in
25 US6946292.
   Host cells transformed with vectors encoding the binding molecules may be cultured by any
   method known to those skilled in the art. Host cells may be cultured in spinner flasks, roller
   bottles or hollow fibre systems but it is preferred for large scale production that stirred tank
   reactors are used particularly for suspension cultures. Preferably the stirred tankers are adapted

       WO 2014/037899                                                                  PCT/IB2013/058317

   for aeration using e.g. spargers, baffles or low shear impellers. For bubble columns and airlift
   reactors direct aeration with air or oxygen bubbles maybe used. Where the host cells are
   cultured in a serum free culture media it is preferred that the media is supplemented with a cell
   protective agent such as pluronic F-68 to help prevent cell damage as a result of the aeration
 5 process. Depending on the host cell characteristics, either microcarriers maybe used as growth
   substrates for anchorage dependent cell lines or the cells maybe adapted to suspension culture
   (which is typical). The culturing of host cells, particularly invertebrate host cells may utilise a
   variety of operational modes such as fed-batch, repeated batch processing (see Drapeau et al
   (1994) cytotechnology 15: 103-109), extended batch process or perfusion culture. Although
 0 recombinantly transformed mammalian host cells may be cultured in serum-containing media
   such as fetal calf serum (FCS), it is preferred that such host cells are cultured in synthetic serum
   -free media such as disclosed in Keen et al (1995) Cytotechnology 17:153-163, or commercially
   available media such as ProCHO-CDM or UltraCHO(TM) (Cambrex NJ, USA), supplemented
   where necessary with an energy source such as glucose and synthetic growth factors such as
 5 recombinant insulin. The serum-free culturing of host cells may require that those cells are
   adapted to grow in serum free conditions. One adaptation approach is to culture such host cells
   in serum containing media and repeatedly exchange 80% of the culture medium for the serum
   free media so that the host cells learn to adapt in serum free conditions (see e.g. Scharfenberg
   K et al (1995) in Animal Cell technology: Developments towards the 21st century (Beuvery E.G.
 o et al eds), pp619-623, Kluwer Academic publishers).
   Binding molecules of the invention secreted into the media may be recovered and purified using
   a variety of techniques to provide a degree of purification suitable for the intended use. For
   example the use of isolated antibodies of the invention for the treatment of human patients
   typically mandates at least 95% purity, more typically 98% or 99% or greater purity (compared
25 to the crude culture medium). In the first instance, cell debris from the culture media is typically
   removed using centrifugation followed by a clarification step of the supernatant using e.g.
   microfiltration, ultrafiltration and/or depth filtration. A variety of other techniques such as dialysis
   and gel electrophoresis and chromatographic techniques such as hydroxyapatite (HA), affinity
   chromatography (optionally involving an affinity tagging system such as polyhistidine) and/or
30 hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC, see US5429746) are available. In one
   embodiment, the antibodies of the invention, following various clarification steps, are captured
   using Protein A or G affinity chromatography followed by further chromatography steps such as

       WO 2014/037899                                                           PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                   92
   ion exchange and/or HA chromatography, anion or cation exchange, size exclusion
   chromatography and ammonium sulfate precipitation. Typically, various virus removal steps are
   also employed (e.g. nanofiltration using e.g. a DV-20 filter). Following these various steps, a
   purified (preferably monoclonal) preparation comprising at least 75mg/ml or greater e.g.
 5 100mg/ml or greater of the isolated antibody of the invention or antigen binding fragment thereof
   is provided and therefore forms an embodiment of the invention. Suitably such preparations are
   substantially free of aggregated forms of antibodies of the invention.
   Bacterial systems may be used for the expression of non-immunoglobulin binding molecules
   described above. Bacterial systems are also particularly suited for the expression of isolated
 0 antibody fragments. Such fragments are localised intracellularly or within the periplasma.
   Insoluble periplasmic proteins can be extracted and refolded to form active proteins according to
   methods known to those skilled in the art, see Sanchez et al (1999) J.Biotechnol. 72, 13-20 and
   Cu pit PM et al (1999) Lett Appl Microbiol, 29, 273-277.
   Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention provide a method for producing a binding
 5 molecule which binds IL-18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP)
   complex wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell under conditions suitable for
   producing the binding molecule, wherein the host cell comprises a vector as described herein.
   Embodiment 95: The method of producing a human antibody or a fragment thereof according to
   any one of embodiments 1 to 88, wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell under
 0 conditions suitable for producing the binding molecule, wherein the host cell comprises a vector
   as described herein.
   6. Pharmaceutical compositions
   The invention provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising the binding molecule which
   binds IL-18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex and wherein
25 the binding molecule is not IL-18BP and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
   Embodiment 96: The pharmaceutical compositions comprising a human antibody or a fragment
   thereof according to any one of embodiments 1 to 88 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
   The compositions can additionally contain other therapeutic agents that are suitable for treating
   or preventing a human disease or disorder noted below. Pharmaceutically carriers enhance or

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                        93
   stabilize the composition, or facilitate the preparation of the composition. Pharmaceutically
   acceptable carriers include solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal
   agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically
   compatible.
 5 A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of
   methods known in the art. The route and/or mode of administration vary depending upon the
   desired results. It is preferred that administration be intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,
   or subcutaneous, or administered proximal to the site of the target. The pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier should be suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral,
 0 spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of
   administration, the active compound (particularly low molecular weight chemical entities) may
   be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural
   conditions that may inactivate the compound.
   The composition should be sterile and fluid. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by
 5 use of coating such as lecithin, by maintenance of required particle size in the case of
   dispersion and by use of surfactants. In many cases, it is preferable to include isotonic agents,
   for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the
   composition. Long-term absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by
   including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum
 0 monostearate or gelatin.
   Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be prepared in accordance with methods well
   known and routinely practiced in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of
   Pharmacy, Mack Publishing Co.,       2 0 th ed., 2000; and Sustained and Controlled Release Drug
   Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978. Pharmaceutical
25 compositions are preferably manufactured under GMP conditions. Typically, a therapeutically
   effective dose or efficacious dose of an antibody of the invention described herein is employed
   in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. They are typically formulated into
   pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in
   the art. Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a
30 therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses
   may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     94
   indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to
   formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity
   of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary
   dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active
 5 compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required
   pharmaceutical carrier.
   Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present
   invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to
   achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of
 0 administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level depends upon a
   variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the
   present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the
   time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the
   duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with
 5 the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior
   medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors.
   A physician can start doses of the antibodies of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical
   composition at levels lower than that required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and
   gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, effective doses of
 0 the compositions of the present invention, for the treatment of a fibrotic disease or disorder
   described herein vary depending upon many different factors, including means of
   administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an
   animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic.
   Treatment dosages need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. For administration with
25 an antibody, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5
   mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg
   body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime entails
   administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months.
   Binding molecules of the invention, especially antibodies and fragments thereof, are usually
30 administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be weekly, monthly
   or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of therapeutic

       WO 2014/037899                                                              PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     95
   protein in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody
   concentration of 1-1000 pg/ml and in some methods 25-300 pg/ml. Alternatively, antibodies of
   the invention can be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less
   frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the
 5 antibody in the patient. In general, humanized antibodies show longer half life than that of
   chimeric antibodies and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration
   can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic
   (preventative) applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent
   intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of
 0 their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is
   sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably
   until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the
   patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.
   The pharmaceutical composition may comprise (e.g. as its sole therapeutically active ingredient)
 5 a binding molecule that binds with IL18 (e.g. specifically binds) and does not bind the IL-18/IL
   18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex, wherein the binding molecule is not IL-18BP, wherein
   the binding molecule is selected from : an isolated antibody, a fragment of an isolated antibody,
   a single variable domain antibody, a bi- or multi-specific antibody, a multivalent antibody, a dual
   variable domain antibody, an immuno-conjugate, a fibronectin molecule, an adnectin, a DARPin,
 0 an avimer, an affibody, an anticalin, an affilin, a protein epitope mimetic or combinations thereof
   and wherein the composition may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
   Typically the composition will be in an intravenously, inhalable or subcutaneously administrable
   form. In other embodiments, the composition maybe in lyophilized form.

   8. Diagnostic uses and kits
   One of the advantages of the binding molecule or isolated antibody or fragment thereof as
   described herein is that they bind IL-18 but do not bind the IL-18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18
   BP) complex and that they are not IL-18BP. Hence, the binding molecule or isolated antibody or
 0 fragment thereof as described herein are capable of only detecting free IL-18, not bound to IL
   18BP. As free IL-18 is the biologically active molecule, it becomes immediately apparent that a
   binding molecule capable of recognizing only such entity may allow differentiation of free IL-18
   from IL-18 bound to IL-18BP, which is inactive. Moreover, as the binding molecules of the
   invention do not encompass the IL-18BP, either isolated or naturally occurring, they lend
 5 themselves not only as therapeutic agents but also as tools in many other applications such as
   in diagnosis or in a diagnostic kit.
   Hence, in another aspect, the present invention provides for binding molecules or isolated
   antibodies or fragments thereof as described herein which bind IL-1 8 and do not bind the IL
   18/IL-18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex wherein the binding molecule is not IL-18BP for use
 0 in diagnosis or for use in a diagnostic kit.
   The binding molecules or the isolated antibody or a fragment thereof as described herein can be
   used in combination with detecting antibodies in ELISA assays, western blots etc. and can be
   used only to detect the presence of free IL-18 but also to measure the amount of free IL-18.
   Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides for binding molecules or isolated
25 antibodies or fragments thereof which bind IL-1 8 and do not bind the IL-1 8/IL-1 8 binding protein
   (IL-18 BP) complex wherein the binding molecule is not IL-18BP for use in diagnosis or for use
   in detecting and/or measuring the presence and/or the amount of free IL-18 (i.e. IL-18 not bound
   to IL-18BP) in a sample.

 0           inflammatory disease or disorder) with the binding molecule or the isolated antibody or a
             fragment thereof as described herein which binds IL-18 and does not bind the IL-18/IL
             18 binding protein (IL-18 BP) complex wherein the binding molecule is not IL-18BP;
          b. measuring the level of free IL-18;
          c. optionally, measuring the level of total IL-18 and IL-18 BP;
 5        d. wherein the steps b) and c) may be carried out simultaneously or consecutively or in

   The antibodies and fragments thereof were generated by phage display. The phagemid library
   used is based on the HuCAL@ concept (Knappik,A. at al. (2000) J Mol Biol 296, 57-86) and
   employs the CysDisplayTM technology for displaying the Fab on the phage surface (WO
   01/05950). To increase affinity and biological activity of selected antibody fragments, L-CDR3

   Antibody MOR9464 when formulated in a liquid formulation appeared to lose potency over time.
   It was hypothesized that the molecule may undergo some modifications which affected its
   potency. MOR9464 was incubated at a temperature higher than physiological temperature to
   accelerate the appearing of the loss of potency. By combining complex biophysical techniques,
 5 including mass spectrometry and reverse phase HPLC, two distinct, yet unknown, forms of
   MOR9464 were isolated.
   A number of modifications may occur to protein when they are in the extracellular media, during
   in vitro manipulation and in vivo circulation. Whatever the modification is, it can widely impact
   the properties relevant to protein-based pharmaceutical. Hence, it becomes paramount to
 0 understand the structure-functional relationship of these modifications. Exocellular modifications
   are modifications which occur soon after therapeutic proteins complete the trafficking pathway,
   reach cell surface and they are released in the extracellular medium environment and incubated
   there during the production period. They also encompass modification occurring during in vitro
   manipulation, such as purification and formulation in suitable buffers, or even in vivo circulation
 5 (Zhong X. and Wright J.F., Int J of Cell Biol., 2013, 1-19). Proteolytic processing is the most
   common and well-known exocellular modifications as its products are easily identified. Oxidation
   of single amino acid residues may be more difficult to characterize and may involve methionine
   residues as well as tryptophan, cysteine, histidine and tyrosine residues . N-terminal
   pyroglutamate formation is also a well-known exocellular modification whereby the N-terminal
 0 Glutamine or Glutamate residues can readily cyclize with its own terminal group to form
   pyrrolidone carboxylic acid. Deamidation of asparagine and aspartate residues or aspartate
   isomerization are also known, yet not well characterized modifications.
   If the exocellular modifications occur in specific regions of the antibody, they may have a deep
   effect on the functional characteristics of an antibody, such as loss of potency. If the
25 modification occurs in the CDR or in a very near location, it may impact of the ability of the
   antibody to recognize and/or specifically bind its antigen.
   Analyses of the MOR9464 sequence were carried out to identify potential site of exocellular
   modifications. The mutants shown in Table 1B were generated.

    Asparagine 30 just flanking the H-CDR1 of MOR9464 was considered to be a possible site of
    modification, together with serine 31 in the H-CDR1 and methionine 54 in the H-CDR2. Non
    enzymatic deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues to aspartate and glutamate
    occurs through hydrolytic reaction and is pH, temperature and ionic strength-dependent. It also
  5 depends on the amino acid residues preceding the asparagine and glutamine residues, with
    serine and threonine increasing the deamidation rates.
    Most of the MOR10222_S31X mutants, with or without methionine mutation, heavily aggregated
    after production. Hence these mutants were not characterized any further.
    9.3) Determination of Affinities Usinq Solution Equilibrium Titration (SET)
 0  For  KD  determination by solution equilibrium titration (SET), monomer fractions of antibodies
    were used (analyzed by analytical SEC).
    Affinity determination in solution was basically performed as described in the literature (Friguet
    B at al. (1985) J Immunol Methods;77(2):305-19). In order to improve the sensitivity and
    accuracy of the SET method, it was transferred from classical ELISA to electro
  5 chemiluminescent (ECL)-based technology (Haenel C et al. (2005) Anal Biochem;339(1):182
    4.).
    Goat-anti-human (Fab) 2 fragment specific antibodies (Dianova) were labeled with MSD SULFO
    TAGTM NHS-Ester (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the
    manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were carried out in polypropylene microtiter plates and
/0  phosphate-based assay buffer. Unlabeled human IL-18 was serially diluted, starting with a
    concentration at least 10 times higher than the expected     KD. Wells without antigen were used to
    determine Bmax values; wells with assay buffer were used to determine background. After
    addition of a constant amount of antibodies or fragment thereof (e.g. 1OpM final concentration in
    60pl final volume), the mixture was incubated over night at RT. The applied antibodies or
25  fragments thereof concentration was similar to or below the expected      KD
    Streptavidin MSD plates were blocked with BSA-containing phosphate buffer over night. After
    blocking of the plate, biotinylated human IL-1 8 was added and incubated for 1h at RT.
    Subsequently the equilibrated samples were transferred to those plates and incubated for a

  short time at RT. After washing, MSD SULFO-TAG labeled detection antibody (goat anti-human
  (Fab) 2) was added to the MSD plate and incubated for a short time at RT.
  After washing the plate and adding MSD Read Buffer T with surfactant, electrochemi
  luminescence signals were detected using a Sector Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery,
5 Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
  Data was evaluated with XLfit (IDBS) software applying customized fitting models. For       KD
  determination of Fab molecules the following fit model was used (according to Haenel et al.,
  2005), modified according to Abraham et al,1996):

  In principle the same protocol was applied to determine      KD values for antibodies and fragments
5 with the following differences: whole antibodies were added to the dilution series of antigen, and
  equilibrated over night at RT. Subsequently, the samples were treated as described above.
  For data evaluation i.e.  KD determination of IgG molecules the following fit model for IgG was
  used (modified according to Piehler et al., 1997):
                                                                           2

   Affinities of the anti-IL-1 8 antibodies or fragments thereof were determined in solution using the
   assay conditions described above and are indicated in Table 2A (column 2). Where IL-18 from

   9.4) Inhibition of IFN-y release from IL-18 stimulated human PBMCs
   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were freshly isolated from heparinized human
   whole blood using standard techniques. Briefly, diluted blood containing Heparin (15U/ml) as
 0 an anti-coagulant was layered onto Ficoll-Paque TMPlus and centrifuged (800xg, 20 minutes,
   180C). The PBMCs were collected from the plasma:Ficoll interface and washed twice (600xg,
   10 minutes, 40C), before re-suspending in medium.
   PBMCs were re-suspended in media and applied to a 96 well cell culture plate to give a final cell
   density of 1.5x1 06/ml (in a final assay volume of 200l). To ensure the antibodies and fragment
 5 thereof according to the invention recognised native IL-18, which may be glycosylated, PBMCs
   were stimulated with LPS and IL-12 which induces IFN-y via IL-18-dependent autocrine
   feedback.
   Cells were stimulated with 3nM human recombinant IL-18 plus IL-12 (1ng/ml) or LPS (3 g/ml)
   plus IL-12 (10ng/ml) to induce secretion of native IL-18 protein (all final concentrations). In the
20 case of recombinant human IL-18, the concentration selected was pre-determined as an
   approximate EC8 0 in this assay. In the case of native IL-18, LPS stimulates production of IL-18,
   whilst IL-12 increases IL-18 receptor expression (Yoshimoto T et al. (1998) J Immunol;
   161(7):3400-7). The extent of IL-18-dependency in this assay was determined via inclusion of
   the highly specific protein, IL-18 Binding Protein-IgG, Fc (hlL-18BPa-Fc) as a positive control
25 (dotted line in Figures 3 (A-D).
   To assess their potency and efficacy, the antibodies and fragments thereof were pre
   equilibrated for 30 min with either IL-12 and LPS (native conditions) or IL-12 and IL-18

  (recombinant conditions) prior to applying to cells with a final concentration between 0.1 and
  300nM. Anti-lysozyme control antibody MOR03207 was used as a negative control.
  From each treatment group, a mean ± SEM value (where n=3 or more) was determined from
  n=2-5 wells.
5 Cells were incubated at 370C, 5% CO 2 for 24 hours after treatment, after which time the
  supernatant was collected by centrifugation (1200rpm for 5 min) and stored at -200C for
  subsequent analysis. IFN-y protein levels were assessed using ELISA as per the manufacturer's
  instructions.
  All antibodies and fragments thereof dose-dependently inhibited IFN-y production with a similar
0 level of efficacy achieved at the highest concentrations as that seen for recombinant IL-18BPa
  Fc (Table 2A columns 5-6, Table 2B column 2 and Figures 3 (A-D) where efficacy of the IL
  18BPa is denoted by dotted line). The control antibody, MOR03207 (anti-lysozyme control
  antibody) did not inhibit the IL-18 response. Germlining antibodies, (e.g. MOR1 0579 from
  MOR09441 and MOR1 0222 ) from MOR09464 did not significantly alter their neutralizing
5 capacity. Mutants of MOR9464 and MOR10222, in particular MOR9464_N30K and
  MOR10222_N30S_M541 did have comparable neutralizing capacity to the wild type antibodies.

  9.5) Inhibition of IFN-y release from IL-18 stimulated KG-1 cells
  Anti-IL-18 antibodies and fragments thereof were analyzed for their ability to inhibit IFN-y
  release from IL-18-stimulated KG-1 cells. In the absence of an antagonist, IL-18 promotes
5 maximal stimulation of IFN-y release in the presence of a co-stimulus such as TNFaX and IL-12
  through upregulation of IL-18 receptors (Nakamura S et al. (2000) Leukemia;14(6):1052-9).
  Inhibitory activity of the antibodies and fragments was assessed against 1nM of either human or
  cynomolgus IL-18 (unless otherwise specified), predetermined as an EC80 in this cell-based
  system.

       WO 2014/037899                                                              PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                       116
   KG-1 cells were re-suspended in culture media and applied to a 96 well cell culture plate to give
   a final cell density of 0.3 x10 6/ml (in a final assay volume of 200pl). Cells were stimulated with
   1nM human or cynomolgus recombinant IL-18 plus TNFax (final concentration 20ng/ml). The
   concentration of recombinant IL-18 selected was pre-determined as an approximate EC80 in this
 5 assay.
   To assess the potency and efficacy of these antibodies, the antibodies and fragments thereof
   were pre-equilibrated for 30 min with TNFax and IL-18 (human or cynomolgus) prior to applying
   to cells with a final concentration between 0.1 and 300nM. Anti-lysozyme control antibody
   MOR03207 was used as a negative control.
 o From each treatment group, a mean ± SEM value (where available) was determined from n = 2
   5 wells.
   Cells were incubated at 370C, 5% CO 2 for 24 hours after treatment, after which time the
   supernatant was collected by centrifugation (885 x g for 5 min) and stored at -20C for
   subsequent analysis. IFN-y protein levels were assessed using ELISA as per the manufacturer's
 5 instructions.
   All antibodies and fragments thereof dose-dependently inhibited IFN-y production with full
   inhibition achieved at the highest concentrations. For affinity-matured antibodies, IC50 values
   ranged from 0.3-0.8 nM against 0.8 nM human IL-18, therefore representing a 1:1 molar ratio
   antibody:antigen or better. VH4_3b framework antibodies (MOR08776, MOR010501,
 0 MOR010502) demonstrated similar potency against both human and cynomolgus IL-18, whilst
   VH1A_3 framework antibodies were slightly less potent against cynomolgus IL-18 (Table 2,
   columns 3 and 4). The control antibody, MOR03207 did not inhibit the IL-18 response.
   9.6) IL-18 induced INF-y release in human whole blood
25 The whole blood assay incorporates both the presence and function of the endogenous IL-18BP
   since the IL-18BP is primarily generated by the spleen and is present systemically at levels of
   around 10-20ng/ml in healthy individuals.             IL-18BP binds with high affinity to IL-18 and

       WO 2014/037899                                                             PCT/IB2013/058317

   neutralizes its activity, and therefore might represent a sink for antibodies that recognize
   accessible epitopes of this complex.
   The activity of the anti-IL-18 antibodies was assessed in heparinized human whole blood taken
   from a healthy volunteer. All reagents were prepared at twenty-fold the final desired
 5 concentration using serum free medium. Cells were stimulated with either 7nM human
   recombinant IL-18 plus IL-12 (1ng/mL) or LPS (10g/mL) plus IL-12 (10ng/mL) to induce
   secretion of native IL-18 protein (all final concentrations). In the case of recombinant human IL
   18, the concentration selected was pre-determined as an approximate EC80 in this assay. In the
   case of native IL-18, LPS stimulates production of IL-18, whilst IL-12 increases IL-18 receptor
 0 expression and the extent of IL-18-dependency is determined via inclusion of recombinant
   human IL-18 Binding Protein-IgG, Fc (hlL-18BPa-Fc) as a positive control.
   To assess the potency and efficacy of these antibodies, the anti-IL-18 antibodies and fragments
   thereof were pre-equilibrated for 30 min with the relevant stimulus prior to applying to cells with
   a final concentration between 0.1 and 1OOOnM. Anti-lysozyme control antibody MOR03207 was
 5 used as a negative control.
   The stimulus mixture (+/- antibody or fragment) was added to each well of a 96-well tissue
   culture sterile microtitre plate as 30pL and 170pL heparinised whole blood was then added to
   each well, such that the final volume in each well was 200pl. The plates were then returned to a
   humidified incubator (370C). After 24h, the plates were centrifuged (885 x g, 40C, 5 min) and
 0 the supernatants removed and assayed for hIFN-y production using a commercially available
   ELISA kit. Final data was derived as a mean ± standard error of mean from 3-5 healthy human
   donors.
   All antibodies and fragments dose-dependently inhibited IFNy production against either
   stimulus. Full inhibition of the recombinant IL-18-induced response was achieved at the highest
25 concentrations, whilst similar efficacy was observed against LPS/IL-12 stimulation as that for the
   IL-18BPa-Fc (Table 3; Figures 7(A-E) and 8(A-E)). Germlining MOR09441 and MOR09464 did
   not significantly alter their neutralizing capacity. The control antibody, MOR03207 did not inhibit
   the IL-18 response. Selected antibodies were also assessed for their ability to inhibit
   recombinant cynomolgus IL-18 bioactivity (7nM) in whole blood from the cynomolgus monkey.

   097, lot: 69655) or anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule)-AP (SIGMA, #A4312) both diluted 1:5000
   in 0.5% BSA / 0.05% Tween20 / 1x PBS. Plates were washed 5x with TBST, 20 pl AttoPhos
   (Roche) solution (1:5 diluted in ddH20) were added and fluorescence was measured at the
 5 Tecan Reader.
   For anti-IL-18 antibodies MOR8775 and MOR8776 which do not bind the IL-18/IL-18BP
   complex, binding signals were significantly decreased or no signals were observed (Figure
   9(A)). In comparison, a strong signal was observed in the presence of mouse 125-2H
   supporting the reported ability of this control antibody to bind an epitope distinct from that of the
 0 IL-18BP. Similarly, a dose-dependent signal was observed in the presence of control antibody
   MOR08741.
   In a second setup, the experiment was done in a similar way, except for using unbiotinylated hu
   IL-18. The IL-18/IL-18BP complex was captured onto a Maxisorp plate via the Fc tag of the rhIL
   18BP/Fc using a goat anti-hu IgG (Fc gamma fragment specific, Jackson ImmunoResearch
25 #109-005-098). A concentration-dependent signal was observed for controls MOR08741, again
   highlighting the ability of this antibody to recognise the IL-18/IL-18BP complex. In comparison,
   no signal was observed for MOR09441, MOR09464, MOR09465, MOR09466, confirming that
   they do not bind the IL-18/IL-18BP complex.
30 9.8) Epitope binninq of anti-IL18 antibodies and fragments via ELISA

       WO 2014/037899                                                              PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    121
   For epitope binning two set-ups were used. For the first set-up, an antibody fragment (Fab A)
   was titrated and incubated with biotinylated human IL-18. Fab A was tested with a constant
   concentration of an antibody B (IgG B). As a positive control, Fab A was analyzed with itself in
   the IgG format. NeutrAvidin plates (Thermo Scientific Cat#1 5402) were blocked with
 5 Chemiblocker (1:1 diluted with PBS) and incubated for 2h at RT (or over night at 40C). Next day
   plates were washed 2x with PBST and Fabs were titrated from 500nM down to 2nM in PBS
   buffer containing 1OnM final concentration biotinylated human IL-1 8. The complex of antibody
   fragments and biotinylated IL-18 was added to the NeutrAvidin plates and incubated for 1 hour.
   After washing 3x with PBST IgG B was added at 20nM to the corresponding wells of the
 0 NeutrAvidin plates. After 20 minutes incubation, and 3x PBST wash, detection antibodies anti
   Fc-AP - goat anti human IgG, Fc gamma-chain specific (Jackson Immuno Research, 109-055
   098) and anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule)-AP (SIGMA, #A4312 , Lot: 067K4863) were added
   diluted 1:5000 in 0.5% BSA / 0.05% Tween20 / 1x PBS.
   Plates were washed 5x with PBST, 20 pl AttoPhos solution (1:5 diluted in ddH20) was added
 5 and plates were measured at the Tecan Reader. Fluorescence emission at 535 nm was
   recorded with excitation at 430 nm.
   In general, signals could only be obtained when the IgG B was able to bind to accessible
   epitopes on the antigen which are different to the tested Fab A (i.e. antibody binding to a
   different epitope). In contrast, for antibodies with partially overlapping or identical epitopes,
 0 binding signals were significantly decreased in comparison to controls.
   The second ELISA set-up was performed on Maxisorp plates. Fab A was coated to different
   concentrations in PBS and incubated o/n at 40C. Next day plates were washed 3x with PBST
   and blocked for 2 hours at RT with 5% MPBST (100pl/well). After a 3x PBST washing step,
   human IL-1 8 was added at a constant concentration for 1h. Plates were washed 3x with PBST
25 and biotinylated antibody fragment (biotinylated Fab B) was titrated (max. conc. 5pg/mL,
   1Opg/mL or 20pg/mL). For complex formation of Fab A with IL-18 and biotinylated Fab B, plates
   were incubated for 1 h, subsequently washed 3x with PBST and detection antibody ZyMax
   Streptavidin-Alkaline Phosphatase (Zymed, Cat. No. 43-8322, Lot 51102099) was diluted
   1:2,000 in PBST and 20pL/well was added to the ELISA plates. Plates were washed 5x with
30 TBST, 20 pL AttoPhos (Roche) solution (1:5 diluted in ddH20) were added and plates were
   measured at the Tecan Reader.

         WO 2014/037899                                                          PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     122
   In this case, as for the first set-up, signals could only be obtained when the biotinylated Fab B
   was able to bind to accessible epitopes on the antigen which are different to the tested Fab A
   (i.e. antibody binding a different epitope).
   As shown in Figure 10A, antibodies MOR8775 compete with murine antibody 125-2H (black cell
 5 filling) whilst MOR8776 does not compete with 125-2H for binding to IL-18 (no cell filling). Both
   antibodies do compete with IL-18BP-Fc for binding IL-18 (black cell fillings). Neither MOR8775
   nor MOR8776 compete with ABT325 antibody (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/780,035 and
   10/988,360). Depending on the experiments settings, MOR8775 and MOR8776 compete with
   each other (striped cell filling)
 0 In a second set of experiments antibodies MOR9464, MOR9464_N30K,
   MOR10222_N30SM541 and MOR1 3341 were tested for their ability to bind IL-18 in the
   presence of any of these antibodies, IL-18BP-Fc, ABT325 and murine antibody 125-2H using
   the Proteon XPR36 instrument, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based, real-time label-free
   biosensor. Prior to analysis the integrity of the proteins was confirmed-, and the concentration
 5 assessed by LC-MS.
   All antibodies and IL18BP-Fc were immobilized on the interaction spots of a GLC sensor chip by
   standard amine coupling. In a first step IL18 was injected as analyte 1 and in a second step
   either an anti-IL18 antibody or IL18BPa-Fc was injected as analyte 2.
   Ligands to be immobilized were prepared at a concentration of either 20 pg/mL (antibodies) or
 0 10 pg/mL (IL18BP-Fc) in 10 mM Acetate Buffer, pH 4.0. Analytes were diluted in PBS buffer
   (TEKNOVA) containing 0.005% Tween 20, the same buffer solution was used as running buffer
   for the instrument. Analyte 1 (25 nM IL18) was injected at a flow rate of 50 pL/min for 180
   seconds with a dissociation time of 60 seconds. Analyte 2 (25 nM IL18BPa-Fc or anti-IL18
   antibody) was injected at a flow rate of 50 pL/min for 180 seconds with a dissociation time of
25 180 seconds. Regeneration was performed with 10 mM Glycine, pH 1.5 at a flow rate of 100
   pL/min for 20 seconds. Two independent sets of experiments were performed. Data evaluation
   was based on whether the sensogram signal increased upon injection of analyte 2 compared to
   the signal of analyte 1. If the signal increased it was concluded that the immobilized ligand and
   injected analyte 2 recognized different epitopes. If the signal did not increase it was concluded
30 the two shared the same or overlapping epitopes.

       WO 2014/037899                                                           PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                   123
   As shown in Figure 10B, antibodies MOR9464, MOR9464_N30K, MOR10222_N30S_M541 and
   MOR13341 compete with each other (black cell fillings), with IL-18BP-Fc and with murine
   antibody 125-2H. None of these antibodies compete with ABT325 (white cell fillings).
   Antibodies such as MOR9464_N30K and MOR10222_N30S_M541 which show to dually
 5 compete with the IL-18BP-Fc and with murine antibody 125-2H appear to have the advantage of
   not only binding free IL-18, not bound to the natural inhibitor IL-18BP-Fc, but also appear to
   have the potential to prevent binding of IL-18 to the IL-1 8Ra/p. As described in Wu et al. (Wu C.
   et al., J. Immunol. 2003, 170: 5571-5577), IL-18Rp does not appear to bind IL-18 alone, but
   form a functional high affinity receptor complex with IL-18Ra that is able to signal in response to
 0 IL-18. Biochemical data combined with epitope mapping of 125-2H on IL-18 have revealed that
   the C-terminal 17 amino acids of the human IL-18 are critical for signal transduction through the
   heterodimeric receptor. Hence, antibodies capable of binding within the 125-2H epitope and
   equally competing with the IL-18 BP for binding IL-18 appear to have the potential of preventing
   IL-18-dependent pathway activation not only through blocking the binding to IL-18Ra but also
 5 through blocking the binding of IL-18 to IL-18Ra/p complex. As it will be apparent in section
   9.11, antibody MOR9464_N30K binds, among others, amino acids Glu177 and Leu180 which
   are within the 17-amino acid stretch described in Wu et al.
   9.9) IL-18 epitope mapping by modellinq
 0 Human IL-18 from SwissProt entry Q14116 was used to search for structural information in the
   PDB (Berman H.M et al (2000) Nucl Acids Res; 28:235-242). Three structures were found with
   the code 1JOS (Kato Z et al (2003) Nat Struct Biol;10:966), 2VXT (Argiriadi MA et al (2009) J
   Biol Chem; 284:24478) and 3F62 (Krumm B et al (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA; 105:20711).
   1JOS is the NMR structure of human IL-18. 2VXT is the crystal structure of the engineered
25 human IL-18 in complex with mouse 125-2H antibody fragment at 1.49 A resolution and 3F62 is
   the crystal structure of the engineered human IL-18 in complex with the poxvirus IL-18 binding
   protein at 2.0 A resolution.

        WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                     124
   Three binding sites on IL-18 have been identified by mutational analysis. Two of them, site 1
   and 2, are important for binding IL-18Ra and the third one, site 3, for binding IL-18Rp (Kato Z. et
   al. (2003) Nat.Struct.Biol,10:966). Site 2 is also important for binding IL-18BP.
   A structural complex between IL-1p and IL-1 R1 is also available (1ITB, Vigers G.P et al (1997)
 5 Nature, 386:190). The structure of the complex between IL-1p and IL-1 R1 shows that IL-1p has
   two binding sites for the receptor, site 1 and 2 (Figure 11(A)). Since no structure is available for
   the complex between IL-18 and IL-18Ra, the crystal structure of IL-1p in complex with IL-1 R1
   was used as template for protein modelling (PDB code 1ITB). The model of IL-1 8Ra was built
   by using the structure of IL-1 R1 as template. The crystal structure of IL-18 (pdb code 2VXT,
 o Argiriadi M.A et al (2009) J.Biol.Chem. 284:24478) and the modelled structure of IL-18Ra were
   structurally superposed to the complex IL-1 p/IL-1R1 and the IL-18/IL-18Ra model so obtained
   was refined to obtain the final structural model (Figure 11(B)). MOE v2009.1 (Chemical
   Computing Group Inc.) is the software used for modeling the complex between IL-18 and IL
   18Ra. The Homology Model panel has been used to build the model of IL-18Ra, by selecting
 5 AMBER99 forcefield and the default panel parameters. The energy minimization panel in MOE
   has been used for the refinement of the final IL-18/IL-18Ra complex.
   The overall structure of human IL-1 8 shows similarity with that of IL-1 P. In particular, the RMSD
   (root mean square deviation) between IL-18 and IL-1      P Ca atoms   in secondary structure
   elements indicates that they are related proteins belonging to the same structure class (Kato Z.
 o et al. (2003) Nat.Struct.Biol, 10:966). A comparison between the structures of IL-1 P and IL-18
   revealed that site 1 and 2 in IL-1 8 correspond to site 1 and 2 in IL-1P. In Figure 11(B), sites 1
   and 2 are shown in the model of the complex between IL-18 and IL-18Ra, site 3 is also shown.
   Site 3 is reported as the site of interaction for IL-18Rp (Kato Z. et al. (2003) Nat.Struct.Biol,
   10:966).
25 The IL-18 binding site for IL-18BP has been somehow identified by alanine mutations and by
   the X-ray crystal structure of a poxvirus IL-18BP in complex with IL-18 (Krumm et al (2008) Proc
   Natl Acad Sci USA; 105(52):20711-20715). This putative binding site also corresponds to the
   region on IL-18 that has been identified as site 2, one of the two regions of interaction of IL-18
   with IL-18Ra.

   9.10) IL-18 epitope mappinq by Hydroqen/Deuterium exchange Mass Spectrometry (H/DxMS)
   Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange Mass Spectrometry was used to probe human IL-1 8 for
   information regarding the epitope for MOR9464. H/DxMS mapping relies upon the mass
 5 differences between "normal" hydrogen atoms and the "heavy" isotope deuterium which also
   comprises a neutron in addition to the single proton present in the normal hydrogen nucleus.
   Upon transfer from water to a deuterium based solvent system (heavy water), a protein will
   experience an increase in mass as the amide hydrogen on the protein's backbone become
   gradually replaced with deuterons (heavier isotope of hydrogen). The likelihood of a
 0 hydrogen/deuterium exchange event is largely determined by protein structure and solvent
   accessibility. The H/DxMS technology is used to measure relative hydrogen/ deuterium
   exchange and as a consequence protein structure and solvent accessibility.
   When a protein binding partner binds to an antibody (e.g antigen/antibody interaction)
   experimentally observable changes in its exchange rate may be observed. Surface regions that
 5 exclude solvent upon complex formation exchange much more slowly. Solvent excluded regions
   are useful for deducing the location of a binding site. In the case of an antigen-antibody
   interaction, changes in the rate of deuterium exchange might highlight the location of the
   epitope, but also any other perturbation resulting from the binding of the antibody to the antigen.
   For example, a decrease in the amount of deuterium uptake in the antigen at a given exchange
 0 time after antibody binding might represent either increased protection due to direct binding of
   the antibody to this region or indirect perturbation of the structure (allosteric changes) because
   of antibody binding. These two effects cannot be distinguished very easily, though the strongest
   effect observed is often attributed to direct protection from the antibody.
   The location of decreased deuteron incorporation after antibody binding may be deduced by
25 digestion of the target protein following hydrogen/deuterium exchange (e.g. with a suitable
   enzyme such as pepsin) and then mass spectrometry to determine the mass of the relevant
   fragments.
   Triplicate control experiments were carried out on 316 pmol IL-18 antigen at deuterium
   exchange times of 3 and 25 minutes by diluting a stock solution of IL-1 8 with 95% deuterated

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    126
   PBS buffer to a concentration of 83.6% D. Deuterium exchange was quenched with quenching
   buffer (6M Urea and 1M TCEP). After quenching, the vial was analyzed by on-line pepsin
   digestion / LC-MS analysis. On-line pepsin digestion was performed using Life Science's
   Poroszyme immobilized pepsin packed into 2.Ox 20 mm column, and LC separation was
 5 performed on a Thermo C18 BioBasic column (1.0 x50 mm) at a flow rate of 100 PL/min using a
   fast gradient so all peptides eluted in less than 20 minutes. Mobile phases are standard
   reverse-phase mobile phases: 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. In
   these experiments backbone amide hydrogens that are exposed on the surface of IL-18 will
   incorporate deuterons.
 o Next, triplicate labeling experiments were carried out. First, MOR9464 antibody was
   immobilized on Protein G agarose beads (Thermo 22851) using standard techniques. Antibody
   beads were centrifuged to remove a PBS solution. Then 200 pL of cold PBS (pH 7.4) and 6 pL
   (316 pmol) of IL-18 was added to the immobilized MOR9464 antibody and incubated for 15 min
   at 4 0C.  After incubation, the complex was centrifuged and washed with 200 PL PBS and
 5 centrifuged again. For deuterium exchange, 200 pL of 83.6% deuterium PBS buffer was added
   to the antigen-antibody complex for incubation at 4   0C  for 3 or 25 min. Deuterium buffer was
   then removed, and immediately, 125 pL quench buffer (as above) was added. After quenching,
   the flow-through was transferred into pre-chilled HPLC vial and analysed using the identical on
   line pepsin digestion/LC-MS analysis that was in the control experiments. The backbone amides
 0 that are present in the antigen-antibody interface will incorporate fewer deuterons at a given
   exchange time relative to the control experiments. By comparing the H/Dx patterns of the
   labeling and control experiments, the epitope is revealed as that area of the antigen that is
   protected from on-exchange in the labelling experiments.
   The results of this analysis, when conducted with MOR9464, revealed three most significant
25 regions of protection on IL-18. These were (with reference to SEQ ID NO:1) from amino acid 87
   to 99, from amino acid 119 to 137 and from amino acid 138 to 160. These regions are shown to
   contain amino acids which are involved in the binding of the IL-18BP (Figure 12).
   9.11) X-ray structural characterization of IL-18/antibody fragment

        WO 2014/037899                                                         PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    127
   The general epitope identification provided by modelling and H/DxMS confirmed that the
   antibodies and fragments thereof as described herein recognise a region on IL-18 which is also
   recognised by the IL-18BP (Figure 12). In order to identify the relevant amino acids on IL-18 in
   these regions, X-ray structure determination of an IL-18/antibody complex was carried out.
 5 To prepare the antibody fragment, 13mg of MOR9464_N30K at a concentration of 18mg/mL in
   10mM Histidine pH 5.0, were cleaved with 1/300 (w/w) papain in 100mM Tris-HCI pH 7.0, 10mM
   DTT during 200min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 50PM of papain
   inhibitor E64. The Fab fragment was then purified over a protein A column equilibrated with
   20mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0.
 o Purification of the Fab complex with IL-18: A 1.33-fold excess of human IL-18 (1.6 mg in PBS)
   was added to 3.2mg of the MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment (recovered from the Protein A
   flow-through). The IL-18 complex with the MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment was
   concentrated by ultrafiltration, loaded on a SPX-75 size-exclusion chromatography and eluted
   isocratically in 10mM Tris-HCI pH 7.4, 25mM NaCl.
 5 Crystallization: The IL-1 8/MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment complex was concentrated by
   ultrafiltration to 11.8mg/mL and crystallization screening was performed by vapor diffusion in
   sitting drops in 96-well plates. The experiments were set up with a Phoenix robotic system and
   stored in a Rocklmager hotel at 190C. Two crystal forms (form A and form B) were identified and
   characterized:
 0 1) Crystal form A grew from 0.1M Lithium sulfate, 0.1M ADA pH 6.5, 12% PEG 4,000. (Cryo
   protectant was a 1:1 mix of the reservoir solution with 20% PEG 4,000, 30% glycerol)
   2) Crystal form B grew from 59.5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 15% glycerol, 85mM
   HEPES pH 7.5. (No cryo-protectant needed).
   X-ray data were collected at the Swiss Light Source, beamline X1OSA, with a Pilatus pixel
25 detector. All diffraction images were processed with XDS (version Dec. 6, 2010), as
   implemented in APRV.
   For crystal form A, 720 images of 0.25' oscillation each were recorded at a crystal-to-detector
   distance of 460mm, using X-ray radiation of 0.99999A wavelength.

      WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    128
  For crystal form B, 720 images of 0.25' oscillation each were recorded at a crystal-to-detector
  distance of 430mm, using X-ray radiation of 0.99984A wavelength.
  The structure of crystal form A was determined by molecular replacement with the program
  Phaser, using PDB entry 3GBM.pdb and 2VXT.pdb as starting models for the MOR9464_N30K
5 antibody fragment and IL-18 molecule, respectively. The variable and first constant domains of
  the antibody fragment in 3GBM.pdb were used as independent search models. A clear solution
  for one IL-18/MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment complex per asymmetric unit was readily
  obtained. The structure of crystal form B was determined in the same way, but using the refined
  models derived from crystal form A instead of the PDB entries.
0 Structure refinement: The structure was refined by multiple cycles of electron-density map
  inspection and model rebuilding in Coot 0.6.2 followed by automated refinement using
  autoBUSTER (1.11.2/ buster 2.11.2). Intermolecular contacts were identified with NCONT and
  the buried surface was analyzed with AREAIMOL, both from the CCP4 program suite (version
  6.1.2). X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 4 below.

   The overall view of the structure of the complex of IL-18/MOR9464_N30K fragment is shown in
   Figure 13. Upon complex formation, 36 amino acids on IL-18 with reduced solvent accessibility
   are identified at the binding interface of IL-18 with the antibody fragment. These residues are
   Leu41, Glu42, Met87, Tyr88, Lys89, Asp90, Ser9l, Gln92, Pro93, Arg94, Gly95, Met96, Ala97,
 5 Phe138, Gln139, Arg140, Ser141, Val142, Pro143, Gly144, His145, Asp146, Asn147, Met149,
   Gln150, Glu152, Ser153, Ser154, Glu157, Gly158, Phe160, Glu177, Asp178, Glu179, Leu180
   and Gly181.
   Further characterization of the relevant contacts made in the complex interface identified that
   Arg140 and Glu152 are the amino acids which are likely to contribute the most to this particular
 0 complex formation. Both residues are located at the centre of the binding interface, and
   contribute to a large number of intermolecular contacts (21 and 18, respectively, using a cut-off
   distance of 4.0A). Arg140 interacts with both L-CDR3 (Tyr94L) and H-CDR3 (Tyr101H,
   His102H) residues. Glu152 forms a strong (buried) salt-bridge interaction with L-CDR2 Arg51L
   and accepts a H-bond from L-CDR3 Tyr94L. All residues in the antibody chains are numbered
 5 sequentially, the letter L or H following the residue number indicate a residue in the light chain
   or heavy chain, respectively.
   The three dimensional structure of IL-18/ MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment complex allowed
   some further investigations on the different cross-reactivity between the human IL-18 and the
   cynomolgus IL-18. MOR9464_N30K is 10-fold weaker against cynomolgus IL-18 (20pM)
 0 compared to 2pM against human IL-18 (Table 2). Cynomolgus IL-18 differs from human IL-18 in
   6 positions (human vs cynomolgus): V471; S86N; T99A; K1 15R; F170Y and E177K (Figure
   14(A). Of these positions only glutamic acid 177 (Glu177; E177) is at the IL-18/antibody
   fragment complex interface (Figure 14(B)). Thus, it is arguable that K177 in the cynomolgous
   monkey sequence of cynomolgus IL-18 causes a 10-fold drop in affinity to MOR9464_N30K as
25 indicated in Table 2A column 1, where the      KD (SET, pM) for MOR9464_N30K for human IL-18 is
   2±1 pM whereas for cynomolgus IL-18 is 20±10 pM.
   In order to identify with what part of the IL-1 8Ra MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment competes,
   a superposition of the IL-1 8/ MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment complex with the IL-1 8/IL
   18Ra complex was performed. In brief, the structures of IL-18 in the IL-18/IL-18Ra complex and
30 IL-18 in the IL-18/MOR9464_N30K complex were superposed by using the align command in
   PyMol (The PyMol Molecular Graphic system, version 1.2r3pre, Schroedinger LLC).

       WO 2014/037899                                                            PCT/IB2013/058317
                                                    131
   As shown in Figure 15, it appears that MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment competes with the
   Ig-domain D3 of IL-1 8Ra for binding IL-1 8.
   Similarly, the structure of the IL-1 8/ MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment complex was
   superimposed onto the structure of the human IL-1 8 in complex with poxvirus IL-1 8BP
 5 (coordinate file used 3F62.pdb) using the "align" command in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular
   Graphic system, version 1.5.0., Schr6dinger LLC).
   As shown in Figure 16, the poxvirus IL-18BP clashes with the heavy chain variable domain of
   the MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment and competes predominantly for binding amino acids
   residues Met87 to Met96 on IL-18.
 0 These findings further confirm the biochemical and epitope binning data showed herein and
   show that the binding molecules as described herein, in particular the antibodies and the
   fragments thereof, do not bind the IL-18/IL-18BP complex.
   Finally, comparison with the prior art murine antibody 125-2H was performed. The analysis was
   carried out with the structure of 125-2H antibody fragment as found in the 2VXT.pdb file. In
 5 brief, the structure of IL-18 in complex with MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment was
   superimposed onto IL-18 in complex with the 125-2H Fab using the "align" command in PyMOL
   (The PyMOL Molecular Graphic system, version 1.5.0., Schr6dinger LLC).
   As shown in Figure 17, MOR9464_N30K antibody fragment (left side of the superimposition)
   and 125-2H antibody fragment (right side of the superimposition) overlap in recognising IL-18.
z0 However, 125-2H antibody fragment does not bind the epitope recognised by the IL-18BP as
   shown in Figure 18 where the 125-2H/IL-18 complex was superposed with the poxvirus IL
   18BP/IL complex. These data further confirm, both the prior art literature with regard to 125-2H
   (Argiriadi M.A et al (2009) J.Biol.Chem. 284:24478) and also the biochemical and epitope
   binning data showed herein that murine antibody 125-2H binds the IL-18/IL-18BP complex.
25 Finally, as shown in Figure 19, Lysine in position 30 in the heavy chain of MOR9464_N30K
   appears to form electrostatic/polar interactions with Asp 146 and Asn 147 of human IL-18
   indicating that lysine 30 is involved in the formation of the antibody-antigen complex. It is,
   therefore, apparent that an exocellular modification as described in section 9.2 herein such as
   asparagine deamidation, may have contributed to the loss of potency over time of MOR9464.

                                             132
Replacement of asparagine 30 with a lysine in MOR9464_N30K appears to provide
MOR9464_N30K with increased stability.
