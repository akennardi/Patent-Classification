                                   Abstract
In fibrotic lung fibroblasts, basal levels of p53 protein (and miR-34a) are
markedly suppressed, leading to reduced p53-mediated inhibition ofuPA
and uPAR, or concurrent induction of PAI- I. These changes contribute to
excessive FL-fibroblast proliferation and production of extracellular
matrix (ECM), and, therefore, pulmonary fibrosis. These processes are
reversed by treating the cells, and treating subjects suffering from
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with the small organic molecule
nutlin-3a (NTL) or with a peptide, CSP-4 (SEQ ID NO: 1), or variants or
derivatives or multimers of this peptide, which increase p53 levels by
inhibiting MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 protein. Use of these
compounds serves as a new approach to the treatment of IPF, as they
restore p53 expression and p53-mediated changes in the uPA-fibrinolytic
system in FL-fibroblasts and restrict production and deposition of ECM.

              Inhibition of Pulmonary Fibrosis with Nutlin-3a and Peptides
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
           The present invention in the field of biochemistry and medicine is directed to methods
 5 and composition for increasing p53 protein levels, reducing uPA and uPAR and increasing PAI
    1 expression, in fibrotic lung (FL) fibroblasts and reducing their proliferation, and for treating
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) using nutlin-3a and peptides.
   Description of the Background Art
           Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a poorly understood progressive and fatal lung
10 disease for which no treatment exists other than lung transplantation (Mason DP et al., Ann
   Thorac Surg 84:1121-8, 2007). Median survival of five years after diagnosis is less than 20%.
   Most forms of interstitial lung diseases and other forms of pulmonary fibrosis are characterized
   by fibrotic lesions, progressive distortion of alveolar architecture occurs and replacement with
   fibrotic or scar tissues with excess extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition (American Thoracic
15 Society, Am JRespir Crit Care Med 161:646-664, 2000; Noble PW et al., Clin Chest Med
   25:749-758, 2004; Selman M et al., Ann Intern Med 134:136-151, 2001). This results in
   progressive dyspnea and loss of lung function. A hallmark morphological lesion is spatial and
   temporal heterogeneity incorporating areas of normal lung being directly adjacent to areas of
   fully established fibrosis, microscopic honeycombing, and areas of evolving fibrosis containing
20 actively proliferating and collagen-producing fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, the so called "fibrotic
   foci".
           IPF is the most common chronic, progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease of
   unknown etiology with an estimated incidence of 40-50 cases for 100,000 individuals in the
   United States. Increased fibrotic lung ("FL") fibroblasts (or myofibroblast)) viability, activation,
25 production and deposition of ECM typify IPF lungs (Selman M et al., Expert Opin Emerg Drugs
   16:341-62, 2011; Shetty, S et al. Am JRespir Cell Mol Biol 15:78-87, 1996; Zhu S et al., Am J

   American Thoracic Society, supra;Noble PW et al., supra)
           Previous work by the present inventors (and others) showed that lung fibroblasts
30 including FL-fibroblasts from the lungs of IPF patients express urokinase-type plasminogen
   activator (uPA), uPA receptor, (uPAR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI-1) (Shetty et
   al., 1996, supra; Shetty S and Idell S. Am JPhysiol274:L871-L882, 1998; Chang W et al., J

    WO 2014/145389                                                               PCT/US2014/030147
   Biol Chem 285:8196-206, 2010). uPA is mitogenic for both normal lung (NL) and FL
   fibroblasts, and the process involves uPA binding to uPAR through the uPA growth factor
   domain (Tkachuk V et al. Clin Exp PharmacolPhysiol 23:759-65, 1996; Padr6 T et al., J Cell
   Sci 115:1961-71, 2002; Shetty S et al., Am JPhysiol268:L972-L982, 1995; Shetty S et al.,
 5 Antisense Res Dev 5:307-314, 1995). In addition, uPA augments uPAR expression (Shetty S et
   al., JBiol Chem 276:24549-56, 2001; Shetty S et al., Am JRespir Cell Mol Biol 30:69-75,
   2004). Several years ago, the present inventors reported that FL-fibroblasts from IPF lungs
   express significantly more uPA and uPAR, and show a higher rate of basal and uPA-mediated
   proliferation than the NL-fibroblasts (Shetty et al., 1996, supra; 1998, supra). Other groups
10 confirmed that increased uPAR expression by FL-fibroblasts from patients with IPF contributes
   to the migratory behavior (Mace KA et al., J Cell Sci 118:2567-77, 2005; Basire A et al.,.
   Thromb Haemost 95:678-88, 2006; Zhu, S. et al., 2009, supra
           Studies by the present inventor and colleagues found that uPA regulates epithelial cell
   apoptosis/survival through regulation of p53 (Shetty S et al., 2005, supra) which controls
15 reciprocal expression of uPA (Shetty P et al., Am JResp Cell Mol Biol, 39:364-72 ,2008), its
   receptor uPAR (Shetty S et al. Mol Cell Biol 27:5607-18, 2007) and its major inhibitor PAI-I
   (Shetty S et al. JBiol. Chem 283:19570-80, 2008) at the posttranscriptional level and involves a
   novel cell surface signaling interaction between uPA, uPAR, caveolin-1 ("Cav-I") and      P1
   integrin (Shetty S et al., 2005, supra). Based on the appreciation of the foregoing, the present
20 inventors conceived of new compositions and methods for treating ALI and its consequent
   remodeling reactions.
           During lung fibrosis (which term is used interchangeably with "pulmonary" fibrosis),
   expression of the transcriptional factor p53, known primarily as a tumor suppressor protein, is
   severely suppressed in fibrotic fibroblasts which in turn induces expression of uPA and uPAR
25 while PAI-I expression is significantly inhibited. Suppression of PAI-I expression and
   concurrent induction of uPA and uPAR expression as a consequence of inhibition of p53
   expression fibrotic fibroblasts causes fibroblast proliferation and ECM deposition, i.e., fibrosis.
   Increased mdm2 interaction with p53 and subsequent mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53
   contributes to inhibition of p53 in fibrotic fibroblasts.
30         A reciprocal relationship between the activities of p53 and NF-KB has been demonstrated
   in cancer cells, but there is little information concerning interactions between p53 and NF-KB in
   inflammatory processes. Liu G et al. (JImmunol. 182:5063-71(2009)) found that neutrophils
   and macrophages lacking p53, (p53(-I-) have greater responses to stimulation with bacterial
                                                       2

   lipopolysaccharide (LPS) than do p53(+/') cells, and they produce greater amounts of
   proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, IL-6, and MIP-2, and demonstrate enhanced NF
   KB DNA-binding activity. p53(-I-) mice are more susceptible than are p53(+/') mice to LPS
   induced acute lung injury (ALI). The enhanced response of p53(-I-) cells to LPS does not involve
 5 alterations in intracellular signaling events associated with engagement of the toll-like receptor
   TLR4 engagement (e.g., activation of MAP kinases, phosphorylation of IKB-a or the p65
   subunit of NF-KB, or degradation of IKB-a. Culture of LPS-stimulated neutrophils and
   macrophages with nutlin-3a, attenuated NF-B DNA-binding activity and production of
   proinflammatory cytokines. Treatment of mice with nutlin-3a reduced the severity of LPS
10 induced ALI. The authors concluded that p53 regulates NF-KB activity in inflammatory cells
   and suggested that modulation of p53 may have potential therapeutic benefits in acute
   inflammatory conditions such as ALI.

   the p53 pathway in cancer cells. (Tovar, C. et al., ProcNatlAcad Sci USA 103:1888-1893

15 the present invention.
            In view of the poor prognosis and lack of therapeutic approaches for IPF, there is an
   urgent need for new interventions to reverse or at least slow the progression of disease. This
   critical therapeutic gap is addressed by the present invention.
            The present invention constitutes and extension of the inventor's earlier findings
20 (S. Shetty et al., 2007, 2008 & 2009, supra). As described in the sections below, the p53
   regulates the expression of uPA, uPAR and PAI-I The process involves MDM2-mediated
   control of p53 protein expression at the posttranslational level without affecting p53 mRNA.
   These observations demonstrate a causal link between expression of p53 and the uPA
   fibrinolytic system in fibrotic repair.
25                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
            Inhibition of p53 protein interaction with MDM2 using NTL augments p53 and PAI-I
   while inhibiting uPA and uPAR. These changes results in apoptosis of fibrotic fibroblasts and
   inhibition of proliferation of fibrotic fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of patients with IPF as
   well as from the lungs of mice with BLM-induced accelerated pulmonary fibrosis.
30          According to the present invention, NTL Inhibits progressive and established pulmonary
   fibrosis by inducing or augmenting p53 expression in fibrotic fibroblasts. Therefore, this
   compound is useful for treating pulmonary fibrosis in a subject in need thereof.

   WO 2014/145389                                                                PCT/US2014/030147
           The present inventors conceived that disrupted p53-mediated control of the uPA
   fibrinolytic system in FL-fibroblasts is a basis for targeted therapy of IPF. In FL-fibroblasts,
   baseline expression of p53 and microRNA-34a (miR-34a) are markedly suppressed while the
   levels of ECM proteins such as collagen-I (Col-I) and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) are
 5 increased. Treatment of FL-fibroblasts with either the mdm2 inhibiting compound nutlin-3a or
   CSP-4 augments p53 and PAI-I expression with reciprocal inhibition of uPA and uPAR.
   Treatment of FL-fibroblasts with nutlin-3a or CSP-4 also inhibits the production of ECM. These
   preliminary findings and recent publications of the present inventors and colleagues justify an
   interventional approach to restore cross-talk between the p53 and uPA-fibrinolytic system which
10 is otherwise distorted in FL-fibroblasts leading to lung fibrosis. p53 has pleiotropic effects that
                                                    2
   go beyond control of uPA-fibrinolytic system . However, PAI-I is the downstream effector of
   p53 in fibroblasts and other cells.
           Importantly, restoration of p53 in FL-fibroblasts modulates expression of uPA, uPAR
   and PAI-I, cellular viability and production of ECM. The p53-uPA fibrinolytic system-targeted
15 approach in FL-fibroblasts is illustrated in Fig. 1. p53 induces miR-34a transcription while
   miR-34a augments acetylation of p53 through inhibition of histone deacetylase sirtuinI (SIRTI).
   This leads to stabilization of p53 protein due to inhibition of its degradation mediated by mdm2.
   However, in FL-fibroblasts, the basal levels of p53 protein and miR-34a are markedly
   suppressed due to increased ubiquitination of p53 protein by mdm2 as a consequence of low
20 baseline expression of caveolin-1. This leads to reduced p53-mediated inhibition of uPA and
   uPAR, or concurrent induction of PAI-I. These changes contribute to excessive FL-fibroblast
   proliferation and production of ECM and are reversed by CSP-4 and nutlin-3a. CSP-4 and
   nutlin-3a increase p53 levels by inhibiting mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 protein.
   Restoration of p53 expression and p53-mediated changes in the uPA-fibrinolytic system in FL
25 fibroblasts leads to attenuation of viability, and restricts production and deposition of ECM.
   Fibrosis is inhibited in BLM-challenged mice with established pulmonary fibrosis via restoration
   of p53 levels in FL-fibroblasts that in turn suppresses the proliferation signals uPA and uPAR
   while inducing the pro-apoptotic signal for these cells; PAI-1.
           The inventors show, for the first time, that p53-mediated changes of the uPA-fibrinolytic
30 system regulate pro-fibrotic response of lung fibroblasts that are central to the pathogenesis of
   pulmonary fibrosis and that this pathway can be targeted for therapeutic benefit. Unlike NL
   fibroblasts from histologically "normal" lungs, FL-fibroblasts, including
   fibroblasts/myofibroblasts from fibrotic lung tissues, express very low levels of baseline p53,

   miR-34a and caveolin- 1 while uPA and uPAR expressions are high. Treatment of FL-fibroblasts
   with CSP-4, or the low molecular weight compound nutlin-3a restore p53 and miR-34a
   expression, and induce PAI-1. These changes suppress uPA and uPAR expression and inhibit
   ECM deposition. These agents also reverse BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and protect the
 5 lung epithelium, which likewise demonstrates crosstalk between p53 and regulation of the
   fibrinolytic system. Therefore, CSP-4-mediated or nutlin-3a-mediated mitigation of pulmonary
   fibrosis represent novel therapeutic approaches.
           There is currently no effective treatment to reverse lung fibrosis. The present invention
   addresses this important gap and provides novel compounds and methods for targeting FL
10 fibroblasts and cross-talk between p53 and the uPA-fibrinolytic system to effectively treat
   fibrotic lung disease.
           The present invention is also directed to compositions of matter. In one embodiment, the
   composition is a peptide compound that increases p53 protein levels, reduces uPA and increases
   PAI-I expression in FL fibroblasts, preferably selected from the group consisting of:

   about 91% to about 99%. The peptide variant chemical derivative or multimer may have 100%
   or greater than 100% of the activity of CSP-4. This relative activity may be based on any
   method disclosed herein or known in the art for evaluating such activity.
30         A preferred compound is the heptapeptide designated CSP-4, FTTFTVT (SEQ ID

                     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
25          The present inventors discovered that basal expression of "tumor suppressor" protein,
   p53 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAl-1) are markedly reduced in FL-fibroblasts
   obtained from the lungs of IPF patients. This is also true for mice with BLM-induced
   accelerated pulmonary fibrosis, an accepted model of human IPF. p53 regulates the expression
   of major components of uPA-fibrinolytic (uPA, uPAR and PAl-1) system. However, it has been
30 unclear how changes in the levels of these proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary
   fibrosis, and whether restoration of the normal mode of p53-uPA fibrinolytic system cross-talk

             According to the present invention, increased uPA and uPAR expression, and a
   concurrent inhibition of PAI-I due to a lack of p53 expression in FL-fibroblasts are critical to
   the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Induction of p53 expression, and restoration of p53
   uPA-fibrinolytic system cross-talk through p53-mediated reduction of uPA, and a concurrent
 5 increase in PAI- 1 expression in FL-fibroblasts, mitigates IPF and is the basis for treating this
   disease with NTL.
             Unlike normal lung ("NL") fibroblasts, fibroblasts obtained from lungs of patients with
   IPF ("FL"-fibroblasts) or from mice with BLM-induced lung fibrosis express minimal p53.
   Further, FL-fibroblasts produce low levels of PAI-I, while expression of uPA and uPAR are
10 markedly elevated.
             The present invention targets the all three major components (uPA, uPAR and PAI-1) of
   the uPA-fibrinolytic system in a global and coordinate manner. Concurrently targeting all three
   major components of the uPA-fibrinolytic system through restoration of p53 expression in FL
   fibroblasts mitigates fibrosis.
15           Accordingly, this treatment affects primary FL-fibroblasts and lung tissue isolated from
   the patients with IPF ex vivo, and in vivo. These changes were observed in a mouse model with
   established lung fibrosis in which intermediaries and downstream mediators of the salutary
   effects of nutlin-3a were defined.

   CSP is the 20 residue peptide underlined above, and has the sequence GIWKASFTTFTVTKYWFYR
   (SEQ ID NO:2). The preferred peptide of the present invention, designated CSP-4 is the
   fragment FTTFTVT (SEQ ID NO:1) of CSP and is shown double-underlined within the Cav-1
   sequence. CSP-4 has the activities shown in the Examples and Figures, below, and affects how
 5 p53 regulates LEC viability via coordinate control of uPA, uPAR (upwards) and PAI-I
   expression (downwards) and by this presumed mechanism, protect LECs or lung epithelium in
   vivo from apoptosis and block fibrosis that results from ALI.
           In studies disclosed herein, a control peptide for CSP-4, which is termed "CP" is a
   scrambled peptide with the same amino acid composition as he larger CSP (SEQ ID NO:2), but
10 has a different sequence: WGIDKAFFTTSTVTYKWFRY (SEQ ID NO:5).
           Modifications and changes may be made in the structure of CSP-4, and to create
   molecules with similar or otherwise desirable characteristics. Such functional derivatives or
   biologically active derivatives (which terms are used interchangeably) are encompassed within
   the present invention.
15         Preferred functional derivatives are addition variants and peptide oligomers/multimers,
   and the like.
           These may be generated synthetically but also by recombinant production, and tested for
   the binding properties or biological activity of CSP-4. A preferred way to measure the activity
   of the variant is in a competitive binding assay wherein the ability of the peptide variant to
20 compete with binding of soluble caveolin, such as one that is detectably labeled, with soluble
   uPAR ("suPAR").
           It is understood that distinct derivatives of CSP-4 and longer polypeptides comprising
   CSP-4 may easily be made in accordance with the invention, either by chemical (synthetic)
   methods or by recombinant means (preferred for longer polypeptides).
25         Included in within the definition of functional variants of CSP-4 are addition which
   preferably comprise an additional 1-5 amino acids at either terminus or at both termini. In other
   embodiments (which are intended to be distinct from the peptide multimers discussed below),
   further additional residues may be added, up to about 20 residues. In the addition variant of
   CSP-4, the additional residues N-terminal to, and/or C-terminal to SEQ ID NO: 1 (the core CSP
30 4 peptide) may include some of those in the order in which they occur in the native sequence in
   Cav-1 (SEQ ID NO:4. However, the addition variant cannot be SEQ ID NO:3. Alternatively,
   other amino acids can be added at either terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1, with the understanding that
                                                      18

   the addition variant maintains the biological activity and binding activity of CSP-4 (at least 20%
   of the activity, or preferably greater, as is set forth below).
            Preferred substitutions variants of CSP-4 is a conservative substitutions in which 1, 2 or
   3 residues have been substituted by different residue. For a detailed description of protein
 5 chemistry and structure, see Schultz G.E. et al., PrinciplesofProtein Structure, Springer
   Verlag, New York, 1979, and Creighton, T.E., Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties,
   2 "ded., W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, 1993, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
   Conservative substitutions and are defined herein as exchanges within one of the following
   groups:
10          Phe may be substituted by a large aromatic residue: Tyr, Trp.
            Thr may be substituted by a small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues: e.g.,
   Ala, Ser, or Gly.
            Val may be substituted by a large aliphatic, nonpolar residues: Met, Leu, Ile, Cys.
            Even when it is difficult to predict the exact effect of a substitution in advance of doing
15 so, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the effect can be evaluated by routine screening
   assays, preferably the biological and biochemical assays described herein. The activity of a cell
   lysate or purified polypeptide or peptide variant is screened in a suitable screening assay for the
   desired characteristic.
            In addition to the 20 "standard" L-amino acids, D-amino acids or non-standard, modified
20 or unusual amino acids which are well-defined in the art are also contemplated for use in the
   present invention. These include, for example, include P-alanine (3-Ala) and other o-amino
   acids such as 3-aminopropionic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dpr), 4-aminobutyric acid and
   so forth; a-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib); c-aminohexanoic acid (Aha); 6-aminovaleric acid (Ava);

30 (Phe(pNH 2)); N-methyl valine (MeVal); homocysteine (hCys), homophenylalanine (hPhe) and
   homoserine (hSer); hydroxyproline (Hyp), homoproline (hPro), N-methylated amino acids and
   peptoids (N-substituted glycines).

            Other compounds may be designed by rational drug design to function in manner similar
   to CSP-4. The goal of rational drug design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active
   compounds. By creating such analogs, it is possible to produce drugs that are more active or
   more stable than the natural molecules (i.e., peptides), lower susceptibility to alterations which
 5 affect functions. One approach is to generate a three-dimensional structure of CSP-4 for
   example, by NMR or X-ray crystallography, computer modeling or by a combination. An
   alternative approach is to replace randomly functional groups in the CSP-4 sequence, and
   determine the affect on function.
           Moreover, a biologically active derivative has the activity of CSP-4 in an in vitro or in
10 vivo assay of binding or of biological activity, such as assays described herein. Preferably the
   polypeptide inhibits or prevents apoptosis of LECs induced by BLM in vitro or in vivo with
   activity at least about 20% of the activity of CSP-4, or at least about 30%, 40%, 50%, 60 %,

15   0%; or even more preferably, from about      1% to about 99%. The derivative may have 100%
   or even greater activity than CSP-4.

   an amido (abbreviated "Am") group, respectively, for example acetyl (CH 3CO-) at the N
   terminus and amido (-NH 2) at the C terminus. A broad range of N-terminal capping functions,

           Either the N-terminal or the C-terminal capping function, or both, may be of such
   structure that the capped molecule functions as a prodrug (a pharmacologically inactive
10 derivative of the parent drug molecule) that undergoes spontaneous or enzymatic transformation
   within the body in order to release the active drug and that has improved delivery properties over
   the parent drug molecule (Bundgaard H, Ed: Design ofProdrugs,Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1985).
           Judicious choice of capping groups allows the addition of other activities on the peptide.
   For example, the presence of a sulfhydryl group linked to the N- or C-terminal cap will permit
15 conjugation of the derivatized peptide to other molecules.
           Chemical Derivatives of CSP-4
           In addition to the capping groups described above which are considered "chemical
   derivatives" of CSP-4, the preferred chemical derivatives of CSP-4 may contain additional
   chemical moieties not normally a part of a protein or peptide which can be introduced to CSP-4
20 or an addition variant of CSP-4 by known means to constitute the chemical derivative as defined
   herein. Covalent modifications of the peptide are included within the scope of this invention.
   Such derivatized moieties may improve the solubility, absorption, biological half life, and the
   like. Moieties capable of mediating such effects are disclosed, for example, Gennaro, AR,
   Remington: The Science and Practice ofPharmacy, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers;
25 21st Ed, 2005 (or latest edition)
           Such modifications may be introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid
   residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with
   selected side chains or terminal residues. Another modification is cyclization of the peptide
   which is generally accomplished by adding terminal Cys residues which can be bonded via a
30 disulfide bond to generate the cyclic peptide. Alternative, a cross-linkable Lys (K) is added at
   one terminus and a Glu (E) at the other terminus.

           Cysteinyl residues (added, e.g., for cyclizing purposes) most commonly are reacted with
   a-haloacetates (and corresponding amines) to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl
   derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, a
   bromo-j-(5-imidozoyl) propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N- alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2
 5 pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitro
   phenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.
           Added lysinyl residues (e.g., for cyclizing) and the amino terminal residue can be
   derivatized with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with a cyclic
   carboxylic anhydride has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other
10 suitable reagents for derivatizing amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl
   picolinimidate; pyridoxal phosphate; pyridoxal; chloroborohydride; trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid;
   O-methylisourea; 2,4 pentanedione; and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.
           Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for cross-linking the peptide or oligomer
   or multimer to a water-insoluble support matrix or other macromolecular carrier. Commonly
15 used cross-linking agents include 1,1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane, glutaraldehyde, N
   hydroxysuccinimide esters, esters with 4-azidosalicylic acid, homobifunctional imidoesters,
   including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3,3'- dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate), and bifunctional
   maleimides such as bis-N-maleimido-1,8-octane. Derivatizing agents such as methyl-3-[(p
   azidophenyl)dithio]propioimidate yield photoactivatable intermediates that are capable of
20 forming crosslinks in the presence of light. Alternatively, reactive water-insoluble matrices such
   as cyanogen bromide-activated carbohydrates and the reactive substrates described in U.S. Pats.
   3,969,287; 3,691,016; 4,195,128; 4,247,642; 4,229,537; and 4,330,440 are employed for protein
   immobilization.
           Other modifications include hydroxylation lysine, phosphorylation of the hydroxyl
25 groups of threonyl residues, methylation of the a-amino groups of side chains of (added) lysine
   residues chains (Creighton, supra), acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and, in some instances,
   amidation of the C-terminal carboxyl groups. Also included are peptides wherein one or more
   D-amino acids are substituted for one or more L-amino acids.
           Multimeric or Oligomeric Peptides
30         The present invention also includes longer peptides built from repeating units of CSP-4
   or a functional derivative thereof that has the anti-apoptotic and protective activity of CSP-4.
   The preferred peptide unit of such a multimer is FTTFTVT (SEQ ID NO: 1). Addition variants

   of this peptide that may be the "unit" of the multimer preferably include from 1-4 additional
   amino acids.
           A peptide multimer may comprise different combinations of peptide monomers (which
   may include either or both of SEQ ID NO: 1 or addition variants thereof or a chemically
 5 derivatized form of the peptide. Such oligomeric or multimeric peptides can be made by
   chemical synthesis or by recombinant DNA techniques as discussed herein. When produced by
   chemical synthesis, the oligomers preferably have from 2-5 repeats of a core peptide sequence,
   and the total number of amino acids in the multimer should not exceed about 160 residues,
   preferably not more than 100 residues (or their equivalents, when including linkers or spacers).
10         A preferred synthetic chemical peptide multimer has the formula
                                                     PIn
   wherein the core peptide P1 is SEQ ID NO: 1, and wherein n=2-5, and wherein the core peptide
   alone or in oligo- or multimeric form has the biological activity of CSP-4 as disclosed herein in
   an in vitro or in vivo bioassay of such activity.
15         In another embodiment, a preferred synthetic chemical peptide multimer has the formula

   P1 and P 2 are the core peptides described above, including additional variants, wherein
   (a)     P1 and P2 may be the same or different; moreover, each occurrence of P1 in the multimer
           may be a different peptide (or variant);
20 (b)     X is a spacer which comprises or consists of:
            (i)     a short organic chain, preferably C1 -C5 alkyl, CI-C 5 alkenyl, C1 -C5 alkynyl, C1_C 5
                    polyether containing up to 4 oxygen atoms, wherein m = 0 or 1 and n = 1-7; or

 5          occurrence of P1 in the multimer may be a different peptide (or variant);
   wherein
            n = 1-25 and z = 0-6; (preferred ranges of n include n=1-5, 1-10, 1-15, or 1-20)
   and wherein the core peptide alone or in multimeric form has the biological activity of CSP-4 as
   disclosed herein in an in vitro or in vivo bioassay of such activity.
10          In the present peptide multimers, either P or p2 is preferably SEQ ID NO: or an
   addition variant or chemical derivative thereof. The multimer is optionally capped. It is
   understood that such multimers may be built from any of the peptides or variants described
   herein. It is also understood that the peptide multimer should be different from SEQ ID NO:3
   (i.e., not native human Cav-I and is preferably not a native mammalian Cav-I homologue).
15          Peptidomimetics
            Also included within the scope of this invention is a peptidomimetic compound which
   mimics the biological effects of CSP-4. A peptidomimetic agent may be an unnatural peptide or
   a non-peptide agent that recreates the stereospatial properties of the binding elements of CSP-4
   such that it has the binding activity and biological activity of CSP-4. Similar to a biologically
20 active CSP-4 peptide, peptide multimer, a peptidomimetic will have a binding face (which
   interacts with any ligand to which CSP-4 binds) and a non-binding face. Again, similar to CSP
   4, the non-binding face of a peptidomimetic will contain functional groups which can be
   modified by coupling various therapeutic moieties without modifying the binding face of the
   peptidomimetic. A preferred embodiment of a peptidomimetic would contain an aniline on the
25 non-binding face of the molecule. The NH 2-group of an aniline has a pKa ~ 4.5 and could
   therefore be modified by any NH 2 - selective reagent without modifying any NH 2 functional
   groups on the binding face of the peptidomimetic. Other peptidomimetics may not have any
   NH 2 functional groups on their binding face and therefore, any NH 2 , without regard for pKa
   could be displayed on the non-binding face as a site for conjugation. In addition other
30 modifiable functional groups, such as -SH and -COOH could be incorporated into the non
   binding face of a peptidomimetic as a site of conjugation. A therapeutic moiety could also be
                                                     25

    WO 2014/145389                                                               PCT/US2014/030147
   directly incorporated during the synthesis of a peptidomimetic and preferentially be displayed on
   the non-binding face of the molecule.
            This invention also includes compounds that retain partial peptide characteristics. For
   example, any proteolytically unstable bond within a peptide of the invention could be selectively
 5 replaced by a non-peptidic element such as an isostere (N-methylation; D-amino acid) or a
   reduced peptide bond while the rest of the molecule retains its peptidic nature.
            Peptidomimetic compounds, either agonists, substrates or inhibitors, have been described
   for a number of bioactive peptides/polypeptides such as opioid peptides, VIP, thrombin, HIV
   protease, etc. Methods for designing and preparing peptidomimetic compounds are known in
10 the art (Hruby, VJ, Biopolymers 33:1073-1082 (1993); Wiley, RA et al., Med. Res. Rev.
   13:327-384 (1993); Moore et al., Adv. in Pharmacol33:91-141 (1995); Giannis et al., Adv. in
   Drug Res. 29:1-78 (1997). Certain mimetics that mimic secondary structure are described in
   Johnson et al., In: Biotechnology and Pharmacy, Pezzuto et al., Chapman and Hall (Eds.), NY,
    1993. These methods are used to make peptidomimetics that possess at least the binding
15 capacity and specificity of the CSP-4 peptide and preferably also possess the biological activity.
   Knowledge of peptide chemistry and general organic chemistry available to those skilled in the
   art are sufficient, in view of the present disclosure, for designing and synthesizing such
   compounds.
            For example, such peptidomimetics may be identified by inspection of the three
20 dimensional structure of a peptide of the invention either free or bound in complex with a ligand
   (e.g., soluble uPAR or a fragment thereof). Alternatively, the structure of a peptide of the
   invention bound to its ligand can be gained by the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy. Greater knowledge of the stereochemistry of the interaction of the peptide with its
   ligand or receptor will permit the rational design of such peptidomimetic agents. The structure
25 of a peptide or polypeptide of the invention in the absence of ligand could also provide a
   scaffold for the design of mimetic molecules.
            Deliverable Peptides and Peptide Multimers
            One embodiment of the invention comprises a method of introducing the peptide of the
   invention into animal cells, such as human cells. Compositions useful for this method, referred
30 to as "deliverable" or "cell-deliverable" or "cell-targeted" peptides or polypeptides comprise a
   biologically active peptide according to the invention, preferably CSP-4, or a functional
   derivative thereof, or a peptide multimer thereof, that has attached thereto or is associated with,
                                                     26

    WO 2014/145389                                                               PCT/US2014/030147
   a further component which serves as an "internalization sequence" or cellular delivery system.
   The term "associated with" may include chemically bonded or coupled to, whether by covalent
   or other bonds or forces, or combined with, as in a mixture. As used herein, "delivery' refers to
   internalizing a peptide/polypeptide in a cell, Delivery molecules contemplated herein include
 5 peptides/polypeptides used by others to effect cellular entry. See for example, Morris et al.,
   Nature Biotechnology, 19:1173-6, 2001). A preferred strategy is as follows: an apoptosis
   inhibiting ("biologically active") peptide of the invention is bonded to or mixed with a specially
   designed peptide which facilitates its entry into cells, preferably human cells. This delivery
   system does not require the delivery peptide to be fused or chemically coupled to biologically
10 active peptide or polypeptide (although that is preferred), nor does biologically active peptide
   or polypeptide have to be denatured prior to the delivery or internalization process. A
   disadvantage of earlier delivery systems is the requirement for denaturation of the "payload"
   protein prior to delivery and subsequent intracellular renaturation . These embodiments are
   based on known approaches for promoting protein translocation into cells.
15          One type of "delivery" peptide/polypeptide which promotes translocation/internalization
   includes the HIV-TAT protein (Frankel, AD et al., Cell 55:1189-93 (1998), and the third a helix
   from the Antennapedia homeodomain (Derossi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:10444-50 (1994);
   Lindgren, M et al., Trends Pharm. Sci. 21:99-103 (2000); Lindgren et al., Bioconjug Chem.
   (2000); Maniti 0 et al., PLoS ONE 5el5819 (2010). The latter peptide, also known as
20 "penetratin" is a 16-amino acid peptide with the wild-type sequence RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK
   (SEQ ID NO:6) or two analogues/variants designated W48F (RQIKI FFQNRRMKWKK, SEQ ID
   NO:7) and W56F (RQIKIWFQNRRMKFKK, SEQ ID NO:8) (Christiaens B et al., Eur JBiochem
   2002, 269:2918-2926). Another variant with both of the above mutations is
   RQIKIFFQNRRMKFKK (SEQ ID NO:9). Transportan, a cell-penetrating peptide is a 27 amino
25 acid-long peptide containing 12 functional amino acids from the N- terminus of the neuropeptide
   galanin linked by an added Lys residue to the sequence of mastoparan (Pooga, M et al., FASEB
   J. 12:67-77 (1998)). The sequence of transportan is GWTLNSAGYLLGKINLKALAALAKKIL
   (SEQ ID NO: 10). Analogues of penetratin and transportan are described by Lindgren et al.,
   Bioconjug Chem. 2000.
30          Another protein (family) includes VP22, a herpes simplex virus protein that has the
   remarkable property of intercellular transport and distributes a protein to many surrounding cells
   (Elliott, G et al., 1997, Cell 88:223-33; O'Hare et al., U.S. Pat. 6,017,735). For example, VP22
   linked to p53 (Phelan, A. et al., 1998, Nat Biotechnol 16:440-3) or thymidine kinase (Dilber,
                                                    27

    WO 2014/145389                                                              PCT/US2014/030147
   MS et al., 1999, Gene Ther 6:12-21) facilitating the spread of linked proteins to surrounding
   cells in vitro. Also useful are VP22 homologues in other herpes viruses, such as the avian
   Marek's Disease Virus (MDV) protein UL49, that shares homology with HSV-1 VP22
   (Koptidesova et al., 1995, Arch Virol. 140 :355-62) and has been shown to be capable of
 5 intercellular transport after exogenous application (Dorange et al., 2000, JGen Virol. 81:2219).
   All these proteins share the property of intercellular spread that provide an approach for
   enhancing cellular uptake of the peptides, variants, and multimers of this invention.
            Also included are "functional derivatives" of the above intercellular spreading or
   "delivery" "delivery" or "internalization" proteins and peptides such as HIV-TAT or VP22
10 which include homologous amino acid substitution variants, fragments or chemical derivatives,
   which terms are herein for the biologically active peptides. A functional derivative retains
   measurable translocation or intercellular spreading (VP22-like) activity that promotes entry of
   the desired polypeptide, which promotes the utility of the present biologically active peptide
   e.g., for therapy. "Functional derivatives" encompass variants (preferably conservative
15 substitution variants) and fragments regardless of whether the terms are used in the conjunctive
   or the alternative.
            Because the above transport proteins are said to work best when conjugated or
   otherwise bound to the peptide they are transporting, such as CSP-4 or a variant or multimer
   thereof, there are a number of disadvantages to using them. A more effective delivery
20 polypeptide that can be admixed with the biologically active peptide and does not need to be
   chemically bonded for its action is described in Morris et al., supra, as "Pep-I" which has the
   amphipathic amino acid sequence KETWWETWWT EWSQPKKKRKV (SEQ ID NO:11). Pep-i
   consists of three domains:
   (1)      a hydrophobic Trp-rich motif containing five Trp residues KETWWETWWTEW (residues
25          1-12 of SEQ ID NO:11, above). This motif is desirable, or required, for efficient
            targeting to cell membrane and for entering into hydrophobic interactions with proteins;
   (2)      a hydrophilic Lys-rich domain KKKRKV (the 6 C-terminal residues of SEQ ID NO: 11)
            which is derived from the nuclear localization sequence of SV40 virus large T antigen,
            and improves intracellular delivery and peptide solubility; and
30 (3)      a spacer "domain" SQP (3 internal residues of SEQ ID NO: 12) which and separate the
            two active domains above and include a Pro that improves flexibility and integrity of
            both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains.

   Accordingly, another embodiment of the invention is a deliverable peptide or polypeptide
   comprising CSP-4 or a functional derivative thereof as described above, and a delivery or
   translocation-molecule or moiety bound thereto or associated therewith. The delivery molecule
   may be a peptide or polypeptide, e.g.,
 5         (a)      HIV-TAT protein or a translocationally active derivative thereof ,
           (b)      penetratin having the sequence RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK (SEQ ID NO:8),
           (c)      a penetratin variant W48F having the sequence RQIKIFFQNRRMKWKK
                    (SEQ ID NO:7)
           (d)      a penetratin variant W56F having the sequence RQIKIWFQNRRMKFKK,
10                  SEQ ID NO:13)
           (e)      a penetratin variant having the sequence RQI KIWFQN RRMKFKK,
                    SEQ ID NO:16)
           (f)      transportan having the sequence GWTLNSAGYLLGKINLKALAALAKKIL (SEQ
                    ID NO:10)
15         (g)      herpes simplex virus protein VP22 or a translocationally-active homologue
                    thereof from a different herpes virus such as MDV protein UL49; or
           (h)      Pep-1, having the sequence KETWWETWWTEWSQPKKKRKV (SEQ ID NO:9).
           When a delivery moiety, such as the peptides and proteins discussed above, is
   conjugated or fused to the biologically active peptide of the invention, it is preferred that the
20 delivery moiety is N-terminal to the biologically active peptide.
           In Vitro Testing of Compositions
           The compounds of this invention are tested for their biological activity, e.g., anti-fibrotic
   activity, their ability to affect expression of uPA, uPAR and PAI-I mRNAs, inhibit proliferation
   of lung fibroblasts, etc. using any one of the assays described and/or exemplified herein or
25 others well-known in the art.
           In Vivo Testing of Compositions
           The ability of a compound (such as a NTL analogues or CSP-4 variants or derivative or
   peptide multimers to inhibit lung fibrosis in BLM-treated mice is a preferred test for assessing
   the functional activity of the compound. Other tests known in the art that measure the same type

            Method of Preventing or Treating Lung Injury and Fibrosis
            The compounds and compositions described herein are used in method to inhibits
   MDM2 interaction with p53 protein in vitro or in vivo, and to treat diseases or conditions
   associated with ALI and pulmonary fibrosis/IPF
 5          Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Compositions and Their Administration
            The compounds that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the
   invention include NTL, and all of the peptide compounds described above, as well as the
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these compounds. "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt"
   refers to conventional acid-addition salts or base-addition salts that retain the biological
10 effectiveness and properties of the compounds of the present invention and are formed from
   suitable non-toxic organic or inorganic acids or organic or inorganic bases. Sample acid-addition
   salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid,
   hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, and those derived
   from organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic
15 acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, and the like. Sample base
   addition salts include those derived from ammonium, potassium, sodium and, quaternary
   ammonium hydroxides, such as for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Chemical
   modification of a pharmaceutical compound (i.e.,. drug) into a salt is a technique well known to
   pharmaceutical chemists to obtain improved physical and chemical stability, hygroscopicity,
20 flowability and solubility of compounds. See, e.g., H. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage
   Forms and Drug Delivery Systems ( 6 th Ed. 1995) at pp. 196 and 1456-1457.
            As stated above, the compounds of the invention possess the ability to inhibits MDM2
   interaction with p53 protein and are exploited in the treatment of acute lung injury and, in
   particular, pulmonary fibrosis.
25          The compounds of the invention, as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,
   may be incorporated into convenient dosage forms, such as capsules, impregnated wafers,
   tablets or preferably, injectable preparations. Solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable
   carriers may be employed. "Pharmaceutically acceptable," such as pharmaceutically acceptable
   carrier, excipient, etc., means pharmacologically acceptable and substantially non-toxic to the
30 subject to which the particular compound is administered.
            Solid carriers include starch, lactose, calcium sulfate dihydrate, terra alba, sucrose, talc,
   gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate and stearic acid. Liquid carriers include syrup,
                                                       30

    WO 2014/145389                                                                  PCT/US2014/030147
   peanut oil, olive oil, saline, water, dextrose, glycerol and the like. Similarly, the carrier or
   diluent may include any prolonged release material, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl
   distearate, alone or with a wax. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the
   form of a syrup, elixir, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid (e.g., a solution),
 5 such as an ampoule, or an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid suspension. A summary of such
   pharmaceutical compositions may be found, for example, in Gennaro, AR, Remington: The
   Science and PracticeofPharmacy, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers; 21st Ed, 2005 (or
   latest edition).
            The pharmaceutical preparations are made following conventional techniques of
10 pharmaceutical chemistry involving such steps as mixing, granulating and compressing, when
   necessary for tablet forms, or mixing, filling and dissolving the ingredients, as appropriate, to
   give the desired products for oral, parenteral, topical, transdermal, intravaginal, intrapenile,
   intranasal, intrabronchial, intracranial, intraocular, intraaural and rectal administration. The
   pharmaceutical compositions may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances
15 such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and so forth.
            The present invention may be used in the treatment of any of a number of animal genera
   and species, and are equally applicable in the practice of human or veterinary medicine. Thus,
   the pharmaceutical compositions can be used to treat domestic and commercial animals,
   including birds and more preferably mammals, most preferably humans.
20          The term "systemic administration" refers to administration of a composition or agent
   such as NTL or the peptides described herein, in a manner that results in the introduction of the
   composition into the subject's circulatory system or otherwise permits its spread throughout the
   body, such as intravenous (i.v.) injection or infusion. "Regional" administration refers to
   administration into a specific, and somewhat more limited, anatomical space, such as instillation
25 in the lung, the preferred route, or intrapleural, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, subdural, or to a
   specific organ. Other examples include intranasal, which is one route that corresponds to
   instillation in the lungs, intrabronchial, intra-aural or intraocular, etc. The term "local
   administration" refers to administration of a composition or drug into a limited, or
   circumscribed, anatomic space, such as subcutaneous (s.c.) injections, intramuscular (i.m.)
30 injections. One of skill in the art would understand that local administration or regional
   administration often also result in entry of a composition into the circulatory system, i.e., so that
   s.c. or i.m. are also routes for systemic administration. Instillable, injectable or infusible
   preparations can be prepared in conventional forms, either as solutions or suspensions, solid
                                                      31

    WO 2014/145389                                                               PCT/US2014/030147
   forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection or infusion, or as emulsions.
   Though the preferred regional routes of administration are into the lungs, the pharmaceutical
   composition may be administered systemically or topically or transdermally either separately
   from, or concurrently with, instillation into the lungs.
 5          Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for compositions of the present invention are
   liposomes, pharmaceutical compositions in which the active polypeptide is contained either
   dispersed or variously present in corpuscles consisting of aqueous concentric layers adherent to
   lipidic layers. The active polypeptide is preferably present in the aqueous layer and in the lipidic
   layer, inside or outside, or, in any event, in the non-homogeneous system generally known as a
10 liposomic suspension. The hydrophobic layer, or lipidic layer, generally, but not exclusively,
   comprises phospholipids such as lecithin and sphingomyelin, steroids such as cholesterol, more
   or less ionic surface active substances such as dicetylphosphate, stearylamine or phosphatidic
   acid, and/or other materials of a hydrophobic nature. Those skilled in the art will appreciate
   other suitable embodiments of the present liposomal formulations.
15          The therapeutic dosage administered is an amount which is therapeutically effective, as
   is known to or readily ascertainable by those skilled in the art. The dose is also dependent upon
   the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment(s), if any, the frequency
   of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired.
   Therapeutic Methods
20          The methods of this invention may be used to treat pulmonary fibrosis or IPF in a
   subject in need thereof. The term "treating" is defined broadly to include, at least the following:
   inhibit, reduce, ameliorate, prevent, reduce the occurrence or recurrence, including the frequency
   and/or time to recurrence, or the severity of symptoms of the disease or condition being treated
   or prevented. This may occur as a result of inhibiting epithelial cell death, inhibiting fibroblast
25 proliferation, any of the other biological or biochemical mechanisms disclosed herein as being
   associated with or responsible for IPF.
            The NTL, NTL analogue, or peptide or peptide derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable
   salt thereof is preferably administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition as described
   above.
30          Doses of the compound preferably include pharmaceutical dosage units comprising an
   effective amount of the NTL or peptide . Dosage unit form refers to physically discrete units
   suited as unitary dosages for a mammalian subject; each unit contains a predetermined quantity
                                                      32

    WO 2014/145389                                                               PCT/US2014/030147
   of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the
   required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are
   dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active material and the
   particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of
 5 compounding such an active compound for the treatment of, and sensitivity of, individual
   subjects
           By an effective amount is meant an amount sufficient to achieve a regional concentration
   or a steady state concentration in vivo which results in a measurable reduction in any relevant
   parameter of disease.
10         The amount of active compound to be administered depends on the NTL, NTL
   derivative, peptide or derivative thereof selected, the precise disease or condition, the route of
   administration, the health and weight of the recipient, the existence of other concurrent
   treatment, if any, the frequency of treatment, the nature of the effect desired, and the judgment
   of the skilled practitioner.
15         A preferred single dose, given once daily for treating a subject, preferably a mammal,
   more preferably human who his suffering from or susceptible to IPF resulting therefrom is
   between about 0.2 mg/kg and about 250 mg/kg, preferably between about 10 mg/kg and about
   50 mg/kg, for example, via instillation (by inhalation). Such a dose can be administered daily
   for anywhere from about 3 days to one or more weeks. Chronic administration is also possible,
20 though the dose may need to be adjusted downward as is well-understood in the art. The
   foregoing ranges are, however, suggestive, as the number of variables in an individual treatment
   regime is large, and considerable excursions from these preferred values are expected.
           For continuous administration, e.g., by a pump system such as an osmotic pump that was
   used in some of the experiments described below, a total dosage for a time course of about 1-2
25 weeks is preferably in the range of 1 mg/kg to 1 g/kg, preferably 20-300 mg/kg, more preferably
   50-200 mg/kg. After such a continuous dosing regiment, the total concentration of the active
   compound is preferably in the range of about 0.5 to about 50 pM, preferably about 1 to about 10
   PM.
           An effective concentration of the active compound for inhibiting or preventing inhibiting
30 apoptosis in vitro is in the range of about 0.5 nM to about 100 nM, more preferably from about 2
   nM to about 20 nM. Effective doses and optimal dose ranges may be determined in vitro using
   the methods described herein.

           Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood
   through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are
   not intended to be limiting of the present invention, unless specified. The examples are included
   to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill
 5 in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques
   discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be
   considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art
   should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the
   specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without
10 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
                                               EXAMPLE I
                Deceased FL-Fibroblast p53 Expression in Fibrotic Foci of IPF Lungs
            Staining of lung sections from IPF patients and control "normal" subjects wit various
   reagents, including by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (see Figs. 2A-21) revealed that IPF tissues
15 display fibrotic foci which are dense with ECM. FL-fibroblasts dispersed in the vimentin-rich
   foci showed minimal staining for p53 and PAI-I antigens. However, immunofluorescence
   staining for SP-C, PAI-1, p53 and active caspase-3 (not shown) demonstrated that alveolar type
   II (ATII) cells surrounding the fibrotic foci show elevated staining for p53 and PAI-I antigens,
   and are positive for active caspase-3, indicating apoptosis of encircling ATII cells. The IHC
20 results reveal that ATII cells encasing fibrotic foci continuously die due to increased expression
   of p53 and PAI-I. These wounds are replaced by activated fibroblasts which show minimal
   basal p53 and PAI-I, and elevated ki-67 staining indicating proliferation due to suppression of
   p53 and PAI-I expression.

            Cell lysates from NL- and FL-fibroblasts were immunoblotted to reveal changes in the
   proteins and a miRNA. See Fig. 3A-3B. Basal miR-34a expression was significantly lower in
   FL-fibroblasts indicating that reduced p53 expression and consequent changes in p53-uPA
30 fibrinolytic system cross-talk contributed to fibrogenesis. Such changes are associated with
   increased col-I and inhibition of miR-34a. The results further showed that increases in p53

                Disparate Expression of uPA, PAI-i and col-I mRNAs by Fibroblasts
 5                                    from IPF and "Normal" Lungs.
           Total RNA isolated from lung tissues from "normal" subjects and patients with IPF or
   from NL- were tested for uPA, PAI-I and col-I mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized
   to the corresponding levels of p-actin mRNA. Results are shown in Figs. 4A-4B.
           Expression of col-I and PAI-I mRNA significantly increased in IPF lung tissues whereas
10 uPA mRNA was is reduced. Interestingly, unlike IPF lung tissues, col-I and uPA mRNA and
   lower level of PAI-I mRNA expression were found in FL-fibroblasts compared to NL
   fibroblasts. uPAR protein and mRNA are also elevated in FL-fibroblasts. The elevated PAI-I in
   the lung tissues is attributable to increased expression of PAI- 1 by lung epithelial cells or
   macrophages rather than FL(IPF)-fibroblasts. This is consistent with increased expression of
15 col-I, uPA and uPAR, and reduced PAI-I proteins in FL-fibroblasts from IPF lungs (see Fig
   3A).
                                               EXAMPLE IV
          Differential Expression of uPA and PAI-i by FL- vs. NL-Fibroblasts from Mice
           FL-fibroblasts were isolated from the lungs of mice 21 days after BLM injury or NL
20 fibroblasts from control mice exposed to intranasal saline as described elsewhere 2 6. The lysates
   from NL- and FL-fibroblasts were immunoblotted. Changes in the expression of p53, uPA,
   PAI- 1 and col-I proteins were detected by immunoblotting of cell lysates of NL- ad FL
   fibroblasts. (Fig. 5A-5D). Total RNA was extracted from mouse lung tissues NL- and FL
   fibroblasts from the lung tissues of mice with BLM-induced fibrosis or control (saline-treated)
25 and tested for uPA, PAI-I and Col-I mRNA. Proliferative rates of NL- and FL-fibroblasts from
   mice were compared. Consistent with FL(IPF)-fibroblasts from IPF lungs 2, the baseline rate of
   proliferation of murine FL(BLM)-fibroblasts were significantly higher than that of NL
   fibroblasts (from saline-treated mice). p53 inhibited uPA gene transcription, concurrently bound
   the PAI-I promoter and augmented PAI-I mRNA transcription-           4 . p53 also inhibited
30 expression of uPA and uPAR via destabilization of their transcripts while stabilizing the PAI-I
   transcript2-2 Lastly, inhibition of either uPA or uPAR augments p53 expression and
                                                     35

   downstream p53-mediated induction of PAI-I, thereby increasing cellular senescence and
   apoptosis. It was concluded that p53-mediated regulation of uPA-fibrinolytic system at the
   transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels is compromised in FL-fibroblasts due to lack of
   p53 expression. This leads to increased uPA and uPAR, and inhibition of PAI-I in these cells.
 5                                            EXAMPLE V
           CSP Augments p53 Expression via Induction of miR-34a in FL(IPF)-Fibroblasts.
           NL- and FL-fibroblasts were treated with PBS, CSP or CP and RNA analyzed for miR
   34a by real-time PCR. Also, FL-fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of PBS or CSP or CP
   with or without miR-34a antisense (miR-34a-AS) or pre-miR-34a (o control miRNA.
10 Conditioned medium (CM) from these cultures was immunoblotted for PAI-I and cell lysates
   (CL) were immunoblotted for p53. In one experiment, FL-fibroblasts were treated with PBS or
   CSP or CP in the presence or absence of miR-34a-AS, pre-miR-34a or control miR. RNA was
   analyzed for changes in miR-34a by real-time PCR. Results appear in Figs 6A-6C.
           A series of overlapping deletions were made in CSP and these peptide fragments were
15 tested on FL-fibroblasts for changes in p53, uPA, PAI-I and col-I (Fig. 6D).
           CSP significantly increased miR-34a and p53 expression in FL- but not in NL
   fibroblasts. p53 induction by CSP was mimicked by expression of pre-miR-34a alone and
   abolished by inhibition of miR-34a by miR-34a-AS. This indicated that induction of p53 occurs
   through miR-34a-mediated stabilization.
20         Deletional analysis of the CSP 20mer revealed that an internal 7 amino acid fragment,
   named CSP-4 and having the sequence FTTFTVT (SEQ ID NO: 1) had the activity of the full
   length peptide. This supports the conclusion that the salutary effect of CSP-4 in FL-fibroblasts
   or mice with established lung fibrosis (see Fig 11 A-i ID), involves control of p53 and miR-34a
   expression.

           Mdm2 Mediated Increased Degradation of p53 Proteins in FL (IPF)-Fibroblasts.
           Lysates from NL- and FL-fibroblasts were either immunoblotted for p53, and mdm2 or
   immunoprecipitated with anti-mdm2 antibody and immunoblotted (IB) for the associated p53
 5 protein. The results showed robust mdm2-p53 interaction in NL-fibroblasts which were absent
   in FL-fibroblasts (see Fig 7A-7B) despite elevated levels of mdm2 in the FL-fibroblasts. Thus,
   increased mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 protein contributed to marked suppression of
   baseline p53 levels in FL-fibroblasts, supporting the use of the therapeutic interventions
   disclosed herein to target the interaction of mdm2 and p53.

                        Fibroblasts: Role of p53-fibrinolytic system cross-talk
           FL-fibroblasts were exposed to PBS (control), nutlin-3a (10 pM), CSP-4 (10 nM) or CP
   for 48hrs. Lysates were immunoblotted for the expression of Col-I, PAI-1, p53, and uPA.
15 Results are shown in Fig. 8A-8B. Cultured FL- were exposed to vehicle (PBS) or nutlin-3a,
   CSP-4 or CP and counted to assess proliferation. The results showed that both nutlin-3a and
   CSP-4 inhibited col-I expression and proliferation of FL-fibroblasts. The process involves
   induction of p53 and PAI-I expression, and concurrent inhibition of uPA.
           In another experiment (results in Fig. 8C), FL-fibroblasts were transduced with
20 adenovirus vector expressing p53, PAI-I or caveolin-1 or appropriate vector controls and
   cultured for 2 days at which time cell lysates were immunoblotted for Col-I, p53, PAI-1, and
   uPA. Transduction of FL-fibroblasts from IPF lungs with Ad-Cav-I induced p53 and PAI-I
   while inhibiting uPA and col-I expression. The effects of nutlin-3a or CSP-4 on FL-fibroblasts
   were mimicked by expressing either p53 or PAI-I or caveolin-1 alone. Therefore, p53-mediated
25 induction of PAI-I and inhibition of uPA expression contribute to the inhibition of col-I.
   Interestingly, treatment of FL-fibroblasts from the lungs of IPF patients or BLM-treated mice
   with recombinant PAI-I protein failed to induce apoptosis or senescence (not shown) whereas
   elevated exogenous PAI-I induced ATII cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. The resistance
   of FL-fibroblasts to exogenous PAI-I would enable these cells to flourish in the PAI-I protein
30 rich environments of IPF or BLM-injured lungs.

           NL-fibroblasts isolated from histologically "normal" human lungs 2 (S. Shetty et al.,
 5 1996, supra) were transfected with a lentiviral vector carrying p53 shRNA to inhibit baseline
   p53 expression. Control cells were similarly treated with a non-specific shRNA. Conditioned
   medium from the cultures was immunoblotted for PAI-1, uPA, and soluble col-I, and cell lysates
   were tested for p53 and a-SMA.     Total RNA isolated from these fibroblasts were analyzed for
   changes in the expression of uPA, PAI-I and col-I mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. The results
10 (in Fig 9A-9B) show that inhibition of p53 expression in NL-fibroblasts augmented uPA, col-I
   and a-SMA but inhibited PAI-I. This supports the link described here between p53-mediated
   changes in the uPA system and fibrogenesis.

                       Nutlin-3a Inhibits Lung Fibrosis in BLM-Treated Mice
15         Mice exposed to BLM (or saline in controls) for 14 d to induce lung fibrosis were
   injected IV with nutlin-3a (10 mg/kg body weight) (Zhang et al., supra) or a vehicle control to
   determine and the effect on established lung fibrosis was examined. Fibrosis was evaluated by
   CT scanning and lung function (compliance and resistance) were measured using the Flexivent
   system. Lung sections were subjected to trichrome staining and H & E staining (the latter not
20 shown) to assess lung architecture and collagen deposition as an indication of fibrosis. Finally,
   whole lung homogenates were analyzed for total collagen (hydroxyproline) and desmosine
   content (Bhandary YP et al., Am JPhysiol:Lung Cell Mol Physiol 302:L463-73, 2012;
   Bhandary YP et al., Am JPathol,183:131-43 2013) as an independent assessment of the ECM.
   Results (Figs 10-1OD) of all the above tests indicated a beneficial effect of nutlin-3a on lung
25 fibrosis. Oral administration of Nutlin-3a 14 days after BLM injury likewise inhibited
   pulmonary fibrosis in mice.

         CSP-4 Peptide Inhibits Established Lung Fibrosis and Improves Lung Function.
           Mice were exposed to BLM to induce pulmonary fibrosis. After 14 d, the mice were

            CSP-4 (SEQ ID NO: 1)or control peptide (scrambled sequence of same amino acids; CP,

    14 days earlier. One week later, mice were tested by CT scanning to evaluate lung fibrosis.
   Lung volume was measured in the same mice using quantitative CT renditions. Lung sections
   were subjected stained (trichrome and H&E to assess collagen deposition as an indicator of lung
   fibrosis. Whole lung homogenates were analyzed for total hydroxyproline and desmosine
 5 content (the latter results not shown). Results are in Figs. 11 A-1 ID. All tests showed that CSP
   4 inhibited BLM-induced lung fibrosis. Consistent with the in vitro effects of both CSP and
   CSP-4 on FL-fibroblasts from IPF lungs (See Fig 6D), CSP-4 exerted a beneficial effect in vivo
   against established lung fibrosis, mimicking the salutary effects of the full length peptide, CSP
   (SEQ ID NO:3).

                CSP-4 Peptide and Nutlin-3a Inhibit Proliferation of FL-Fibroblasts.
           Mice exposed to BLM 14 days earlier were treated with CSP-4 or its control (CP) or
   Nutlin-3a IV (as in Examples IX and X). Seven days later lung sections were obtained and
   subjected to IHC for Ki-67 to assess cell proliferation (see Figs. 12A). The increased staining
15 for ki-67 antigens observed in lung sections of fibrotic mice was significantly reduced by
   treatment with nutlin-3a or CSP-4. Fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of these animals (as
   described in Example X) were tested for the changes in expression of col-I, p53 and downstream
   uPA and PAI- 1 proteins by Western blotting, and mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR (see Figs.
    12B-12C). FL-fibroblasts from mice with established BLM-induced fibrosis showed increased
20 uPA and col-I mRNA and protein expression compared to NL-fibroblasts from mice without
   lung injury. These cells also showed minimal p53 and PAI-I expression. However, in
   fibroblasts from mice treated with nutlin-3a, uPA and col-I protein and mRNA expression were
   significant suppressed. These changes were associated with marked induction p53 protein, and
   PAI-I protein and mRNA expression, indicating that restoration of p53-fibrinolytic system
25 cross-talk mitigates fibrosis.

           Inhibition of Fibrotic Changes by Treatment Ex Vivo with CSP-4 or Nutlin-3a
           Mice were exposed to intranasal BLM for 21 d to induce pulmonary fibrosis, sacrificed,
   and their lungs excised and chopped into small pieces and placed into culture medium. These
30 tissue samples were thereafter treated with I0nM CSP-4 peptide, control peptide (CP) or nutlin
   3a for 72h. Conditioned medium and tissue lysates were and analyzed for changes in col-I and
                                                    39

   a-SMA by Western blotting. The results (Fig. 13) showed that treatment of fibrotic lung tissue
   explants with CSP-4 or nutlin-3a inhibited fibrosis ex vivo. The full length CSP peptide yielded
   similar inhibition of col-I and a-SMA (results not shown). Nutlin-3a and CSP-4 are expected to
   act similarly to affect human IPF lung tissues ex vivo. The present inventors' results provided
 5 herein and in recent reports (e.g., Bhandary et al., 2012, 2013, supra) , strongly support the
   conception that p53-mediated downstream changes in uPA and PAI-I regulates viability of FL
   fibroblasts.

        p53 Expression in FL-Fibroblasts and Downstream Reversal of the uPA-fibrinolytic
10                           System Mitigates Pulmonary Fibrosis In Vivo.
            The results reported herein and elsewhere (Bhandary YP et al., 2012, supra) Shetty SK
   et al., Am JRespir Cell Mol Biol 47:474-83, 2012) show that IP or IV administration of CSP or
   CSP-4 (Fig. 11 A- I1D), or IV or oral administration of nutlin-3a in wild type (WT) mice (Fig
    10A-10D) beginning 14 d after BLM mitigates established lung fibrosis. Therefore, mdm2
15 mediated degradation of p53 protein and loss of downstream p53-uPA system cross-talk
   increases FL-fibroblast viability and production of ECM in vivo, leading to destruction of lung
   architecture and loss of lung function. Because patients often present with advanced stages of
   IPF (at the time of initial diagnosis), the mechanisms by which nutlin-3a and CSP-4 inhibit
   established lung fibrosis are evaluated and the downstream targets of nutlin-3a and CSP-4 are
20 identified. These studies utilize lung tissues from IPF patients and mice with advanced lung
   fibrosis due to BLM lung injury. The contribution and the specificity of p53-uPA system cross
   talk is confirmed by using uPA-, uPAR-, PAI-1- and p53-deficient mice.
            A.     Determination of the effects of nutlin-3a and CSP-4 treatment on fibrosis
                   using FL(IPF)-tissues ex vivo.
25          Freshly dissected FL-lung tissues from IPF patients are treated with nutlin-3a (10pM) or
   CSP-4 (10 nM) for 3 to 7 days (see Fig 13). Lung tissues are homogenized and tested for
   changes in ECM (hydroxyproline and desmosine). Controls include fibrotic lung (FL)-tissues
   from IPF patients treated with vehicle or control peptide, CP or naive lung tissues maintained in
   culture medium. Other controls include NL-tissues resected from histologically "normal" lungs.
30 De-identified patient ("normal" and IPF) lungs that were not suitable for transplantation and
   donated for medical research are obtained through 11AM (Edison, NJ) and the NDRI
   (Philadelphia, PA) and used for ex vivo studies. Fibroblasts are isolated from these tissues and
   analyzed for changes in p53, uPA, uPAR and PAI-i expression, production of ECM and
                                                     40

    WO 2014/145389                                                                  PCT/US2014/030147
   viability. Changes in rate of ECM synthesis are also measured. FL-tissue explants from patients
   with IPF have elevated synthesis of ECM when compared to expression levels in the slices of
   NL-tissues from control subjects. However, FL-lung explants treated with either nutlin-3a or
   CSP-4 show significantly reduced ECM synthetic rates when compared to those remain
 5 untreated or exposed to either vehicle alone or CP. Fibroblasts isolated from the IPF explants
   treated with either nutlin-3a or CSP-4 show elevated levels of p53, miR-34a and PAI-I, and
   reduced uPA and uPAR expression. Phosphorylation of Akt and expression of PDGFR-p mRNA
   and protein also are reduced in fibroblasts from IPF explants treated with nutlin-3a or CSP-4.
   The rate of proliferation and production of ECM of these fibroblasts are significantly lower than
10 FL-fibroblasts from untreated or vehicle- or CP-treated controls but comparable to that of
   fibroblasts isolated from NL-tissues.
            B.     Role of p53 and miR-34a in the control of lung fibrosis.
            Based on the above results, it is predicted that lack of p53 and miR-34a expression by
   FL-fibroblasts contributes to lung fibrosis and that restoration of baseline p53 expression by
15 nutlin-3a or CSP-4 via induction of miR-34a mitigates lung fibrosis. Since maximum lung
   fibrosis occurs between 14-28 days after BLM injury (Bhandary YP et al., 2012, supra; Bhandary
   YP et al., 2013, supra; and data presented here) pre-miR-34a is expressed in mouse lung
   fibroblasts by IV injection of lentivirus (LV) containing proa2(I) collagen promoter with pre-miR
   34a at 14 and 21 days after BLM lung injury. Lung fibrosis is evaluated 28 days later. The role of
20 miR-34a in nutlin-3a- or CSP-4-mediated mitigation of lung fibrosis is confirmed by LV expression
   of miR-34a-AS in fibroblasts using proa2(I) promoter in fibrotic lungs.
            The role of p53 in the salutary effects against lung fibrosis is confirmed directly by
   expressing p53 in lung fibroblasts of mice with established fibrosis using LV or Ad-p53
   containing proa(I) collagen promoter with or without inhibition of miR-34a. Lung fibrosis and miR
25 34a expression is evaluated, e.g., 28 days after BLM injury. Alternatively or additionally, p53
   expression is inhibited using LV shRNA in WT mice with BLM-induced lung fibrosis or use p53
   deficient mice with established lung fibrosis (Davis DW et al., JExp Med 192:857-869, 2000).
   These mice are then exposed to nutlin-3a or CSP-4, e.g., 14 and 21 d after BLM injury. Control
   mice with lung fibrosis are exposed to non-specific shRNA or naive WT mice and treated with
30 nutlin-3a or CSP-4. The mice are tested for lung fibrosis and miR-34a expression, e.g., 28 d after
   initiation of BLM injury. The contribution of the p53-uPA system cross-talk is confirmed by
   exposing WT, p53-, uPA-, uPAR- and PAI-1-deficient mice to BLM for 14-21 d to induce lung
                                                      41

            C.      Restoration of p53 expression and downstream p53-uPA fibrinolytic system
                    cross-talk by nutlin-3a or CSP-4 inhibits lung fibrosis.
 5         The contribution of p53-uPA fibrinolytic system cross-talk in mitigation of lung fibrosis
   by nutlin-3a and CSP-4 in mice is confirmed by isolating fibroblasts from these mice, e.g., 28 d
   after BLM injury. These cells are tested for changes in p53, uPA, uPAR and PAI-I expression
   and production of ECM. we expect to find that FL-fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of mice
   with BLM injury will show elevated uPA and uPAR, viability and production of ECM. These
10 FL-fibroblasts show minimal p53 and PAI-I expression compared to NL-fibroblasts from
   uninjured lungs. However, fibroblasts from the lungs of mice with BLM-induced fibrosis
   exposed to nutlin-3a or CSP-4 show elevated p53. These cells are less proliferative with minimal
   ECM production. uPA and uPAR expression are reduced while PAI-I increases compared to
   FL-fibroblasts obtained from BLM injured mice. uPA, uPAR and PAI-i levels in the lung
15 fibroblasts of BLM+nutlin-3a or BLM+CSP-4 treated mice are comparable to NL-fibroblasts
   isolated from uninjured mice.
           To confirm the involvement of p53-uPA system cross-talk, FL-fibroblasts extracted from
   BLM injured mouse lungs are transduced with Ad-p53. The fibroblasts from BLM injured lungs
   exposed to nutlin-3a or CSP-4 are positive controls while those exposed to CP or Ad-EV are
20 negative controls. The cells are tested for changes in uPA, uPAR and PAI-i.
           Transduction of Ad-p53 or treatment with nutlin-3a or CSP-4 augments PAI-I and
   inhibits uPA and uPAR expression. These cells suppress production of ECM and a rate of
   proliferation compared to FL-fibroblasts exposed to CP or Ad-EV. FL-fibroblasts from BLM
   mice express remarkably low levels of caveolin-I and expression of caveolin-I mitigates excess
25 production of ECM. Therefore, FL-fibroblasts are transduced with Ad-Cav-I to see whether p53
   and p53-mediated downstream changes in uPA fibrinolytic system, ECM and cellular viability
   are reduced compared to those treated with Ad-EV.
           D.       Role of nutlin-3a- or CSP-4-mediated in inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in
                    mitigation of lung fibrosis.
30         FL-fibroblasts display elevated phosphorylation of Akt and expression of PDGFR-p
   which provides survival signals (Stambolic V et al. Mol Cell 8:317-25, 2001; Li J et al. J
   Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol 23:253-66, 2004; Hoyle GW et al. Am JPathol154:1763-75,
   1999; Meinecke AK et al. Blood 14:119 :5931-42, 2012) Further, p53 augments expression of
                                                    42

    WO 2014/145389                                                                 PCT/US2014/030147
   PTEN (Stambolic et al., supra; Mayo LD, et al. JBiol Chem 277:5484-89, 2002) and inhibits
   PDGFR-p (Widau RC et al., Mol Cell Biol 32:4270-82, 2012; Thornton JD et al., Cell Cycle
   4:1316-9, 2005) whereas PAI-I inhibits Akt phosphorylation (Shetty SK et al., 2012, supra;
   Stambolic et al., supra, Malinowsky K et al. Transl Oncol 5:98-104, 2012). Transduction of
 5 FL-fibroblasts with Ad-Cav-I inhibits phosphorylation of Akt through increased PTEN activity
   (Tourkina E et al. Open Rheumatol J. 6:116-22, 2012; Wang XM et al. JExp Med 203:2895
   906, 2006; Xia H et al.Am JPathol176:2626-3 7, 2010)
            Results provided herein showed that nutlin-3a and CSP-4 augment p53 and repress
   production of ECM in FL-fibroblasts, and mitigate BLM-induced lung fibrosis. The present
10 inventors therefore conceived that inhibition of Akt and PDGFR-p survival signals in FL
   fibroblasts, due to induction of p53 and changes in p53-uPA fibrinolytic system cross-talk,
   mitigates fibrosis. To test this, FL-fibroblasts from BLM injured mouse lungs are tested for
   phosphorylation of Akt and expression of PDGFR-p. The responses are compared with
   fibroblasts extracted from mice treated with nutlin-3a or CSP-4 or CP after BLM injury. FL
15 fibroblasts from BLM injured mice are expected to have minimum baseline p53 expression and
   elevated phosphorylation of Akt. PDGFR-p expression is expected to increase in FL-fibroblasts.
   p53 should be augmented in fibroblasts from mice treated with either nutlin-3a or CSP-4,
   leading to inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and PDGFR-p expression. Since FL-fibroblasts
   from BLM injured mice express more uPA and uPAR, these fibroblasts will manifest increased
20 viability and ECM compared to fibroblasts from mice treated with BLM plus nutlin-3a or CSP
   4. However, transduction of FL-fibroblasts from BLM mice with Ad-p53 or Ad-Cav-I will
   reduce phosphorylation of Akt and PTEN, PDGFR-p expression, cell viability and production of
   ECM compared to Ad-EV treated control cells. Inhibition of p53 using shRNA will inhibit
   ECM production, PDGFR-p expression and viability of FL-fibroblasts exposed to Ad-Cav-I or
25 nutlin-3a or CSP-4. These cells will show elevated uPA and uPAR with minimal PAI-I
   compared to FL-fibroblasts transduced with Ad-Cav-I or nutlin-3a or CSP-4 in the presence of
   control shRNA.
            According to the present invention, because IPF patients often present with advanced
   fibrotic disease at the time of diagnosis, targeting of FL-fibroblasts has a clinical advantage over
30 prevention of ATII cell apoptosis or epithelial mesenchymal transition. Nutlin-3a and CSP-4
   effectively induce p53 only in FL-fibroblasts for markedly reduced baseline p53 and elevated
   mdm2 expression in FL-fibroblasts compared to NL-fibroblasts or ATII cells in injured lungs.
   This is particularly true with ATII cell caveolin- 1 and p53 expression, which is markedly
                                                      43

   WO 2014/145389                                                                PCT/US2014/030147
   increased in the lungs of patients with IPF or mice with BLM lung injury. Based on this
   experience, further induction of p53 in ATII cells is not anticipated in response to nutlin-3a or
   CSP-4 because of elevated baseline levels in BLM or IPF lungs. Indeed, the present inventors
   and colleagues found that CSP or CSP-4 inhibited BLM- or cigarette smoke-induced ATII cell
 5 p53 expression and apoptosis (Bhandary et al., 2012, 2013, supra; Shetty SK et al., Am JRespir
   Cell Mol Biol 47 :474-83, 2012) by blocking ATM kinase-mediated serine-15 phosphorylation
   of p53 by competing with caveolin-1, which is otherwise induced in ATII cells due to BLM injury
   for protein phosphatase 2A-C (Volonte D et al.,. JBiol Chem 284:5462-66, 2009). In addition,
   nutlin-3 a action on neutrophils and macrophages could have a beneficial effect against
10 inflammation via p53-mediated inhibition of NF-KB DNA binding activity and production of pro
   inflammatory cytokines (Liu G et al., JImmunol 182 :5063-71, 2009).
            Therefore, the benefits of nutlin-3a and CSP-4 interventions outweigh any potential
   deleterious or off-target effects. Excessive proliferation and production of proa(I) collagen by the
   FL-fibroblasts should lead to efficient expression of pre-miR-34a and miR-34a antisense in FL
15 fibroblasts using LV after BLM-induced lung fibrosis in mice (Liu X et al., Am JPhysiol:Lung
   Cell Mol Physiol 298:L819-29, 2010; Merkel 0 et al., Cell Cycle 9:2764-8, 2010).
            Transduction of BLM-injured lungs with Ad-cav-I (Wang XM et al. JExp Med
   203:2895-906, 2006) inhibits fibrosis despite of increased caveolin-1 expression by ATII cells
   during BLM injury. This suggests that expression of p53, pre-miR-34 and miR-34a antisense still
20 should be effective even if they transduce NL-fibroblasts as well as FL-fibroblasts in mice with
   established pulmonary fibrosis.
