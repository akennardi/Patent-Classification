Related Applications
         This Application is related to Australian Patent Application Nos. <removed-apn> and
2014216011,      and    Australian   Patent   No.   2012278120     (a   national   phase   entry    of
PCT/EP2012/060641).         The entire contents of the abovementioned patent and applications
are incorporated herein by reference.
Technical field
         The present invention relates to the field of taste. More particularly, it concerns the
use of certain cinnamic acid derived amides as taste-enhancing ingredients to impart or
reinforce the tastes known as kokumi or umami.
         The present invention also concerns compositions or articles containing at least one of
the aforementioned compounds.
Background and Prior art
         Various cinnamic acid derived amides are known to naturally occur in plants such as
Zanthoxylum rubescens (Rutaceae) [Amides from Zanthoxylum Rubescens. Adesina, S.K.;
Reisch, J. Phytochem. 1989, 3, 839-842.] or Piperaceae [Chemical constituents of peppers
(Piper spp.)      and    application  to    food  preservation: naturally   occurring   antioxidative
compounds. Nakatani, N.; Inatani, R.; Ohta, H.; Nishioka, A., Environ. Health Perspectives
1986, 67, 135-142].
         Since vanilloid amides, such as capsaicin or piperine are usually found in pepper or
capsicum species, they generally have a pungent or hot taste. It would be desirable to avoid
this. US2003/0152682 (Bayer Polymers LLC) and EP 1 323 356 (Symrise) disclose the use
of ferullic acid amides as pungent compounds or heat generating-system for oral hygiene
products. Included in this document is the compound trans-rubenamine, but it is not described
or even suggested to have an umami taste. EP 2 138 152 (to Henkel) describes mouthwash
compositions containing ferrulic acid derived amides among other amides or pungent, or
cooling compounds. However, none of these documents anticipate, report or suggest that the
compounds described therein have organoleptic properties that can be used to impart or
reinforce a kokumi or umami taste.
         In New Developments in Umami (Enhancing) Molecules, Winkel et al, Chemistry &
Biodiversity, Vol 5 (2008), p 1 195-1203, a review of known umami modifying compounds is
given. However, there is no suggestion of the compounds of the present invention.
Kokumi and umami are now established descriptors in the field of taste and are known to
supplement, enhance, or modify the taste and/or aroma of a food without necessarily having a
strong characteristic taste or aroma of their own. A desire for kokumi

                                                 2
   and umami exists for a wide range of foods like soups, sauces, savory snacks, prepared
   meals, condiments, etc. Moreover, they are often found to complement or enhance
   foodstuffs which have a savory or salty characteristic and, as a result, may be useful
   where sodium or salt reduction is desired.
 5         Umami is one of the five basic tastes sensed by specialized receptor cells present
   on the human tongue. Umami applies to the sensation of savoriness, and particularly to
   the detection of glutamates and/or ribotides which are common in meats, cheese and other
   protein-rich foods. The behavior of umami receptors explains why foods containing
   monosodium glutamate (MSG) often taste "fuller". However, some consumers are
10 apparently sensitive to MSG and may suffer from headaches or other illnesses upon
   consuming it. Thus replacement of MSG, at least partially, can be desirable.
           Kokumi has been described variously as "deliciousness", "continuity",
   ?mouthfulness", "mouthfeel" and "thickness". It exists naturally in a variety of foods such
   as cheese, giving a 'mature' cheese taste; vegetable flavors, particularly tomato; meat,
15 where it gives a fullness and longer lasting taste; mayonnaise & dressings, where it can
   round out acid notes; fat-reduced food products, where it gives a similar fullness to full
   fat products; herbs and spice; and soups, especially miso soup.
           US2006/057268 reports saturated or unsaturated N-alkamide and their use as
   umami ingredients.
20         It would be desirable to provide a flavor or taste enhancing ingredient that has
   umami or kokumi characteristics. It would be even more desirable to provide a flavor or
   taste enhancing ingredient that has umami and kokumi characteristics.
   Description of the invention
25         We have now surprisingly discovered that a certain class of cinnamic acid derived
   amide derivatives can be used as flavor or taste enhancing ingredients, for instance to
   impart or reinforce the kokumi or umami taste of a flavoring composition or of a flavored
   food.
           Accordingly, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula
                                                               R4

       the dotted line represents a carbon-carbon single or double bond; and
 5     each of R 1 to R4 , when taken independently from each other, represents a hydrogen
       atom or represents a R5 or OR 5 group, R5 representing a C1 to C 5, or even a C1 to C3 ,
       alkyl group; and optionally one of the groups R 1 to R 4 represents -OH; and/or
       when R1 and R 2 are taken together, and/or R 3 and R 4 are taken together, represent a
       OCH 20 group, provided said groups taken together are adjacent substituents of the
10     phenyl group;
   as an ingredient to confer, enhance, improve or modify the kokumi or umami taste of a
   flavored article.
            For the sake of clarity, by the expression "any one of its stereoisomers", or the
   similar, it is meant the normal meaning understood by a person skilled in the art, i.e. that
15 the invention's compound can be a pure enantiomer (if chiral) or diastereomer (e.g. the
   double bond is in a conformation E or Z).
            For the sake of clarity, by the expression "wherein the dotted line represents
   carbon-carbon single or double bond", or the similar, it is meant the normal meaning
   understood by a person skilled in the art, i.e. that the whole bonding (solid and dotted
20 line) between the carbon atoms connected by said dotted line is a carbon-carbon single or
   double bond.
            One advantage of the present invention is that the compounds confer umami
   and/or kokumi taste to a product without detrimentally affecting the flavor profile of the
   product.

           The compounds of the invention can be used alone or in mixtures and provide a
   strong kokumi or umami taste at exceptionally low levels.
           As mentioned above, the invention concerns the use of a compound of formula (I)
   as a taste-conferring or enhancing ingredient, and in particular to impart or reinforce
25 kokumi or umami taste.
           According to a particular embodiment of the invention, said compound (I) is used
   to impart or reinforce kokumi or umami taste as well as to enhance the saltiness and/or
   savory perception of a flavor.
           According to a particular embodiment of the invention, such use is very much
30 appreciated by flavorists to impart or enhance the kokumi or umami taste in savory
   flavors, such as beef, chicken, pork, and seafood. Surprisingly, in seafood applications
   such as surimi, or seafood bouillons or snack flavors, compounds according to formula (I)
   are also found to enhance the perception of sweetness and longevity of the flavor. By

                                                   6
   contrast, in beef flavors, the compounds according to formula (I) are found to enhance
   perception of fattiness and tallow notes. Additionally we found that said compounds can
   increase juiciness in meat based products.
           In other words the present invention concerns a method to confer, enhance,
 5 improve or modify the taste properties, as indicated above, of a flavoring composition or
   of a flavored article, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an
   effective amount of at least a compound of formula (I). In the context of the present
   invention "use of a compound of formula (I)" includes the use of any composition
   containing compound (I) and which can be advantageously employed in the flavor
10 industry as active ingredient.
           In another aspect, the invention provides            a taste-modifying    composition
   comprising:
   i)   as a taste-conferring or modifying ingredient, at least one compound according to
        formula (I) above;
15 ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a flavor carrier and a
        flavor base; and
   iii) optionally at least one flavor adjuvant.
           By "flavor carrier" we mean here a material which is substantially neutral from a
   flavor point of view, insofar as it does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of
20 flavoring ingredients. The carrier may be a liquid or a solid.
            Suitable liquid carriers include, for instance, an emulsifying system, i.e. a solvent
   and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in flavors. A detailed description of
   the nature and type of solvents commonly used in flavor cannot be exhaustive. Suitable
   solvents include, for instance, propylene glycol, triacetine, triethyl citrate, benzylic
25 alcohol, ethanol, vegetable oils or terpenes.
            Suitable solid carriers include, for instance, absorbing gums or polymers, or even
   encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials may comprise wall-forming and
   plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides, natural or modified starches,
   hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinylalcohols, proteins or
30 pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids :
   Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel, Band 2 der Schriftenreihe
   Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH & Co., Hamburg, 1996.
   Encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in the art, and may be

                                                   7
   performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying, agglomeration, extrusion,
   coacervation and the like.
           By "flavor base" we mean here a composition comprising at least one flavoring
   ingredient.
 5          Said flavoring ingredient is not a compound of formula (I). Moreover, by
   "flavoring ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in flavoring
   preparations or compositions to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such an
   ingredient, to be considered as being a flavoring one, must be recognized by a person
   skilled in the art as being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the taste
10 of a composition, and not just as having a taste.
           The nature and type of the flavoring co-ingredients present in the base do not
   warrant a more detailed description here, the skilled person being able to select them on
   the basis of its general knowledge and according to intended use or application and the
   desired organoleptic effect. In general terms, these flavoring co-ingredients belong to
15 chemical classes as varied as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles,
   terpenoids, nitrogenous or sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said
   perfuming co-ingredients can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co
   ingredients are in any case listed in reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander,
   Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent
20 versions, or in other works of a similar nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature
   in the field of flavor. It is also understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds
   known to release in a controlled manner various types of flavoring compounds.
           According to a particular embodiment of the invention, said flavor base comprises
   another umami imparting flavor ingredient, such as MSG (mono sodium glutamate), and
25 ribotides (a blend, e.g. 50-50 w/w, of IMP (inosine monophosphate) and GMP (guanosine
   monophosphate)), for example in a MSG/ribotides w/w ratio from 95/5 to 90/10. Or
   ingredients rich in those compounds mentioned before that are well known to the people
   skilled in the art.
           By "flavor adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable of imparting additional
30 added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance, chemical stability, and so on. A
   detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant commonly used in flavoring bases
   cannot be exhaustive. Nevertheless, such adjuvants are well known to a person skilled in

                                                  8
   the art, but it has to be mentioned that said ingredients are well known to a person skilled
   in the art.
            A composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I) and at least one
   flavor carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well as a flavoring
 5 composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), at least one flavor carrier,
   at least one flavor base, and optionally at least one flavor adjuvant.
            In a highly preferred embodiment, more than one compound of formula (I) is used
   in combination since it is found that a synergistic enhancement of the kokumi or umami
   taste can be achieved in this way. Moreover, it is found that the combination of
10 ingredients can provide the desired kokumi or umami taste without imparting undesirable
   flavor notes.
            Moreover, a compound of formula (I) can be advantageously incorporated into
   flavored articles to positively impart, or modify, the kokumi or umami taste of said
   articles. Thus, in yet another aspect, the present invention provides a flavored article
15 comprising:
   i)    as taste-conferring or modifying ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I), as
         defined above, optionally present as part of a flavoring composition; and
   ii) a foodstuff base.
            Suitable foodstuff bases, e.g. foods or beverages, can be fried or not, as well as
20 frozen or not, low fat or not, marinated, battered, chilled, dehydrated, instant, canned,
   reconstituted, retorted or preserved. Typical examples of said foodstuff bases include:
   " a seasonings or condiment, such as a stock, a savory cube, a powder mix, a flavored
       oil, a sauce (e.g. a relish, barbecue sauce, a dressing, a gravy or a sweet and/or sour
       sauce), a salad dressing or a mayonnaise;

      etc;
 5 * an imitation products, such as a dairy (e.g a reformed cheese made from oils, fats and
      thickeners) or    seafood or meat (e.g. a vegetarian meat replacer, veggie burgers)
      analogue; or
   " a pet or animal food.
           Particularly preferred foodstuffs in which the compound according to formula (I)
10 finds utility include those having topnotes such as seafood, beef, chicken, vegetables,
   cheese, fat, tallow and/or marrow are important.
           For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "foodstuff' we mean here
   an edible product, e.g. a food or a beverage. Therefore, a flavored article according to the
   invention comprises one or more compounds according to formula (I), as well as optional
15 benefit agents, corresponding to taste and flavor profile of the desired edible product, e.g.
   a savory cube.
           The nature and type of the constituents of the foodstuffs or beverages do not
   warrant a more detailed description here, the skilled person being able to select them on
   the basis of his general knowledge and according to the nature of said product.
20         According to any one of the above embodiments of the invention, the taste
   modifying composition and the flavored article according to the invention comprise as
   taste conferring or modifying ingredient a compound of formula (II) wherein R3
   represents a hydrogen atom or represents a R group, and R 4 represents a R5 or OR 5
   group, R5 representing a C1 to C3 alkyl group. According to any one of the above
25 embodiments of the invention, R5 represents a methyl, ethyl, propyl or iso-propyl group.
           The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be
   incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide
   range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be flavored and
   on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given
30 base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with flavoring co
   ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.
           In the case of flavoring compositions, typical concentrations are in the order of
   0.05% to 30%, more preferably 0.1% to 20%, most preferably 0.1% to 10%, of the

                                                 10
   compounds of the invention based on the weight of the flavoring compositions into which
   they are incorporated. Concentrations lower than these, such as in the order of 0.5 ppm to
   300 ppm by weight, more preferably 5ppm to 75ppm, most preferably 8 to 50 ppm, can
   be used when these compounds are incorporated into flavored articles, the percentage
 5 being relative to the weight of the article.
           At these levels the taste is typically described as umami-like, lasting, sweet and
   lingering.
   Examples
10         The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following
   example, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the NMR spectral
   data were recorded in CDCl 3, with a 400 MHz machine for 1H, and a 100 or 125 MHz
   machine for   13 C, the chemical displacements, S, are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS
   as standard, and the coupling constants, J, are expressed in Hz.

   Preparation of Compound According to the Invention
   Synthesis of amides with ethyl chloroformate, general procedure:
20 The acid (E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acrylic        acid (typically 33 mmol) and DIEA
   (diisopropyl ethyl amine, 2 equiv.) were diluted in 200 mL of EtOAc and 50 mL of
   dichloromethane. The solution was cooled to 15 C and ethyl chloroformate (1 molar
   equiv.) was added drop wise. The reaction was stirred for 1 hour before the starting amine
   (1 molar equiv., diluted 2-3 times in EtOAc) was added. The reaction was stirred
25 overnight at room temperature. It was washed with aqueous 5% KHSO 4 , brine, aqueous
   5% NaHCO 3, brine, and then dried over Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated under high vacuum for 3
   hours.   The crude product        was purified by flash chromatography           (silica gel;
   cyclohexane/EtOAc, 2:8) or by recrystallization from EtOAc. Yields were between 50
   and 80% on the purified product.

        a) Pure amide in pure water
   The amides were evaluated at 20ppm in mineral water in comparison with 0.05%
   monosodium glutamate (MSG). The trained panelists (5-10) were giving an umami taste
   intensity note. The Relative umami intensity (RUI) was calculated as follows:
