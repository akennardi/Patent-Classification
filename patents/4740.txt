[0003]           The present disclosure relates generally to orthopaedic instruments for use
in the performance of an orthopaedic joint replacement procedure, and more particularly to
orthopaedic surgical instruments for use in the performance of a revision knee replacement
procedure.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0004]           The knee joint basically consists of the bone interface of the distal end of
the femur and the proximal end of the tibia. Appearing to cover or at least partially protect
this interface is the patella, which is a sesamoid bone within the tendon of the long muscle
(quadriceps) on the front of the thigh. This tendon inserts into the tibial tuberosity and the
posterior surface of the patella is smooth and glides over the femur.

                                                 2
[0005]          The femur is configured with two knob like processes (the medial condyle
and the lateral condyle) which are substantially smooth and which articulate with the
medial plateau and the lateral plateau of the tibia, respectively. The plateaus of the tibia are
substantially smooth and slightly cupped thereby providing a slight receptacle for receipt
of the femoral condyles.
[0006]          When the knee joint is damaged whether as a result of an accident or illness,
a prosthetic replacement of the damaged joint may be necessary to relieve pain and to
restore normal use to the joint. Typically the entire knee joint is replaced by means of a
surgical procedure that involves removal of the surfaces of the corresponding damaged
bones and replacement of these surfaces with prosthetic implants. This replacement of a
native joint with a prosthetic joint is referred to as a primary total-knee arthroplasty.
[0007]          On occasion, the primary knee prostheses fails. Failure can result from
many causes, including wear, aseptic loosening, osteolysis, ligamentous instability,
arthrofibrosis and patellofemoral complications. When the failure is debilitating, revision
knee surgery may be necessary. In a revision, the primary knee prosthesis is removed and
replaced with components of a revision prosthetic knee system.
[0008]          Knee implant systems for both primary and revision applications are
available from a variety of manufacturers, including DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw,
Indiana. DePuy and others offer several different systems for both primary and revision
applications. For example, DePuy Orthopaedics offers the P.F.C. SIGMA@ Knee System,
the LCS@ Total Knee System, and the S-ROM Modular Total Knee System. These
orthopaedic knee systems includes several components, some appropriate for use in
primary knee arthroplasty and some appropriate for use in revision surgery.
[0009]          DePuy Orthopaedics also offers other orthopaedic implant systems for other
applications. One such system is the LPS System. The LPS System is provided for use in
cases of severe trauma and disease. In such cases, the trauma or disease can lead to
significant amounts of bone loss. The LPS System provides components that can replace
all or significant portions of a particular bone, such as the femur. The DePuy LPS System
is described more fully in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/135,791., entitled "Modular

                                                3
Limb Preservation System", filed Apr. 30, 2002 by Hazebrouck et al. (U.S. Pat. Pub. No.
2003-0204267), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
[0010]          In some patients, the metaphysis of the bone near the joint presents cavitary
defects that are not completely filled by standard knee implants. The presence of such
metaphyseal defects can result in loosening of the prosthetic implant over time,
compromising the stability of the prosthetic implant and frequently requiring revision of
the prosthetic implant.
[0011]          To fill metaphyseal cavitary defects, knee systems with modular
metaphyseal sleeves have been provided. Such sleeves are illustrated, for example, in: U.S.
Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0114323, entitled "Knee Prosthesis Kit with Winged Sleeves and
Milling Guide;" U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2006/0030945A1, entitled "Modular Orthopaedic
Implant System With Multi-Use Stems;" U.S. Pat. No. 7,799,085, entitled "Modular
Implant System With Fully Porous Coated Sleeve;" U.S. Pat. No. 7,291,174, entitled
"Prosthetic Tibial Component With Modular Sleeve;" U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,342, entitled
"Medical Fastening System;" U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,097, entitled "Medical Fastening
System;" U.S. Pat. No. 5,782,921, entitled "Modular Knee Prosthesis;" and U.S. Pat. No.
4,634,444, entitled "Semi-Constrained Artificial Joint." Such sleeves have been used in
commercially available prosthetic knee implant systems, such as the P.F.C. SIGMA.@
Knee System, the LCS@ Total Knee System, the S-ROM Modular Total Knee System and
the LPS System, all available from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana.
[0012]          Modular sleeves have also been used in hip implant systems, as illustrated,
for example, in: U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,699, entitled " Modular Stem and Sleeve Prosthesis;"
and U.S. Pat. No. 4,790,852, entitled "Sleeves for Affixing Artificial Joints to Bone." Such
hip sleeves have been used in commercially available prosthetic hip implant systems, such
as the S-ROM hip systems, available from DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana.
[0013]          The disclosures of all of the above patent applications and patents are
incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

                                                4
 [0014]         In knee systems with modular metaphyseal sleeves, the conventional shape
of many of the sleeves is generally an elliptical cone with a large ellipse profile close to the
joint line tapering down to a smaller elliptical or circular profile at the termination of the
component distal to the joint line. Generally, the sleeves have a terraced or stepped outer
 surface and an inner channel for frictional fixation to another component. This geometry
fills cavitary defects in the metaphysis, allows for a wider surface area for load transfer
 through the joint and provides rotational stability for the articulating components of the
prosthesis.
 [0015]         The outer surface of the sleeve is supported by solid bony structure or the
bone bed. In the case of the distal femur, patient anatomy and the condition of the bone,
particularly in a revision surgery, may require that the distal femur be resected to a more
proximal level. Implanting a prosthetic distal femoral component and sleeve at this more
proximal level may elevate the joint line (that is, the line defined by the articulation of the
articular surfaces of the distal femoral component and proximal tibial component).
Elevation of the joint line may adversely affect performance of the prosthetic knee system:
the positions of the collateral ligament attachments to the femur relative to the joint line
may impact knee kinematics, the articulation of the patella against the femoral component
 will be impacted, and the function of the extensor mechanism will also be impacted.
 [00161         Prosthetic knee implant systems have commonly included femoral augments
for use on the distal and posterior bone-facing surfaces of the femoral implant components.
Examples of such augments are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,005,018 and 5,984,969,
 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. Such components serve to
 augment the inferior and posterior portions of the femoral component to add additional
thickness to compensate for the lack of sufficient boney tissue, allowing the joint line to be
distalized. However, with the femoral component so distalized, the metaphyseal sleeve
used with the femoral component may no longer be optimally seated on a healthy bone
 bed. To compensate, surgeons may sometimes opt to use a larger size of metaphyseal
 sleeve. Because of differences in the geometries of differently-sized metaphyseal sleeves,
changing to a larger size requires that the surgeon prepare the bone cavity a second time so
that the cavity will accept the geometry of the larger size of metaphyseal sleeve.

                                               5
[0017]          Accordingly, a need exists for a knee prosthesis system that allows the
surgeon the flexibility to optimize the position of the joint line while also allowing for a
metaphyseal sleeve to be efficiently and optimally positioned on a healthy bone bed.
SUMMARY
[0018]          A modular knee implant system that allows the surgeon to prepare the bone
to receive a metaphyseal sleeve and to optimize the position of the joint line without
further bone preparation to receive a different size of metaphyseal sleeve is provided.
[0019]          According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a modular knee prosthesis
system is provided. The system includes a distal femoral implant component, a proximal
tibial implant component and two metaphyseal members. The distal femoral implant
component has a pair of spaced, curved distal condylar surfaces and a stem. The stem has
an outer surface tapering from a distal end in the proximal direction. The outer surface of
the stem has a maximum outer diameter at the distal end and a smaller outer diameter at a
second position proximal to the distal end. The proximal tibial implant component has an
articulating surface to receive and articulate with the distal articulating surfaces of the
distal femoral component and a stem. The tibial stem has an outer surface tapering from a
proximal end in the distal direction. The outer surface of the tibial stem has a maximum
outer diameter at the proximal end and a smaller outer diameter at a second position distal
to the proximal end. The first metaphyseal member has an outer surface that tapers in a
proximal direction and an inner surface defining a tapered bore sized and shaped to be
mountable on the stem of one of the implant components and to create a frictional lock
between the stem and the first metaphyseal member. The outer surface of the first
metaphyseal member comprises a stepped portion having a plurality of steps. Each step has
a maximum medial-lateral dimension and a maximum anterior-posterior dimension. The
stepped portion of the first metaphyseal sleeve has an overall axial length L. The second
metaphyseal member has an outer surface that tapers in a proximal direction and an inner
surface defining a tapered bore sized and shaped to be mountable on the stem of one of the
implant components and to create a frictional lock between the stem component and the
second metaphyseal member. The outer surface of the second metaphyseal member
comprises a stepped portion having a plurality of steps. Each step has a maximum medial-

                                               6
lateral dimension and a maximum anterior-posterior dimension. The stepped portion of the
second metaphyseal sleeve has an overall axial length L+X and has a common geometry
with the first metaphyseal sleeve over axial length L: over axial length L, the maximum
medial-lateral dimension and maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each step is the
same as the maximum medial-lateral dimension and maximum anterior-posterior
dimension of each step over the axial length L of the stepped portion of the first
metaphyseal member. With this common geometry over axial length L, the same prepared
bone space will receive either the first metaphyseal member or the second metaphyseal
member.
[0020]          In an illustrative embodiment, the first metaphyseal member and the second
metaphyseal member have the same number of steps over axial length L of the stepped
portions of the first metaphyseal member and the second metaphyseal member.
[0021]          In a more particular embodiment, each step of the stepped portion of the
first metaphyseal member has an axial height, each step of the stepped portion of the
second metaphyseal member has an axial height, and the axial heights of corresponding
steps of the first metaphyseal member and the second metaphyseal member are the same.
[0022]          In another illustrative embodiment, the system also includes a third
metaphyseal member having an outer surface that tapers in a proximal direction and an
inner surface defining a tapered bore sized and shaped to be mountable on the stem of one
of the implants components and to create a frictional lock between the stem and the third
metaphyseal member. The outer surface of the third metaphyseal member comprises a
stepped portion having a plurality of steps. Each step has a maximum medial-lateral
dimension and a maximum anterior-posterior dimension. The stepped portion having an
overall axial length L+X+Y. The maximum medial-lateral dimension and maximum
anterior-posterior dimension of each step over the axial length L of the stepped portion of
the third metaphyseal member is the same as the maximum medial-lateral dimension and
maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each step over the axial length L of the stepped
portion of the first metaphyseal member and the second metaphyseal member. The
maximum medial-lateral dimension and maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each
step over the axial length L+X of the stepped portion of the third metaphyseal member is

                                                7
the same as the maximum medial-lateral dimension and maximum anterior-posterior
dimension of each step over the axial length L+X of the stepped portion of the second
metaphyseal member.
[0023]           In another illustrative embodiment, the tapered bore of the first metaphyseal
member is sized and shaped to be mountable on the stem of the distal femoral implant
component and to create a frictional lock between the stem of the distal femoral implant
component and the first metaphyseal member and the tapered bore of the second
metaphyseal member is sized and shaped to be mountable on the stem of the distal femoral
implant component and to create a frictional lock between the stem of the distal femoral
implant component and the first metaphyseal member. In this embodiment, the contact
between the articulating surfaces of the tibial member and the distal femoral component
define a first joint line when the distal femoral component is assembled with the first
metaphyseal member and the contact between the articulating surfaces of the tibial member
and the distal femoral component define a second joint line when the distal femoral
component is assembled with the second metaphyseal member. The second joint line is
more distal than the first joint line in this embodiment.
[0024]           In a more particular embodiment, the distance between the first joint line
and the second joint line corresponds with the difference between the overall axial lengths
of the first metaphyseal member and the second metaphyseal member and defines a distal
offset.
[0025]           According to another aspect of the present invention, a modular knee
prosthesis system comprises a distal femoral component, a first metaphyseal member and a
second metaphyseal member. The distal femoral component has a pair of spaced, curved
distal condylar surfaces and a stem having an outer surface tapering from a distal end in the
proximal direction. The outer surface of the femoral stem has a maximum outer diameter at
the distal end and a smaller outer diameter at a second position proximal to the distal end.
The first metaphyseal member includes an inner surface defining a tapered bore sized and
shaped to be mountable on the stem of the distal femoral component and to create a
frictional lock between the stem of the distal femoral component and the first metaphyseal
member. The tapered bore extends proximally from an opening at the distal end of the first

                                               8
metaphyseal member. The first metaphyseal member also includes a tapered stepped outer
surface having an axial length L. The second metaphyseal member includes an inner
surface defining a tapered bore sized and shaped to be mountable on the stem of the distal
femoral component and to create a frictional lock between the stem of the distal femoral
component and the second metaphyseal member, the tapered bore extending proximally
from an opening at the distal end of the second metaphyseal member. The second
metaphyseal member includes a tapered stepped outer surface having an axial length L+X.
The tapered stepped outer surface of the first metaphyseal member and the tapered stepped
outer surface of the second metaphyseal member have the same shape and the same
medial-lateral dimensions and the same anterior-posterior dimensions over axial length L.
When the first metaphyseal member is mounted on the distal femoral component with the
first metaphyseal member frictionally locked to the distal femoral component, the
assembly has a maximum axial length. When the second metaphyseal member is mounted
on the distal femoral component with the second metaphyseal member frictionally locked
to the distal femoral component, the assembly has a maximum axial length. The maximum
axial length of the assembly of the second metaphyseal member and the distal femoral
component is greater than the maximum axial length of the assembly of the first
metaphyseal member and the distal femoral component.
[0026]          In an illustrative embodiment, the first metaphyseal member and the second
metaphyseal member have the same number of steps over axial length L of the tapered
stepped outer surface of the first metaphyseal member and the tapered stepped outer
surface of the second metaphyseal member.
[0027]          In a more particular embodiment, each step of the tapered stepped outer
surface of the first metaphyseal member has an axial height and each step of the tapered
stepped outer surface of the second metaphyseal member has an axial height. The axial
heights of corresponding steps of the first metaphyseal member and the second
metaphyseal member are the same.
[0028]          In another illustrative embodiment, the system further comprises a third
metaphyseal member including an inner surface defining a tapered bore sized and shaped
to be mountable on the stem of the distal femoral component and to create a frictional lock

                                               9
between the stem of the distal femoral component and the first metaphyseal member. The
tapered bore extends proximally from an opening at the distal end of the first metaphyseal
member. The first metaphyseal member includes a tapered stepped outer surface having an
axial length L+X+Y. When the third metaphyseal member is mounted on the distal femoral
component with the third metaphyseal member frictionally locked to the distal femoral
component, the assembly has a maximum axial length. The maximum axial length of the
assembly of the third metaphyseal member and the distal femoral component is greater
than the maximum axial length of the assembly of the second metaphyseal member and the
distal femoral component.
[0029]         In another illustrative embodiment, the distal femoral component has a
distal bone-facing surface and the system further comprises a distal femoral augment. The
distal femoral augment has a thickness that is substantially the same as X.

[0069]          Terms representing anatomical references, such as anterior, posterior,
medial, lateral, superior, inferior, etcetera, may be used throughout the specification in
reference to the orthopaedic implants and orthopaedic surgical instruments described
herein as well as in reference to the patient's natural anatomy. Such terms have well
understood meanings in both the study of anatomy and the field of orthopaedics. Use of
such anatomical reference terms in the written description and claims is intended to be
consistent with their well-understood meanings unless noted otherwise.
[0070]          FIG. 1 illustrates an example of the femoral components of a modular knee
prosthesis system illustrating the principles of the present invention. The femoral
components of the system include a distal femoral component 10 with distal curved convex
condylar surfaces 12, 14. The illustrated distal femoral component is a posterior stabilized
component. The system illustrated in FIG. 1 also includes a femoral stem 16, along with a
collar 18 for placement between the stem 16 and the distal femoral component 10 and a
bolt 20 so that the stem 16 and collar 18 may be selectively mounted on the distal femoral
component. Each stem 16 has a frusto-conical outer surface that is smooth and tapers from
a maximum outer diameter at the distal end to smaller outer diameters at positions
proximal to the distal end. Stem extensions 22 are also provided. All of the above
components may be standard parts of the P.F.C. SIGMA.@ Knee System available from
DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana, for example. Each stem 16 in the illustrated
embodiments is an adapter with features like those illustrated in U.S. Pat. Pub. No.
2006/0030945, entitled "Modular Orthopaedic Implant System with Multi-Use Stems."
The stems 16 may also have features like those illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,342,
entitled "Medical Fastening System," U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,097, entitled "Medical Fastening
System," U.S. Pat. No. 5,782,921, entitled "Modular Knee Prosthesis." Also as described
in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2006/0030945, the stem extension may have features other than those
illustrated in FIG. 1. It should be understood that these components are described for
purposes of illustration only; the present invention is not limited to any particular type of
distal femoral component or stem or any other particular component unless expressly
called out in the claims. For example, in some embodiments, the femoral component 10
may have an integral stem 16 instead of the illustrated stem adapter 16, collar 18 and bolt
20.

                                                14
[0071]          In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the femoral components of the illustrated
system include a plurality of sizes of metaphyseal sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C. As described
in more detail below, the geometries of the exterior surfaces of the four sizes of
metaphyseal sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C are the same over a substantial portion of their
axial lengths. It should be understood that multiple sizes of distal femoral components 10
and stem extensions 22 would typically be included in the modular knee prosthesis system.
It should also be understood that a modular knee prosthesis system utilizing the principles
of the present invention may include fewer or more sizes of metaphyseal sleeves 24, 24A,
24B, 24C.
[0072]          As illustrated in FIG. 2, on the tibial side, the kit includes a tibial tray
component 30, a tibial bearing insert 32 and a stem extension 34. The illustrated tibial tray
component 30 is a commercial MBT Revision tibial tray, available from DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana. The tray component 30 has an integral stem
portion 36 with a bore (not shown) with internal threads to which the stem extension 34
may be attached. The outer surface of the stem portion 36 has a smooth finish, tapers away
from the joint motion surface and is connected to the inferior surface of the tibial tray
component 30 through keels 31, 33. The stem portion 36 extends distally from a platform
38, which has a proximal surface on which the tibial bearing insert 32 rests. The tibial
components may also include one or more types or sizes of metaphyseal sleeves, such as
sleeve 40 that has a tapered bore (not shown) sized and shaped to frictionally lock with the
tapered stem portion 36 of the tibial tray component 30. It should be understood that these
tibial components are described for purposes of illustration only; the present invention is
not limited to any particular type of tibial component or stem or any other particular
component unless expressly called out in the claims. For example, the tibial component
may comprise a unitary, all-polymer component or a fixed bearing system, such as those
disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,628,818 and 8,128,703 (which are incorporated by reference
herein in their entireties).
[0073]          The juncture of the curved convex condyles 12, 14 of the distal femoral
component 10 and the curved concave condylar surfaces of the tibial bearing insert 32 (the
curved concave condylar surfaces of the tibial bearing insert being shown in FIG. 2 in

                                                15
phantom at 37, 39) define the articulation of the femoral and tibial components as the knee
flexes and extends. When the patient's leg is in extension, the contact between the curved
convex condyles 12, 14 and concave condylar surfaces 37, 39 corresponds with a distal
joint line. As the knee is flexed from full extension, the distal femoral component 10 and
tibial bearing insert 32 move with respect to each other so that the joint line at full flexion
 (when the posterior surfaces of the femoral condyles contact the bearing surface) may vary
 somewhat from the distal joint line. The plane of the joint line, tangent to the point of
contact of the condylar surfaces of the distal femoral component on the tibial insert, is
 shown at 21 in FIGS. 1 and 13 and at 21A in FIG. 14.
 [0074]          It should be understood that a typical modular knee prosthesis system or kit
 would include multiple sizes of each of the illustrated tibial components 30, 32, 34, 40.
 [0075]          The metaphyseal sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C are designed for use in a bone
wherein the condition of the bone requires additional support or fixation in the metaphysis
of the bone. Each of the femoral sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C has an outer surface that
includes a distal base 47, 47A, 47B, 47C and a stepped portion 49, 49A, 49B, 49C
extending proximally from the distal base to the proximal ends 26, 26A, 26B, 26C. Each
 stepped portion 49, 49A, 49B, 49C has a plurality of adjacent steps or terraces, shown in
FIGS. 3-10 at 50A, 50B, 50C and 50D for the femoral sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C and at 54
for the tibial sleeve 40 (FIG. 2). For the femoral sleeves, the stepped outer surfaces taper
proximally: the steps 50, 50A, 50B, 50C at the distal ends 56, 56A, 56B, 56C have the
largest anterior-posterior and medial-lateral dimensions and the steps 50, 50A, 50B, 50C at
the proximal ends 26, 26A, 26B, 26C have the smallest anterior-posterior and medial
lateral dimensions; the intermediate steps gradually become smaller from the distal ends
 56, 56A, 56B, 56C toward the proximal ends 26, 26A, 26B, 26C. For the tibial sleeve 40,
the outer surface tapers distally: the most distal step has the smallest anterior-posterior and
medial-lateral dimensions and the most proximal step has the largest anterior-posterior and
medial-lateral dimensions; the intermediate steps gradually become smaller from the
proximal end toward the distal end.
 [0076]          It should be understood that the number and size of the steps 50, 50A, 50B,
 50C, may vary from the number and size of steps in the illustrated embodiments. For

                                               16
example, the outer surfaces of the metaphyseal sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C, may have steps
and be shaped like standard commercially available metaphyseal sleeves sold by DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana, and may be configured like the sleeves disclosed in
the prior art, such as, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,799,085. The outer surfaces of the
sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C, may also be porous coated to promote bone ingrowth, as
disclosed in the prior art; the porous coating may extend over substantially all or a portion
of the stepped outer surfaces of the sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C.
[0077]           As shown in FIGS. 1, 3-6 and 11-12, the illustrated femoral sleeves 24,
24A, 24B, 24C have interior surfaces 64, 64A, 64B, 64C defining a proximal bore 68, 68A,
68B, 68C and a distal bore 72, 72A, 72B, 72C. The proximal and distal bores 68, 68A,
68B, 68C, 72, 72A, 72B, 72C in each femoral sleeve may be connected and aligned along
central longitudinal axes 76, 76A, 76B, 76C of the bores.
[0078]           The proximal bores 68, 68A, 68B, 68C of the femoral sleeves 24, 24A, 24B,
24C are sized and shaped to receive a distal end 80 of a stem extension 22. Accordingly,
for a stem extension having a Morse taper post at its distal end, the proximal bore would
comprise a Morse taper bore sized and shaped to receive and frictionally lock with the
Morse taper post. Alternatively, for a stem extension having a threaded distal end, the
proximal bore may be threaded to receive and lock to the threaded distal end of the stem
extension. An adapter to allow for use of different types of stem extensions may also be
used, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,799,085.
[0079]           The distal bores 72, 72A, 72B, 72C of the femoral metaphyseal sleeves 24,
24A, 24B, 24C are frusto-conical Morse taper bores, tapering from the distal ends 56, 56A,
56B, 56C of the sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C toward the proximal ends 26, 26A, 26B, 26C
of the sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C. These distal bores 72, 72A, 72B, 72C are sized, shaped
and finished to be mountable on the stem or adapter 16 of the distal femoral component 10
and to create a frictional lock between the stem of the distal femoral component and the
metaphyseal sleeve, the stem or adapter 16 defining a Morse taper post.
[0080]           As used herein, "Morse taper" refers to one type of locking tapers between
mating components. Generally, Morse taper posts and bores have frusto-conical shapes,

                                                17
substantially the same taper angle and have complementary outer and inner diameters at
some point along their length to allow for tight frictional engagement between the posts
and the walls defining the bores. Standard taper angles and standard surface finishes for
such locking tapers may be used in the present invention. It should be appreciated that
other types of tapered components may be used.
[0081]          In the illustrated knee prosthesis system, the distal bores 72, 72A, 72B, 72C
of each size of sleeve 24, 24A, 24B, 24C has the same maximum inner diameter at the
distal end 56, 56A, 56B, 56C of the sleeve. This maximum inner diameter substantially
corresponds with the maximum outer diameter of the tapered frusto-conical outer surface
75 of the stem or adapter 16 of the distal femoral component 10. The distal bores 72, 72A,
72B, 72C of all the sizes of sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C and the tapered frusto-conical outer
surface 75 of the stem or adapter 16 taper in the proximal direction at substantially the
same taper angle so that relative axial movement of the sleeve 24, 24A, 24B, 24C and stem
or adapter 16 locks the two together when the interior surface 64, 64A, 64B, 64C of the
sleeve 24 engages and frictionally locks with the tapered frusto-conical outer surface 75 of
the stem or adapter 16.
[0082]          As shown in FIGS. 3, 7 and 13, the stepped outer surface 49 of the smallest
size of femoral metaphyseal sleeve 24 has an overall axial length between the distal base
47 and the proximal end 26 shown at "L". The stepped outer surface 49A of the next larger
size of femoral metaphyseal sleeve 24A has an overall axial length between the base 47A
and the proximal end 26A of "L+X", the dimensions "L" and "X" being shown in FIGS. 4
and 8. The stepped outer surface 49B of the next larger size of femoral metaphyseal sleeve
24B has an overall axial length between the base 47B and the proximal end 26B of
"L+X+Y", the dimensions "L", "X" and "Y" being shown in FIGS. 5 and 9. The stepped
outer surface 49C of the largest illustrated size of femoral metaphyseal sleeve 24C has an
overall axial length between the base 47C and the proximal end 26C of "L+X+Y+Z", the
dimensions "L", "X", "Y" and "Z" being shown in FIGS. 6, 10 and 14. The different sizes
of femoral metaphyseal sleeves may be provided with differences of a few millimeters (for
example, 4 millimeters) between each size, so that X=4mm, Y=4mm and Z=4mm. It

                                                18
should be understood that these dimensions are provided as examples only; the inventions
is not limited to any particular dimensions unless expressly called for in the claims.
[0083]           In the illustrated modular knee prosthesis system, the geometries of the
stepped outer surfaces 49, 49A, 49B, 49C of all sizes of femoral metaphyseal sleeve 24,
24A, 24B, 24C are essentially identical over axial length "L". Thus, if "L" is 68 mm for
the smallest sleeve, the sizes and shapes of the proximal 68 mm of the other sleeve sizes
24A, 24B, 24C are essentially identical to the size and shape of the proximal 68 mm of the
smallest sleeve 24. In other words, over axial length "L" for all of the illustrated sizes of
femoral metaphyseal sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C, the sleeves have the same number of
steps, and each step has the same maximum medial-lateral dimension, the same maximum
anterior-posterior dimension, the same axial height and the same shape. The different sizes
of femoral metaphyseal sleeves differ only in the sizes of the bases 47, 47A, 47B, 47C and
in the distal portions corresponding with the axial extensions of the sleeves beyond the
length "L" of the smallest sleeve 24.

[0084]           FIGS. 13 and 14 illustrate assemblies of the smallest and largest illustrated
femoral metaphyseal sleeves 24, 24C with a distal femoral implant component 10, femoral
stem extension 22, tibial tray 30, tibial insert 32 and tibial stem extension 34. The
illustrated assemblies have maximum axial lengths from planes at the proximal ends 26,
26C (the planes shown at 100 and 102) to the plane of the joint line, shown at 21 in FIG.
13 and at 21A in FIG. 14. These maximum axial lengths of the assemblies are shown at
AL1 in FIG. 13 and AL2 in FIG. 14. AL2 is longer than ALl by the dimension "X+Y+Z",
that is the axial length of the sleeve 24C beyond the length "L" of the smallest sleeve 24.

                                                19
[0085]           As can also be seen from a comparison of FIGS. 13 and 14, using the larger
sleeve 24C distalizes the joint line 21 to the position 21A by the offset distance oi. This
offset distance oi also corresponds with the dimension "X+Y+Z". Similarly, using the
sleeve 24A distalizes the joint line by the dimension "X" and using the sleeve 24B
distalizes the joint line by the dimension "X+Y".
[0086]           Since the geometries of the stepped outer surfaces 49, 49A, 49B, 49C of the
different sizes of sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C are the same through axial length "L", the
surgeon can prepare the distal femur to receive the smallest size of femoral sleeve 24. If
the surgeon determines intraoperatively that the joint line should be distalized, the surgeon
may use any of the other sizes of sleeve 24A, 24B, 24C, and the proximal portion of the
larger size sleeve will fit within the opening prepared in the femur to receive the smaller
sleeve and extend distally from the bone by the distance "X", "X+Y" or "X+Y+Z" to
thereby distally offset the joint line. The surgeon can accomplish this distalization without
any further preparation of the bone cavity.
[0087]           As described above, femoral augments may be used on the distal and
posterior bone-facing surfaces of the femoral implant components when the joint line is
distalized. In the illustrative embodiment, a distal augment 110 may be attached to one of a
pair of distal fixation surfaces 109 of the distal femoral implant component 10 when the
sleeve 24C is used, as shown in FIG. 14. In the illustrative embodiment, the thickness of
the augment 109 is equal to the offset distance o1. One of the distal fixation surfaces 109 is
positioned opposite the condylar surface 12 and the other distal fixation surface 109 is
positioned opposite the condylar surface 14. It should be appreciated that another distal
augment may be attached to that surface as well. When the sleeve 24 is used, no augment
is necessary, as shown in FIG. 13.
[0088]           It should also be appreciated that the principles of the present invention may
also be applied to the tibial components of the knee implant system, such as the tibial
sleeve 40 shown in FIG. 2. Such a system could allow the surgeon to select components to
provide a proximal offset to the tibial tray platform 38.

                                               20
[0089]          All of the components of the prosthesis systems described herein may be
made of standard materials, such as a standard polymer (UHMWPE, for example) for the
tibial bearing insert 32 and standard metals, such as cobalt-chromium and titanium alloys,
for the remaining components. To promote bone ingrowth, the sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C
may be porous coated, or could comprise titanium foam as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Pub. Nos.
20100057212 ("Porous Titanium Tibial Sleeves and Their Use in Revision Knee Surgery")
and 20100076565 ("Porous Titanium Femoral Sleeves and Their Use in Revision Knee
Surgery"), both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
[0090]          Referring now to FIGS. 15-37, another modular knee prosthesis system is
shown with different embodiments of the femoral components (hereinafter components
200). An orthopaedic surgical instrument system 300 for use with the modular knee
prosthesis system is also shown. Some features of the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 15
37 are substantially similar to those discussed above in reference to the embodiment of
FIGS. 1-14. Such features are designated in FIGS. 15-37 with the same reference numbers
as those used in FIGS. 1-14.
[0091]          As shown in FIG. 15, the femoral components 200 of the system include a
femoral component 210 including distal curved convex condylar surfaces 12, 14. The
surfaces 12, 14 are shaped (i.e., curved) in a manner that approximates the condyles of the
natural femur. In the illustrative embodiment, the condylar surface 12 is a medial condyle
surface 12, and the condylar surface 14 is a lateral condyle surface 14. The surfaces 12, 14
are spaced apart from one another, thereby defining an intercondylar notch therebetween.
[0092]          The condyle surfaces 12, 14 are formed in a bearing surface 212 of the
femoral component 210, and the femoral component 210 includes a fixation surface 214
positioned opposite the bearing surface 212. The femoral component 210 also includes an
elongated stem post 216 that extends superiorly away from the surface 214. The elongated
stem post 216 is configured to receive a stem component such as, for example, the stem
extension 22, or engage a metaphyseal sleeve such as, for example, the sleeves 24, 24A,
24B, 24C described above or sleeves 224, 224A, 224B, which are described in greater
below.

                                               21
[0093]           Specifically, as shown in FIG. 15, the elongated stem post 216 of the
femoral component 210 has a tapered bore 218 defined therein into which the tapered
distal end 80 of the stem extension 22 may be advanced to taper lock the post 216 to the
stem extension 22. Similar to the adaptor 16 of the distal femoral component 10, the outer
surface 220 of the elongated stem post 216 is also tapered and may be advanced into one of
the distal bores 72, 72A, 72B, 72C of the sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C, respectively, or one
of the tapered distal bores 272, 272A, 272B of the sleeves 224, 224A, 224B. As described
above, each distal bore is shaped and finished to create a frictional lock such as, for
example, a taper lock, between the corresponding sleeve and the femoral component 210.
In the illustrative embodiment, the outer surface 220 defines a Morse taper.
[0094]           The fixation surface 214 of the femoral component 210 includes a number
of surfaces 230, 232, 234, 236 positioned opposite the condyle surfaces 12, 14. In the
illustrative embodiment, the fixation surface 214 includes a pair of distal fixation surfaces
230 similar to the distal fixation surface 109 of distal femoral component 10. One of the
distal fixation surfaces 230 is positioned medially and the other is positioned laterally. The
fixation surface 214 also includes a pair of posterior fixation surfaces 232, with one being
medially positioned and the other laterally positioned. As shown in FIG. 15, the posterior
fixation surfaces 232 extend generally in the superior/inferior direction.
[0095]           The fixation surface 214 also includes a pair of posterior chamfer surfaces
234, with one being medially positioned and the other laterally positioned. The medial and
lateral posterior-chamfer fixation surfaces 234 extend superiorly and posteriorly from their
respective lateral and medial distal fixation surfaces 230 to their respective posterior
fixation surfaces 232. As shown in FIG. 15, the fixation surface 214 has a pair of anterior
chamfer surfaces 236, with one being medially positioned and the other laterally
positioned. The medial and lateral anterior-chamfer fixation surfaces 236 extend superiorly
and posteriorly from their respective lateral and medial distal fixation surfaces 230 to their
respective posterior fixation surfaces 232.
[0096]           Each of the fixation surfaces 230, 232, 234, 236 has a cement pocket formed
therein. In the illustrative embodiment, the cement pockets are contiguous with one another
such that a single, continuous cement pocket 240 is formed in both the medial and lateral

                                               22
fixation surfaces 214 of the femoral component 210. Each cement pocket 240 is defined by
a side wall 242 that extends inwardly from the respective fixation surface 214 to a bottom
wall 244.
[0097]          A mounting aperture 250 is defined in each distal fixation surface 230. As
shown in FIG. 15, the aperture 250 is defined by a cylindrical wall 252 that extends
inwardly from a rim 254 positioned in the cement pocket 240. As described in greater
detail below, the aperture 250 is sized to receive a mounting plug 256 of a distal augment
component 342, 344 to secure the augment component 342, 344 to the femoral component
210.
[0098]          Another mounting aperture 260 is defined in each posterior fixation surface
232. As shown in FIG. 15, the aperture 260 is defined by a cylindrical wall 252 that
extends inwardly from a rim 254 positioned in the cement pocket 240. As described in
greater detail below, the aperture 260 is sized to receive a mounting plug 256 of a posterior
augment component 346, 348 to secure the augment component 346, 348 to the femoral
component 210.
[0099]          As shown in FIG. 15, the femoral components 200 include a plurality of
sizes of metaphyseal sleeves 224, 224A, 224B. Similar to the sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C
described above, the geometries of the sleeves 224, 224A, 224B of the exterior surfaces of
the three sizes are the same over a portion of their axial lengths. As used herein, the terms
"same," "match," or "identical" refer to components that are designed to have the same
dimensions and configuration. Such components may be subject to accepted tolerances or
manufacturing variations that cause the components to vary slightly in some respect. For
example, the portions of metaphyseal sleeves 224, 224A, 224B that are designed to be the
same may nevertheless vary slightly due to manufacturing tolerances. Nevertheless, such
components are the same, match, or are identical because they are designed to have the
same configuration and dimensions. It should be understood that multiple sizes of femoral
components 210 would typically be included in the modular knee prosthesis system. It
should also be understood that a modular knee prosthesis system utilizing the principles of
the present disclosure may include fewer or more sizes of metaphyseal sleeves 224, 224A,
224B.

                                               23
[0100]          Similar to the sleeves 24, 24A, 24B, 24C, the sleeves 224, 224A., 224B are
designed for use with bones in which the condition of the bone requires additional support
or fixation in the metaphysis of the bone. As shown in FIG. 15, each of the sleeves 224,
224A, 224B has a distal base 262, 262A, 262B and a body 264, 264A, 264B extending
proximally from its respective distal base to a respective proximal end 266, 266A, 266B.
[0101]          As shown in FIG. 15, each of the sleeves 224, 224A, 224B has a proximal
bore 268, 268A, 268B defined in the proximal end 266, 266A, 266B thereof. The proximal
bores 268, 268A, 268B, of the femoral sleeves 224, 224A, 224B are sized and shaped to
receive a distal end 80 of a stem extension 22. Accordingly, for a stem extension having a
tapered post at its distal end, the proximal bore would comprise a tapered bore sized and
shaped to receive and frictionally lock with the tapered post. Alternatively, for a stem
extension having a threaded distal end, the proximal bore may be threaded to receive and
lock to the threaded distal end of the stem extension. As described above, each of the
sleeves 224, 224A, 224B has a distal bore 272, 272A, 272B, which is defined in the
respective distal base 262, 262A, 262B of each sleeve, as shown in FIGS. 16-18.
[0102]          Referring now to FIGS. 16-18, the bodies 264, 264A, 264B of the sleeves
224, 224A, 224B include a plurality of stepped walls 274, 274A, 274B. Each pair of
adjacent stepped walls 274, 274A, 274B is connected by an annular surface 276, 276A,
276B. As a result, the bodies 264, 264A, 264B are terraced similar to the sleeves 24, 24A,
24B, 24C. In the illustrative embodiment, the bodies 264, 264A, 264B are tapered such
that the sleeves 224, 224A, 224B have the smallest anterior-posterior dimensions and the
smallest medial-lateral dimensions at their respective proximal ends 266, 266A, 266B and
become progressively larger as the bodies 264, 264A, 264B extend to their respective
distal bases 262, 262A, 262B.
[0103]          It should be understood that the number and size of the stepped walls 274,
274A, 274B may vary from the number and size of steps in the illustrated embodiments.
The outer surfaces of the sleeves 262, 262A, 262B may also be porous coated to promote
bone ingrowth, as disclosed in the prior art; the porous coating may extend over
substantially all or a portion of the stepped outer surfaces of the sleeves 224, 224A, 224B.
It should be understood that these dimensions are provided as examples only; the

                                               24
disclosure is not limited to any particular dimensions unless expressly called for in the
claims.
[0104]           As shown in FIG. 16, the body 264 of the sleeve 224 has a longitudinal axis
280 and a tapered outer surface 282 that has an axial length "L" defined along the axis 280.
In the illustrative embodiments, the annular surfaces 276 are substantially flat. As a result,
the stepped walls 274 combine to define the axial length L of the body 264. In the
illustrative embodiment, the axial length L is equal to approximately 45 millimeters.
[0105]           As shown in FIG. 17, the body 264A of the sleeve 224A has a longitudinal
axis 280A and a tapered outer surface 282A. The tapered outer surface 282A has a
proximal section 284A that has an axial length "L" defined along the axis 280A and a
section 286A extending distally from the proximal section 284A to the distal base 262A.
The section 286A has an axial length "X" defined along the axis 280A. As a result, the
overall axial length of the body 264A is "L+X." In the illustrative embodiment, the axial
length "L+X" is equal to approximately 50 millimeters.
[0106]           As shown in FIG. 18, the body 264B of the sleeve 224B has a longitudinal
axis 280B and a tapered outer surface 282B. The tapered outer surface 282B has a
proximal section 284B that has an axial length "L" defined along the axis 280B and a
section 286B extending distally from the proximal section 284A. The section 286A has an
axial length "X" defined along the axis 280B. The tapered outer surface 282B has another
section 288B that extends distally from the section 286B to the distal base 262B. The
section 288B has an axial length "Y" defined along the axis 280B. As a result, the overall
axial length of the body 264A is "L+X+Y." In the illustrative embodiment, the axial length
"L+X+Y" is equal to approximately 55 millimeters.
[0107]           In the illustrative embodiment, the different sizes of femoral metaphyseal
sleeves may be provided with differences of a few millimeters (for example, 5 millimeters)
between each size, so that X=5mm, Y=5mm and Z=5mm. Additionally, the overall axial
length of the different sleeves may vary. For example, in one embodiment, the overall axial
lengths of the sleeves may be between 30 millimeters and 55 millimeters.

                                               25
[0108]           In the illustrated modular knee prosthesis system, the outer geometries of
the tapered outer surfaces 282, 282A, 282B of all sizes of femoral metaphyseal sleeve 224,
224A, 224B are essentially identical over axial length "L." Thus, if "L" of the sleeve 224 is
45 mm, the sizes and shapes of the proximal 45 mm of the other sleeve sizes 224A, 224B
(i.e., the proximal sections 284A, 284B) are essentially identical to the size and shape of
the proximal 45 mm of the sleeve 224. In other words, over axial length "L" for all of the
illustrated sizes of femoral metaphyseal sleeves 224, 224A, 224B, the sleeves have the
same number of stepped walls, as shown in FIGS. 16-18. Further, as shown in FIG. 19,
each stepped wall over axial length "L" also has the same maximum medial-lateral
dimension 290, the same maximum anterior-posterior dimension 292, and the same shape.
Each stepped wall over axial length "L" also has the same axial height, as shown in FIGS.
16-18.
[0109]           The different sizes of femoral metaphyseal sleeves 224, 224A, 224B differ
only in the sizes of the bases 262, 262A, 262B and in the distal portions corresponding
with the axial extensions of the sleeves beyond a given axial length. For example, the
tapered outer surfaces 282A, 282B of the femoral metaphyseal sleeve 224A, 224B are
essentially identical over axial length "X." Thus, if "X" of the sleeve 224A is 5 mm, the
size and shape of the section 286B of the sleeve 224B is essentially identical to the size
and shape of the section 286A of the sleeve 224A. In other words, over axial length "X"
for the illustrated sizes of femoral metaphyseal sleeves 224A, 224B, the sleeves have the
same number of stepped walls, as shown in FIGS. 17-18. Further, as shown in FIG. 20,
each stepped wall has the same maximum medial-lateral dimension 294, the same
maximum anterior-posterior dimension 296, and the same shape. Nevertheless, the femoral
metaphyseal sleeve 224B differs from the sleeve 224A in the size of the base 262B and in
the configuration of the distal section 288B.
[0110]           Referring now to FIGS. 21-25, a plurality of surgical instruments 300,
which may be used with the femoral components 200, is shown. In the illustrative
embodiment, the surgical instruments 300 are a plurality of sizes of surgical broaches 302,
302A, 302B. Each of the broaches 302, 302A, 302B is formed from a metallic material
such as, for example, stainless steel or cobalt chromium. As described in greater detail

                                                26
below, the outer geometries of the broaches 302, 302A, 302B are the same over a portion
of their axial lengths and correspond to the outer geometries of the metaphyseal sleeves
224, 224A, 224B. As described above, in other embodiments, the femoral components 200
may include fewer or more sizes of metaphyseal sleeves 224, 224A, 224B; it should be
appreciated that in such embodiments the surgical instruments 300 may include fewer or
more sizes of broaches 302, 302A, 302B.
[0111]           Each of the broaches 302, 302A, 302B includes a proximal tip 304, 304A,
304B and a body 306, 306A, 306B extending from the proximal tip 304, 304A, 304B to a
respective distal end 308, 308A, 308B. In the illustrative embodiment, the tip 304, 304A,
304B of each broach 302, 302A, 302B has an aperture 310, 3 10A, 3 10B defined therein
that is sized to receive a femoral stem trial. The distal end 308, 308A, 308B of each broach
302, 302A, 302B is configured to engage an attachment mechanism of an instrument
handle. An exemplary configuration of the distal end 308, 308A, 308B of each broach 302,
302A, 302B is shown and described in U.S. Patent App. Serial No. 13/834,862 entitled
"FEMORAL SYSTEM HANDLE SURGICAL INSTRUMENT AND METHOD OF
ASSEMBLING SAME" (Attorney Docket No. 265280-223293), which was filed
concurrently herewith and is expressly incorporated herein by reference.
[0112]           The bodies 306, 306A, 306B have a plurality of cutting teeth 312, 312A,
312B defined in the outer surface 322, 322A, 322B thereof. The cutting teeth 312, 312A,
312B are configured to engage the bone surrounding the medullary canal of the patient's
femur to define a cavity in the bone sized to receive a sleeve. The cutting teeth 312, 3 12A,
3 12B cooperate to define a plurality of stepped planes 314, 3 14A, 3 14B of their respective
outer surfaces 322, 322A, 322B. As a result, the bodies 264, 264A, 264B are terraced. In
the illustrative embodiment, the bodies 306, 306A., 306B are tapered such that the broaches
302, 302A, 302B have the smallest anterior-posterior dimensions and the smallest medial
lateral dimensions at their respective proximal tips 304, 304A, 304B and become
progressively larger as the bodies 306, 306A, 306B extend to their respective distal ends
308, 308A, 308B. In the illustrative embodiment, the number of stepped planes 314, 314A,
314B of the broaches 302, 302A, 302B corresponds to the number of the stepped walls
274, 274A, 274B of the sleeves 224, 224A, 224B, respectively.

                                                 27
[0113]           As shown in FIG. 21, the body 306 of the broach 302 has a longitudinal axis
320 and a tapered outer surface 322 defined by the tips 324 of the cutting teeth 312. The
tapered outer surface 322 has an axial length "L" defined along the axis 320. In that way,
the body 306 has the same axial height as the body 264 of the sleeve 224. Additionally, the
stepped planes 314 of the body 306 combine to define the axial length L of the body 306.
In the illustrative embodiment, the number of stepped planes 314 is equal to the number of
stepped walls 274 of the sleeve 224; as such, each stepped plane 314 corresponds to a
stepped wall 274 of the sleeve 224.
[0114]           The tapered outer surface 322 of the broach 302 has a proximal section 326
extending from the proximal tip 304 and a section 328 extending from the proximal section
326 to the distal end 308. The distal section 328 has an axial length that is approximately
50% of the axial length L.
[0115]           In the proximal section 326 of the tapered outer surface 322, the outer
geometry of the broach 302 defined by the stepped planes 314 is the same as the
corresponding outer geometry of the sleeve 224 defined by the stepped walls 274. In other
words, the number of stepped planes 314 is equal to the number of stepped walls 274, and
each stepped plane 314 has the same maximum medial-lateral dimension, the same
maximum anterior-posterior dimension, and the same axial height as the corresponding
stepped wall 274. For example, as shown in FIG. 24, the stepped planes 314 in the
proximal section 326 define the same maximum medial-lateral dimension 290 and the
same maximum anterior-posterior dimension 292 as the corresponding stepped wall 274 of
the sleeve 224. As a result, the broach 302 is configured to define a cavity in the patient's
femur that includes a proximal section that is substantially the same as the sleeve 224 such
that the sleeve 224 is fitted into that section.
[0116]           In the distal section 328 of the tapered outer surface 322 the number of
stepped planes 314 is equal to the number of stepped walls 274, and each stepped plane
314 has the same axial height as the corresponding stepped wall 274. However, the
maximum medial-lateral dimension and the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each
stepped plane 314 are smaller than the maximum medial-lateral dimension and the
maximum anterior-posterior dimension of the corresponding stepped wall 274. In other

                                                28
words, the outer geometry of the broach 302 defined by the stepped planes 314 is smaller
than the corresponding outer geometry of the sleeve 224 defined by the stepped walls 274.
As a result, the broach 302 is configured to define a cavity in the patient's femur that
includes a distal section that is smaller than the sleeve 224 such that the sleeve 224 is press
fit into that section.
[0117]           In the illustrative embodiment, the maximum medial-lateral dimension of
each stepped plane 314 in the distal section 328 is 0.35 mm less than the maximum medial
lateral dimension of the corresponding stepped wall 274 of the sleeve 224. Similarly, the
maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each stepped plane 314 in the distal section 328
is 0.35 mm less than the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of the corresponding
stepped wall 274 of the sleeve 224. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the
dimensions of the broach 302 may be adjusted to provide greater or less press fit for the
sleeve 224.
[0118]           Furthermore, since the geometries of the outer surfaces 282, 282A, 282B of
the femoral metaphyseal sleeves 224, 224A, 224B are essentially identical through axial
length "L," the sleeves 224A, 224B will fit within a cavity prepared by the broach 302 in a
patient's femur and extend distally from the bone by the distance "X" or "X+Y." As such,
if the sleeve 224A is inserted into a cavity prepared by the broach 302, the portion of the
sleeve 224 corresponding to the distal section 328 of the broach 302 will be press fit, while
the portion corresponding to the proximal section 326 of the broach 302 will be fitted into
that portion of the cavity.
[0119]           As shown in FIG. 22, the body 306A of the broach 302A has a longitudinal
axis 320A and a tapered outer surface 322A defined by the tips 324A of the cutting teeth
312A. The tapered outer surface 322A has an axial length "L+X" defined along the axis
320A. In that way, the body 306A has the same axial height as the sleeve 224A.
Additionally, the stepped planes 314A of the body 306A combine to define the axial length
"L+X" of the body 306A. In the illustrative embodiment, the number of stepped planes
314A is equal to the number of stepped walls 274A of the sleeve 224A; as such, each
stepped plane 314A corresponds to a stepped wall 274A of the sleeve 224A.

                                               29
[0120]          The tapered outer surface 322A of the broach 302A has a proximal section
326A extending from the proximal tip 304A and a section 328A extending from the
proximal section 326A to the distal end 308A. The distal section 328A has an axial length
that is approximately 50% of the axial length "L+X."
[0121]          In the proximal section 326A of the tapered outer surface 322A, the outer
geometry of the broach 302A defined by the stepped planes 314A is the same as the
corresponding outer geometry of the sleeve 224A defined by the stepped walls 274A. In
other words, the number of stepped planes 314A is equal to the number of stepped walls
274A, and each stepped plane 314A has the same maximum medial-lateral dimension, the
same maximum anterior-posterior dimension, and the same axial height as the
corresponding stepped wall 274A. For example, as shown in FIG. 24, the stepped planes
314A in the proximal section 326A define the same maximum medial-lateral dimension
290 and the same maximum anterior-posterior dimension 292 as the corresponding stepped
wall 274A of the sleeve 224A. As a result, the broach 302A is configured to define a cavity
in the patient's femur that includes a proximal section that is substantially the same as the
sleeve 224A such that the sleeve 224A is fitted into that section.
[0122]          In the distal section 328A of the tapered outer surface 322A the number of
stepped planes 314A is equal to the number of stepped walls 274A, and each stepped plane
314A has the same axial height as the corresponding stepped wall 274A. However, the
maximum medial-lateral dimension and the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each
stepped plane 314A are smaller than the maximum medial-lateral dimension and the
maximum anterior-posterior dimension of the corresponding stepped wall 274A. In other
words, the outer geometry of the broach 302A defined by the stepped planes 314A is
smaller than the corresponding outer geometry of the sleeve 224A defined by the stepped
walls 274A.
[0123]          For example, as shown in FIG. 25, a stepped plane 314A in the distal
section 328A defines a maximum medial-lateral dimension 330 that is less than the
maximum medial-lateral dimension 294 of the corresponding stepped wall 274A.
Similarly, the same stepped plane 314A in the distal section 328A defines a maximum
anterior-posterior dimension 332 that is less than the maximum anterior-posterior

                                                30
dimension 296 of the corresponding stepped wall 274A. As a result, the broach 302A is
configured to define a cavity in the patient's femur that includes a distal section that is
smaller than the sleeve 224A such that the sleeve 224A is press fit into that section.
[0124]           In the illustrative embodiment, the maximum medial-lateral dimension of
each stepped plane 314A in the distal section 328A is 0.35 mum less than the maximum
medial-lateral dimension of the corresponding stepped wall 274A of the sleeve 224A.
Similarly, the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each stepped plane 314A in the
distal section 328A is 0.35 mm less than the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of the
corresponding stepped wall 274A of the sleeve 224A. It should be appreciated that in other
embodiments the dimensions of the broach 302A may be adjusted to provide greater or less
press fit for the sleeve 224A. It should also be appreciated that the medial-lateral press fit
and the anterior-posterior press fit may or may not be equal.
[0125]           Furthermore, since the geometries of the outer surfaces 282A, 282B of the
femoral metaphyseal sleeves 224A, 224B are essentially identical through axial length
"L+X," the sleeve 224B will fit within a cavity prepared by the broach 302A in a patient's
femur and extend distally from the bone by the distance "X+Y." As such, if the sleeve
224B is inserted into a cavity prepared by the broach 302A, the portion of the sleeve 224B
corresponding to the distal section 328A of the broach 302A will be press fit, while the
portion of the sleeve 224B corresponding to the proximal section 326A of the broach 302A
will be fitted into that portion of the cavity.
[0126]           As shown in FIG. 23, the body 306B of the broach 302B has a longitudinal
axis 320B and a tapered outer surface 322B defined by the tips 324B of the cutting teeth
312B. The tapered outer surface 322B has an axial length "L+X+Y" defined along the axis
320B. In that way, the body 306B has the same axial height as the sleeve 224B.
Additionally, the stepped planes 314B of the body 306B combine to define the axial length
"L+X+Y" of the body 306B. In the illustrative embodiment, the number of stepped planes
314B is equal to the number of stepped walls 274B of the sleeve 224B; as such, each
stepped plane 314B corresponds to a stepped wall 274B of the sleeve 224B.

                                               31
[0127]          The tapered outer surface 322B of the broach 302B has a proximal section
326B extending from the proximal tip 304B and a section 328B extending from the
proximal section 326B to the distal end 308B. The distal section 328B has an axial length
that is approximately 50% of the axial length "L+X+Y."
[0128]          In the proximal section 326B of the tapered outer surface 322B, the outer
geometry of the broach 302B defined by the stepped planes 314B is the same as the
corresponding outer geometry of the sleeve 224B defined by the stepped walls 274B. In
other words, the number of stepped planes 314B is equal to the number of stepped walls
274B, and each stepped plane 314B has the same maximum medial-lateral dimension, the
same maximum anterior-posterior dimension, and the same axial height as the
corresponding stepped wall 274B. As a result, the broach 302B is configured to define a
cavity in the patient's femur that includes a proximal section that is substantially the same
as the sleeve 224B such that the sleeve 224B is fitted into that section.
[0129]          In the distal section 328B of the tapered outer surface 322B the number of
stepped planes 314B is equal to the number of stepped walls 274B, and each stepped plane
314B has the same axial height as the corresponding stepped wall 274B. However, the
maximum medial-lateral dimension and the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each
stepped plane 314B are smaller than the maximum medial-lateral dimension and the
maximum anterior-posterior dimension of the corresponding stepped wall 274B. In other
words, the outer geometry of the broach 302B defined by the stepped planes 314B is
smaller than the corresponding outer geometry of the sleeve 224B defined by the stepped
walls 274B. As a result, the broach 302B is configured to define a cavity in the patient's
femur that includes a distal section that is smaller than the sleeve 224B such that the sleeve
224B is press fit into that section.
[0130]          In the illustrative embodiment, the maximum medial-lateral dimension of
each stepped plane 314B in the distal section 328B is 0.35 mm less than the maximum
medial-lateral dimension of the corresponding stepped wall 274B of the sleeve 224B.
Similarly, the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of each stepped plane 314B in the
distal section 328B is 0.35 mm less than the maximum anterior-posterior dimension of the
corresponding stepped wall 274B of the sleeve 224B. It should be appreciated that in other

                                               32
embodiments the dimensions of the broach 302B may be adjusted to provide greater or less
press fit for the sleeve 224B.
[0131]           Referring now to FIGS. 26-35, a plurality of augments 340 of the femoral
components 200 are shown. The augments 340 include a plurality of distal augments 342,
344 (see FIGS. 26-29) and a plurality of posterior augments 346, 348. As described above,
each of the augments 340 includes a mounting plug 256 that is configured to be received in
the mounting aperture 250. Each augment 340 also includes a retention mechanism 350
configured secure the corresponding augment 340 to the femoral component 210, as
described in greater detail below. In the illustrative embodiment, the augments 340 are
formed from any suitable implant-grade metallic material such as, for example, cobalt
chromium, titanium, or stainless steel.
[0132]           As shown in FIGS. 26-27, the distal augment 342 includes a wedge-shaped
body 358 that has a proximal surface 360, a distal surface 362 positioned opposite the
proximal surface 360, and a side wall 364 that connects the surfaces 360, 362. The side
wall 364 includes a tapered anterior surface 366 and a tapered posterior surface 368, which
extend obliquely relative the surfaces 360, 362. When the distal augment 342 is secured to
the femoral component 210, the tapered anterior surface 366 is configured to engage the
anterior chamfer surface 236 of the femoral component 210, and the tapered posterior
surface 368 is configured to engage the posterior chamfer surface 234 of the femoral
component 210.
[0133]           As shown in FIG. 26, the proximal surface 360 of the distal augment 342
has a rim surface 370 and a side wall 372 that extends inwardly from the rim surface 370.
The side wall 372 cooperates with a bottom surface 374 to define a pocket 376 in the
proximal surface 360. The upper end 378 of the mounting plug 256 is positioned an
opening 380 defined in the bottom surface 374, and the body 382 of the plug 256 extends
through the augment body 358 to an end 384 positioned below the body 358, as shown in
FIG. 27. The end 384 of the body 382 is divided into four legs 386.
[0134]           The retention mechanism 350 of the augment 340 includes a fastener 388
that is threaded into the body 382 of the mounting plug 256. The fastener 288 includes a

                                                 33
socket in which a driver may be inserted to rotate the fastener 288. When the fastener 388
is rotated in a first direction, the fastener 388 is driven toward the end 384 of the body 382,
causing the legs 386 to expand outward; when the fastener is rotated in the opposite
direction, the fastener 388 moves away from the end 384 of the body 382 such that the legs
386 are permitted to retract.
[0135]           The distal surface 362 of the wedge-shaped body 358 is configured to
engage the distal surface 230 of the femoral component 210. In the illustrative
embodiment, a plurality of feet 390 extend from the distal surface 362 of the wedge-shaped
body 358. Each foot 390 is sized to be positioned in the cement pocket 240 of the femoral
component 210. As shown in FIG. 27, the wedge-shaped body 358 also has a thickness 392
defined between the distal surface 362 and the proximal surface 360.
[0136]           As shown in FIGS. 28-29, the distal augment 344 includes a wedge-shaped
body 400 that has a proximal surface 402, a distal surface 404 positioned opposite the
proximal surface 402, and a side wall 406 that connects the surfaces 402, 404. The side
wall 406 includes a tapered anterior surface 408 and a tapered posterior surface 410, which
extend obliquely relative the surfaces 408, 410. When the distal augment 344 is secured to
the femoral component 210, the tapered anterior surface 408 is configured to engage the
anterior chamfer surface 236 of the femoral component 210, and the tapered posterior
surface 410 is configured to engage the posterior chamfer surface 234 of the femoral
component 210.
[0137]           The side wall 406 has a posterior notch 412 defined therein. As shown in
FIGS. 28-29, the notch 412 is defined by a substantially planar proximal surface 414
extending parallel to the proximal surface 402 and anteriorly from an edge of the tapered
posterior surface 410 and a substantially planar posterior surface 416 extending orthogonal
to the proximal surface 414. The notch 412 is sized to receive the posterior augment 348,
as described in greater detail below.
[0138]           As shown in FIG. 28, the proximal surface 402 of the distal augment 344
has a configuration similar to the proximal surface 360 of the distal augment 342. The
surface 402 has a rim surface 420 and a side wall 422 that extends inwardly from the rim

                                                 34
surface 420. The side wall 422 cooperates with a bottom surface 424 to define a pocket
426 in the proximal surface 402. The upper end 428 of the mounting plug 256 is positioned
an opening 430 defined in the bottom surface 424, and the body 432 of the plug 256
extends through the augment body 358 to an end 384 positioned below the body 358, as
shown in FIG. 29. The end 384 of the body 432 is divided into four legs 386.
[0139]           The retention mechanism 350 of the augment 340 includes a fastener 438
that is threaded into the body 432 of the mounting plug 256. The fastener 438 includes a
socket in which a driver may be inserted to rotate the fastener 438. When the fastener 438
is rotated in a first direction, the fastener 438 is driven toward the end 384 of the body 432,
causing the legs 386 to expand outward; when the fastener is rotated in the opposite
direction, the fastener 438 moves away from the end 384 of the body 432 such that the legs
386 are permitted to retract.
[0140]           The distal surface 404 of the wedge-shaped body 400 is configured to
engage the distal surface 230 of the femoral component 210. In the illustrative
embodiment, a plurality of feet 440 extend from the distal surface 404 of the wedge-shaped
body 400. Each foot 440 is sized to be positioned in the cement pocket 240 of the femoral
component 210. As shown in FIG. 29, the wedge-shaped body 358 also has a thickness 442
defined between the distal surface 404 and the proximal surface 402.
[0141]           As shown in FIGS. 27 and 29, the thickness 442 of the augment 344 is
greater than the thickness 392 of the augment 342. In the illustrative embodiment, the
thickness 392 is equal to approximately 4 millimeters, and the thickness 442 is equal to
approximately 12 millimeters. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the
thicknesses of the augments may increase or decrease depending with the size of the other
femoral components 200. Additionally, as shown in FIGS. 27 and 29, the distal surface 404
of the augment 344 is wider than distal surface 362 of the augment 342.
[0142]           As described above, the femoral components 200 also include posterior
augments 346, 348. Each of the posterior augments 346, 348 includes a body 450 having
an anterior surface 452 and a posterior surface 454 positioned opposite the anterior surface
452. As shown in FIGS. 30 and 32, each of the posterior augments 346, 348 includes the

                                               35
mounting plug 256, which has a configuration similar to the configurations described
above in regard to the distal augments 342, 344.
[0143]           The posterior surface 454 of the body 450 is configured to engage the
posterior fixation surface 232 of the femoral component 210. In the illustrative
embodiment, a plurality of feet 456 extend from the posterior surface 454. Each foot 456 is
sized to be positioned in the cement pocket 240 of the femoral component 210. As shown
in FIG. 30, the posterior augment 346 has a thickness 460 defined between the anterior
surface 452 and the posterior surface 454; as shown in FIG. 32, the posterior augment 348
has a thickness 462 defined between the anterior surface 452 and the posterior surface 454.
In the illustrative embodiment, the thickness 462 of the augment 348 is greater than the
thickness 460 of the augment 346.
[0144]           In use, the augments 340 may be attached to the femoral component 210 in
the same sequence, regardless of the combination of augments 340 used. For example, as
shown in FIGS. 30-3 1, the posterior augment 346 may be attached first to the posterior
fixation surface 232 of the femoral component 210 via the mounting plug 256, which is
inserted into the aperture 260. Using the fastener (not shown) of the mounting plug 256,
the legs 386 of the mounting plug 256 are expanded into engagement with the wall 252
defining the aperture 250, thereby securing the augment 346 to the posterior fixation
surface 232.
[0145]           The distal augment 342 may then be attached to the distal fixation surface
230. As shown in FIG. 31, the mounting plug 256 is aligned with the aperture 250 of the
distal fixation surface 230. The distal augment 342 may be advanced downward such that
the plug 256 is received in the aperture 250. The fastener 388 may then be operated to
engage the wall 252 with the legs 386 of the mounting plug 256, thereby securing the
augment 342 to the distal fixation surface 230.
[0146]           As shown in FIGS. 32-35, another combination of augments 340 - in this
case, the largest augments 344, 348 - may attached in the same sequence as the augments
342, 346. To do so, the posterior augment 348 may be attached first to the posterior
fixation surface 232 of the femoral component 210 via the mounting plug 256, which is

                                                36
inserted into the aperture 260. Using the fastener (not shown) of the mounting plug 256,
the legs 386 of the mounting plug 256 are expanded into engagement with the wall 252
defining the aperture 250, thereby securing the augment 348 to the posterior fixation
surface 232.
[0147]          The distal augment 344 may then be attached to the distal fixation surface
230. To do so, the distal augment 344 is positioned above the distal fixation surface 230 as
shown in FIG. 33. The augment 344 may then be rotated as shown in FIG. 34 and
advanced downward.
[0148]          As shown in FIG. 34, the user may slide posterior edge of the distal
augment 344 under the posterior augment 348 to "hook" the distal augment 344 into
position. In doing so, the posterior augment 348 is advanced into the posterior notch 412 of
the distal augment 344. When the plug 256 of the distal augment 344 is received in the
aperture 250 and the augment 344 is properly seated as shown in FIG. 35, the posterior
augment 348 remains in the posterior notch 412. The fastener 388 may then be operated to
engage the wall 252 with the legs 386 of the mounting plug 256, thereby securing the
augment 348 to the distal fixation surface 230.
[0149]          As shown in FIGS. 36-37, the femoral components 200 may be assembled
to form a femoral orthopaedic prosthesis. In FIG. 36, the smallest femoral sleeve 224 and
the smallest augments 342, 346 are assembled with the femoral component 210 to form
prosthesis 470. In FIG. 37, the largest femoral sleeve 224B and the largest augments 344,
348 are assembled with the femoral component 210 to form prosthesis 472. As shown in
FIGS. 36-37, the distal-most points 474 of the condyle surfaces 12, 14 define a joint line of
the femoral orthopaedic prosthesis when the patient's leg is extension. In FIG. 36, the joint
line is indicated by line 476; in FIG. 37, the joint line is indicated by line 478.
[0150]          The illustrated assemblies have maximum axial lengths from planes at the
proximal ends 266, 266B (the planes shown at 480 and 482) to the plane of the joint line,
shown at 476 in FIG. 36 and at 478 in FIG. 37. These maximum axial lengths of the
assemblies are shown at AL1 in FIG. 36 and AL2 in FIG. 37. In the illustrative

                                                   37
embodiment, AL2 is longer than AL1 by the dimension "X+Y", that is the axial length of
the sleeve 224B beyond the length "L" of the smallest sleeve 224.
[0151]           As can also be seen from a comparison of FIGS. 36-37, using the larger
sleeve 224B distalizes the joint line 476 to the position 478 by the offset distance 01. This
offset distance 01 also corresponds with the dimension "X+Y". Similarly, using the sleeve
224A distalizes the joint line by the dimension "X" relative to the joint line 476.
[0152]           Since the geometries of the stepped bodies 264, 264B, 264C of the different
sizes of sleeves 224, 224A, 224B are the same through axial length "L", the surgeon can
prepare the distal femur using the broach 302 to receive the smallest size of femoral sleeve
224. If the surgeon determines intraoperatively that the joint line should be distalized, the
surgeon may use any of the other sizes of sleeve 224A, 224B, and the proximal portion of
the larger size sleeve will fit within the opening prepared in the femur to receive the
smaller sleeve and extend distally from the bone by the distance "X" or "X+Y" o thereby
distally offset the joint line. In the illustrative embodiment, the thickness 442 of the distal
augment 344 is equal to the offset distance oI such that the sleeve 224B the prosthesis 472
may be stabilized when the joint line is distalized. The surgeon can therefore accomplish
this distalization without any further preparation of the bone cavity.
[0153]           Another system providing the option of distalizing the joint line is disclosed
in the application for United States Patent filed concurrently herewith entitled "Knee
Prosthesis System with Standard and Distally Offset Joint Line," (docket no.
