TECHNICAL FIELD
[00031 The present disclosure relates to optical surgery, and more specifically to
surgical replacement of a patient's lens.
BACKGROUND
[0004] The human eye, in simple terms, functions to provide vision by transmitting
and refracting light through a clear outer portion called the cornea and focusing the
image by way of the lens onto the retina at the back of the eye. The quality of the
focused image depends on many factors including the size, shape, and length of the
eye, and the shape and transparency of the cornea and lens.
[00051 When trauma, age, or disease causes the lens to become less transparent,
vision deteriorates because of a reduction in light transmitted to the retina.     This
deficiency in the eye's lens is medically known as a cataract. The treatment for this
condition is often surgical removal of the lens and implantation of an artificial lens,
typically known as an intraocular lens (IOL).
[00061 An IOL is often foldable and inserted into the eye through a relatively small
incision by being advanced through an IOL insertion cartridge, which causes the IOL
to fold. The IOL is typically advanced through the insertion cartridge by a plunger
like device.
[00071 Before inserting an IOL, the old lens is usually removed through a process
called phacoemulsification. In phacoemulsification, an eye's lens is emulsified with
an ultrasonic handpiece and aspirated from the eye. Aspirated fluids are replaced with
an irrigation of balanced salt solution, thus maintaining the anterior chamber, as well
                                             I

as cooling the handpiece. The irrigation fluid and the aspiration suction are usually
supplied by a remote surgical console, which is coupled to the handpiece through
several feet of tubing.
[0008] Typically, a second stage is required to completely remove the lens, as the first
stage only extracts the main portions. Thus, after phacoemulsification, an irrigation
aspiration probe is used to aspirate out the remaining peripheral cortical matter, while
leaving the posterior capsule intact.
[0009] A reference herein to a patent document or any other matter identified as prior
art, is not to be taken as an admission that the document or other matter was known or
that the information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the
priority date of any of the claims.
SUMMARY
[0010] A variety of systems, processes, and techniques for ocular surgery are
disclosed.
[0011] The present invention provides a pumping portion adapted to be coupled to a
drive portion of a pump unit, the pumping portion comprising: an outer shell defining
an interior channel; an elastomeric pump segment disposed within the outer shell, the
elastomeric pump segment defining a cavity and comprising integrated conduits in
fluid communication with the interior channel; a cap disposed at a distal end of the
cavity, the cap comprising a recess adapted to receive a distal end of a rotor of the
drive portion of the pump unit; and a fluid port adapted to expel fluid drawn into the
integrated conduits through the interior channel.
[0012] In certain implementations, a modular hand-held system for ocular surgery
may include a hand-held phacoemulsification unit and a hand-held pump unit. The
pump unit may be adapted to provide suction for aspirating fluid and tissue through
the phacoemulsification unit and include an adapter configured to detachably couple
the phacoemulsification unit to the pump unit to form an integrated hand-held system.
[0013] In particular implementations, the phacoemulsification unit may be also
adapted to receive suction from a surgical console for aspirating material from an eye.
[0014] In some certain implementations, the adapter may be also configured to
detachably couple the pump unit to a hand-held irrigation-aspiration unit to form a
                                             2

second integrated hand-held system.      The pump unit may also provide suction for
aspirating material through the irrigation-aspiration unit.
[0015] The phacoemulsification unit may, for example, include a male luer fitting,
and the adapter may include a female luer fitting. The luer fittings may, for example,
be engaged by a friction fit.
[0016] In some implementations,         a process for ocular surgery may include
emulsifying a lens in an eye using a modular hand-held system including a
phacoemulsification unit detachably coupled to a pump unit and removing lens
portions from the eye using suction provided by the pump unit. The process may also
include decoupling the phacoemulsification unit from the pump unit, coupling an
irrigation-aspiration unit to the pump unit to form a second hand-held system, and
removing material from the eye using suction provided by the pump unit.
[00171 Certain implementations may include polishing a posterior capsule of the eye
using the second system.
[0018] Various implementations may have one or more features. For example, by
using a hand-held system with a local pump unit to remove a diseased lens from an
eye, chamber stability may be improved during phacoemulsification. Additionally,
since the phacoemulsification unit may be detachable from the pump unit, another
unit may be coupled to the pump unit. For example, an irrigation-aspiration unit or a
vitrectomy unit may be coupled to the pump unit. This may provide the ability to use
the pump unit for a variety of operations during a procedure, and obtain its advantages
in each.
[0019] A variety of other features will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the
following description and claims, as well as the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0026] FIG. 1 illustrates an example system 100 for ocular surgery. System 100
includes a phacoemulsification unit 110 and a pump unit 140 that are detachably
coupled together. In general, phacoemulsification unit 110 is adapted to break up an
eye's lens into pieces and aspirate the pieces with the suction provided by pump unit
140.
[0027] Phacoemulsification unit 110 includes a body portion 120 and a distal tip
assembly 130. Body portion 120 includes a housing 121 that is substantially rigid and
may be made of hard plastic, metal, or any other appropriate material. Body portion
120 may be any length. In some implementations, the body portion 120 may have a
length between about four to six inches. In other instances, body portion 120 may
have a length greater than six inches or smaller than four inches. Body portion 120
also includes an infusion port 122 for receiving infusion fluids (e.g., a water/saline
solution) for delivery to an eye during a lens separation and removal process. In some
instances, the fluid may, for example, come from a surgical console. Infusion port
122 communicates with a channel 124 inside of housing 121.
[0028] Body portion 120 also includes resonators 125. Resonators 125 are adapted to
generate high-frequency vibrations (e.g., ultrasonic) in response to applied electrical
power, which may be received through an electrical conduit 126.           In particular
implementations, resonators 125 may be piezoelectric transducers.
[0029] Internal to housing 121, body portion 120 includes a horn 127 that is vibrated
by resonators 125.    Horn 127 may, for example, be composed of metal. Horn 127
includes a channel 128 through which eye fluid and tissue may be aspirated. Horn
127 also includes a male luer fitting 129. In particular implementations, male luer
fitting 129 is composed of a polymer, which may facilitate resisting separation due to
the vibrations of the system during use.
                                             4

[0030] Distal tip assembly 130 includes a sleeve 131 that is flexible. Sleeve 131 may,
for example, be made of an elastomeric material (e.g., silicone). Sleeve 131 forms a
channel 132. The channel 132 also communicates with channel 124. Irrigation fluid
flows through channel 124 and into channel 132. The fluid may flow through channel
132 until it exits distal tip assembly 130, as indicated by arrows 133.
[0031] Distal tip assembly 130 also includes a surgical tip 134. The surgical tip 130
extends through the sleeve 131.       Tip 134 is engaged with horn 127 of body portion
120 and receives vibrations from resonators 125 therethrough. Surgical tip 134 may,
for example, be made of metal (e.g., stainless steel or titanium).        Surgical tip 134
includes a distal section 135 that may be placed against a lens to emulsify it.
Particularly, surgical tip 134, when vibrated, is operable to break up and emulsify a
natural eye lens. Distal section 135 includes a port 139 into which material from the
eye may enter.     These materials may include fluid in the eye (e.g., aqueous humor
and/or fluid irrigating the eye), lens particles, tissues, and any other material for which
removal from the eye is desirable. These materials may be aspirated from the eye, as
indicated by arrow 136. The port 139 communicates with a channel 137 that extends
through the surgical tip 134. The fluid may be conveyed through channel 137 of the
surgical tip 134 and through channel 128 of the horn 127.
[0032] In the illustrated implementation, distal tip assembly 130 is adapted to
slideably engage body portion 120. For example, a proximal end 152 of surgical tip
134 may be received into a port 154 formed in a distal end 156 of the horn 127. Also,
in some instances, a proximal end 158 of sleeve 131 may be received onto a distal end
160 of the housing 121.          Further, the proximal end 158 of sleeve 131 may be
expandingly flexible at end 138 to receive the distal end 160 of the housing 121.
[00331 Pump unit 140 includes a body 142. In some instances, the body 142 may be
made of metal, hard plastic, or any other appropriate material. Body 142 may be any
length. In some instances, body 142 may have a length about four to six inches. In
other instances, body 142 may have a length greater than six inches or smaller than
four inches. Body 142 houses, among other things, a motor 144. In some instances,
motor 144 may be an electric motor. In other implementations, motor 144 may be
other types of motors.       For example, in some instances, the motor 144 may be a
pneumatic, hydraulic, or any other type of motor operable to operate pump unit 140.
                                              5

[0034] In the present example, an electric motor is described. However, the scope of
the disclosure is not so limited, and the description of an electrical motor is provided
as an example for illustration purposes only. Motor 144 is operable to produce a
rotational drive motion in response to supplied electrical power, which is received
through electrical conduit 148. In particular implementations, electric motor 144 may
be a direct current (DC) motor.          Electric motor 144 may, for example, operate
between 0 to 6,000 RPM.
[0035] Pump unit 140 also includes a pump 146 that is driven by motor 144.            As
illustrated, pump 146 is a scroll-type peristaltic pump.        In other implementations,
pump 146 may be another type of peristaltic pump or any other appropriate type of
pump. For example, in some instances, the pump 146 may be a venturi-type pump.
Pump 146 draws fluid in through a channel 149, which communicates with channel
128 of phacoemulsification unit 110. Pump unit 140 also includes an aspiration port
150 through which aspirated fluid may be discharged. 'The aspirated materials (e.g.,
fluid and tissue, such as aqueous humor, irrigation fluid, cortical material, epithelial
cells, etc.) may be conveyed to a container (e.g., a bag or tank).
[00361 Pump unit 140 may also include an adapter 152.            The adapter 152 may be
coupled to a distal end 160 of the pump unit 140. Adapter 152 may include a female
luer fitting 154 that is adapted to receive male luer fitting 129 of phacoemulsification
unit 110.     In some instances, the two luer fittings 129, 154 mate with each with a
friction fit.    Female luer fitting 154 may, for example, be made of metal (e.g.,
stainless steel or titanium), plastic, or any other appropriate material.
[0037] In operation, one or more incisions are made in the eye to allow the
introduction of surgical instruments.         A user (e.g., physician or other medical
professional) then removes the anterior face of the capsule that contains the lens
inside the eye.
[0038] Surgical tip 135 of distal tip assembly 130 may then be inserted into the eye
through one of the incisions, until tip 135 is in contact with the lens. Resonators 125
may then be activated at a relatively high frequency (e.g., ultrasonic), causing tip 135
to vibrate, to sculpt and emulsify the lens while pump unit 140 aspirates particles
through the channel 137 formed in surgical tip 135. Generally, the lens is fragmented
into two or four pieces, and each piece is emulsified and aspirated out with suction
                                               6

through channel 137, channel 128, channel 149, and aspiration port 150.                 After
removing    all hard portions      of a lens,       e.g.,    a central   lens  nucleus,  with
phacoemulsification, the softer lens portion, e.g., outer lens cortex, may be removed
with suction only (e.g., with an irrigation-aspiration unit).
[0039] System 100 has a variety of features. For example, system 100 may be used to
remove a diseased lens from an eye. Moreover, locating pump unit 140 nearer to the
phacoemulsification unit 110 may improve chamber stability for phacoemulsification.
Maintaining a steady intraocular pressure in the eye is important because pressure
fluctuations can result in, among other things, posterior capsule rupture, endothelial
cell loss, and inflammation. Improved anterior chamber stability should produce
improved clinical outcomes. Additionally, since phacoemulsification unit 110 is
detachable from pump unit 140, another unit may be coupled to pump unit 140. For
example, an irrigation-aspiration probe or a vitrectomy probe may be coupled to the
pump unit. Thus, system 100 provides the ability to use pump unit 140 for a variety
of operations during a procedure.
[0040] Although FIG. 1 illustrates one example system for ocular surgery, other
systems for ocular surgery may include fewer, additional, and/or a different
arrangement of components. For example, a different phacoemulsification unit may
be used with pump          unit 140.    Thus, pump          unit is adaptable    to different
phacoemulsification      units.   For     instance,       in    some    implementations,    a
phacoemulsification unit may include a second fine metal instrument called a
"chopper" that is used from a side port to help with chopping the nucleus into smaller
pieces.   As   another    example,    a   different    pump      unit  may    be  used   with
phacoemulsification unit 110. For example, a different pump unit having an adapter
operable to interface with the male luer fitting 129 of the phacoemulsification unit
110 may be used.
[0041] As another example, phacoemulsification unit 110 may also be used with a
standard surgical console. Because phacoemulsification unit 110 includes male luer
fitting 129, it may readily couple to surgical conduits (e.g., hoses or tubes) to a
surgical console. That is, in some instances, phacoemulsification unit 110, decoupled
from the pump unit 140, may be coupled to a surgical console via one or more
surgical conduits.
                                              7

[0042] Although female luer fitting 154 and male luer fitting 129 are shown to be
mated by a friction fit, other matings between the luer fittings are possible.       For
example, male luer fitting 129 may have threads on the outside that have
corresponding threads on adapter 152. Thus, a threading engagement may mate pump
unit 140 with phacoemulsification unit 110. In some instances, the pump unit 140 and
phacoemulsification unit 110 may be coupled with both a friction fit and a threaded
engagement.     In particular implementations, pump unit 140 may be mated with
phacoemulsification unit 110 through a threading engagement without a luer fitting.
Various other couplings adapted to maintain phacoemulsification unit 110 and pump
unit 140 in an integrated hand-held configuration during a procedure while still
allowing decoupling are possible. Example couplings include a luer lock, a rotating
thread cuff, and a barbed fitting into an elastomer.
[0043] FIG. 2 illustrates an example irrigation-aspiration ("I/A") unit 200. I/A unit
200 may, for example, be used with a pump unit similar to pump unit 140.
[0044] The example I/A unit 200 includes a housing 210 defining a channel 214, an
insert 211 received within the channel 214, a male luer fitting 219 received in a recess
221 formed at a proximal end 230 of the housing 210, and a sleeve 220 coupled to a
distal end 242 of the housing 210.      The housing 210 may be formed from a rigid
material. For example, the housing 210 may be formed from a rigid plastic, metal or
other suitable material.   The housing 210 also includes an infusion port 212 that
defines a channel 244.
[0045] In some implementations, male luer fitting 219 is composed of a polymer. In
other implementations, male luer fitting 219 may be composed of a metal or any other
appropriate material.
[0046] The insert 211 defines a channel 217 extending therethrough. The male luer
fitting 219 defines a channel 236. The I/A unit 200 also includes a cannula 224
extending from a distal end 232 of the insert 211. A proximal end 234 of the cannula
224 is received in the channel 217 at the distal end 232. The cannula 224 defines a
channel 225 extending therethrough. The channels 217, 225 and 236 communicate
with each other to define an aspiration passage 238.
[0047] The sleeve 220 defines a channel 222. The distal end of the housing 210 may
be received into the channel 222, such that the sleeve 220 expands over the distal end
                                             8

of the housing 210 to form a sealed interface.         In other implementations, other
engagements (e.g., threaded or barbed) may be used. The cannula 224 extends
through the channel 222 and such that a distal end 226 of the cannula 224 extends past
a distal end 242 of the sleeve 220. In some instances, the cannula 224 may be formed
entirely or in part from a plastic material. In other implementations, the cannula 224
may be formed from a metal, such as stainless steel or titanium. In other instances,
the cannula 224 may be formed from any suitable material. Further, in some
instances, the cannula 224 may include a tip 231. The tip 231 may be utilized, for
example, to polish the capsular bag. In some instances, the tip 231 may be an integral
part of the cannula 224. For example, where the cannula 224 is formed from a plastic,
the tip 231 may be an integral part thereof In implementations where the cannula 224
is formed from a metal, the tip 231 may be formed from a plastic applied to the distal
end 226 of the cannula 224. For example, the tip 231 may be overmolded onto the
cannula 224.
[0048] An outer surface of insert 211 and an inner surface of the housing 211 define
an annular space extending 240 through the housing 210. The annular space 240 is
isolated from the aspiration passage 238. The annular space 240 communicates with
channels 222, 244 to define an infusion passage 246. The infusion passage 246 is
fluidly separate from the aspiration passage 238.
[0049] Infusion fluid, such as a water/saline solution (e.g., a balanced salt solution), is
introduced into the infusion passage 246 via the infusion port 212. In some
implementations, the infusion fluid exits the I/A unit 200 at the distal end 242 of the
sleeve 220, as indicated by arrows 223. In other implementations, the sleeve 220 may
include one or more ports 243 formed at the distal end 242 thereof, which permit
outflow of the irrigation fluid. The infusion fluid exits the I/A unit 200 at the distal
end 242 of the sleeve 220, as indicated by arrows 223.        The infusion fluid may be
provided to an eye during a procedure, such as cortex removal or capsule polishing.
The infusion fluid may, for example, be provided by a surgical console.
[0050]    Aspirated materials, represented by arrow 227, are drawn into the aspiration
passage 238 of the I/A unit 200 via a distal opening 248. The aspirated materials pass
through the aspiration passage 238 and exit the I/A unit 200 via the male luer fitting
219.
                                            9

[0051] In the illustrated implementation, sleeve 220 slideably engages with body
portion 210. Thus, sleeve 220 expands over the distal portion of body portion 210 to
create a sealed interface.
[0052] In operation, the I/A unit 200 may be coupled to a handheld pump unit, such
as, for example, the pump unit 140, and to an irrigation supply line (e.g., from a
surgical console). The distal end 226 of the cannula 224 may be inserted into the eye
through an existing incision. Materials, such as cortical material, may then be
aspirated, along with other tissue (e.g., epithelial cells), while leaving the posterior
capsule intact.    Simultaneously, fluids may be irrigated into the eye to stabilize it.
Additionally, if desired, the posterior capsule of the eye may be polished with distal
end 226.
[0053] The I/A unit 200 has a variety of features. For example, by locating a pump
unit nearer to the phacoemulsification unit, chamber stability may be improved.
Additionally, the I/A unit 200 may be used with a conventional surgical console if
desired. A handheld pump unit can also be positioned remotely from the I/A unit 200
(e.g., for ergonomic reasons) and coupled to the irrigation-aspiration unit via
aspiration tubing.
[0054] Although FIG. 2 illustrates an example I/A unit 200, other systems may use
other I/A units that may include fewer, additional, and/or a different arrangement of
components.
[0055] FIGs. 3A and 3B illustrate an example pump unit 300.             Pump unit 300
includes a drive portion 310 and a pumping portion 320. Pump unit 300 may, for
example, be usable in system 100.
[0056] Drive portion 310 includes a body 312. In the illustrated implementation,
body 312 is generally cylindrical and made of metal, but may have other shapes and
be made of other materials in other implementations. Body 312 includes a slot 314
configured to receive a fluid port 330 of pumping portion 320, to be discussed below.
Inside body 312 is an electric motor and a rotor 316 that is driven thereby. A conduit
318 is used to supply electricity to drive portion 310.
[0057] Pumping portion 320 includes an outer shell 322 and an inner shell 324. Outer
shell 322 is sized to fit around body 312 of drive portion 316 and inner shell 324 is
sized to fit inside body 312. Thus, body 312 slides between outer shell 322 and inner
                                             10

shell 324.    The shells 322, 324 may be made of hard plastic, metal, or any other
appropriate material. Inside inner shell 324, pumping portion 320 includes an
elastomeric pump segment 326 that includes integrated conduits 327.          Elastomeric
pump segment 326 engages rotor 316 in drive portion 310. The elastomeric pump
segment 326 is engaged by the rotor 316 as the rotor 316 is rotated to cause material
within the integrated conduits 327 to be transported therethrough. For example, the
rotor 316 may compress the elastomeric pump section 326, thereby causing a
peristaltic pumping action to transport material within the integrated conduits 327.
Thus, elastomeric pump segment 326 may, for example, provide a peristaltic-type
action to pump fluids through pump unit 300.
[00581 Pumping portion 320 also includes an adapter 328. In some instances, the
adapter 328 may be adapted to engage a male luer fitting on a unit adapted to couple
thereto (e.g., a phacoemulsification unit and/or an irrigation-aspiration unit). In other
implementations, the adapter 328 may be adapted to be received into a female fitting
on a unit, such as a phacoemulsification hand piece, and irrigation and aspiration hand
piece, or any other desired device. Adapter 328 includes an interior channel 332. The
interior channel 332 is in fluid communication with the integrated conduits 327. Fluid
may be drawn into pump unit 300 through the interior channel 332. Pumping portion
320 also includes a fluid port 330 through which fluid may be expelled from pump
unit 300. Fluid port 330 is sized to be received in slot 314 in body 312.
[0059] The drive portion 310 and the pumping portion 320 may be coupled together
by insertion of a distal end 313 of the body 312 between the outer shell 322 and inner
shell 324 of the pumping portion 320 with the fluid port 330 aligned with the slot 314.
In the illustrated example, the pumping portion 320 may be rotated relative to the
drive portion 310 such the fluid port 330 resides within a transverse portion 315 of the
slot 314. Thus, by rotating the pumping portion 320 and drive portion 310 relative to
each other, the fluid port 330 is made to reside in the transverse portion 315 of slot
314, causing the pumping portion 320 to be secured to drive portion 310.
[0060] Pump unit 300 has a variety of features. For example, pump unit 300 allows
pumping action to be performed near a coupled unit, such as a phacoemulsification
unit or irrigation-aspiration     unit. Thus, chamber     stability may be improved.
Additionally, since pumping portion 320 is separable from drive portion 310,
                                            11

pumping portion 320 may be removed after a procedure (e.g.,                  due to being
contaminated with biological material) while preserving drive portion 310.            Thus,
drive portion 310 may be used for multiple procedures. Additionally, since adapter
328 is adapted to engage a number of coupleable units (e.g., a phacoemulsification
unit, an irrigation-aspiration unit, etc.), pump unit 300 may be used for multiple
operations during a surgical procedure.
[00611 FIG. 4 illustrates an example surgical console 400 for use in ocular surgery.
Console 400 includes a housing 402 with a computer system 404 and an associated
display 406 operable to show, for example, data relating to system operation and
performance during a surgical procedure.        Display 406 may also interface with the
console 400, such as to establish or change one or more operations of the console
400.   In some instances, display 406 may include a touch-sensitive screen for
interacting with the console 400 by touching the screen of the display 406.
[0062] Various probes may be used with surgical console 400. Console 400 may, for
example, provide electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and/or other appropriate type of
power to a probe. Console 400 may also be operable to control the supplied power,
e.g., an infusion rate of fluid to a surgical site, aspiration of fluid from a surgical site,
and/or ultrasonic power to a phacoemulsification unit, as well as to monitor one or
more patient vital signs.
[0063] Console 400 may also include a number of systems that are used together to
perform ocular surgical procedures.         For example, the systems may include a
footswitch system 408 including, for example, a footswitch 410, a fluidics system
412, which could, for example, provide active irrigation, aspiration, and a pneumatics
system 418. The pneumatics system 418 may be operable to supply power to and
control a probe. For example, the pneumatics system 418 may be operable to
repeatedly cycle application of a pressurized gas. In some instances, the pneumatic
system 418 may be operable to cycle pressurized gas at rates within the range of one
cycle per minute to 7,500 cycles per minute, or possibly even 10,000 cycles per
minute or more. In certain implementations, the cycled gas may be applied at, for
example, different pressures, different rates, and different duty cycles. A probe may
also be interfaced with console 400 via pneumatics system 418 (e.g., to control
actuation of a cutter). Fluidics system 412 may be operable to provide infusion and/or
                                             12

irrigation fluids to the eye. The fluidics system 412 may also be operable to generate
a vacuum, such as to aspirate materials during a surgical procedure. To optimize
performance of the different systems during surgery, their operating parameters may
be varied according to, for example, the particular procedure being performed, the
different stages of the procedure, the surgeon's personal preferences, whether the
procedure is being performed in the anterior or posterior portion of the patient's eye,
and so on.
[0064] In this implementation, fluidics system 412 includes a fluid reservoir 414 and
a fluid control device 416. Fluid reservoir 414 holds the fluid to irrigate an eye. The
fluid may, for example, be a water/saline solution. In particular implementations,
fluid reservoir 414 may also supply fluid for other operations during an ocular surgery
(e.g., to maintain intraocular pressure). Fluid control device 416 is coupled to fluid
reservoir 414 and is adapted to control the flow of fluid from fluid reservoir 414 to an
irrigation port of a handheld device (e.g., a phacoemulsification probe or an irrigation
aspiration probe). Fluid reservoir 414 may, for example, be a bag, and fluid control
device 416 may be a pump. Fluidics system 412 may also supply the irrigation fluid
by a gravity feed.
[0065] The different systems in console 400 may include control circuits for the
operation and control of the various functions and operations performed by console
400, such operations of a probe. Computer system 404 may be operable to govern the
interaction and relationship between the different systems to properly perform a
surgical procedure. To do this, computer system 404 may include one or more
processors, one or more memory devices, and may be configured or programmed to
control operations of console 400, for example, based upon pre-established programs
or sequences.
[0066] In certain modes of operation, console 400 may provide irrigation fluid to a
phacoemulsification unit through a line 413.          The phacoemulsification unit may
receive suction for aspiration from a local pump unit that is coupled to the
phacoemulsification unit. The console may also supply irrigation fluid to another
coupleable unit (e.g., an irrigation-aspiration unit) through line 413. Further, one unit,
e.g., the irrigation-aspiration unit, may be utilized subsequent to a previously used
unit, e.g., a phacoemulsification unit. However, a unit, such as one or more of the
                                             13

units described herein or other suitable units, may be used in any desired order. The
irrigation-aspiration unit may also receive suction from the pump unit, which may
have been previously coupled to the phacoemulsification unit.
[0067] In certain implementations, console 400 may provide suction for one or more
handpieces.     For   example,    console    400    could    provide   suction    for   a
phacoemulsification unit of an I/A unit. In some instances, the console 400 may be
used to provide suction to an I/A unit such as I/A unit 200.
[00681 FIG. 5 illustrates selected operations for an example process 500 for ocular
surgery. Process 500 may, for example, be accomplished with a system similar to
system 100.
[00691 Process 500 calls for emulsifying a lens in an eye using a modular hand-held
system including a phacoemulsification unit and a pump unit (operation 504).
Emulsifying a lens, may, for example, include breaking the lens into several pieces
using ultrasonic movement. For example, in some instances, the lens may be
fragmented into four pieces. However, the lens may be fragmented into any number
of different pieces.
[0070] Process 500 also calls for removing portions of the lens using the hand-held
system (operation 508).      For example, portions of the lens may be aspirated out
through the phacoemulsification unit due to suction provided by the pump unit.
[0071] Process 500 additionally calls for decoupling the phacoemulsification unit
from the pump unit (operation 512). The phacoemulsification unit may, for example,
be decoupled by detaching a male luer fitting of the phacoemulsification unit from a
female luer fitting of the pump unit.
[0072] Process 500 also calls for coupling an irrigation-aspiration unit to the pump
unit to form a second system (operation 516). The irrigation-aspiration unit may, for
example, be coupled by attaching a male luer fitting of the irrigation-aspiration unit to
a female luer fitting of the pump unit.
[0073] Process 500 additionally calls for removing materials from the eye using the
second system (operation 520). For example, cortical materials may be removed from
the eye. Other materials, e.g., fluids and/or other tissues, may also be removed. The
materials may, for example, be removed by being aspirated out through the irrigation
aspiration unit due to suction provided by the pump unit.
                                           14

[0074] Process 500 also calls for polishing the lens capsule of the eye with the second
system (operation 524). The posterior capsule may, for example, be polished with a
tip or distal end of the irrigation-aspiration unit.
[0075] Although FIG. 5 illustrates one implementation of a process for ocular
surgery, other processes for ocular surgery may include fewer, additional, and/or a
different arrangement of operations. For example, a process may include operations
prior to emulsifying the lens. For instance, one or more incisions may be made in the
eye (e.g., through the cornea) to allow the introduction of surgical instruments. Also,
the anterior face of the capsule that contains the lens inside the eye may be removed.
As an additional example, a process may include irrigating the eye (e.g., with a
balanced salt solution) during the removal of the lens and/or other materials from the
eye. As another example, a process may not include polishing the lens capsule. As a
further example, a process may include switching an irrigation supply line from the
phacoemulsification unit to a separate irrigation handpiece unit. Moreover, a number
of the operations may be performed in a contemporaneous or simultaneous manner.
[0076] The various implementations discussed and mentioned herein have been used
for illustrative purposes only.     The implementations were chosen and described in
order to explain the principles of the disclosure and the practical application and to
allow those of skill in the art to understand the disclosure for various implementations
with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. Thus, the
actual physical configuration of components may vary. For example, the mentioned
size(s) of components and their illustrated sizing relative to each other may vary
based on application. Moreover, the shapes of one or more components may vary
depending on application.         Thus, the illustrative implementations should not be
construed as defining the only physical size, shape, and relationship of components.
[0077] Various systems and techniques for ocular surgery have been discussed, and
several others have been mentioned or suggested. However, those skilled in the art
will readily recognize that a variety of additions, deletions, substitutions, and
modifications may be made to these systems and techniques while still achieving
ocular surgery. Thus, the scope of protection should be judged based on the following
claims, which may capture one or more aspects of one or more implementations.
