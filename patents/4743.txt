                                       TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The invention relates to a method for fastening a first object to a second object.
                                            PRIOR ART
[0002]      Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
general knowledge in the field.
[0003]      Such a fastening device is described in DE 10 2010 003 130 Al. The fastening
deice has an expansion sleeve and an expanding mandrel, wherein the sleeve has a first load
engagement means for the first object and an abutment for an outer surface of the second
object. A sealing element is arranged adjacent to the abutment.
[0004]      With such fastening devices there is a danger that if the driving depth is too low,
the sealing element may not be sufficiently compressed to guarantee its sealing function.
There is also the danger that the sealing element may be pressed too strongly if the driving
depth is too large and will protrude radially outward. The tolerance for the driving depth is
therefore limited.
[0005]      The problem addressed by the invention is that of providing a device with which
the sealing function of the sealing element is guaranteed within a wide tolerance for the
driving depth, without the sealing element excessively protruding radially when compressed.
[0006]      It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of
the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.
                            PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION
[0007]      According to the invention there is provided a device for fastening a first object to
a second object, comprising a load section having a first load engagement means, a driving
section defining a driving direction, and a sealing element for sealing between the device and
the second object, wherein the sealing element is a circular sealing ring with a width b
perpendicular to the driving direction and a height h in the driving direction that is greater
than the width b and an outside diameter D and an inside diameter d, where 2b      = D - d,

                                                  2
wherein D is less than or equal to a largest diameter of the load section, in particular the first
load engagement means.
[0008]      Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the
claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive
sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of
"including, but not limited to".
[0009]      Preferably, h > 1.1 x b, more preferably h > 1.5 x b and especially preferably h
>1.8 x b. In comparison to previously known devices, a greater height of the sealing element
is achieved for the same volume and therefore the sealing element is compressed sufficiently
even if there are large fluctuations in the driving depth.
[0010]      According to one advantageous embodiment, the sealing element comprises a
sealing ring with an outer diameter D and an inner diameter d. The width b preferably
corresponds to the difference between the outer diameter D and the inner diameter d. The ring
is especially preferably circular. The outer diameter D is preferably less than or equal to a
largest diameter of the load section, especially preferably that of the first load engagement
means, and therefore the sealing ring does not protrude radially outward. It is likewise
preferred that the sealing ring protrudes radially relative to the load section, particularly the
first load engagement means, by at most 15%, more preferably at most 7.5%, and especially
preferably at most 3%. It is likewise preferred that the sealing ring protrudes radially relative
to the load section, particularly the first load engagement means, by at most 0.5 mm, more
preferably at most 0.25 mm, and especially preferably at most 0.1 mm. The inner diameter d
is preferably less than or equal to a largest diameter of the driving section, so that the sealing
ring contacts the driving section radially inwardly, whereby the sealing function is improved
under certain circumstances.
[0011]      According to an advantageous embodiment, a cross-sectional surface of the
sealing element is rectangular. According to another advantageous embodiment, a cross
sectional surface of the sealing element is oval or elliptical.
[0012]      According to an advantageous embodiment, the fastening device comprises a
sealing surface facing in the driving direction, against which the sealing element rests. The
fastening device preferably comprises a sealing flange bearing the sealing surface.
[0013]      According to an advantageous embodiment, the load section comprises a shank
and a sleeve that bears the first load engagement means. The sleeve also bears the sealing

                                                  3
surface, especially preferably the flange. The first load engagement means preferably
comprises a thread.
[0014]       According to an advantageous embodiment, the driving section comprises a
shank. The driving section preferably comprises a nail tip. According to another
advantageous embodiment, the driving section comprises a screw thread. The driving section
preferably comprises a screw tip or drill bit. According to another advantageous embodiment,
the driving section comprises an expansion sleeve and an expanding mandrel.
                                         EMBODIMENTS
[0015]       The invention will be described below in detail on the basis of embodiments with
reference to the drawings. In the drawing:
[0016]       Figure 1 shows a recess,
[0017]       Figure 2 shows a fastening device,
[0018]       Figure 3 shows a sealing element in cross section,
[0019]       Figure 4 shows a fastening device driven into a recess in a longitudinal view, and
[0020]       Figure 5 shows a fastening device driven into a recess in a longitudinal view.
[0021]       Figure 1 shows a plate 100 with a surface 110. The plate 100 consists of a metal or
an alloy such as steel. The surface 110 is provided with a paint and/or protection layer, for
corrosion protection for example. The plate 100 is provided with a blind hole 120, which was
drilled into the plate 100 from the surface 110 with the aid of a step drill. The step of the step
drill, which is used as a stop to guarantee a predetermined drilling depth, leaves a depression
140 in the form of an imprint or scratch in the surface 110 at the edge 130 of the blind hole
120, whereby the protective layer can be damaged under certain circumstances. It is therefore
desirable to seal the depression 140 together with the blind hole 120 against the environment,
more particularly dust-tightly, air-tightly and/or water-tightly. To facilitate this sealing, a step
drill with the smallest possible step is used, so that the depression 140 in the radial direction
is likewise as narrow as possible.
[0022]       Figure 2 shows a fastening device 200 for fastening a first object, not shown, such
as a support part or other part to be attached, on a second object, likewise not shown, such as
the plate 100 in Figure 1. The fastening device 200 has a load section 210 with a first load
engagement means designed as a thread 220. The fastening device further comprises a head
230 and a driving section 240, which defines a driving direction 250. The driving section 240
has a substantially cylindrical outer surface 260, with which it can be pressed into a blind

                                                  4
hole according Figure 1, for example, in order to fasten the fastening device 200 by frictional
engagement in the blind hole. The outer surface 260 is therefore used as a second load
engagement means. In examples that are not shown, the driving section is designed in the
nature of a nail, a screw, an expander pin or the like. Finally, the fastening device has a
sealing element designed as a circumferential sealing ring 270 for sealing between the
fastening device 200 and the second object.
[0023]      Figure 3 shows the sealing ring 270 enlarged in a cross-sectional view. The
sealing ring consists of an elastic material, for example an elastomer, EPDM, neoprene or
rubber. The sealing ring has a circular shape with an outside diameter D and an inside
diameter d. Each of the two cut faces 280 of the sealing ring 270 that are shown has a
rectangular shape. In embodiments that are not shown, the corresponding cut surfaces of the
sealing element are oval or elliptical. The cut faces 280 and thus the sealing ring 270 have a
width b perpendicular to the driving direction and a height h in the driving direction that is
greater than the width b. It is evident from the drawing that the width b corresponds to the
difference between the outside diameter D and the inside diameter d. In the present example,
the ratio between the height h and the width b is approximately 2, with which good results
regarding the sealing function can be achieved at an outer diameter D     =  8 mm, for example.
In embodiments that are not shown, the ratio is larger or smaller than 2. For an outer diameter
D  = 10 mm, a ratio of approximately 1.7 between the height h and the width b has shown
good results. For sealing, the sealing ring 270 has a first sealing surface 300 facing opposite
the driving direction 250, a second sealing surface 310 facing in the driving direction 250,
and a third sealing surface 320 facing radially inward. The first sealing surface 300 and the
second sealing surface 310 are flat and are oriented perpendicular to the driving direction
250. The third sealing surface 320 is curved in the shape of a cylindrical surface and is
oriented parallel to the driving direction 250. The third sealing surface 320 is therefore
suitable for making sealing contact with the cylindrical outer surface 260 of the driving
section 240 according to Figure 2.
[0024]      Figure 4 shows a longitudinal section of the fastening device 200 according to
Figure 2 after fastening to the plate 100 according to Figure 1. The fastening device 200 was
driven for this purpose into the blind hole 120 with its driving section 240, for example by
one or more blows on the head 230, particularly with the aid of a fastener-setting device that
is not shown. The fastening device consists of a pin 330 and a sleeve 340. The pin 330
comprises the head 230 and a continuous shank 350, which bears the sleeve 340 in the load

                                                 5
section 210 of the fastening device 200, and forms the cylindrical outer surface 260 in the
driving section 240 of the fastening device 200. The sleeve 340 is tightly connected to the
shank 350 by means of a press fit and bears the thread 220 on the outer side of the sleeve. In
addition, the sleeve 340 has a fourth annular sealing surface 360 facing in the driving
direction 250.
[0025]      To seal the blind hole 120 against the surroundings in order to prevent the ingress
of corrosion-promoting moisture, one side of the first sealing surface 300 of the sealing ring
270 contacts the fourth sealing surface 360, and on the other side, the second sealing surface
310 contacts the surface 110 of the plate 100, with the depression 140 at the edge 130 of the
blind hole 120 being covered as completely as possible by the second sealing surface 310. In
addition, the third sealing surface 320 of the sealing ring 270 contacts the shank 350. For this
purpose, the inside diameter d of the sealing ring 270 is less than or equal to an outer
diameter of the shank 350. The sleeve 340 has the same geometry at its ends in the driving
direction 250 and opposite the driving direction 250, so that the sleeve 340 can be fastened on
the pin 330 in both possible orientations.
[0026]      A part to be attached 400 mounted on the fastening device 200 has a passage
opening formed as a bore 410, with which the part to be attached is slipped over the load
section 210 of the fastening device 200. The fastening is achieved by a threaded nut, not
shown, such as a cap nut, which is screwed onto the thread 220. In an example that is not
shown, the bore of the part to be attached has an internal thread and is screwed onto the
thread of the fastening device. In order for the part to be attached 400 to come to rest against
the surface 110 of the plate 100 without disruption while being pushed onto the fastening
device 200, the outside diameter D of the sealing ring 270 is less than or equal to an inside
diameter of the bore 410. In order to be able to select as small an inside diameter of the bore
410 as possible, the outside diameter D of the sealing ring 270 is preferably less than or equal
to an outside diameter of the thread 220, so that the sealing ring 270 does not protrude
radially relative to the thread 220. In embodiments that are not shown, the sealing ring
protrudes radially relative to the thread by 15% or 0.5 mm, or by 7.5% or 0.25 mm, or by 3%
or 0.1 mm, the outside diameter D of the sealing ring preferably being less than or equal to
the inside diameter of the bore.
[0027]      Figure 5 shows a longitudinal section of an additional embodiment of a fastening
device 200, after it has been fastened to the plate 100 according to Figure 1, wherein
corresponding elements are provided with identical reference numbers. The sleeve 340 in this

                                                  6
case has a sealing flange 420 bearing the fourth sealing surface 360. The fourth sealing
surface 360 is flat and perpendicular to the driving direction 250. The flange 420, and
therefore also the fourth sealing surface 360, additionally extends radially up to a diameter
that is equal to or only slightly less than the outer diameter of the thread 220. In this way, a
large fourth sealing surface 360 is achieved.
[0028]      The two embodiments shown according to Figures 4 and 5 are presented at a
relatively slight driving depth, so that the sealing ring 270 is only compressed slightly in the
driving direction 250 and is therefore deformed only slightly, or not at all. Accordingly, a free
space 430 radially outside of the sealing ring 270 is formed and has a relatively large volume
due to the geometry of the sealing ring 270 according to the invention. With a greater driving
depth, the distance between the fourth sealing surface 360 of the fastening device 200 and the
surface 110 of the plate 100 is small, so that the sealing ring 270 is compressed further in the
driving direction 250 and deformed. Although this makes the free space 430 smaller, the
sealing ring 270 also does not protrude radially past the outer diameter of the thread, even for
a larger driving depth 220. Therefore a wide tolerance for driving depth is guaranteed without
hampering contact of the part to be attached 400 with the surface 110 of the plate 100.
[0029]      The invention has been described on the basis of examples of a device for
fastening a first object to a second object. The features of the described embodiments can also
be freely combined with one another within a single fastening device. It should be pointed out
that the devices according to the invention are also suitable for other purposes.
