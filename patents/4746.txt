                          Using Weighted Period Event Tables
                                          ABSTRACT
        A system stochastically models events related to potential perils (e.g., hurricanes, terrorist
attacks) using a weighted period event table. Both rare and likely events are captured in
modeling with minimal computational overhead, allowing appropriate allocation of resources.
Applications include disaster response, municipal planning, financial risk modeling and
allocation,

                                           BACKGROUND
TECHNICAiL FuLD
fOO01]      The subject matter described herein generally relates to the field of predicting and
managing catastrophic event impacts, and more specifically to modeling scenarios involving one
or more catastrophic events and making decisions regarding mitigation accordingly.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
100021      Numerous resources need to be deployed when disasters strike. Fire, police, National
Guard and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) resources all need to be allocated
in a sensible manner. For some disasters, coordination among two or more national govemments
may be required. Likewise, businesses need to allocate their resources in a similar fashion. For
instance, if a retail establishment has a regional warehouse, it will want to know which stores are
likely to be damaged (so goods are not shipped there) as well as which are nearby to the
impacted area but are not likely to be damaged (so that goods can be shipped there to be
available in the damaged area after the disaster)
100031       Perhaps the most direct example of such allocation of resources in the face of a
catastrophic event comes from the insurance industry, in that industry, multiple layers of
insurers have often-overlapping coverage, all with limits (e.g., caps) and other constraints,
Further, catastrophic events, even if randomly distributed, are sometimes bunched so that
exposure seems unusually high. In addition, some catastrophic events tend not to be independent
but instead are tied together, eg., (a) a weather pattern breeds multiple cyclonic events during a
                                                   I

single season; (b) a large earthquake is accompanied by a tsunami and numerous aftershocks; (C)
a terrorist attack is not isolated but is planned as one of several coordinated attacks.
[00041       In the past, governments, aid organizations and businesses have come up with
documents outlining certain "rules of engagement" with respect to addressing the impact of such
catastrophic events. For example, a state National Guard unit may have one plan for
mobilization within the state's boundaries, but a more complex and limited manner of
engagement for mobilization when a neighboring state seeks its assistance.
100051       As such rules and agreements play out, however, the complexity becomes quite
difficult to manage, For instance, there is widespread public commentary regarding the number
of different law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in Washington, DC The FEMA website
page http:b'wwwfemagov/about/offices/ncriindex.shtnm explains that there is an entire Office of
National Capital Region Coordination to oversee and manage the overlapping responsibilities of
various authorities in the region who should be included in catastrophic planning.
[00061       In the private sector, various responsibilities for addressing damage due to
catastrophic events are typically spelled out in contracts. Allocating risks and responsibilities
related to such events is a difficult task, and accuracy in prediction of needs can be quite
beneficial, for example in determining the amount and location of emergency supplies to
warehouse in various locations.
 j0007]       it would be advantageous to such allocation tasks if there were a system and method
that could accurately model disaster event scenarios in a manner that did not consume excessive
computational resources.
 [00081       The features and advantages described in the specification are not all inclusive and, in
 particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in

100211      The figures depict various embodiments for purposes of illustration only. One skilled
in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of
the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from. the
principles of the invention described herein,
                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
100221      As described herein, a system and method apply machine processing to predict where
and how impacts caused by a catastrophic event are to be addressed. Such modeling can be used
when allocations are first being negotiated, whenever review of exposure is desired by a
stakeholder, when a disaster is imminent, and even during or after a catastrophic event (for
instance with respect to event-response scenarios).
[00231      For context, in one application several organizations are interested in helping to
insure against a natural disaster. Typically, the obligations of such organizations are set forth in
a document with numerous terms, for instance detailing the nature of protection being provided
and the locations covered. To add to the complexity, notjust one orgizatio        (e.g an insurance
company) but several such organizations each may have overlapping responsibilities with respect
to a given geographic area, piece of property, or facility. To avoid doubled-up resource
allocations, typically there is some rule for determining which of several organizations has
primary responsibility (and the extent of such responsibility), which has secondary, tertiary, and
even further subordinate responsibility.
 [0024j     These various rules and terms inject a great amount of uncertainty and complexity in
predicting the extent of exposure from various perils. Known approaches require a great amount
                                                   4

of human interpretaton and expert analysis, both to enter information initially and to interpret
results after a catastrophic event. At times, low quality information has led to poor decision
making by various stakeholders.
f0025]       As noted above, the discussion here has centered on one specific application in the
insurance industry, but those skilled in the art will readily recognize other applications., e.g.,
deployment of emergency equipment to an area impacted by a natural disaster,
[0026}       In order to more fully explain the systems and methods described above, what follows
is a more detailed description of a system and method using a weighted period event table
according to one embod iment.
100271       Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a diagram of a framework 100 of modeling
probabilistic events, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks, and corresponding loss
assessments, for example required deployments of mission personnel and materiel. FIG.I
illustrates framework 100 by reference to various processing blocks, which can be thought of
either as steps of a method or as processing modules for performing such steps.
100281       Processing begins 101 by engaging, instantiating or otherwise enabling a number of
processing modules or steps. At first, a peril, vulnerability processing module/step 102 operates
by defining and scoping the perils and vulnerabilities to be addressed. In one embodiment, a
peril module 102 identifies the events that can impact a portfolio of buildings and estimates the
hazard induced by the peril at each location in the portfolio. For instance, for an earthquake
peril, this includes identifying all earthquakes that impact the portfolio and identifying the extent
of ground shaking at al locations, such as shown below.

[00291      Next, event loss processing 103 (which is in some embodiments performed using
vulnerability module 102) determines the mean and coefficient of variation of event loss at the
relevant location(s) for a specified coverage level. For example, one might model an earthquake
impacting a given city neighborhood by stating that the following losses are expected:
             Earthquake Event       Site ID       Mean expected loss     Coefficient

10030]      Next, processing moves to a decision 104 as to whether stochastic analysis is
appropriate. In some cases a scenario analysis is performed 105 in order to study the impact of a
                                                  6

particular historical event or a scenario event on the portfolio, Specifically, one can simply posit
various likely scenarios (e gs What is the financial impact of a Hurricane Andrew-like event
today in Florida. if the total insured value in the area is $842M).
100311       Many times, it is necessary to study the portfolio losses under not just one scenario
event but under several possible events. For example, for sone emergency response planning
purposes, one might want to consider the probability that terrorists have planned to attack one
city rather than another. Similarly, it is necessary to use multiple scenarios to consider the
possibility that a hurricane might pass within ten miles, or 25 miles, of a city. Conventional
scenario analysis is too simplistic to address all of the possibilities in such an instance, so it is
appropriate to decide to use stochastic analysis to model the possibilities.
[0032]       In that instance, processing flows to a module/step 106 in which a loss (e.g., financial
loss for monetary planning, or other impact for emergency response team or military planning) is
determined for each event in a weighted period event table (WPET) 107 using the mean and
coefficient of variation information provided, for instance, by the vulnerability module,
combined with local and global factors 108 that capture the potential correlation between the
losses at multiple locations. Using the WPET provides insight into how the portfolio reacts to a
combination of catastrophic events which can happen within a certain period of time. Using the
hurricane example above -for instance, a WPET of hurricane events will be constructed with
several probable hurricanes based on their corresponding annual rates, and the portfolio will be
analyzed under all such hurricanes. Losses to the portfolio are then calculated for each event in
the WPET by financial engine processing 109. The results are then used for generation of a risk
output I10, eig, to identify the hurricanes that cause large losses and the locations that suffer the
                                                    7

most, as well as to determine the nature and recipient of the risk mitigation efforts or to further
pass on the results to a different module for additional processing.
[00331      The use of WPET vs a regular PET (weighted vs regular) provides a more efficient
way of analyzing the data and with a comparable effort, WPET is able to analyze a far more
number of realizations of what can happen in reality compare to a regular PET and therefore, the
outcome of an analysis under WPET methodology will be much more accurate and decision
makers can be less uncertain toward their view of risk. The data associated with a WPET
framework, as will be explained later in the document, provides relative weight to different
scenarios and therefore, can provide a better insight by giving more weight to things that can
happen more frequently while in regular PBT, all weights are equal and to provide a fair balance
between frequent and rate scenarios, a much more number of simulation is needed.
[0034I      The results of such processing yield losses under each event in the catalog for all the
locations of interest, which are then passed, as illustrated in the flow diagram, to a financial
engine, which then generates risk measures such as gross losses of interests to specific clients or
for other purposes (e.g. to provide client-specific losses based on insurance policies with
corresponding limits, deductibles and other parameters).
100351      The illustrated example shows processing by a financial engine 109, but in other
applications, other logistical processors may be used as appropriate for the application. For
instance, a deployment engine may be used instead of a financial engine when it is desired to
figure out where to station emergency response and military personnel and where to warehouse
emergency/defensive materiel so as to best be able to respond to such perils, as well as from
what locations to deploy such resources once a first peril is realized. There may be situations in
which only a certain number of local resources are deployed to address a peril, after which more
                                                   8

remote resources are deployed to ensure that no facility has resources depleted beyond a certain
threshold limit,
[0036]       Military planners, FE MA personnel, municipalities, and businesses of various types
are all interested in being able to model expected outcomes from various peril possibilities, but
conventional approaches have been overly complex and unable to scale to the amount of
variability commonly seen in the real world.
100371       Referring now to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a typical modeling platform as discussed
herein. WPET engine 202, in one embodiment a server computer, models risk per instructions
from an analyst workstation 201 via a network (referred to as "cloud" to indicate the availability
of any appropriate network topology, e g.. a LAN, WAN, or broadly speaking, the Internet).
Results from processing of WPET engine 202 are applied to a risk management subsystem 203,
again a server computing system in one environment, from which is determined any desired risk
exposure metric or variable (e.g, number of blankets needed for warehousing to meet need on
 'expected plus one standard deviation* basis).
[0038]       The WPET engine 202 takes as input the parameters needed to define scenarios for
the downstream engines. For example, in a hurricane model, input parameters can be which set
of hurricane models are of interest, what event rate set is going to be used for the analysis, and
whether there is any correlation or clustering among hurricane events. The WPET engine 202
then considers these input parameters and data sets to create many different scenarios together
with a probability of occurrence which the risk portfolio might expct in the future. Once the
scenarios are simulated by the WPET engine 202, downstream systems such as risk management
 subsystem 203 calculate the losses for each scenario and then the loss metric that will be used for
 decision making purposes, based on the probabilities determined by the WPET engine 202.
                                                    9

                           GENERAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
[00391      FIG, 3 below is a block diagram illustrating the high-level components of a system
300 for WPET processing as described herein, such as may be used to provide processing
referred to in connection with WPET engine 202 of FIG. 2. The overall characteristics of the
desired WPEBT are defined in block 301, in one embodiment in a manner that is largely model
independent and high level. Initial number of periods, rate tolerance, and minimum number of
occurrences are examples of the WPET criteria defined in one embodiment in block 301. These
conditions are applied generally for any WPET processed by system 300.
[0040]      Additional event definitions are stored in blocks 302 - 305, The event set is defined
in block 302 which lists the stochastic event set specific to a model. Blocks 303 to 305 are used
in some embodiments to address additional sets of information and as may be defined based on
specific requirements in an environment of use of system 300, Information regarding how
different events can be groups together is managed based on the event cluster definitions of
block 303 and the multiplicity definitions of block 304. This information is used in
embodiments in which it is desired to introduce seasonality and correlation in the event sets.
Block 305 defines the variability of different periods in terms of number of events that will be
used by WPIlET processing engine 202 to distribute events into different periods.
100411      The constituent components of system 300 described above (301-305) and data
storage subsystem 301 are in some embodiments implemented in one or more database systems
holding event information relating to event occurrences in a WPET. in one embodiment,
subsystems 302305 are implemented by a blade server system on which a relational database
application has been structured to provide a WPET as described herein, However, as set forth
                                                  10

with regard to FC. 4, in other embodiments other types of processors and computing systems
are usable to perform such processing as well,
[00421       The event information pertinent to system 300 varies from one peril to another peril
and from one region to another region. Typically, this information provides all possible single
event scenarios which can happen in that peril/region, but there is no knowledge of how these
events can happen together in a year or, in the case of a multi-year insurance contract, how
events might line up during the lifetime of the contract. A primary task of the WPET engine 202
is to get these raw events and combine them with other factors, rules and conditions to create
different scenarios in the tine domain that satisfy the conditions of that peril/region. Such
processing is found to better represent reality, compared to calculating the event consequences as
they were happening independent of each other.
10043]       A factor indices module 306 allows modelers, municipal planners and other types of
users of system 300 to specify certain input factors of relevance (indices) for the specific
modeling that is desired. Module 306 is implemented, in one embodiment, as a data service in
communication with a server-based host application to provide the factors that go into the WPET
processing engine and will be used for sampling of values provided by the other modules,
[00441       The output of modules 301-306 are applied to a processing module 307 providing the
core WPET processing as described herein. Those skilled in the art wiII recognize that any sort
of communication among the modules described herein, or similar modules, could also be used
should other architectures for system 300 be desired.
[0045j       Factors and parameters used in WPET processing may come either from a client
application as model inputs or may be stored in the model data itself, The two sources of
parameters and factors are then applied to the data set by the WPFT engine 202 to create
                                                   II

scenarios. The input factors and event set information are also used to provide the probability of
each of these scenarios to downstream engines for calculation of loss metrics. Thus, WPIT
processing operates to generate event scenarios corresponding to the peril/region and input
factors.

[0046]      FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating components of an example machine able to read
instructions from a machine-readable medium and execute those instructions in a processor to
perform the machine processing tasks discussed herein, such as the WPET engine operations
discussed above. Specifically, FIG. 4 shows a diagrammatic representation of a machine in the
example form of a computer system 400 within which instructions 424 (e g., software) for
causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein may be
executed. In alternative embodiments, the machine operates as a standalone device or may be
connected (e,g., networked) to other machines, for instance via the Internet. In a networked
deployment, the machine may operate in the capaelty of a server machine or a client machine in
a server-client network environment, or as a peer machine in a peer-to-peer (or distributed)
network environment,
[0047]      The machine may be a server computer, a client computer, a personal computer (PC),

                          IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION
[0051)      Application of WPET-based processing as described herein is appropriate in a variety
of circumstances. As discussed above, location and deployment of resources for emergency
response and military situations is one example. Another is risk quantification to facilitate risk
management, which has application in financial industry niches such as within the insurance
industry, and also in other areas such as municipal planning, public policy detenninations. and
determination of cost-effectiveness of construction projects and construction project options. For
instance, a hotel company looking to locate a new property in coastal Florida, or nearby a fault
line, may consider various options that present different risk profiles, and the cost-benefit
analysis used to select a particular option is appropriate driven by complex considerations as
addressed using WPET-based processing,

exemplary embodiments.
PET CONmNT/FORMAT
            Each row in PET table contains the following fields:
                    * Simulation period
                    *   Event ID
                    o Year

[00531       Each "simulation period" is a possible future outcome of events. "Year" and "day"
define the event occurrence time, "Event ID" indicates which event has happened in a period.
"Factor Index" is a key that quantifies how much the loss for this specific event is above or
below the mean value, "Weight" specifies the relative importance of each period that helps
address challenges regarding high frequency/low frequency events discussed below
[0054]       To calculate loss statistics from PET, each period (which could consist of several
lines in the PET table depending on how many events occurred in that period) is considered
separately; the desired loss (financial perspective and aggregation level) is applied; then the
result is multiplied by the weight for that period and summed up.
HI(H AN!) Low FREQUENCY EVENTS
100551       The simplest form for the PET is one in which all the periods have the same weight,
iLe the weight for every period equals one divided by number of simulated periods. To illustrate
some of the challenges that arise with a constant weight consider the following exemplary PET
statistics for earthquake and hurricane risks.
[00561       One earthquake event set has 382,028 events with rates as high as 0.23 and as low as
5e- 13. In order to capture the event with the lowest rate, 2e1 2 periods would be needed,
meaning that the PET table would have le14 lines. Also, in 2e12 periods, the event with the
highest rate would be sampled Sell times. Thus, a great amount of overhead is required to
support capturing events with low rates, In contrast, WPET representation requires a PET with
only 3e6 rows (an order of 3e7 smaller). ilow this saving is achieved using weighted PET is
explained in the next section,

[0058]       A graphical representation of this PET is provided in FIG. 5A, showing various
events 50 1 and the periods, e g., 502, within which they occur, The horizontal axis is not strictly
a time scale: it merely indicates period number. Notice that only 10 periods out of the 20
simulated periods have any events in them at all. This makes sense because the sum of all event
rates in the event table is equal to 0.61 and the probability of having zero events is exp(-0.61)
which is equal to 0,54, which is consistent with the 10/20 simulation.
100591      One statistic that can be obtained from the PET table is the implied rate of each event
Every row in this PET has basically a weight of 0.05 (ie., 1/20), Thus, to calculate the implied
rate, you should count the number of times an event has occurred and multiply it by 0,05. In the
case of event 101 the implied rate would be 8 times 0.05 which is equal to 04, and the real event
rate is 0.42, therefore the relative rate error is 0.02/0.42 or 4.8%,
[00601       There are t.vo methods to define the number of times each event occurs in the RET:
                 Number of occurrences for each event is Proportional to its rate (e g. event 101
                 has a rate of 0.42, therefore it has occurred 0,42*20=8 times).
             29 Define the total number of occurrences as the sum of all rates multiplied by the
                 number of simulated periods (in this case 0.61*20 equals 12). And then pick 12
                 events from the event set randomly, with the chance of each event being picked
                 proportional to its rate.
                                                     17

[0061]      The RMS Simulation Platform product provided by Risk Management Solutions of
Newark, California uses the latter method (which preserves total rate) and that is used in the
embodiment discussed here, One problem with the first method is none of the events with a rate
lower than the inverse of number of simIUations will be present in the PET even once, The
downside with the second method is that if one of those rare events acts selected, it will have an
implied rate which can be orders of magnitude larger than the real event rate,
WEIGaTED PET (WPET)
[00621     Now consider the same example, this time modeled using the weighted PET
approach. First, start with simulating 5 periods. Event 101 will be simulated twice, say on
periods I and 3, and no other event will be simulated, if the simulation was for 20 periods, event
10 1 would have been simulated 8 times (as seen in the regular PET method discussed above).
Instead of simulating event 10 1 in 20 random simulation periods, the assumption here is that it
happens at periods 1, 6, 11, 16, and 3. 8, 13t -18, ,eg. the periods where the remainder is I or 3
when divided by 5, The graphical representation of this idea will look as shown in FIG, 513.
Again, the horizontal axis is not the time axis, but the period number axis without imposition of
any temporal correlation. The assumption is simply the periods in which these events will
happen on to help with reduced number keeping and storage space,
 100631     The next step is updating the rate of the events that got simulated, In this example the
implied rate for event 1-0 is 2/5 or 0.4. Reducing this implied rate from the original rate gives
the remnant rate of 0,02. Now, event 101 will have an updated rate of 0.02 in the event rate
table.
                                     Event ID        Event Rate
                            1        101             0,02

                            5        401           0.0
[00641       Next, simulation is performed for 10 periods. The only event to be simulated in this
increment is event 201 (with a rate of 01). It happens to fall on period 3, so if the simulation
were for 20 periods, it wold fall on periods 3 and 13 (13 being the period which has a remainder
of 3 when divided by 3). The graphical representation for the 10 simulated periods and for the
imaginary 20 period equivalence will look as shown in FIG. 5C. The implied rate of event 201 is
1/10, and therefore the updated rate will be 0.1 - 1/10 or zero, The updated event rate table will
look like:
                                     Event ID      Event Rate
                                     101           002

                            5        40 1          0.01
[00651       Next, situation is performed for 20 periods, with events 301 and 302 (with rates of
0.05) chosen. The graphical representation is shown in FIO. 5D and looks somewhat similar to
that of the regular PET in terms of how many times each event is simulated. If the real rate is
updated with implied rates, the event rate table that results is:
                                       vent ID      Event Rate
                            2         20            00
                                                    0           -------------------
                            3        301            0
                            4        302            0
                                                  19

                                 5   401               0.01
[00661      Note that event 101 is still in the table. If simulation had proceeded to the next
increment with 40 periods, event. 101 would have been selected again, making the implied rate
closer to the real rate and reducing the relative rate error, In fact, this error can be reduced to any
arbitrarilysmall number as an input to the PET creation tool.
[0067]      Computational efficiency in application of WPET comes from going from such
graphical representations, which are similar to those using regular PET, to a table format, which
can be much more concise than the RPETtable. Since there is a pattern to how the events are
repeated along periods, it is not necessary to store all the information in the axis. If event 101
happened on period ], then with the weight information it is also known that event 101 happened
on periods 6, 11, and 16, as well, so recording that information would be redundant. Thus, by
redefining the occurrence of a "period" based on new, non-redundant information, a more
compact. representation is achieved: the following table will be enough to represent the
information represented by FIG, 3D:
                              Oee.    Period          Event       Weight

 [00681     The graphical representation of this way of looking at the events is illustrated in
 FIG. 5S with the new periods 503 being illustrated by the numbers inside the boxes on the axis.

                                              302           1/20
[00691      The tree diagram of FIG. 5F provides another perspective of this arrangement. The
events 501are indicated in the columns along with the first of the original periods 502 in which
they occur, as well as in subsequent columns with additional ones of the original periods 502 in
which they occur, and the diagram is arranged to show the progression through the original
periods 502 such that the leftmost column shows original periods 1-5, the middle column shows
periods 1-10 grouped to show redundancy of events, and likewise the rightmost column shows
original periods 1-20. The scarcity of meaningful information in this diagram is evident by the
lack of events corresponding to many of these original periods 502--for instance periods 2 (and
7, 12 and 17) are carried in the diagram but do not correspond to any events,. In the right
column, the new periods 503 are illustrated, showing how they correspond with both the original
periods 502 and events 50 1-none of the new periods is "m-eaningless" in the sense that it has no
event associated with it. Further, grouping based on the new periods 503 allows consideration of
each occurence of an event based on the original periods 502 with a single combined occurrence
and the corresponding weig ht of the event, Thus, rather than keeping track of four events 101 in
original periods 1b fl, 6 and 16, using the new period the only required storage is of the single
 instance of the event in new period I and its corresponding weight of 15, thereby reducing the
overall size of the PET. The implied rate of every event in the table is calculated by adding the
                                                  21

weights of the rows containing that event, for instance event 101 happens in periods 1, 2, 3 and 4
and therefore the total rate of event 101 is the sum of the weights of these periods, which is equal
to 1/5 + 1/10 + 1/20 + 1/20= 0A
 0070]       In one embodiment, the original periods 502 are not completely ignored, as they are
still helpful in combining PETs for a new peril by back tracking to the occurrence origin of each
event, as further discussed herein,
BRANCHING 0:r
[0071]       Branching out refers to dividing a single period into two periods, each having a
weight equal to half the weight of the original period. These new periods have identical events
in them, and therefore the event rates will not be impacted by branching out. However, the
factor index and the event dates for these events are different in two periods, thus providing more
samples of each event,
[00721       In one embodiment the minimum number of occurrences (the minimum number of
times each event has been sampled with a different factor) is an input to system 300. After the
WPET is created as explained above, the processing traverses through the PET, finds all periods
which contain events with only one sample, divides those periods into two with new factors and
halving the weight. Next, processing repeats the same procedure for periods with events which
only have two samples and keeps going until all events are sampled at least equal to the specified
number,
MULTI-PERIL PET
[00731       In order to enable contracts with multi perils, the PET for those perds is either created
at the same time, or if a peril is being added later, the initial number of simulated periods is set as
a multiple of the initial number of periods with which the original PET was created.
                                                   22

[00741      Creating the PET for all perils at the same is the most straightforward approach, but i
may not be the most efficient choice if a new peril is being added to an existing mix of perils.
Thus, a strategy for adding a peril to an existing PET is preferred in some circumstances
Consider a situation in which the WPET example in the section above was previously created
and now it is desired to add a new peril to it with the following event rate table:
                                           1Event I-D   Event Rate
                                   1        501         01
                                  2      7502           O.05
{0075]      It would not be appropriate to simulate this peril separately and combine it with the
previous WPET since period 'i in one PET does not correspond to period ''          in the other,
Rather, processing proceeds through the WPET again and ensures that the WPET events for the
perils which already exist are simulated exactly where they where simulated before and the new
events are added at the proper place. This example is ilustrated in FIG, 6A, with the new events
601 added to the original events 501 at the corresponding original periods 502, The tree diagram
representation of this scenario is illustrated in FIG. 61B with the addition of the new periods 603
as previously outlined, The resulting combined WPET for both perils is:
                               Period       Event            Weight

PET VALIDATION
RAE CONvaRwEuC          AN I)POISSON DISTRIBUTmIN
[00761      In some implementations, it may be helpful to validate the extent to which the PET
accurately represents the event set it was created from. In sone embodiments, to implement
such validation, processing can check how close the implied rate for each event calculated from
the PET is with respect to the actual rate of that event. A maximum relative error of the implied
rate with respect to the actual rate is provided as an input to the PET generation process called
"MaxRatelolerance" in one embodiment, The smaller this number, the larger the PET size will
need to be, The implied rate for every event is calculated by summing up the weights of all the
PET rows including that event, In one embodiment, histograms are produced to provide
graphical illustration of differences between actual and PET-produced distribution functions for
any particular input simulation, Likewise, bar graphs or other graphical representations are
provided in some embodinents to illustrate error frequency or distribution as may be desired in
any particular environment of use,. In some further embodiments used in applications where
geographical distribution of errors may be of interest, color coded maps are produced showing,
based on determined simulation error magnitude, where simulation errors using the WPET
processing described above occur with particular magnitudes. Such graphical representations
may be helpful, for Instance, to determine that even though an occasional simulation error may
have a particularly high magnitude, ii is in a location that is of only modest interest (e.g, a rural
county rather than a major metropolitan area),
10077]      The discussion above included two WPET table formats, one based on occurrences
and the other with period numbers as the primary key, Those ski] led in the art will recognize
from the discussion above that additional formats may be desirable in other environments, as it
                                                   24

may be that a WPET in any particular implementation desirably includes a number of additional
columns, such as: Occurrence, Period, EventlD, FactorIndex,      ear, Day, and Weight.
[00781       In one embodiment, implementation of the WPET file is accomplished by dividing
the table into an 'indexbini file and a data,bin' file, The oindexbin' has three columns. The
implicit row number is Period, the first column (int2) is the beginning occurrence (zero-based)
for this period, the second column (int32) is number of occurrences in this period, and the third
column (double) is the period. The 'data.bin' has five columns. The implicit row number (zero
based) is Occurrence% the first column (int32) is 'Eventl[D% the second column is 'Year' the
third column (int32) is Day', and the fourth column (int22) is 'FactorIndex,
[0079]       An application of a WPET-based method for modeling terrorism events provides
another example of processing as disclosed herein. As discussed generally above,the weighted
period event table (WPET) is a representation of the stochastic event set to represent event sets in
a simulation platform, A single year WPET is essentially a collection of several realizations
(denoted periods in this document) of events that could happen over the next year. A multi-year
WPIET is a collection of several periods of events that could happen over the next six years. In
the WPET the different periods are not equiprobable, but rather have weights associated with
them (importance sampling). This is primarily done to ensure that both frequent and rare events
from the stochastic catalog can be captured in the WlET without having to use an excessive
number of periods (realizations). This document briefly summarizes the general WPET
generation methodology and describes in the detail the generation of the WPET for a
Probabilistic Terrorism Model (PTM),
 [0080]      The WPET is an approach used to generate a small catalog of events inchiding rare
events while preserving event rates. Essentially this approach involves the following steps:
                                                 25

            a) Set initial number of periods to N,
            b) Sample each event       *    ej times (where L 3 denotes the floor operator) and
               place them in these N periods. Essentially only events with rates exceeding 1/N
               are sampled,
            c) Assume that the sampled events recur every N periods (as discussed above),
            d) Update the event rates considering the events that have already been assigned.
               In other words, update event rates with their residual rates after assignment.
            e) If the updated event rates are all not below a pre-specifled threshold, double N.
            1) Repeat steps b through e until the updated (i~e, residual) event rates all fall
               below the threshold.
            g) Represent the assigned events in a compact structure using the periodicity of the
               assigned events (Le- if we know event 101. recurs every 5 periods starting from
               period 1, represent that using one event 101 in period I with a weight of 1/5),
PTM HAS A FEW UNIQUE AsPECTs NOT SHARED By OTHER TYPICAL CATASTROPHE MoDU'S.
            a) Terrorism events occur frequently in clusters of 1 or more attacks (e.g. 9/11,
               2005 London bombings). This issue is termed 'multiplicity' where attacks
               cluster together based on pre-defined cluster size probabilities, An attack
               cannot occur along with every other attack. Attacks that can cluster together
               have been pre-defined and identified by a parameter called 'high niode ID'.
            b) Terrorism event occurrences do not follow a Poisson distribution. After a
               terrorist event occurs, the rates for subsequent events reduce and the resulting
               frequency distribution is non-Poissonian.
                                              26

[0081]       The WPET generation methodology for PTM has to take into account the issues of
multiphicity and non-Poissonian frequencies. This section describes the methodology used to
generate a single year WPET for PTM. Much of the WPET generation methodology is similar to
that described in the previous section for natural catastrophe models. This section primarily
illuminates areas of differences,
Sten 1 l.ni tate the process
                 The WPET generation process is initiated with a starting number of periods (V,)
set to a reasonable value (e g, 10,000).
Step 2: Perform assignments for all higthmodessone       hade        a time
Step 2a: Determine attacks that belong to the high mode considered
[0082]       Only attacks belonging to a particular high mode can happen together as an event,
Hence, the rest of the steps described below only apply to the high mode considered. The steps
have to be repeated for all high modes, one high mode at a tirne
Stegp2b: Determine number of occurrences of each attack in N periods
                 The number of occurrences of attack a (N) is computed as
                  N =       N,j                                   (1)
                 where  LI denotes the floor operation, and yv denotes the rate of event a.
Step 2c: Determine the number of clusters (a.k.a. events/ event elustersl of various sizes
[00831       For the high mode considered, attacks happen in event clusters of various sizes as
defined by a pre-specified multiplicity distribution. This distribution provides the probabilities of
observing clusters of sizes I to 5. Using Equation 1, the total number of attacks happening in N
periods is calculable, and from that processing can separate them into clusters of sizes I to 5 based
on the multiplicity distribution. Denote the multiplicity distribution as
                                                  27

                  P(NV =j)     =M                                (2)
[0084]      where N is the number of attacks in a cluster, m; denotes the probability of observing a
cluster of sieJ, From Equation 2, it can be inferred that the number of clusters of size can be
expressed as nbk, where k is some constant. The total number of attacks is
                             N         k
                                                                   )
[0085]      From Equation I, it is also known that
                    Ctolff =Y        . v,%rJ                      (4)
[0086]      The value of k can be estimated using Equations 3 and 4, and the total number of
clusters of different sizes can be estimated as:
                     N'.       fluN(5N F     .I
[00871      The floor operators ensure integral numbers of events and clusters,
Step 2dfAssign attacks to event clusters
[0088]      The .N>,g attacks are placed into clusters based on the cluster counts estimated in
Eqination 5. This assignment is done randomly, For instance, each cluster of size is populated by
a random collection off attacks from the N'f,     attacks.
Step 2e: Assign events (a.k~a. clusters) to periods
[00891      The events need to be assigned to periods in accordance with the desired frequency
distribution. This assignment is done using the following idea of conditional assignments;
  tei       ssi nthe firstaedv           dtl  ovr N
                                                   28

Step (ii):iAssign the second and subsequent events conditioned on the first event assignment
Step (iia): Compute the probability of assignment for each period
[00901       Suppose the desired frequency model is defined as follows:
                        f(O) = 0.6,)             0t(2)= 0.15,'(3) =0,05.
[0091]       Each period in the WPET could have zero to three events based on this frequency
distribution. The probability that the event gets assigned to a period with x events is proportional
to the probability of exceeding x events. The event can be in any of the periods among this set of
periods with x events with uniform probability, The table below illustrates this for the above
mentioned example where the probability of an assignment to a set of periods with x previous
events in each period. For instance, the assignment probability corresponding to the set of periods
with 0 events equals P(0) = k*40, Given that the assignment happens to this set, if this set contains
NyA periods, the event can get assigned to any of these perods with uniform probability /o.       The
value of k is computed such that the probabilities sum up to I
                      0         *,40%
                              k*20%
                      2       k*5%
[00921       For instance, if N, is chosen as 10,00, the total number of assignments based on the
above frequency distribution equals 6,500. The table below shows the achieved frequencies after
assigning 6,500 occurrences to 10,000 periods using the above methodology,

[00931       Step (ib): Adjust the assignment probability for each period
it is possible to improve the match between the target and the achieved frequencies by further
constraining the assignments.        In N, periods, the expected number of periods with x events
equals:
                                  E(JN     =fk) Np0al                 (6)
100941       where Pp,   is the sum of the conditional probabilities of all the events in the catalog
(which is less than 1). A heuristic constraint is imposed that an event can be placed in a period
with Y1 events only if the number of periods with x events (denoted At) is less than the expected
number shown in Equation 6 [E(Nfl during that particular assignment. It is to be noted that this
constraint is evaluated during every assignment. Therefore, if at any pointt       -falsbelow E(N     )
it is acceptable to place this event in a period with x-I events, even if this constraint was not
satisfied during some prior assignment;
100951       Based on the above discussion, P(x), the assignment probability corresponding to the
set of periods with  x                              PT._
                       prior events, is set to 0 if R    > [E(Ntu)1.
100961       Step 3: Expand the size of the WPET if necessary Once the assignments are performed
for al the hiLh modes, the residual rates are computed for each attack. If any of the residual rates
exceeds a pre-specified threshold (e.g., le-9), Nv,is doubled. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until all
the residual rates fall below the threshold.
                                                     30

[0097J       There is complexity when expanding the size of the PET, When the initial size PET is
created, all periods have the same weight and when clusters are identified and their number of
occurrence, it is easy to assign them to different periods while satisfying the frequency distribution.
However, in the subsequent phases, different periods already have different weights and
assignment of clusters to each period should be done sequentially and at each step, the frequency
distribution should be compared to the target distribution, The following steps summarizes the
assignment of dusters to different periods when periods have different weights:
             1) assign a cluster to a period randomly
             2) check if that period or one or its virtual duplicates is available from previous
                phases
             3) if the period exists, update the periods weight and its sequence as well as adding
                the new period with the new cluster added to it in addition to what clusters where
                 available in that period before this phase, If it does not exist, create a new period
                 with the new cluster assigned to it
             4) update the frequency distributions
             5) update the list of periods in each frequency distribution bin which will be used in
                 each phase for cluster assignment
{0098        Generation of a multhyear WPET for PTM While the above section describes the
methodology to generate a single-year WPET, changes are necessary to generate a multi-year
WPET. The key Issue to be considered while generating a multi-year PET is the relationship
between events happening in one year to the other, Because counter-terrorism measures are
adopted following a terrorist event, the rates for subsequent events drop (e.g., impact of 9/1l).
                                                    31

This creates a dependence from one year to the other that needs to be explicitly accounted for.
This can be handled using the concept of conditional frequencies
100991      Conditional frequency is defined as the probability of observing a certain number of
events in a given year given the total number of events that have happened in prior years, i.e,
P(     = xj L       /N
                    N   , where. N, is the number of events in year m. In subsequent sections.
this conditional frequency is denotedf4NpreV=g) A sample table of conditional frequencies is
shown below from information provided by Dr. Gordon Woo.

[00100      The WPET generation methodology needs to sample events following. the conditional
probabilities defined by the above table. The first year WPET is generated as discussed in the
above section. For any subsequent year, the WPET generation methodology needs to reflect the
following changes:
                                                 32

1001011     During years 2 and above, the event rates will be lower than what is used for year 1,
This is because of the reduction in the event frequencies following even occurrences in year L
The new event rates can be quantified as shown below:

        where     A, and A are the adjusted and unadjusted rates of event i respectively. The goal is
now to match these adjusted rates during the WPET assignment rather than the unadjusted rates.
Assin events (a.k.a. clusters) to Periods
Assignment probability computation
                                                                     33

1001021     The previous section illustrated how assignment probabilities are calculated for
assigning events to periods based on the number of events already assigned to the period, Now the
assignment probability calculation has to take into account the events assigned to that period in the
current year and in all previous years. The conditional frequency table essentially assists in
calculating the conditional assignment probabilities as described above. Suppose in period i, the
sum of the assignments in years I and 2 is N;, the relevant conditional probabilities for the number
of events in year 3, denoted N, are obtained as(NjN6. The first step in calculating the
assignment probabilities is getting the joint conditional frequencyf4N+Ni|NM)      This can be done
directly using the conditional frequencies. The corresponding assignment probabilities,
P(N'+;N,) are obtained as described above. The probabilities we are interested in for simulation
purposes are the unconditional probabilities which are obtained as P(Ni+NaN9)
      P(NAN,)P (N,, where P(N) can be empirically estimated as the proportion of periods with N!
prior events. Finally, the unconditional assignment probabilities are normalized so that they add
up to I.
Assignment probability adjustment
{00103]     The earlier section illustrated how the assignment probabilities need to be adjusted
based on the constraint that A1     <[E(Ng)] for achieving a good frequency distribution match,
A similar adjustment needs to be performed for the multi-year case as well.
Of N, periods, the expected number of periods with a specific (NN M1)equals
                  E(NYi          )=    (N  + N21N)     PAPQ,           (8)
where f N 4 Ni|N)          denotes the conditional frequency of N+V, given N, P(N              is the
proportion of periods with N, prior assignments and P'w is the sum of the conditional
probabilities. A set of periods with event counts (V,+NN) is considered for event assignment
                                                  34

only if E(NA'          I   )> I              where No y         is the number of periods with event
counts (NQ prior, N+N        l currentprior) The assignment probability for this period set is set
to zero if this constraint is not satisfied,
Event aan       ent
[001041      For event assignment, a set of periods with event counts (N,A4VN) is first chosen in
proportion to?  P    + N), and the event is placed in a period randomly chosen from this set,
[00105]      Once WPET is created with the methodology explained above based on the conditional
frequenxy distributions of each year, the single year WPETs are combined into a single multi-year
WPET. The challenge in combining years of different WPEITs is that each one of these WPETs
has a different number of simulations and also each simulation period has a different weight.
When two WPETs are combined to create a multi-year WPET, the number of simulations should
be the same and also the years that are combined together should have the same weight. This
means that even if a WPET for the first year and second year both had the same number of periods
one cannot merely be put after the other to create the WPET for 2 years of simulations, since their
weighs do not match.
[001061      To overcome this issue, the following approach is used in one embodiment for any two
given single year WPETs, For simplicity, the discussion explains the combination of two single
year WPETs into one 2-year WPET, but the same approach can be expanded to any number of
years by combining the resulting multi-year WPET with a new single year WPET,
             1, Loop over the periods of the WIET for the first year
             2, Compare the weight of the first period from WPET I to the first period from
                 WPET 2
                                                  35

            3. Break the period which has higher weight into two periods such that the first new
                period has the same weight as the weight of the period from the other WPET.
            4. Combine the first periods of WPET I and WPET 2 and create a 2-year period
            5    Remove the first periods from the individual WPETs and continue the process
                 until alt periods of the WPET I are added to the multi-year WPET.
            6, Add all the remang periods of WPET 2 to the multi-year WPET for these
                 periods, no event has occurred in the first year.
