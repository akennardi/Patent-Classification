                   ROAD OR RAILWAY TRACK CLEANER
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]      The present invention generally relates to apparatus and methods for removing
unwanted material from a road, railway track and/or other open spaces.
BACKGROUND
[0002]      As a way of example, it is common for coal to build up on rail track on and
around rail departure routes at coal terminals. The coal deposits are typically from spillage
from coal train wagons, particularly both after they have been filled and after they have
been emptied.    This spillage has been shown to contribute to coal dust pollution and to
premature failure of rail clips due to acidic corrosion when the coal deposits become wet.
[0003]      Similarly, in the same or other locations, other material such as sand, iron ore,
vegetation and any loose bulk spillage or other debris may collect on and around roads and
railway tracks, also impeding traffic flow.     Spillage on the road or railway track can be
anywhere on the network and can come from the wagon loads via spillage or derailment,
spillage from trucks or from the environment, such as wind blown sand.
[0004]      Currently, the road and rail industries typically relies on mobile industrial
vacuum trucks to remove the spilled coal or other material.            This process is often
problematic and unsuitable. The present invention seeks to provide an alternative device
and method for removing unwanted materials from a road or railway track, such as but not
limited to coal.

derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as, an
acknowledgement or admission or any form of suggestion that prior publication (or
information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0029]       The following modes, given by way of example only, are described in order to
provide a more precise understanding of the subject matter of a preferred embodiment or
embodiments.
[0030]       In the Figures, incorporated to illustrate features of an example embodiment,
like reference numerals are used to identify like parts throughout the Figures.
[0031]       Referring to Figures 6 and 7, there is depicted a collection apparatus 10 that
can be used for removing material from a railway track 12. The collection apparatus 10
includes a collection unit 15 configured to be detachably connected to a vehicle 11. The
collection unit 15 is configured to sweep and collect material from the railway track 12 and
transfer the material to a collection outlet 16.
[0032]       The collection apparatus 10 also includes a conveyor unit 18 configured to
accept material from the collection outlet 16 at a conveyor inlet 20 and transfer the
material to a conveyor outlet 21.        The conveyor outlet 21 is movable relative to the
collection outlet 16, as will be described in more detail below.

[0033]           Throughout this specification, the term "railway track" generally relates to the
rails on which a train or other vehicle rolls, but also includes any supporting structure, such
as but not limited to sleepers, fasteners such as clips, and/or foundations such as ballast,
concrete and/or other suitable materials. The railway track 12 shown in Figure 6 and 7
includes rails 22, clips (not shown) and sleepers 23.
[0034]           The vehicle 11 may take the form of any suitable road-rail vehicle, sometimes
referred to as a hi-rail vehicle.           In the embodiment shown, the vehicle 11 provides the
propulsion and power sources. The vehicle 11 shown is a standard wheel loader, modified
with creep transmission equipment where arms 17 that would typically have a bucket or
similar tool attached are instead connected to the collection unit 15.
[0035]           This loader includes hi-rail wheels 13 to help guide the vehicle II along the
track 12, in addition to standard drive wheels 14 that provide propulsion to the vehicle 11
and therefore the full assembly. The vehicle 11 can alternatively be replaced with other
prime movers such as excavators.
[0036]           The vehicle 11 also includes a hydraulic connection to the apparatus 10, to
provide a power source for operation of the collection apparatus 10.               In alternative
embodiments, various other connections between the vehicle 11 and apparatus 10 to
provide power may be used in addition or in the alternative to the hydraulic connection,
such as but not limited to electric or pneumatic connections.
[0037]           While the vehicle 11 is described as a standard loader or other standard
machine, any vehicle 11 that is used needs a creep transmission circuit fitted to divert the
hydraulic flow to the connection to the apparatus 10, away from the normal drive
transmission of the vehicle. Such a diversion system allows maximum torque at low travel
speed. That is, the maximum cleaning ability and power to the apparatus 10 is provided at
slow speed.
[0038]           The collection unit 15 will now be described in more detail.       Referring to
Figures 1-5, the collection unit 15 is configured to be supported on the track 12 by two rail
wheels 25.         Only two wheels 25 are required as the apparatus 10 is balanced by the

                                             -6
connection to the vehicle 11 at a coupling 26. It will be appreciated that the collection unit
 15 can be modified to be used for any gauge of track 12, subject to local track clearance
regulations.
[0039]       In the embodiment shown, the coupling 26 is configured in the same manner as
a standard loader bucket attachment, to enable connection to standard loaders or similar
standard equipment. It will be appreciated, however, that this connection may also take
alternative forms.
[0040]       With reference in particular to Figure 5, the collection unit includes a rotating
brush 30 with a central member 31 to which brushes 32 are attached. In the embodiment
shown the brushes 32 are sections of rubber tufts, as typically used in ballast regulators,
however in alternative embodiments a wide range of other materials may be used to form
the brushes 32.
[0041]       The brush 30 is configured to sweep the track 12 and can be raised or lowered
as necessary by raising or lowering of the coupling 26. In the assembly shown in Figure 6,
for example, this is achieved by the arms of the vehicle attachment 17 being hydraulically
moved up and down via a joy stick control in an operator's cabin that forms part of the
vehicle 11.
[0042]       The rotating of the brush 30 forces material from the track 12 into the housing
34 of the collecting unit 15. The sweeping unit 15 operates by rotating the brush 30 in a
direction so that the brush elements 32 when close to the track 12 move in a forward
direction.   That is, a counter-clockwise direction when viewed as in Figure 5.          Such
rotation of the brush 30 sweeps material from the track 12 up through a receiving port 35.
[0043]       The housing 34 includes tapered sides 36 that then direct the material to a
collection conveyor 38 situated along a lower side of the collection unit 15. The collection
conveyor 38 carries the collected material to an upper rear portion of the collection unit 15
where it falls down to the collection outlet 16.
[0044]       A hopper 40 allows for a temporary buildup of material in a situation where
material is being delivered to the outlet 16 faster than the conveyor unit 18 is transporting

the material away. However, it is not anticipated that such a situation would occur when
operating under normal conditions, as the conveyor speeds are synchronised, taking into
account the respective belt areas and volumetric flows.
[0045]           The brush 30 is driven by a motor 42 that is connected to a drive 43 that
connects the motor 42 to the brush 30. The drive 43 may be in the form of one or more
belts, gears or other suitable drive transfer means, and may involve a gearing ratio or may
directly drive the brush 30. The collection conveyor 38 is driven by a separate motor 44.
[0046]           The conveyor unit 18 is connected to and at least partially supported at a lower
end by the collection unit 15, and therefore the wheels 25 of the collection unit 15. This
connection includes pins 45 that pivotally mount brackets 46 of the conveyor unit 18 to a
plate 47 of the collection unit 15. The plate 47 is rotatably attached to the hopper 40 by a
swivel coupling 48, which allows the conveyor unit 18 to rotate relative to the collection
unit 15.
[0047]           The conveyor unit 18 is also supported by hydraulic arms 50. The hydraulic
arms 50 are connected at a lower end to brackets 52 mounted to the middle of the conveyor
unit 18 and at an upper end to a swivel 53 that is mounted to the housing 34.
[0048]           The hydraulic arms 50 can be used to raise and lower an upper end of the
conveyor unit 18, with the pins 45 permitting rotation of the lower end relative to the
collection unit 15.             This movement is illustrated in Figure 3, for example, where the
conveyor unit 18 is shown in an upper position while simultaneously shown in broken
lines in a lower position.
[0049]           Meanwhile, the swivel 53 simultaneously allows rotation of the conveyor unit
18 and therefore lateral movement of the upper end of the conveyor unit 18, while the
lower end is permitted to pivot relative to the collection unit 15 by the swivel coupling 48.
[0050]           Referring now to Figures 8 to 12B, the conveyor unit 18 includes two
individual conveyors, a first conveyor 56 and a second conveyor 57. The first conveyor 56
is coupled substantially parallel to and above the second conveyor 57, so that material

       R~caghnen
       ven\R~orbl\DC\CA\!645554   -703/2018

carried on and ejected from an upper end of the first conveyor 56 falls onto the second
conveyor 57.
[0051]           Referring to Figures 12A and 12B, the first conveyor 56 includes a belt 60 that
rotates about a series of rollers 61 and is driven by a motor 62 (see Figure 8). Similarly,
the second conveyor 57 includes a belt 65 that rotates about a series of rollers 66 and is
driven by a motor 67 (see Figure 9).
[0052]           The conveyor unit 18 is extendable so that the distance from the conveyor inlet
20 to the conveyor outlet 21 is adjustable. Figure 12A shows the conveyor unit 18 in an
extended configuration while Figure 12B shows the conveyor unit 18 in a retracted
configuration. Movement between these positions is achieved using a hydraulic cylinder
70 that is mounted at one end to a first conveyor mount 71 and at the other end to a second
conveyor mount 72.
[0053]           Referring to Figure 13, the second conveyor 57 is slidably mounted inside a
conveyor unit frame 75 that houses the first conveyor 56 and to which the mount brackets
46, 52 and various other components are fixed.          A guide rail 77 that forms part of the
second conveyor 57 sits within the conveyor unit frame 75 and can slide along low friction
pads 78, such as pads made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or Teflonm.
[0054]           Referring to Figures 11 A and 11B, the frame 75 includes guide plates 80 that
are fixed above and inside each edge of the belt 60 of the first conveyor 56. Similarly,
with reference to Figure 1 IC, brackets 82 connect guide plates 83 to the guide rail 77 of
the second conveyor 57, such that the guide plates 83 are fixed above and inside each edge
of the belt 65.
[0055]           The sweeping unit 15 is designed to collect unwanted material from the
railway track 12, or other surface to be cleaned, and transfer it continuously during use via
the conveyor unit 18 to a bin being towed or driven in front of the apparatus 10. The
adjustment of the conveyor outlet 21 position as previously described allows the use of a
range of different bin vehicles to be used as may be available in a given situation.

[0056]           Further, movement of the conveyor outlet 21 in a lateral direction also allows
transfer of material to a bin driven on a separate track or road located adjacent the
apparatus 10. In yet other embodiments, the apparatus 10 may include a storage means to
temporarily store the material, such as in the hopper 40, before transferring to a bin in bulk
only at particular times.
[0057]           The various degrees of freedom of the conveyor unit 18 as described above
also allow it to be positioned within a kinetic envelope of the machine 10 whilst in a
transport or travelling mode, before then being rotated, extended and/or lifted whilst in a
brushing or sweeping mode.
[0058]           The apparatus 10 is powered by the vehicle 11 to which it is detachably
connected. This connection may be via an adapter plate in some embodiments, so that the
apparatus 10 can be easily disconnected.           Such an adapter plate includes appropriate
features to enable this to easily occur, including hydraulic and/or electric coupling points.
[0059]           The rotating brush 30 and conveyors 38, 56, 57 are powered by a proportional
hydraulic pump and motors. Preferably, this is achieved by a single hydraulic connection
that then separately drives the various motors 42, 44, 62, 67, hydraulic cylinders 50, 70,
and any other devices, motors or actuators that may be included on the apparatus 10.
[0060]           Each of the various components just described are controlled from the cabin of
the vehicle 11 in the preferred embodiment, however alternative embodiments may involve
different control inputs.
[0061]           The apparatus 10 further includes a dust suppression system integrated to the
collection unit 15. This may take the form of a sprinkler system located inside the housing
34, or any other suitable system as will be understood by those skilled in the art.
[0062]           Dust suppression is extremely important when the apparatus 10 is used for
collecting materials such as coal, where dust created from the material can be a health
hazard. The dust suppression system is integrated into the collection unit 15 and optionally
also the conveyor unit 18, as dust can be created at a number of different locations in the
path of the collected material.

[0063]           The dust suppression is achieved in a preferred embodiment by pumping water
stored in a tank through a misting nozzle manifold using an electric pump and a flow
control valve. The nozzle manifold is located across the receiving port 35 of the collection
unit 15. Nozzles may also be placed at the hopper 40 and/or outlet 16, or near the swivel
coupling 48.
[0064]           Optionally, a feed grate may be incorporated in the housing 34 to limit
ingestion of ballast rock or other large items. The rotating brush 30 incorporates a rotation
speed control and raise lower function via cabin joystick controller as described above.
[0065]           The apparatus 10 aims to rip, loosen, brush and collect unwanted railway track
material build up in a controlled dust free operation.        The apparatus 10 is configured to
remain within statutory kinetic envelope dimensions for rail vehicles.
[0066]           The machine 10 is designed to predominately remove coal, however it is not
limited to this material. Other example materials that may be collected and removed using
the machine include, but are not limited to, iron ore, other mining products, sand,
vegetation, general garbage and any loose bulk spillage or other debris.
[0067]           The machine 10 is fitted with lighting, emergency stops, fire extinguishers, and
appropriate guarding and signage compliant to the relevant standards, such as ARTC and
AS standards.
[0068]           The preferred embodiment has been described as an unpowered unit that is
connected to a standard, existing powered unit to provide propulsion and a power source.
This enables the apparatus 10 to be compact and cheaper than a dedicated, stand-alone
machine. Any vehicle or prime mover used has to be able to deliver sufficient power and
torque to drive the brush 35 and all of the conveyors 38, 56, 57, whilst simultaneously
being able to move in the required direction along the road, rail or other surface. It will be
appreciated, however, that the apparatus 10 could also be designed to include its own
propulsion and/or power supply.

[0069]           The embodiment described herein collects material from the track 12 by
sweeping the track 12, however in an alternative embodiment there may also be included a
vacuum system to assist the sweeping and collection function of the apparatus 10.
[0070]           While the embodiments described herein have related to an apparatus for use
on a railway track, it is also envisaged that it should not be restricted to railway track, but
rather some simple modifications would mean it can be used for large road and/or flat
surface areas such as fields or parking lots.          Such modifications would also allow the
apparatus to be used as a mobile loose bulk pick up and loading system, such as for grain,
for example. Other modifications would also allow for use with single rail track systems
by not engaging the hi rail system.
[0071]           While the embodiments described herein all used conveyors for transferring
the collected material, it will be appreciated that alternative devices could be used in place
of one or more of the conveyors. For example, an auger or screw conveyor could be used
in place of the collection conveyor 38 to deliver the material to the collection outlet 16.
[0072]           Whilst the present invention has been described with reference to particular
embodiments, it will be understood that many modifications will be apparent to those
skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications should be considered to fall within
the scope of the invention as broadly described and as claimed below.
[0073]           In the foregoing description of preferred embodiments, specific terminology
has been resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be
limited to the specific terms so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific term
includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a
similar technical purpose. Terms such as "front" and "rear", "inner" and "outer", "above"
and "below", "upper" and "lower" and the like are used as words of convenience to
provide reference points and are not to be construed as limiting terms.
