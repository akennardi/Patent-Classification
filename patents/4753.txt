                           BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
                                   Field of the Invention
 [0001] The inventive subject matter relates to an immunogenic composition capable of
 conferring protection against diarrhea caused by Campylobacterjejuniand a method of
 inducing an immune response against C. jejuni using the immunogenic composition.
                                Description of Related Art
 [0002] Campylobacterjejuniis estimated to cause 2.5 million cases annually in the
 United States and >400 million cases worldwide. In developing countries C. jejuni is,
 like ETEC, primarily a pediatric disease. The symptoms of campylobacter enteritis
 include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and sometimes vomiting. Stools usually contain

                                               2
 mucus, fecal leukocytes and blood, although watery diarrhea is also observed. The
 disease is zoonotic, and wild and domesticated birds represent a major reservoir. C.
jejuni is a major foodborne infection, most often being associated with contaminated
 poultry, but major outbreaks have been associated with water or raw milk contamination
 (44). C. jejuni is also associated with Reiter's syndrome and inflammatory bowel
 syndrome, but the major complication of C. jejuni enteritis is Guillain-Barr6 Syndrome
 (GBS), a post-infectious polyneuropathy that can result in paralysis (Allos, B.M., J.
 Infect. Dis 176 (Suppl 2):S125-128 (1997)). The association is due to molecular
 mimicry between the sialic acid containing-outer core of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS)
 and human gangliosides (Moran, et al., J. Endotox. Res. 3: 521 (1996)). Thus,
 antibodies generated against LOS cores result in an autoimmune response to human
 neural tissue.
 [0003] C. jejuni capsular moieties are important in serodetermination. However, despite
 over 47 Penner serotypes of C. jejuni having been identified, most Campylobacter
 diarrheal disease is caused by C. jejuni expressing only a limited number of serotypes.
 Therefore, only selected strains of C. jejuni, predicated on epidemiological studies,
 provides suitable candidate strains for development of vaccine compositions. However,
 despite the importance of this organism to human disease, there are no licensed vaccines
 against C. jejuni.
[0002] LOS synthesis in Campylobacter is controlled by a number of genes, including
genes encoding enzymes involved in biosynthesis of sialic acid for incorporation into
LOS. Thus, C. jejuni is one of a limited number of bacteria that can endogenously
synthesize sialic acid, a 9 carbon sugar that is found in many mammalian cells. This is

                                               3
consistent with the observed molecular mimicry of LOS and human gangliosides
important in GBS (Aspinall, et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 213: 1029 (1993); Aspinall, et al.,
Infect. Immun. 62: 2122-2125 (1994); Aspinall, et al., Biochem., 33: 241 (1994);
Salloway et al., Infect. Immun., 64: 2945 (1996)).
[0003] An interesting recent revelation regarding the Campylobacter genome sequence
was the presence of a complete set of capsule transport genes similar to those seen in type
11/111 capsule loci in the Enterobactericeae(Parkhill et al., Nature, 403: 665 (2000);
Karlyshev et al., Mol. Microbiol., 35: 529 (2000)). Subsequent genetic studies in which
site-specific mutations were made in several capsule transport genes indicated that the
capsule was the serodeterminant of the Penner serotyping scheme (Karlyshev et al., Mol.
Microbiol., 35: 529 (2000)). The Penner scheme (or HS for heat stable) is one of two
major serotyping schemes of campylobacters and was originally thought to be based on
lipopolysaccharide 0 side chains (Moran and Penner, J. Appl. Microbiol., 86: 361
(1999)). Currently it is believed that the structures previously described as 0 side chains
are, in fact, capsules.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0004] The inventive composition relates to an immunogenic composition comprising
polysaccharide antigens comprising isolated capsule polysaccharides from a
Campylobacterjejunistrain, linked to form polysaccharide polymers. The
polysaccharides are isolated from lipooligosaccharide structures and other structures
associated with Guillain Barr6 Syndrome or autoimmune disorders. The embodied
composition comprises one or more polysaccharide antigens each comprising isolated

                                              4
polysaccharides from the C. jejuni strains selected from the group consisting of HS1,
HS1/HS44, HS44, HS2, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS13, HS4/13/64, and HS50.
[0005] Another embodiment is a method of inducing an immune response by
administering an immunogenic composition comprising one or more polysaccharide
antigens with each antigen comprising an isolated polysaccharides or polysaccharide
polymer derived from a C. jejuni strain where the C. jejuni strains are selected from the
group consisting of: HS1, HS1/HS44, HS44, HS, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS13, HS4/13/64, and
HS50. The composition is devoid of lipooligosaccharide structures and other structures
associated with Guillain Barr6 Syndrome or other autoimmune disorders.
[0006] Another embodiment is a method of immunizing against C. jejuni strains HS4,
HS13, HS4/13/64 and HS50 by administering one or more antigens, wherein each
antigen comprises an isolated polysaccharide or polysaccharide polymers derived from a
C. jejuni strain selected from the group consisting of HS4, HS13, HS4/13/64 and HS50.
[0007] Another embodiment is a method of immunizing against C. jejuni strains HS1,
HS1/HS44, HS44 by administering one or more antigens, wherein each antigen
comprises an isolated polysaccharide or polysaccharide polymer derived from a C. jejuni
strain selected from the group consisting of C. jejuni strains HS4, HS13, HS4/13/64.

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0008] The term "polysaccharide antigen" as used herein refers to a capsule
polysaccharide derived from Campylobacterjejuni(C. jejuni or Campylobacterjejuni)
capsule. As used, herein, each polysaccharide antigen comprises a polysaccharide or

                                              8
 polysaccharide polymer derived from one C. jejuni strain. The inventive composition
 can be comprised of multiple polysaccharide antigens. As used herein, "polysaccharide"
 refers to two or more monosaccharide units composing a carbohydrate polymer molecule.
 A "polysaccharide polymer" refers to two or more polysaccharide molecules connected
 together. As used herein, "n" in the polysaccharide structure refers to the number of
 polysaccharide repeats in the polymer and is 1 or more and can be up to 100.
 [0009] An embodiment of the current invention comprises polysaccharide antigens
 comprising a polysaccharide or polysaccharide polymer derived from the capsule of a C.
jejuni strain. The strains from which the capsule polysaccharides are isolated are selected
 from the group consisting of HSI, HS1/HS44, HS44, HS2, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS13,
 HS4/13/64, and HS50. A capsule polysaccharide polymer comprises I to 100 copies of a
 polysaccharide structure, derived from an individual C. jejuni strain, connected together
 to form a polysaccharide polymer. The inventive immunogenic composition one or
 more polysaccharide antigens with each polysaccharide antigen comprising an isolated C.
jejuni polysaccharide structure or polysaccharide polymer from a C. jejuni strain. The
 polysaccharides are isolated or purified away from lipooligosaccharide, or other
 structures associated with GBS or other autoimmune disorders.
 [0010] A large number of the C. jejuni strains are identified. An embodiment of the
 current invention includes only capsule polysaccharides derived from C. jejuni strains,
 which have been shown to result in disease in humans.

                Example 1: HSJ/HS44 and HS44 polysaccharidestructure
[0011] Vaccine strategies against C. jejuni have been largely limited due to the molecular
mimicry between lipooligosaccharide (LOS ) cores of many strains of C. jejuni and
human gangliosides (Moran, et al., J. Endotox. Res., 3: 521 (1996). This mimicry is
thought to be a major factor in the strong association of C. jejuni infection with Guillain
Barre Syndrome (GBS), a post-infectious polyneuropathy (Allos, J. Infect. Dis.,
176(Suppl.): S125-128 (1997)). Thus, antibodies generated against LOS cores result in
an autoimmune response to human neural tissue. It has been estimated that as many as
1/3000 cases of campylobacter enteritis results in GBS. Therefore, the possibility of
developing GBS could be associated with any whole cell vaccine against C. jejuni that
includes ganglioside mimicry.
[0012] Recent development of a molecular CPS typing system re-enforced the strong
correlation between CPS and Penner types (Poly, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 49: 1750
(2011)). Both Penner serotyping and molecular CPS typing have revealed the
predominance of a handful of CPS types worldwide. Among CPS types, the HS1
complex is one of the most common, accounting for 8.2% of C. jejuni induced diarrhea
worldwide ((Poly, et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 49: 1750 (2011); Pike, et al., plOs One 8:
e67375 (2013)). This complex is composed of HS1 and HS44 types, and strains can
serotype as HS1, HS44 or HS1/44. So far, only the CPS structure of the HS1 type strain
has been described, which is composed of repeating units composed of 4-substituted a-D
galactose (Gal) and glycerol (Gro) linked by phosphate (P) in a teichoic acid-like
structure [-4)-a-D-Galp-(1-2)-Gro-(1-P-]n (Aspinall, et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 216: 880
(1993)). The HS1 CPS backbone may be decorated by P-D-fructofuranoses (Fru)

                                                 10
 branches, at C-2 and C-3 of the Gal unit, which in turn may be decorated at C-3 with
 MeOPN (Fig. 1; (McNally, et al., FEBS J. 272: 4407 (2005)). Both the fructofuranose
 branches and MeOPN are found in non-stoichiometric amounts, presumably due to phase
 variation at homopolymeric tracts of bases in the genes encoding their respective
 transferases (McNally, et al., FEBS J. 272: 4407 (2005)). The ~15 kb HS1 CPS locus
 encoding eleven genes for the synthesis of this polysaccharide (BX545859) is the
 smallest CPS locus identified to date in C. jejuni (Karlyshev, et al., Appl. Environ.
 Microbiol. 71: 4004 (2005))(Fig. 1).
 [0013] The HS1 type strain used was MSC57360 and the HS44 strain (ATCC 43463)
 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)(Manassas, VA). C.
jejuni strain CG98-U-77 was isolated from a diarrhea case from Thailand and was
 obtained from the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS). C.
jejuni strains were routinely cultured at 37'C under microaerobic conditions (5%     02, 10%
 C02,  and 85% N2 ) on Mueller Hinton (MH) agar plates, supplemented with the
 appropriate antibiotic, if required. E. coli strains were grown in LB media supplemented
 with the appropriate antibiotics.
 [0014] C. jejuni genomic DNA was extracted from 16 hour cultures. Sequencing of the
 CPS loci was performed as previously described (Karlyshev, et al., Mol. Microbiol. 55:
 90 (2005); Poly, et al. J. Clin. Microbiol. 49: 1750 (2011); , Karlyshev, et al., Gene 522:
 37 (2013)).
 [0015] The CPS was extracted from cells by hot water-phenol extraction for 2 hours at
 70 'C. The aqueous layer was dialyzed (1000 Da) against water followed by
 ultracentrifugation to separate the CPS from the LOS. The supernatant material

                                               I1
containing the CPS was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G50) for
further purification to yield the intact CPSs.
[0016] Determination of monosaccharide composition was performed using a procedure
amenable to the alditol acetate method (Chen, et al., Carbohydr. Res. 343: 1034 (2008))
with the alditol acetates being analyzed in a ThermoFinnigan POLARIS TM -Q (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Inc, Waltham, MA) gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS)
using a DB- 17 capillary column. The sugar linkage types were characterized by
characterization of the permethylated alditol acetates by GC/MS as previously described
(Chen, et al., Carbohydr. Res. 343: 1034 (2008)). The NMR experiments were
performed on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Corporation, Billeria, MA)
equipped with a Bruker cryo platform at 295 K with deuterated trimethylsilyl propanoic
acid and orthophosphoric acid as external standards.
[0017] The variable region containing the genes for synthesis of the polysaccharide are
located between the conserved genes encoding the ABC transporter involved in capsule
synthesis and assembly (FIG. 1), which also shows the variable region of the HSI CPS
locus (McNally, et al., FEBS J. 272: 4407 (2005)). The DNA sequence of the capsule
locus of the HS44 type strain contained homologs of 10 of the 11 genes found in HS1,
missing only HS 1.08, a gene of unknown function (FIG. 1). The gene content of HS44
capsule biosynthesis locus is summarized in Table 1. All shared homologs were >96%
identical, except for the putative MeOPN transferase (HS44.07) which showed only 47%
identity to that of HSI.

[0018] The HS44 locus included an insertion of 10 additional genes between HS1.07 and
HS1.09 encompassing 9,258 bp (Table 1, FIG. 1). These include 4 genes encoding

                                              13
enzymes predicted to be involved in deoxyheptose biosynthesis (HS44.08 to HS44.1 1)
and three genes (HS44.12, HS44.13 and HS44.15) encoding proteins that are homologous
to epimerase reductases that have been recently demonstrated to be involved in 6-deoxy
altro-heptose biosynthesis. The CPS locus of HS44 also includes a gene (HS44.14)
similar to CJ1429c coding for a protein of unknown function in NCTC 11168 (HS2), a
nucleotidyl-sugar pyranose mutase (HS44.16) and a putative heptosyltansferase
(HS44.17, Table 1 and FIG. 1). In contrast, the DNA sequence of the variable CPS
locus of a clinical isolate that typed as HS1/44 was identical with that of the type strain of
HS 1. The minimum protein homology predicted from the 11 genes in these two capsule
loci was >99%.
[0019] Fine structural analysis revealed that the polysaccharide structure of HSl/44 is
similar to that of the previously described teichoic acid capsule polysaccharide (CPS) of
HSI strain (Aspinall, McDonald et al. 1993, McNally, Jarrell et al. 2005): ->4)
[MeOPN->3)-p-D-Fru-(1->]-a-Gal-(1->2)-Gro-(1->P-> (FIG. 2).
[0020] FIG. 3 shows the phosphorous-proton connections detected in HS 1/44 CPS that
emanate from the linkages of the teichoic-acid diester-phosphate (6 p 0.5 and 1.5) to
position 1 of Gro and position 4 of Gal, and from the attachment of the MeOPN (6 p 14.3)
to position 3 (6 H4.83) of Fru residues. The H-4 resonance of the 4-linked Gal carrying
the Fru branches appeared at 6 4.68, whereas that of the defructosylated 4-linked Gal
resonated at 6 4.49 (FIG. 3). A similar pattern was observed for the H-I resonances of
Gro. Simultaneous analysis of the HS1 type strain and HS 1/44 CPSs, suggested that the
HS 1/44 CPS contained a lower degree of fructosylation, as judged by the lower

                                               14
intensities of the 2,3,4-trisubstituted Gal linkage (GC-MS) and MeOPN resonance (3 P
NMR).
[0021] Analysis of HS44 CPS material identified two distinct polysaccharide capsule
structures. One CPS was analogous to the aforementioned teichoic-acid CPS of HS1 and
HS 1/44 (FIG. 2), but in which no MeOPN-containing Fru branches were observed. The
second CPS was rich in heptoses, being composed of repeating blocks of 6-deoxy
galacto-heptose(6d-gal-Hep), 6-deoxy-altro-heptose (6d-altro-Hep) and, in lesser
amounts, 6-deoxy-3-0-methyl-altro-heptose (6d-altro-3-0-Me-Hepf). The heptose
configurations were characterized by comparison with well defined synthetic standards
by GC. The linkage-type analysis (GC-MS) (FIG. 4A) revealed that the deoxy-heptoses
were present in part as terminal and 2-substituted units in the furanose form.
[0022] Accompanying NMR studies (FIG. 4B) confirmed the presence of deoxy
heptoses (6 H 1.5 - 2.0) and revealed that these units were present in the a anomeric
configuration ( 6 P 5.15 - 5.42). A new MeOPN moiety ( 6p 14.0), different from that
expressed by HS1 and HS 1/44 was associated with HS44 CPS material. This is
consistent with the divergence of the putative MeOPN transferase observed in this strain.
[0023] The product of the HS1.08 gene encodes a predicted protein of 849 amino acids,
annotated as a putative sugar transferase (Karlysheev, et al., Mol. Microbiol. 55: 90
(2005)). Because the HS44 teichoic acid-like CPS lacked the non-stoichiometric fructose
branch and the HS1.08 gene was missing from the capsule locus, we hypothesized that
HS 1.08 encoded a fructose transferase. A mutant in this gene expressed a lower MW
capsule as on an Alcian blue stained gel and the MW was restored to that of wildtype in
the complement as shown by gel; NMR analysis also confirmed complementation, but

                                            15
the lower intensity of the MeOPN resonance in the "1P NMR (FIG. 5B) suggested that
complementation in this case was partial. Thus, HS 1.08 appears to encode a transferase
that can transfer Fru to Gal.
[0024] Gene HS1.09 was annotated as a putative CDP glycerol transferase (Karlyshev et
al., 2005). Mutation of this gene in HS1 resulted in the loss of CPS as detected by Alcian
blue staining of an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 5A). Gel analysis of the complement of the
mutant showed a faint CPS band (Fig. 5A), but restoration of CPS expression was
                   31
confirmed by the     P NMR spectrum which indicated the presence of MeOPN (Fig. 5B).

with a repeating polysaccharide structure, derived from HS44 that comprises the

[0026] Upon treatment of Campylobacterjejunistrain PG 3588 (HS: 1) capsule
polysaccharide (CPS) with mild acetic acid (5%), the fructose (Fruf) side branches and
their accompanying MeOPN units were removed. The 'H NMR of the defructosylated
CPS showed the anomeric resonance at 6 5.21that corresponds to the a-D-Gal residue
(without the Fruf substitutions). H5 6 4.18 was assigned from the H6 6 3.75 proton
resonance, Gro resonances were found to be at H1/1'6 4.05/4.12, H2 6 3.98, and H3/3'

4.05, 4.11/ 6pl.1 4 ) which confirmed the presence of the phosphodiester and its
attachment to the Gro and to the C4 of Gal through a phosphodiester. Another resonance
was detected in the 2D 'H- 3 1P HMBC at 6 14.04 for a MeOPN moiety, and it showed a
cross peak at 6 H3.75/6p 14.04, identifying the attachement of MeOPN at the C-6 of Gal.

[0029] Results from monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that the capsule
polysaccharide (CPS) of strain CG2995 (HS:5) contained 3,6-dideoxy-ribo-heptose,
glucitol, and D-glycero-D-manno-heptose (FIG. 6). Multiple linkages of each residue
were observed; terminal 3,6-dideoxy-ribo-heptose, 2,6-disubstituted Glucitol, 2,3,6
trisubstituted Glucitol, 2-monosubstituted D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 2,6-disubstituted
D-glycero-D-manno-heptose,2,7-disubstituted D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, and 2,6,7
trisubstituted D-glycero-D-manno-heptose.
[0030] The ID 'H NMR of the CPS revealed six anomeric peaks, three of which are
associated with D-glycero-D-manno-heptose residues at 5.20 ppm, 5.18 ppm, and 5.16
ppm (A,B,C respectively), and 3 of which are associated with 3,6-dideoxy-ribo-heptose
residues at 5.21 ppm, 4.96 ppm, and 4.87 ppm (K,LN respectively) (FIG. 7). Linkages
and ring resonances were then confirmed via 2D 'H- 1 H COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY

                                             19
experiments. Linkages found through NMR experiments coincided with the linkages
assigned by GC-MS.
[0031] With the aid of 2D 'H-"C HSQC and HMBC the Glucitol residues (X,Y,Z) could
are assigned, along with the ring region resonances from the six heptose residues. As
expected carbons involved in the glycosidic linkages, C2 (6 78.1) of the D-glycero-D
manno-heptose A, B and C, C6 (6 76.8) of D-glycero-D-manno-heptose A, C2 (6 81.6) of
Glucitol Y and Z, C2 (6 82.5) of Glucitol X, and C3 (6 78.8) of Glucitol Y and Z, were
found to be down-field resonances (FIG. 8 (A)). The deoxy resonances associated with
the 3,6-dideoxy-ribo-heptose were easily observed at 6 37.1 (C3) and 6 36.1 (C6).
Selective ID nOe experiments (FIG. 8(B)) also showed the presence of the linkages
aforementioned.

                31
[0032] The ID      P and 2D         HMBC NMR revealed resonances at 0.96 and 1.30
ppm, indicating that the capsular polysaccharide repeats were linked with a phosphate
bridge (FIG. 9). This bridge links through the 6-position of the Glucitol and the 7
                                                              31
position of the D-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Fig. 9). The ID       P spectra also gave rise to a
peak 6 14.5 indicating MeOPN, and through the 2D      'H- 31P HMBC the MeOPN could be
linked to being a 7-subsituted 3,6-dideoxy-ribo-heptose (FIG. 10).
[0033] One main capsular polysaccharide was observed with a backbone of [-7)-a-D
glycero-D-manno-heptose-(1-3)-Glucitol-(6-)-P-] with 2,6-disubstitution of the D-glycero
D-manno-heptose, and 2-monosubstitution of the Glucitol with a-3,6-dideoxy-ribo
heptose (FIG. 1i). Three other variations of the capsular polysaccharide repeat were also
noted; variation 1 with 2-monosubstituted D-glycero-D-manno-heptose and Glucitol
linked through the 2-position instead of 3 to D-glycero-D-manno-heptose (FIG. 1Iii),

                                              20
variation 2 with 2,6-disubstitution of the D-glycero-D-manno-heptose and Glucitol linked
through the 2-position instead of 3 to D-glycero-D-manno-heptose(FIG. 11 iii), and
variation 3 with 2-monosubstituted D-glycero-D-manno-heptose and 2-monosubstituted
Glucitol (FIG. 11 iv).
    Example 3: Conjugation of CPSpolysaccharideto protein carrier
[0034] One or more polysaccharides or polysaccharide polymers can be conjugated to a
carrier molecule to improve immunity. The carrier, in one embodiment, is a protein
carrier molecule. As an example protein carrier, CRM 197 can be conjugated to the
polysaccharide or polysaccharide polymer. The GC-MS profile of the alditol acetate
derivatives of C. jejuni CG2995 CPS, following TEMPO oxidation is shown in FIG. 12.
Conjugation is illustrated in FIG. 13.
Coniugation of HS5 polysaccharide
[0035] Isolated C. jejuni HS5 polysaccacharide was conjugated to a protein structure and
is described here as an illustration of conjugation of the polysaccharide or polysaccharide
polymers. The overall scheme for conjugation is illustrated in FIG. 13. Any protein
carrier is envisioned to be conjugated. Furthermore, conjugation to a protein carrier can
be by any number of means.
[0036] As an illustrative example, in FIG. 13 the polysaccharide was conjugated to
CRM 19 7 by TEMPO-mediated oxidation. In this method, as shown in FIG. 13, the first
step is oxidation of approximately 10% of the primary hydroxyls of the intat CPs to
carboxylic acids via TEMPO-mediated oxidation. The scheme in FIG. 13 illustrates

                                               21
conjugation using the primary hydroxyl of the DD-Hep as one of the sites of oxidation.
Non-stoichiometric oxidation may also occur at C-6 of Glc and at the CH 2-OH of the
side-chain substituent. Following activation of the CPS, conjugation to the carrier
protein (e.g., CRM 19 7 ) is accomplished, in the TEMPO-mediated method shown in FIG.
13, through carbodiimide coupling. Visualization of conjuation is by any means, such as
gel electrophoresis.
Coniugation of HS1 polysaccharide
[0037] A glycoconjugate composed of HS1 teichoic acid CPS and the protein carrier
CRM 197 was created through a conjugation scheme, similar to that used for HS5, based
on stoichiometric oxidation of 10% of the available primary hydroxyls in the CPS. After
oxidation of primary hydroxyls, the activated HS1 CPS was then conjugated to CRM 197
by carbodiimide-type coupling of the newly created carboxylic acid functionalities in the
CPS and exposed CRM 197 lysine units. Importantly, analysis of the HS1 CPS-CRM 197
conjugate vaccine by NMR confirmed that the MeOPN and phosphate moieties remained
intact during the conjugation manipulations. These results are shown in FIG. 14. A
comparison of the intensities of the anomeric resonances in the partially oxidized HS1
CPS indicated that half of the backbone Gal residues were branched by the Fru-cntaining
MeOPN units.
                       Example 4: Polysaccharidesin HS complexes
        [0038] Polysaccharide structures were identified in C. jejuni Penner serotype
complexes. For example, anti-HS4 serum results in cross-reaction to other strains strains

                                                  22
of the HS4 complex, including HS13, HS4/13/64 and HS50 capsules. Isolation and
analysis of the polysaccharides from these strains resulted in identification of
dissacharides containing a common ido-heptose unit. The strains and isolated
polysaccharide derived from the strains are listed in Table 3.

[0039] Illustrated in Table 3, the common, surprising feature of these isolated capsule
polysaccharides is the ido-heptose unit. As such, an embodiment is an immunogenic
composition comprising one or more polysaccharide antigens, each comprising
polysaccharide structures derived from these strains of C. jejuni.
[0040] The previously described CPS structure of C. jejuni strain CG8486 (HS: 4:13:64)

                                             23
consisted mainly of a disaccharide repeating unit [->3)-6d-p-D-ido-Hep-(1 -+4)-p
GlcNAc-(1-+], with non-stoichiometric 0-methyl phosphoramidate substituent attached
to C-2 and C-7 positions of ido-heptose. A minor component of L-glycero-D-ido-heptose
(LD-ido-Hep) was detected by GLC-MS, using alditol acetate derivatives for
compositional analysis and permethylated alditol acetate derivates for lingage analysis of,
and was newly found in this strain. The sugar ring configuration of 6-deoxy-heptose and
L-glycero-D-heptose were assigned as idose. The traces of 1,7-anhydro-L-glycero-D-ido
heptose (1,7-anhydro-LD-ido-Hep) and 1,6-anhydro-L-glycero-D-ido-heptose(1,6
anhydro-LD-ido-Hep) originated from LD-ido-Hep during acid hydrolysis.
[0041] In addition to previously reported linkage types in C.jejuni CG8486 CPS (3
substistuted 6d-ido-heptose [-+3)-6d-ido-Hep-(1-+] and 2,3-di-substistuted 6d-ido
heptose [->2,3)-6d-ido-Hep-( 1->], 3,7-di-substistuted 6d-ido-heptose [-+3,7)-6d-ido
Hep-(1 -+], 4-substituted N-acetyl-glucosamine [-->4)-GlcNAc-(1 -+]), the GLC profile of
GLC-MS of permethylated alditol acetate derivatives of C. jejuni HS:4:13:64 CPS
showed two additional linkage types from LD-ido-Hep which were not detected in
previously reported structure, including 3-substistuted L-glycero-D-ido-heptose [-+3)-LD
ido-Hep-( 1->] and 2,3-di-substistuted L-glycero-D-ido-heptose [-+2,3)-LD-ido-Hep
(1-+].
[0042] The ID 'H NMR of C.jejuni CG8486 CPS showed two resonances of two           p
[0043] glycosides at 6 4.94 and 6 4.66 which were 6d-ido-Hep/LD-ido-Hep and GlcNAc,
respectively. The presence of two anomeric proton resonances for three monosaccharide
residues (6d-ido-Hep, LD-ido-Hep, and GlcNAc) suggested that both 6d-ido-Hep and LD
ido-Hep may contain the same chemical shifts through the sugar ring system except the

                                              24
H-6 position since the only difference between them was at the C-6 position with or
without a hydroxyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed one methyl singlet at 6
2.07 which was characteristic of the N-acetyl moiety from GlcNAc and methylene signals
                                                                                  31
at 6 1.77 and 6 2.03 which were 6-deoxy-moiety from 6d-ido-Hep. In addition, ID      P
NMR detected a characteristic MeOPN signal at 6p 14.7. It was determined that the
CPS of C.jejuni serotype HS4:13:64 (see Table 3) contained both 6-d-ido-Hep and LD
ido-Hep within its CPS:
    [->3)-6d- -ido-Hep-(1->4)- -GlcNAc-(1->] (with non-stoichiometric MeOPN at C-2
    and/or C-7 of 6d-ido-Hep) as a major repeat; and
    [->3)-LD-p-ido-Hep-(1 ->4)-P-GlcNAc-(1 ->] (with non-stoichiometric MeOPN at C
    2 of LD-ido-Hep) as a minor repeat.
CPS determination of C. jejuni HS:4 Type Strain (Strain MK7)
[0044] The CPS isolated from C. jejuni strain MK7 (HS4) was composed of L-glycero-D
ido-heptose (LD-ido-Hep) and N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) by GC-MS profile
determination of alditol acetate derivatives. The above CPS composition of C. jejuni
HS:4 type strain was similar to previously reported CPS of serotype HS:4 complex
(HS:4,13,64; strain CG8486), which contains mostly 6-deoxy-ido-heptose (6d-ido-Hep)
instead of LD-ido-Hep. GC-MS of permethylated alditol acetate derivatives showed the
following linkage types of each monosaccharide: 3-substituted L-glycero-D-ido-heptose
[->3)-LD-ido-Hep-(1 ->] and 4-substituted N-acetyl glucosamine [->4)-GlcNAc-(1 ->].
[0045] The 1H NMR spectrum of the C. jejuni strain MK7 (type strain HS:4) CPS

                                             25
showed two p-anomeric proton resonances at 6 4.70 and 6 4.94 for GlcNAc and LD-ido
Hep, respectively. The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed one methyl singlet at 6 2.07
which was characteristic of the N-acetyl moiety from GlcNAc and a broad range of
overlapping sugar ring proton resonances between 6 3.50 and 6 4.55. In addition, ID "P
NMR detected a weak trace of MeOPN signals at 6p 14.3. The substituted sites of
MeOPN could not be detected due to the small amount of MeOPN substitution in this
HS:4 type strain.
CPS determination of C. jejuni C. jejuni Serotype HS:13 (Strain MK16)
[0046] C. jejuni HS4 type-strain (MK7) contains a CPS composed of the following
disaccharide repeat: [->3)-L- -D-ido-Hep-( 1->4)- -GlcNAc-(l1-*]. The
monosaccharide composition analysis, using GC-MS of alditol acetate
derivatives of C. jejuni strain MK1 6 (serotype HS:13) revealed the presence of glucose
(Glc), 6-deoxy-ido-heptose (6d-ido-Hep), and L-glycero-D-ido-heptose (LD-ido-Hep) by
GS-MS determinationof alditol acetate derivative profiles. Linkage analysis of profiles
of permethylated alditol acetate derivatives showed that these units were present as 4
substituted glucose [->4)-Glc-(1-+], 3-substituted 6-deoxy-ido-heptose [-+3)-6d-ido
Hep-(1-+], 2,3-di-substituted 6-deoxy-ido-heptose [-+2,3)-6d-ido-Hep-(1-+], 3
substituted L-glycero-D-ido-heptose [-+3)-LD-ido-Hep-( 1->], and 3,7-di-substituted 6
deoxy-ido-heptose [-+3,7)-6d-ido-Hep-(1-+]. In addition, a small amount of terminal
glucose [Glc-(1-+] was detected as the non-reducing end of the CPS. C. jejuni serotype
HS:13 contains 4-substituted Glc as backbone instead of 4-substituted GlcNAc (seen in
serotypes HS: 4:13:64 and HS:4).

                                             26
[0047] The 1H NMR spectrum of C. jejuni serotype HS:13 CPS showed two p-anomeric
proton resonances at 6 4.63 and 6 4.92 which assigned as Glc and 6d-ido-Hep/ LD-ido
Hep, respectively (Fig. 15A). The 1H NMR spectrum also revealed the methylene signals
(multiplet) at 6 1.86 and 6 2.00 which were characteristic of the 6-deoxy moiety from 6d
ido-Hep and a broad range of overlapping sugar ring proton resonances between 6 3.30
and 6 4.55. ID "P NMR detected two resonances at 6p 14.1 and 6p 14.4 which were
typical of MeOPN signals (Fig. 15B).
[0048] It was determined that C. jejuni strain MK16 (serotype HS:13) CPS consists of
the following disaccharide repeats in quasi equal concentrations (with MeOPN non
stoichiometrically attached to C-2 and C-7 of 6d-p-ido-Hep):
        [-+3)-6d-p-D-ido-Hep-(1-+4)- -Glc-( 1->]; and
        [-+3)-L--D-ido-Hep-(1 ->4)-p-Glc-(1 -+].
C. jejuni serotype HS3/13/50
[0049] HS: 3:13:50 complex has been identified predicated on a quantitatively low level
immune-crossreactivity. C.jejuni strain BH-01-0142 (serotype HS: 3:13:50) was
composed of galactose (Gal), 6-deoxy-ido-heptose (6d-ido-Hep), and L-glycero-D-ido
heptose (LD-ido-Hep) using GS-MS using alditol acetate derivative profile determination
for compositional analysis of C. jejuni BH-01-0142 CPS (serotype HS:3:13:50)).
[0050] The sugar linkage types: 4-substituted galactose [->4)-Gal-(1--+], 3-substituted 6
deoxy-heptose [-+3)-6d-Hep-( 1->] and 3-substituted L-glycero-D-ido-heptose [-+3)-LD
ido-Hep-(1-->] were found to make up the CPS of serotype HS:3:13:50, using GC-MS

                                             27
profile analysis of permethylated alditol acetate derivatives of C. jejuni BH-01-0142 CPS
(serotype (HS: 3:13:50)). In addition, minor components, 3,4-di-substituted galactose
[->3,4)-Gal-(1 -+], 2,3-di-substituted 6-deoxy-heptose [->2,3)-6d-Hep-( 1->], and 2,3-di
substituted L-glycero-D-ido-heptose [-+2,3)-LD-ido-Hep-( 1->] were also characterized.
The above results suggested that the backbone units of C. jejuni serotype HS: 3,13,50
CPS were [-+4)-Gal-(1--+], [->3)-6d-Hep-(1->], and [->3)-LD-ido-Hep-(1-+], with three
other non-sugar components were non-stoichiometrically attached to the C-3 of Gal, and
C-2 of 6d-ido-Hep and LD-ido-Hep. Also, a terminal Gal [Gal-(1-+] was also determined
and was suggested as a non-reducing end.
[0051] The 1H NMR spectrum of the C.jejuni serotype HS:3:13:50 CPS showed
broad overlapping peaks between 6 5.00 ppm and 6 5.30 ppm representing the anomeric
proton signals. These overlapping peaks suggested the presence of a-anomeric sugars. In
addition, the 1H NMR spectrum also revealed a methylene signal at 6 1.80 and 6 2.02
which are characteristic of 6-deoxy moiety from 6d-ido-Hep. Another proton resonance
at 6 2.72 was later confirmed as a methylene signal which also revealed in the 'H NMR
spectrum.
                                                                           3
[0052] In order to obtain the information for the non-sugar component,       P NMR of the
C. jejuni BH-01-0142 CPS was performed to determine any phosphorus substituents. The
phosphorus resonances at 6p 15.3 revealed the presence of an 0-methyl phosphoramidate
groups (MeOPN) or CH 30P(O)NH 2(OR), which was involved in the structural moiety in
the serotype HS:3,13,50 of C.jejuni CPS. The appearance of one MeOPN signal
suggested this unique component was partially attached to one of the monosaccharide
residues in the CPS of C. jejuni strain BH-0 1-0142, since the results of sugar linkage type

                                                       28
analysis revealed the presence of minor component of 1,3,4-linked Gal, 1,2,3-linked 6d
ido-Hep and 1,2,3-linked LD-ido-Hep.
[0053] 2D 'H- 3 1P HMBC NMR of C.jejuni BH-01-0142 CPS was carried out to
elucidate the linkage site of the MeOPN group (FIG. 16). The cross-peak at 6p 15 .3 /6 H
3.78 represented the correlation between the phosphorus and the methyl group of the
MeOPN. A strong proton-phosphorus correlation between 6 p 15.3 and                   6
                                                                                        H  4.56 suggested
the linkage site of the MeOPN group, with also a weak proton-phosphorus correlation
                                                        6
between 6p 15.3 and the anomeric proton at                H 5.10. Thus, the combination of the results
from monosaccharide linkage type analysis and 2D                 'H-
                                                                     31P HMBC NMR showed that the
O-methyl-phosphoramidate group (residue C) was attached to the C-2 position of 6d-ido
Hep and LD-ido-Hep (residue A').
[0054] A 2D 'H- 13 C HMBC NMR experiment (FIG. 17) showed that a second non
                                                                                 H 3 . 8 9 /6 c
                                                                               6
sugar moiety was that of 3-hydroxypropanoyl. The cross-peaks at                                 173.0 and
6
  H
    2 . 7 2 /6c  173.0 showed three-bond and two-bond connectivities of the carbonyl ester C
1 with H-3 and H-2 of 3-hydroxypropanoyl group (residue D), respectively. The 3
hydroxypropanoyl group was observed to be connected to the C-3 of Gal, by interpreting
                         H 5 .2 0/ 6 C 173.0, and also by taking into account the results from
                       6
the cross-peak at
linkage type analysis that showed a minor peak of 1,3,4-linked Gal.
[0055] We determined that C. jejuni serotype HS:3 has a CPS with the
disaccharide repeat (with non-stoichiometric substitutions of 0-methyl phosphoramidate
at C-2 of 6d-a-ido-Hep/L-U-D-ido-Hep and 3-hydroxypropanoyl ester at C-3 of a-Gal):
             [--+3)L-Ca-D-ido-Hep-(1-+4)-a-Gal-(1 ->]; and

                              Example 5: Immunogenic composition
[0056] An immunogenic composition against C. jejuni is can comprise one or more
isolated C. jejuni polysaccharides or polysaccharide polymers. The composition contains
the polysaccharides or polysaccharide polymers free of LOS, which is associated with
Guillain-Barr6 Syndrome. An embodiment is a composition comprising one or more
isolated C. jejuni derived polysaccharides or polysaccharide polymers, with the
polysaccharide polymer comprising 1 to 100 polysaccharides linked together (i.e., "n"
greater than or equal to 1). The structures of the isolated C. jejuni polysaccharide are
derived from one or more of the strains HS5, HS1, HS2, HS3, HS4, HS4/13/64, HS50
and HS13.
[0057] In one embodiment, the composition comprises one or more polysaccharide

    Example 6: Induction of immune response by CPS conjugates.
Induction of immune response against HS1, HS1/HS44 and HS44
[0059] In one embodiment an immunogenic composition, useful for inclusion in a
vaccine composition against HS1, HS1/HS44 and HS44 C. jejuni strains, comprises a
polysaccharide, comprising the structure:
          [-+4)-a-D-Galp-(1-+2)-Gro-(1->P-+]n
                 3    2

or a polymer comprising a repeating of the polysaccharide structure, where "n". In an
alternative embodiment, the immunogenic composition can comprise the HS44
composition, as in Example 1, which does not contain the "[MeOPN]-+3)-Fruf" unit.
[0060] Surprisingly, the above structure found in HS1 and HS1/HS44 strains induces an
immune response against HS44 strains. In the study, mice were immunized with
escalating amounts of vaccine administered with Alhydrogel* (Clifton, NJ). Two weeks
following the final immunization, all immunized animals exhibited significant levels of
serum IgG antibodies specific against HS1 CPS (P<0.05) compared to pre-immune sera.
Furthermore, this effect was dose dependent as mice immunized with 50 tg of vaccine
(by weight) per dose had a significantly higher endpoint titer (P<0.05) than mice
receiving 10 [g per dose. These results illustrate that HS1 is capable of generating high
levels of anti-CPS antibodies in mice. The results of these studies is illustrated in FIG.
18. Also, shown in FIG. 19, a dot blot demonstrating immunogenicity of an HS1
CRM 197 vaccine. Purified capsules (1 mg/ml) were dot blotted in triplicate (2 ul each) to
nitrocellulose and immunodetected with rabbit polyclonal antiserum to an HS1-CRM197
vaccine. HS1, wildtype HS1 capsule; HS1.08, capsule from a fructose transferase mutant
of HS1 that lacks the fructose branch and the MeOPN; HS23/36, capsule from 81-176
which expresses a heterologous capsule (HS23/36).
Induction of an immune response using an HS-5 polysaccharide composition
[0061] The ability of isolated HS5 polysacccharide to induce an immune response was
evaluated. It is contemplated that isolated HS5 polysaccharide could be used conjugated

                                              34
to any of a number of protein carriers. However, as an illustration, CRM19 7-conjugated
HS5 polysaccharide was evaluated.
[0062] In this study, HS5 was conjugated to CRM 197 predicated on the method in
Example 3. BALB/c mice were given three doses each of 10 pg or 50 pg of HS5
polysaccharide-conjugate at 4 week intervals, with 200 pg of ALHYDROGEL*
(Brenntag AG, Germany). The mice received a total of three injections.    Two weeks
after the last dose, the mice were bled and the sera evaluated by ELISA. The results of
this study are shown in FIG. 19 showing CPS-specific IgG responses.
[0063] The immune response of HS3 conjugated to CRM 1 97 was also examined. Female
BALB/c mice were immunized via subcutaneous injection with conjugate vaccine (HS3
from BH0142 conjugated to CRM197) in aluminum hydroxide 3 times at 4-week intervals.
Vaccine was given by weight. A dose of 5 pg corresponded to approximately 0.5 pg of
conjugated polysaccharide and a dose of 25 pg corresponded to approximately 2.5 pg of
conjugated polysaccharide. Serum was collected 2-weeks following each immunization.
Capsule-specific IgG responses were determined by ELISA. The results are shown in
FIG. 20.
[0064] Additionally, the immune cross-reactions among members of the HS4 complex
were evaluated. In these studies, whole cell proteinase K digested samples of various
members of the HS4 complex were electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and
immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antisera made against formalin killed whole cells
of members of the HS4 complex. HS4 anti-serum was found to cross react to HS13 and
HS4. Anti-HS4/13/64 serum was found to crossreact with HS64 and HS4 and to a small
extent to HS50.

                                             35
[0065] In similar studies, rabbit anti-HS13 serum was found to cross react with HS4 and
HS13 and anti-HS64 serum was found to cross react with HS4, HS13, HS4/13/64 and
HS50. Similarly, rabbit polyclonal antiserum made to conjugate vaccine composed of
the capsule of HS4/13/64 strain conjugated to CRM 197 was used in an immunoblot to
determine the cross reactivity of the vaccine to proteinase K digested whole cell
preparations of other members of the HS4 complex. Antibodies to the vaccine cross
reacted to HS4 and HS64, but not to HS13 or HS50.
     Example 7: Methodfor inducing an anti-C.jejuni immune response in mammals
[0066] An embodiment of the invention is the induction of an immune response against
capsule polysaccharide. The embodied method comprising administering an
immunogenic composition comprising one or more polysaccharide antigens, wherein
each polysaccharide antigen comprises a C. jejuni capsule polysaccharide polymer. The
Campylobacterjejunicapsule polysaccharide polymers comprise of C. jejuni strains, as
in Examples 1-4. As such, a capsule polysaccharide polymer comprises I to 100 copies
of a polysaccharide structure, derived from an individual C. jejuni strain, connected
together to form a polysaccharide polymer. Induction of immunity can be against one or
more strains of C. jejuni.
[0067] The capsule polysaccharide are derived from one or more C. jejuni strains
selected from the group consisting of HS1 and HS1 complex (HS1, HS1/HS44 or HS44),
HS2, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS13, HS4/13/64, and HS50. The inventive immunogenic
compositions would comprise isolated C. jejuni polysaccharide structures or
polysaccharide polymers of the structures, without lipooligosaccharide, or other

                                             36
 structures associated with GBS. The polysaccharide polymers can be conjugated or
 unconjugated to a carrier molecule and the composition administered at a dose range of
 0.1 ptg to 10 mg per dose with or without an adjuvant.
 [0068] Another embodiment is a method of to induce an immune response against C.
jejuni by administering isolated C. jejuni capsule polysaccharide derived from HS1,
 HS1/HS44 or HS44. In the inventive method, the composition is used to induce an
 immune response against HS1, HS1/HS44 or HS44. As an example, a composition
 comprising isolated C. jejuni capsule polysaccharide, isolated away from or purified from
 LOS components and other components that can cause autoimmune responses such as
 Guillain-Barre syndrome, such as derived from HS1, are used to induce an immune
 response against HS1, HS1/HS44 and HS44 C. jejuni strains.
 [0069] In another embodiment, a composition comprising one or more of the
 polysaccharide comprising one or more of polysaccharides derived from HS4, HS13,
 HS4/HS13/HS64 or HS50 can be used in a method to induce immunity against any of the
 C. jejuni strains of the HS4 complex, comprising HS4, HS13, HS4/HS13/H64 or HS50.
 [0070] In the above described compositions, the polysaccharides or polysaccharide
 polymers can be linked to a carrier, wherein said carrier can be a protein. In one
 embodiment, the protein carrier is CRM 197.
 [0071] As an example, the embodiment method, comprises the steps:
          a. administering an immunogenic composition comprising one or more C. jejuni
 isolated capsule polysaccharide polymers derived from capsules of C. jejuni strains
 selected from the group consisting of: HS1 and HS1 complex (HS1, HS1/HS44 or
 HS44), HS2, HS3, HS4, HS5, HS13, HS4/13/64, and HS50, wherein capsule

                                             37
polysaccharides of a strain can be linked to form a polysaccharide polymer comprises 1
to 100 copies of a polysaccharide structure, derived from an individual C. jejuni strain,
connected together to form a polymer and wherein said composition would comprise
isolated C. jejuni polysaccharide structures or polymers of the structures, without
lipooligosaccharide, or other structures associated with GBS and wherein the
polysaccharide or polysaccharide polymers can be conjugated or unconjugated to a
carrier molecule and the composition administered at a dose range of 0.1 pig to 10 mg per
dose with or without an adjuvant, and wherein the polysaccharide structures include one
or more of the following structures selected from the group consisting of:
