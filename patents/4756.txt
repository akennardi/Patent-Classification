   TECHNICAL FIELD
 5
   The invention pertains to the technical field of obtaining a solution comprising a
   high iron content. More in particular, the present invention concerns a method for
   obtaining such a solution, preferably comprising ferrous and/or ferric chloride, in
   an energy-efficient manner as it does not require substantial additional heating or
10 other types of energy input.
   BACKGROUND
   Solutions comprising iron can be found in many industrial applications. For
15 instance, steel pickling facilities use acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid,
   to treat surfaces of steel objects, mostly steel plates. The acid is provided in
   aqueous solution and the waste resulting from the pickling is called waste pickling
   liquid or waste pickle liquor (WPL),        which typically is an aqueous solution
   comprising iron, mainly ferrous iron, e.g. in the form of a ferrous chloride or
20 ferrous sulphate solution. The iron content in WPL is typically less than 10 wt%,
   usually between 6 and 9 wt% of iron, mainly in the form of ferrous chloride
   (FeCl2).   Iron-comprising solutions are further       used in water treatment,        in
   particular ferric chloride solutions which can be used as a coagulating and/or
   flocculating agent. The iron content of such ferric chloride solutions is typically of
25 the order of 15 wt%. However, higher iron content solutions can be preferred, in
   particular for transporting the ferric chloride solution to a water purification facility
   or to an intermediate distribution point to reduce transport costs or to store the
   solution in a storage tank. The iron content of the solution can then be reduced to
   the desired concentration in situ or at the distribution point by dilution or the
30 solution of high ferric chloride concentration can be used as such for e.g. water
   purification.
   Document WO 2012/075109 discloses a method for making a high iron-content
   ferric chloride solution, comprising evaporating water from a ferric chloride
35 solution having an iron content of 15 wt/o or less to increase the iron content to
   23-26 wt%. The document also discloses a process for reconstituting an aqueous
   ferric chloride solution having an iron content of about 23 to 26 weight percent by

                                              2
   diluting a ferric chloride solution having an iron content of about 23 to 26 weight
   percent with water to a lower iron content. Document WO 2012/075109 further
   discloses the exemplary embodiment of either mixing solid iron containing
   materials with hydrochloric acid to obtain a ferric chloride solution with an iron
 5 content of about 15 wt%, or of oxidizing spent pickling liquors to obtain a ferric
   chloride solution with an iron content of about 15 wt%. This ferric chloride solution
   with an iron content of about 15 wt% can then be evaporated to further increase
   the iron content to about 23 to about 26 wt%.
10 The problem with the prior art technique is that it requires intensive heating to
   evaporate the water from the ferric chloride solution.
   There remains a need in the art for an improved process for making a high iron
   content solution, preferably comprising ferric chloride, which overcomes the
15 problem mentioned above. There also remains a need in the art for improved
   methods or devices for storing, transporting and/or moving such as solution, as
   well as for diluting such a solution.
   The invention thereto aims to provide a method for making a high iron-content
20 solution comprising ferric chloride at an increased concentration, which is more
   energy efficient than the prior art method.

   leading to a solution comprising an increased ferric chloride concentration
   compared to said initial ferric chloride concentration, preferably of at least 15
   wt%, more preferably at least 38 wt%.

   particular the content of ferric and/or ferrous iron bound in the ferric and/or
   ferrous chloride.
10 In a preferred embodiment, steps (B2) and (B3) are performed multiple times

   The methods disclosed here above are embodiments of a method for obtaining a
   solution comprising ferric chloride at an increased concentration, comprising the
   steps of:
   (Cl) providing a solution comprising ferric and, optionally, ferrous chloride,

   In a preferred embodiment, at least one of steps (C2) or (C4) is performed.
20 Note that the solution which is obtained by performing the methods of the present
   invention, comprises an increased ferric chloride concentration with respect to the
   solution provided in step (Cl).

25 hydrochloric acid is added in (C2).
   In an embodiment, said solution as obtained by step (C3) comprises ferrous ion
   and said ferrous ion in said solution is oxidized in step (C4). In another
   embodiment, no ferrous ion is present in said solution as obtained by step (C3) or
30 said ferrous ion in said solution is not oxidized in step (C4).
   The present invention allows to obtain a ferric chloride solution with an increased
   ferric chloride concentration without the necessity of an input of thermal energy.
35 The term "equivalent thermal energy" refers to the minimal thermal energy which
   is required to obtain a ferric chloride solution comprising an increased ferric

                                              6
   chloride concentration from an initial ferric chloride concentration by evaporation
   of the solvent, i.c. water, from the solution.
   In an embodiment, the method uses thermal energy which is at most 99%,
 5 preferably at most 95%, more preferably at most 90%, yet more preferably at
   most 80%, still more preferably at most 70%, even more preferably at most 6 0 %,
   yet even more preferably at most 50%, yet still more preferably at most 40%, still
   even more preferably at most 30%, even more preferably at most 20%, yet more
   preferably at most 10%, still more preferably at most 5%, yet even more
10 preferably at most 1% of the equivalent thermal energy.
   In an embodiment, said increased ferric chloride concentration is higher than said
   initial ferric chloride concentration by at least 1 wt%, preferably at least 4 wt%,
   more preferably at least 8 wt%, even more preferably at least 12 wt%, still more
15 preferably at least 15 wt%, yet more preferably at least 18 wt%, yet even more
   preferably at least 20 wt%, still even more preferably at least 25 wt%, yet still
   more preferably at least 30 wt%.
   In an embodiment, said solution provided in steps (C1), (Al) or (B1) comprises a
20 hydrochloric acid concentration of at most 10 wt%, preferably at most 9.9 wt%,
   such as 9.8 wt%, 9.7 wt%, 9.6 wt%, 9.5 wt%, 9.4 wt%, 9.3 wt%, 9.2 wt%,           9.1

   concentration of HCI in the provided solution allows more HCI to be absorbed in
35 e.g. step (A2) or (C2), which allows one to obtain a saturated solution of FeCl3
   with HCI after e.g. step (A2) or (C2).

                                                7
   In a preferred embodiment, said substance, which is added in steps (A3), (82) or
   (C3), is a solid.
   In an embodiment, an agent is used in the oxidation step, the agent preferably
 5 chosen out of the list of chlorine gas (C2), ozone (03), oxygen gas (02), chlorine
   dioxide (C0 2 ), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCI), oxychlorination gas (which preferably
   comprises a combination of oxygen gas (02) and hydrochloric acid (HCI)),
   peroxides, especially hydrogen peroxide (H202), perchlorate, especially sodium
   perchlorate (NaClO3), or any combination thereof. Chlorine gas (C2), oxygen gas
10 (02), a mixture of oxygen gas and hydrochloric acid gas (02+HCI), or a mixture
   thereof is used in a preferred embodiment.
   Whether or not the optional steps (C2) and (C4) are performed in the method may
   depend on the composition of the solution provided in step (Cl) and/or the
15 substance added in step (C3) to the solution to increase its iron content.
   In an embodiment, step (C2) is performed and hydrochloric acid is added to the
   solution. This step is typically performed in case a source of chlorine atoms or ions
   is necessary to chlorinate iron in the solution or iron added during step (C3). In
20 another embodiment, extra chlorine to chlorinate said iron is not necessary, or is
   provided in another step, e.g. during step (C4).
   In an embodiment, step (C4) is performed and ferrous ion in the solution as
   obtained by step (C3) is oxidized. This step is typically performed if the solution
25 provided step (C1) comprises ferrous chloride or ferrous iron, and/or the added
   substance in step (C3) comprises ferrous iron, leading to ferrous ion in the
   solution. In another embodiment, no ferrous ion or only a small amount of ferrous
   ion is present in the solution as obtained by step (C3), e.g. if the solution provided
   in step (Cl) mainly comprises ferric chloride and little to no ferrous chloride and
30 the added substance in step (C3) is e.g. ferric oxide. In such cases, an oxidation
   step (C4) to oxidize ferrous to ferric ion may not be necessary to increase or to
   further increase the ferric chloride concentration of the resulting solution.
   In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the steps (C2) or (C4) is performed to
35 lead to a solution comprising an increased ferric chloride concentration compared
   to said initial ferric chloride concentration.

                                            8
   In a preferred embodiment, both steps (C2) and (C4) are performed. Note that
   hereby the amount of hydrochloric acid added in step (C2) and the manner of
   oxidation or the amount of ferrous ion which is oxidized in step (C4) may still
   depend on the composition or source of the solution provided in step (Cl) or the
 5 substance added to the solution in step (C3).
   In a preferred embodiment, steps (02), (C3) and/or (C4) are performed multiple
   times subsequently or simultaneously,
10 In a preferred embodiment, step (C2) is performed before, during and/or after
   step (C3). In a preferred embodiment, steps (C2) and/or (C3) are performed
   before and/or during step (C4).
   In an embodiment, steps (C2) and (C3) are performed as follows:
15 e       simultaneously;
   *       subsequently;
   e       multiple times simultaneously;
   *       multiple times subsequently;
   *       once or multiple times simultaneously, preferably until a pre-determined
20 ferric chloride concentration is obtained, more preferably said predetermined
   concentration at least 40 wt%, and then once or multiple times subsequently; or
   *       once or multiple times subsequently, preferably until a pre-determined
   ferric chloride concentration is obtained, more preferably said predetermined
   concentration at least 40 wt%, and then once or multiple times simultaneously;
25 whereby optionally step (C4) is performed once or multiple times simultaneously
   and/or subsequently.
   In an embodiment, steps (C3) and (C4) are performed as follows:
   0       simultaneously;
30 -       subsequently;
   e       multiple times simultaneously;

   ferric chloride concentration is obtained, more preferably said predetermined
35 concentration at least 40 wt%, and then once or multiple times subsequently; or

                                             9
   *      once or multiple times subsequently, preferably until a pre-determined
   ferric chloride concentration is obtained, more preferably said predetermined
   concentration at least 40 wt%, and then once or multiple times simultaneously;
   whereby optionally step (C2) is performed once or multiple times simultaneously
 5 and/or subsequently.
   In an embodiment, steps (C2), (C3) and (C4) are performed as follows:
   e      simultaneously;
   0      subsequently;
10 -       multiple times simultaneously;

15 e      once or multiple times subsequently, preferably until a pre-determined
   ferric chloride concentration is obtained, more preferably said predetermined
   concentration at least 40 wt%, and then once or multiple times simultaneously.
   In a preferred embodiment, the hydrochloric acid is added by absorption from a
20 gaseous state by said solution or by injecting gaseous hydrochloric acid in the
   solution, preferably by blowing gaseous hydrochloric acid at high pressure into the
   solution.
   In a preferred embodiment, said substance comprises solid iron and/or solid
25 hematite. By using solid hematite, the ferric chloride concentration can be
   increased to more than 75 wt%. By using solid iron or a mixture of solid iron and
   hematite, the ferric chloride concentration can be increased even higher than with
   hematite.
30 The previous embodiments of the method comprise the step of increasing an iron
   content of said solution by adding a substance comprising iron. This step seems
   necessary to allow an increase of the iron content of the solution without
   evaporation step and thus in a more energy efficient manner as in the prior art.
35 The present invention therefore also concerns a method for increasing iron content
   of a solution, comprising the steps of:

                                              10
   (D1) providing a solution comprising an initial iron content, preferably of at least 6
   wt%; and
   (D2) adding a substance comprising iron,
   leading to a solution comprising an increased iron content, preferably of at least
 5 12 wt%.
   Note that adding said substance is to result in an increase of the iron content of
   the solution, the iron content being a concentration of all iron dissolved in the
   solution. Said iron can be present in the form of atoms, ions, ferrous and/or ferric
10 iron, bound in molecules or unbound, etc.
   Said solution of increased iron content can be obtained as an intermediate solution
   in a method for obtaining a solution of high ferric chloride concentration as
   described in this document.
15
   In a preferred embodiment, the added substance comprises solid ferric and/or
   ferrous iron, and preferably the methods herein described comprise the step of
   dissolving said iron in said solution, more preferably before, during and/or after
   said iron is bound in ferric and/or ferrous chloride.
20
   In an embodiment, the iron content of the solution is increased from an iron
   content of less than 10 wt%, preferably between 4 wt% and 9 wt%, to an iron
   content of more than 15 wt%, e.g. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
   28, 29, 30 wt% or any value there between. Preferably the concentration is
25 increased to more than 20 wt%, more preferably more than 21 wt%, yet more
   preferably more than 22 wt%, still more preferably more than 23 wt%, even more
   preferably more than 24 wt%. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration is
   increased to less than 30 wt%, more preferably less than 29 wt%, yet more
   preferably less than 28 wt%, still more preferably less than 27 wt%, even more
30 preferably less than 26 wt%, yet even more preferably less than 25 wt%. Most
   preferably, the concentration is increased to about 24.5 wt%.
   In an embodiment, said solution provided in step (C1) or in step (D1), comprises a
   ferric chloride concentration of at least 12 wt%, more preferably at least 15 wt%,
35 more preferably at least 16 wt%, even more preferably at least 18 wt%, still more
   preferably at least 20 wt%, yet more preferably at least 23 wt%, even still more
   preferably at least 25 wt%, even yet more preferably at least 27 wt%, still yet

                                             11
   more preferably at least 30 wt%, yet even more preferably at least 32 wt%, yet
   still more preferably at least 35 wt%, still even more preferably at least 38 wt%,
   even more preferably at least 40 wt%. Note that the method of the present
   invention hereby provides a manner of increasing the ferric chloride solution even
 5 higher than 40 wt%.
   In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for decreasing the
   ferric chloride concentration in a ferric chloride solution by diluting said solution.
   Preferably, said ferric chloride concentration is at least 15 wt%, preferably at least
10 18 wt%, more preferably at least 20 wt%, still more preferably at least 23 wt%,
   yet more preferably at least 25wt%, even more preferably at least 27wt%, yet

   comprising solution with increased concentration according to the present
 5 invention.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention concerns a method for obtaining a solution comprising a
10 ferric chloride at an increased concentration. The present invention also concerns
   a method for increasing iron content of a solution.

   component based on the overall weight of the formulation.
10
   The term "iron content of a solution" refers to the concentration of iron in said
   solution. The iron could be in the form of iron atoms, iron ions, ferric iron, ferrous
   iron, iron bound in molecules, etc. Note that e.g. iron-comprising solids are not
   part of the solution and therefore do not contribute to the solution's iron content.
15
   In an aspect, the invention provides a method for obtaining a solution comprising
   a ferric chloride at an increased concentration according to claims 13 and 14, i.e. a
   method for increasing iron content of a solution, comprising the steps of:
           (D1) providing a solution comprising an initial iron content, preferably of at
20         least 6 wt%; and
           (D2) adding a substance comprising iron,
   leading to a solution comprising an increased iron content, preferably of at least
   12 wt%.
25 Note that adding said substance is to result in an increase of the iron content of
   the solution, the iron content being a concentration of all iron dissolved in the
   solution. Said iron can be present in the form of atoms, ions, ferrous and/or ferric
   iron, bound in molecules or unbound, etc.
30 Said solution of increased iron content can be obtained as an intermediate solution
   in a method for obtaining a solution of high ferric chloride concentration as
   described in this document. Also, said method for increasing iron content of a
   solution can be used in a a method for obtaining a solution of high ferric chloride
   concentration as described in this document, in particular in step (C3).
35
   In a preferred embodiment, the added substance comprises solid ferric and/or
   ferrous iron, and preferably the methods herein described comprise the step of

                                             15
   dissolving said iron in said solution, more preferably before, during and/or after
   said iron is bound in ferric and/or ferrous chloride.
   In an embodiment, the iron content of the solution is increased from an iron
 5 content of less than 10 wt%, preferably between 4 wt% and 9 wt%, to an iron
   content of more than 15 wt%, e.g. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
   28, 29, 30 wt% or any value there between. Preferably the concentration is
   increased to more than 20 wt%, more preferably more than 21 wt%, yet more
   preferably more than 22 wt%, still more preferably more than 23 wt%, even more
10 preferably more than 24 wt%. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration is
   increased to less than 30 wt%, more preferably less than 29 wt%, yet more
   preferably less than 28 wt%, still more preferably less than 27 wt%, even more
   preferably less than 26 wt%, yet even more preferably less than 25 wt%. Most
   preferably, the concentration is increased to about 24.5 wt%.
15
   The present invention provides a method for obtaining a solution comprising a
   ferric chloride at an increased concentration, preferably a concentration of at least
   15 wt%, preferably at least 18 wt%, more preferably at least 20 wt%, still more
   preferably at least 23 wt%, yet more preferably at least 25wt%, even more
20 preferably at least 2 7wt%, yet more preferably at least 30wt%, still more
   preferably at least 32wt%, even more preferably at least 35wt%, yet still more
   preferably at least 3 8wt%, yet even more preferably at least 40wt%, still even
   more preferably at least 50wt%, still more preferably at least 60wt%, yet more
   preferably at least 65wt%, e.g. 66wt%, 67wt%, 68wt%, 69wt%, 70wt%, 71wt%,
25 72wt%, 73wt%, 74wt%, 75wt% or higher, most preferably about 71wt%.
   Preferred embodiments of these methods are described in claims 1 to 12 and
   further in this document.
30 In a preferred embodiment, the hydrochloric acid is added in step (C2)             by
   absorption from a gaseous state by said solution.
   In a preferred embodiment, said substance added in step (C3) comprises solid iron
   and/or solid hematite. By using solid hematite, the ferric chloride concentration
35 can be increased to more than 75 wt%. By using solid iron or a mixture of solid
   iron and hematite, the ferric chloride concentration can be increased even higher
   than with hematite.

                                             16
   The previous embodiments of the method comprise the step of increasing an iron
   content of said solution by adding a substance comprising iron. This step seems
   necessary to allow an increase of the iron content of the solution without
 5 evaporation step and thus in a more energy efficient manner as in the prior art.
   The ferric chloride solution with a high iron content, preferably 23 wt%, 24 wt%,
   25 wt%, 26 wt% or higher, can be stored, transported or moved as a solution by
   maintaining a solution temperature so the ferric chloride is stable in solution. In a
10 preferred embodiment the temperature is 80 C or higher. In other embodiments
   the temperature can be 300 C or higher and in another embodiment the
   temperature can be 500C, for example about 80 0C or about 100 0C. In a preferred
   embodiment the temperature is 1000C or lower. In other embodiments the
   temperature can be 75 0C or lower for example about 80 C or about 500C. For
15 frozen ferric chloride solutions, heat can be applied to facilitate the solid to liquid
   phase change. Once transported to the desired location, the ferric chloride solution
   having the high iron content can then be reconstituted on-site to the desired iron
   concentration as desired.
20 In an embodiment, the method comprises the step of ensuring that said solution,
   in particular said solution comprising an increased ferric chloride concentration,
   remains or becomes liquid, e.g. by altering or controlling climatic parameters of
   said solution such as temperature and/or pressure. More in particular, the method
   may comprise the step of keeping said solution comprising a ferric chloride
25 concentration above the freezing temperature of said solution. Note hereby that
   the freezing temperature of the solution depends on the concentration and that
   this step may require heating of said solution, in particular for ferric chloride
   concentrations higher than 75 wt%.
30 Therefore, the present invention also concerns a method for storing, transporting
   and/or moving a ferric chloride solution, preferably a ferric chloride solution
   obtained by a method according to the present invention, with an iron content of
   at least 23 wt%, preferably at least 24 wt%, such as 24 wt%, 25 wt%, 26 wt% or
   higher and any value there between. Preferably said method comprises storing,
35 transporting and/or moving said ferric chloride solution at a temperature of about
   80 C or more. Preferably, said solution is stored for a duration which is longer than
   1 day, more preferably longer than 2 days, still more preferably longer than 3

                                              17
   days, such as 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 days or longer, and/or preferably said solution is
   transported or moved over distances longer than 100km, preferably longer than
   500km, more preferably longer than 1000km, such as 2000km, 3000km, 4000km,
   5000km, 6000km, 7000km, 8000km, 9000km, 10000km or any value there
 5 between or even longer than 10000km. In an embodiment, said ferric chloride
   solution is stored, transported and/or moved in an intermodal container or by
   barge.
   Note hereby that storage, transport or moving of ferric chloride solutions over a
10 long period or over long distances, preferably in intermodal containers or a barge,
   do not seem to have been done or contemplated previously. The present invention
   allows to produce highly concentrated ferric chloride solutions in a fast, cheap and
   reliable manner, but requires the presence of iron containing substances. Due to
   its high concentration, it becomes possible to produce the ferric chloride solution
15 at a site where iron containing substances are present, are produced or are
   collected, and store the solution over a longer time period or transport or move
   the solution over long distance, where it can be diluted to a required
   concentration, for a given use or application. In case the melting point or freezing
   point of the solution is high, in particular higher than ambient temperature, extra
20 measures need to be taken to keep the product in a liquid state. Such measures
   could comprise e.g. isolation or tracing, to avoid the product from crystalizing or
   solidifying. In this respect, a solution with an increased concentration of between
   67 wt% and 75 wt%, more preferably about 71 wt%, is preferred as it crystalizes
   only around 84C, which simplifies transport and storage of the solution. For
25 storage, e.g. a limited isolation and/or tracing could suffice. The melting or
   freezing temperature of the solution determines the type of tracing which can be
   used. If a product melts/freezes about 84C, electrical tracing usually suffices. A
   product with metling/freezing temperature above 100oC requires e.g. steam
   tracing. The type of tracing also determines at least partly the material which can
30 be used in storage or transport vessels or pipes, as well as their lifetime.
   Intermodal containers can hereby be adapted for such long-time storage and/or
   long-distance transport. Barges can be adapted for long-distance transport. Note
   that, due to the corrosive nature of ferric chloride solutions, it is not evident to use
   barges for transporting ferric chloride solutions.
35
   Intermodal containers, also called container, freight container, ISO container,
   shipping container, hi-cube container, box, conex box or sea can, preferably are a

                                             18
   standardized reusable steel box used for the safe, efficient and secure storage and
   movement of materials and products within a global containerized intermodal
   freight transport system. "Intermodal" indicates that the container can be moved
   from one mode of transport to another (e.g. from ship, to rail, to truck) without
 5 unloading and reloading the contents of the container.
   Barges refer to boats or ships, adapted for transporting goods and products over
   water ways, preferably over rivers, canals and lakes.
10 In view of the above, the present invention also concerns an intermodal container
   or barge comprising a ferric chloride solution with a concentration of at least 15
   wt%, preferably at least 18 wt%, more preferably at least 20 wt%, still more
   preferably at least 23 wt%, yet more preferably at least 25wt%, even more
   preferably at least 27wt%, yet more preferably at least 30wt%, still more
15 preferably at least 32wt%, even more preferably at least 35wt/o, yet still more
   preferably at least 38wt%, yet even more preferably at least 40wt%, still even
   more preferably at least SOwt%, still more preferably at least 60wt%, yet more
   preferably at least 65wt%, e.g. 66wt%, 67wt%, 68wt%, 69wt%, 70wt%, 71wt%,
   72wt%, 73wt%, 74wt%, 75wt% or higher, most preferably about 71wt%. The
20 present invention also concerns the use of an intermodal container or barge for for
   storing, transporting and/or moving a ferric chloride solution, preferably a ferric
   chloride solution obtained by a method according to the present invention, and
   preferably said ferric chloride solution comprising a concentration of at least 15
   wt%, preferably at least 18 wt%, more preferably at least 20 wt%, still more
25 preferably at least 23 wt%, yet more preferably at least 25wt%, even more
   preferably at least 27wt%, yet more preferably at least 30wt%, still more
   preferably at least 32wt%, even more preferably at least 35wt%, yet still more
   preferably at least 38wt%, yet even more preferably at least 40wt%, still even
   more preferably at least 50wt%, still more preferably at least 60wt%, yet more
30 preferably at least 65wt%, e.g. 66wt%, 67wt%, 68wt%, 69wt%, 70wt%, 71wt%,
   72wt%, 73wt%, 74wt%, 75wt% or higher, most preferably about 71wt%.
   The agent used in the oxidation step can be chosen out of the list of chlorine gas
   (C2), ozone (03), oxygen gas     (02), chlorine dioxide (C102), sodium hypochlorite
35 (NaOCI), oxychlorination gas (which could be a combination of oxygen gas (02)
   and hydrochloric acid (HCI)), peroxides, especially hydrogen peroxide (1-1202),
   perchlorate, especially sodium perchlorate (NaCIO3). Chlorine gas (Cl2 ), oxygen

                                               19
   gas (02), a mixture of oxygen gas and hydrochloric acid gas (02+HCI), or a
   mixture thereof is used in a preferred embodiment.
   The present invention will be now described in more details, referring to examples
 5 that are not limitative.
   EXAMPLES
   Example 1: see Fig. 1.
10
   A ferric chloride solution (11) is provided with a concentration of 12 wt%.
   Hydrochloric acid in gaseous state (12) is absorbed (13) in said solution (11),
   resulting in a solution comprising ferric chloride and hydrochloric acid (14). Note
   that this may decrease the concentration of ferric chloride in the solution (14).
15 Ferric oxide (15), e.g. in the form of hematite or ferrite, is added to the solution
   (14). The ferric oxide reacts at least partially with the hydrochloric acid (16) to
   form ferric chloride in the solution. Note that the ferric oxide can be added as a
   solid, but that the reaction (16) results in ferric iron which is dissolved in the
   solution. Note also that adding the ferric oxide increases the iron content of the
20 solution (14), even though water is formed in the reaction (16). This is due to the
    heavy molecular mass of ferric chloride compared to water, theoretically allowing
   up to about 85.7 wt% of ferric chloride solution with this reaction.
   The resulting ferric chloride solution (17) comprises a concentration, which is
25  higher than 12 wt%, e.g. 16 wt%. The resulting solution may also comprise
    hydrochloric acid, e.g. which did not participate in reaction (16). In order to
    increase the concentration further, steps (13) and (16) could be repeated using
   the resulting solution (17) as input (19). This repetition of steps could be
    performed multiple times to increase the concentration of ferric chloride, resulting
30  in a final solution (18) comprising at least 38 wt%, preferably 40 wt%, more
    preferably between 60 wt% and 80 wt%, most preferably about 71 wt% of ferric
    chloride.
    In case hydrochloric acid is present in the resulting solution (17), step (16) can be
35  repeated using the resulting solution (17) as input (20).
    In a similar example, the initial ferric chloride concentration can be about 40 wt%:

                                                 20
                 a. f.ex. A 40 wt% ferric chloride (FeC3) solution, with an iron content
                     of about 14 wt%, is saturated with wet hydrochloric acid gas (HCI(g))
                 b. Increasing iron content by adding magnetite (Fe304) yielding in a
                     solution comprising ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ) and ferrous chloride
 5                   (FeCI2), with an increased iron content of about 16.5 wt%.
                 c. Followed with chlorination of ferrous chloride to obtain a solution
                     with a ferric chloride concentration of 47 wt%.
   X           Fe304 +        8 HCl +       FeC 3 ->     FeCl2 +  3 FeCl3  +     4 H2 0
   gX          231.5          291.7         162.2        126.8    486.6
   g H2 0                     424.4         243.3                              739.7
   wt% X                      41%           40%
   X           FeCl 2 +     FeCl 3 + C1 2  ->   FeCl 3
   gX              126,8       486,6      35,5     648,8
   g H20                       739,7               739,7
   wt% X                                             47%
   With these steps, the increased ferric chloride concentration is higher than said
10 initial ferric chloride concentration by 7 wt%.
   Example 2: see Fig. 2.
   A ferric chloride solution (21) is provided with a concentration of about 12 wt%.
15 The solution may also comprise ferrous chloride. Solid iron (22) is added to the
   solution (21). The solid iron (22) reacts with ferric chloride in the solution (21), to
   form ferrous chloride according to reaction (23). Note that this results in an
   increase of the iron content of the solution, and that a solution (24) is obtained
   comprising ferrous chloride and possibly ferric chloride which did not react in
20 reaction (24). Chlorine gas (25) is added to the solution (24), resulting in the
   oxidation of the ferrous iron according to an oxychlorination reaction (26).
   The resulting ferric chloride solution (27) comprises a concentration, which is
   higher than 12 wt%, e.g. 38 wt%. The resulting solution may also comprise
25 ferrous chloride, e.g. which did not participate in reaction (26).
   In order to increase the concentration further, steps (23) and (26) could be
   repeated using the resulting solution (27) as input (29). This repetition of steps
   could be performed multiple times to increase the concentration of ferric chloride,

                                             21
   resulting in a final solution (28) comprising at least 40 wt%, preferably between
   60 wt% and 80 wt%, most preferably about 71 wt% of ferric chloride.
   In case ferrous chloride is present in the resulting solution (27), step (26) can be
 5 repeated using the resulting solution (27) as input (30).
   Example 3: see Fig. 3.
   A solution comprising ferrous and/or ferric chloride (31) is provided, comprising an
10 iron content of about 6 wt%, e.g. waste pickling liquor from a steel pickling plant.
   Hydrochloric acid in gaseous state (32) is absorbed (33) in said solution (31). Note
   that this may decrease the iron content in the solution (34). Iron-comprising
   substances (35) are added to the solution (34). A number of reactions (36) may
   take place, resulting in an increase of the iron content. A solution (37) comprising
15 ferrous chloride is obtained. This solution (37) may further comprise ferric chloride
   already formed in reactions (36) and/or hydrochloric acid which did not participate
   in reactions (36). An oxidizing agent (38) is added to the solution (37), resulting
   in the oxidation (43) of the ferrous iron in the ferrous chloride. The oxidizing agent
   (38) may be chlorine gas and/or oxygen gas, and the ferrous iron can be at least
20 partially oxychlorinated. In case the amount of hydrochloric acid in the solution
   (37) is deemed too low to allow oxychlorination with oxygen gas, extra
   hydrochloric acid gas can be added in this step.
   The resulting ferric chloride solution (39) may comprise an iron content which is
25 higher than about 10 wt% concentration, and a ferric chloride concentration which
   is higher than 16 wt%, e.g. 38 wt%. The resulting solution (39) may also
   comprise ferrous chloride and/or hydrochloric acid, e.g. which did not participate
   in reactions (36).
30 In order to increase the concentration further, steps (33), (36) and (43) could be
   repeated using the resulting solution (39) as input (41). This repetition of steps
   could be performed multiple times to increase the concentration of ferric chloride,
   resulting in a final solution (40) comprising at least 38 wt%, preferably 40 wt%,
   more preferably between 60 wt% and 80 wt%, most preferably about 71 wt% of
35 ferric chloride.

                                               22
   In case hydrochloric acid and/or ferrous chloride is present in the resulting
   solution (39), steps (36) and (43) can be repeated using the resulting solution
   (39) as input (42). Note that if ferrous chloride is present in the resulting solution
   (39), step (43) can be repeated using the resulting solution (39) as input (44) in
 5 order to increase the ferric chloride concentration.
   Example 4: Reaction between iron (Fe), ferric chloride (FeC 3) and chlorine
   gas(C2) to obtain a 69 wt% ferric chloride (FeC3) solution starting from a 40 wt%
   ferric chloride FeCl3 solution. See also example 2 and figure 2.
10
   In this example iron is added to a ferric chloride solution yielding to a solution
   comprising ferrous chloride. The ferrous chloride is oxidised into ferric chloride by
   reacting with chlorine gas. By repeating this process 3 times the ferric chloride
   content of the solution is raised from 40 wt%, over 50 wt% and 60 wt% to 69
15 wt/o. With these steps, the increased ferric chloride concentration is higher than
   said initial ferric chloride concentration by 10 wt%,20 wt% to even 29 wt%.
