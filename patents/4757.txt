   herein by reference.
                      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0002] Field of Invention
15               The present invention relates to novel cyclic depsipeptide
   derivatives and novel harmful organism control agents using the same.
   [0003] Background Art
                  Many harmful organism control agents have hitherto been
   found.    However, novel drugs have still been desired, for example, from
20 the viewpoint of a problem of lowered drug sensitivity, persistence of
   effect, and safety in use.
   [0004]          Non-patent     documents         1  and     2    report  cyclic
   octadepsipeptides.      These    reports,    however, do not disclose the
   compounds of the present invention and thus do not suggest the harmful
25 organism control effect of the compounds of the present invention.
   [0005]          Non-patent documents 3, 4, and 5 disclose the structure
   of cyclic octadepsipeptides and derivatives thereof, and the insecticidal
   activity thereof against silkworms.     These documents, however, do not
   disclose the compounds of the present invention and thus do not suggest
30 the harmful organism control effect of the compounds of the present
   invention.
   [0006]          Patent    documents       1,   2,  and    3   disclose   cyclic
   octadepsipeptides     and  their   endoparasite     control   effect.   These
   documents, however, do not disclose the compounds of the present
35 invention and thus do not suggest harmful organism control effect of the
   compounds of the present invention.

                                          2
   [0007]           Patent    documents     4,  5,  and    6   disclose  cyclic
   octadepsipeptides as endoparasite control agents. These documents,
   however, do not disclose the compounds of the present invention and
   thus do not suggest harmful organism control effect of the compounds of
 5 the present invention.
   [0008]           Patent document 7 discloses FKI-1033 substances as
   cyclic octadepsipeptides and discloses inhibitory effect of ryanodine
   receptors.   This document, however, does not disclose the compounds
   of the present invention and thus does not suggest harmful organism
10 control effect of the compounds of the present invention.
   [0009]           Patent document 8 discloses cyclic octadepsipeptides
   and insecticidal activity thereof against silkworms, Spodoptera litura, and
   Bursaphelenchus      xylophilus.     This document,    however, does not
   disclose the compounds of the present invention and thus does not
15 suggest harmful organism control effect of the compounds of the present
   invention.

   [0123]           The harmful organism control agent according to the
   present invention can also be prepared using compounds represented by
35 formula (1) and carriers depending upon use thereof.
   [0124]           When the harmful organism control agent according to

                                           48
   the present invention is an agricultural and horticultural harmful organism
   control agent, the above compounds are generally mixed with suitable
   solid carriers, liquid carriers, gaseous carriers, surfactants, dispersants,
   or other adjuvants for preparations and formulated into any suitable dosage
 5 forms,  for   example,    emulsifiable     concentrates,   liquid formulations,
   suspensions, wettable powders, floables, dusts, granules, tablets, oils,
   aerosols or smoking agents.

20 [0127]          Gaseous carriers include, for example, LPG, air, nitrogen,
   carbon dioxide, and dimethyl ether.
   [0128]          Surfactants    or   dispersants    usable,    for example,     for
   emulsifying, dispersing, or spreading include, for example, alkylsulfuric
   esters, alkyl(aryl)sulfonic acid salts, polyoxyalkylene alkyl(aryl) ethers,
25 polyhydric alcohol esters, and lignin sulfonic acid salts.
   [0129]          Adjuvants     usable     for  improving     the    properties   of
   preparations include, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, gum arabic,
   polyethylene glycol and calcium stearate.
   [0130]          The    above      carriers,   surfactants,     dispersants    and
30 adjuvants may be used either solely or in combination according to need.
   [0131]          The content of the active ingredient in the preparation is
   not particularly limited,    but is generally      1 to 75%       by weight for
   emulsifiable concentrate, 0.3 to 25% by weight for dust, 1 to 90% by
   weight for wettable powder and 0.5 to 10% by weight for granules.
35 [0132]           Compounds      represented by formula (1),          preparations
   containing them, and admixtures thereof with other harmful organism

                                          49
   control agents can be applied to harmful insects, plants, and plant
   propagation      materials,  for  example,   seeds, plant foliages, roots,
   germinated      plants, and    embryo plants, soil, nutrient solutions in
   nutriculture, solid media in nutriculture, and room where the entry of
 5 pests should be prevented.
   [0133]            The application thereof may be carried out before and
   after the entry of insect pests.
   [0134]            In particular, compounds represented by formula (1),
   preparations containing them, and admixtures thereof with other harmful
10 organism control agents can control harmful organisms by applying an
   effective amount thereof to an object selected from the group consisting
   of seeds, roots, tubers, bulbs, and rhizomes of plants, germinated plants,
   embryo plants, soil, nutrient solutions in nutricultures, solid media in
   nutricultures, and systematically translocating the compound of formula
15 (1) into the plant.
   [0135]            When the object is a seed, root, tuber, bulb, or rhizome of
   a    plant,  any application     method   that  does not    inhibit systemic
   translocation can be adopted without particular limitation, and examples
   of suitable application methods include dipping, dust coating, smearing,
20 spraying, pelleting, or coating.
   [0136]            When the object is a seed, application methods usable
   herein include dipping, dust coating, smearing, spraying, pelleting,
   coating, and fumigating. The dipping is a method in which seeds are
   dipped in a chemical solution.       The dust coating is classified into two
25 types, i.e., a dry dust coating method in which a powdery chemical is
   adhered onto dry seeds, and a wet dust coating method in which a
   powdery chemical is adhered onto seeds which have been lightly soaked
   in water.     The smearing is a method in which a suspended chemical is
   coated on the surface of seeds within a mixer.           The spraying is a
30 method in which a suspended chemical is sprayed onto the surface of
   seeds.      The pelleting is a method in which a chemical is mixed with a
   filler when seeds, together with the filler, are pelleted to form pellets
   having given size and shape.          The coating is a method in which a
   chemical-containing film is coated onto seeds.         The fumigating is a
35 method in which seeds are sterilized with a chemical which has been
   gasified within a hermetically sealed vessel.

                                           50
   [0137]            Compounds      represented by formula (1),      preparations
   containing them, and admixtures thereof with other harmful organism
   control agents can also be applied to, in addition to seeds, germinated
   plants which are transplanted after germination or after budding from
 5 soil, and embryo plants.          These plants can be protected by the
   treatment     of   the   whole   or   a   part  thereof  by  dipping    before
   transplantation.
   [0138]            In application, for example, to seeds, roots, tubers, bulbs,
   or rhizomes, the seeds, roots, tubers, bulbes, or rhizomes may be
10 planted or dipped for a period of time enough to allow the drug to be
   systematically translocate.      The time and temperature in dipping may be
   properly determined       by a person having ordinary skill in the art
   depending, for example, upon the object to be applied and the type and
   amount of the chemical.            The systemic translocation time is not
15 particularly limited and may be, for example, one hr or longer.            The
   temperature in the systemic translocation is, for example, 5 to 451C.
   [0139]            An example of the method for application to soil is a
   method in which granules of compounds of the present invention,
   preparations containing them, and admixtures thereof with other harmful
20 organism control agents are applied into soil or on soil.            Preferred
   methods for application to soil include spreading, stripe application,
   groove application, and planting hole application.            The spreading
   includes surface treatment over the whole area to be treated, and
   mechanical introduction into soil following the surface treatment.
25 [0140]            Drenching of soil with a solution prepared by emulsifying
   or dissolving derivatives of the present invention, preparations containing
   them, and admixtures thereof with other harmful organism control agents
   in water is also an advantageous soil application method.
   [0141]            In application to a nutrient solution in nutrient solution
30 culture systems such as water culture and solid medium culture, for
   example, sand culture, NFT (nutrient film technique), or rock wool
   culture,   for   the   production    of  vegetables   and flowering plants,
   compounds of the present invention, preparations containing them, and
   admixtures thereof with other harmful organism control agents can be
35 applied directly to artificial culture soil containing vermiculite and a solid
   medium including an artificial mat for raising seedling.

   [0142]           In the application step, the effective amount of the
   compound of formula (1) or salt thereof is preferably an amount large
   enough to allow the compound of formula (1) to be systemically
   translocated into the plant in the subsequent systemic translocation step.
 5 [0143]          The effective amount can be properly determined by
   taking into consideration, for example, the properties of compounds, the
   type and amount of the application object, the length of the subsequent
   systemic translocation step, and the temperature.        For example, in the
   case of seeds, the compound of formula (1) or salt thereof is applied in
10 an amount of preferably 1 g to 10 kg, more preferably 10 g to 1 kg, per
   10 kg of seeds.    On the other hand, in application to soil, the compound
   of formula (1) or salt thereof is applied in an amount of preferably 0.1 g
   to 10 kg, more preferably 1 g to 1 kg, per 10 ares of cultivated land.      In
   treatment of foliage of plants, the compound of formula (1) or salt thereof
15 is applied in an amount of preferably 0.1 g to 10 kg, more preferably 1 g
   to 1 kg, per 10 ares of cultivated land.

   example, fatty acid sorbitan, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, and fatty acid
   polyoxyethylene.     The content of the active ingredients in the composition
   for controlling ectoparasiticides according to the present invention is
   generally 0.5 to 70% by weight for the cream.
20 [0147]            The capsules, pills or tablets may be used in such a manner
   that the active ingredients in the composition according to the present
   invention are divided into suitable small portions, the small portion is mixed
   with a diluting solution or a carrier such as starch, lactose, or talc, a
   disintegrator such as magnesium stearate and/or a binder is further added
25 thereto, and, if necessary, the mixture is tabletted.
   [0148]            Injections should be prepared as an aseptic solution.      The
   injection may contain other substances, for example, a salt or glucose in an
   amount enough to be isotonicated with blood.        Carriers usable for injection
   preparation include organic solvents, for example, esters such as glycerides,
30 benzyl benzoate, isopropyl myristate, and fatty acid derivatives of propylene
   glycol, N-methylpyrrolidone, and glycerol formal.     The content of the active
   ingredients in the harmful organism control agent according to the present

   dissolved at 00C in 600 ml of water, and an aqueous 47% hydrogen
   bromide solution was added dropwise thereto.               When the reaction
   solution has become homogeneous, 200 ml of a 5N sodium nitrite
   solution was added dropwise.         The mixture was stirred at 00C for 30 min
15 and was then stirred at room temperature for 24 hr.          Diethyl ether was
   added to the reaction solution, and the mixture was extracted five times.
   A diethyl ether phase was dried over sodium sulfate and was then
   concentrated.       The residue was dissolved in ethanol, and a 9.5N
   ethanol solution of potassium hydroxide was added dropwise at -400C.
20 The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hr, and the reaction
   solution was concentrated.        The resultant white solid was suspended in
   ethanol, and the suspension was stirred at 600C for one hr and was then
   filtered through Kiriyama Rohto to collect a white solid.        The collected
   white solid was washed twice with ethanol at 600C.         The white solid (50
25 g)    was    dissolved     in   264   ml   of   dichloromethane,     90   g   of
   benzyltrimethylammonium chloride and 52 ml of benzyl bromide were
   added thereto, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 8 hr.            The
   reaction solution was returned to room temperature before diethyl ether
   was added.      The organic phase was washed with water and saturated
30 brine, was dried over sodium sulfate, and was concentrated.                 The
   resultant crude product was purified by flash column chromatography

   powder prepared by mixing wheat bran, MF feed (ORIENTAL YEAST
   Co., Ltd.), and dry yeast at a wheat bran : MF feed : dry yeast of 25 : 5 :
   1 to prepare a feed for larvae of Musca domestica.     The feed containing
   the compound was lightly packed in a 3-ml vial, and eight eggs were
35 released.    The mouth of the vial was closed with a meshed lid, and the
   vial was left to stand at 251C.    The number of larvae was counted five

                                           96
   days after the chemical treatment, and the death rate was calculated by
   the following equation.      The test was carried out by replicating each
   treatment twice.
   [0254] Death rate (%) = {number of dead larvae/(number of survived
 5 larvae + number of dead larvae)} x 100
                     As a result, treatment of 12.5 ppm showed a death rate of
   100% for compounds 57 and 58.
   [0255] Test      Example    21:   Tickicidal effect  against   Haemaphysalis
   longicornis

   was bonded to a surface of a back surface of a mouse.          A compound of
   the present invention (9.5 tg) was dissolved in ethanol, and the solution
   was dropped on the surface of the body of the mouth within the capsule.
   After thorough drying, ten nymphal ticks of Haemaphysalis longicornis
15 were released, and the upper portion of the capsule was lidded for
   hermetical closing.     The mouse was grown in a cage at 25 0 C for 12 hr
   under light phase conditions.       Five days after the release, the capsule
   was removed, and survival or death of the nymphal ticks and the number
   of blood sucked individuals were measured, and the death/anguish rate
20 was calculated by the following equation.
   [0256]    Death/anguish      rate   (%)    =  {number    of   dead/anguished
   insects/(number of survived ticks + number of dead/anguished insects)}
   x  100
                     As a result, treatment of 9.5 pg showed an insecticidal
25 activity of not less than 70% in terms of death/anguish rate for compound
   27.
   [0257]    Test Example      22:   Anthelminticidal  effect  against adult    of
   Ascaridiidae galli (in-vitro test)
                     The activity of compounds was evaluated based on a
30 change in motility of adults of A. galli.        Compounds of the present
   invention were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the solution was
   added to a culture solution of A. galli that had been dissolved in a
   Ringer's solution to a compound concentration of 50 ppm.          Six adults of
   A. galli were placed per culture solution, followed by culturing at 41 0 C.
35 After the elapse of 24 hr, the motility of the adults of A. galli was
   observed for the evaluation of the activity of the compounds.

                                            97
   [0258]          As a result, compound 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 19, 54, and 61 of the
   present invention had a high anthelminticidal activity of four insects that
   had stopped automatic motility.
   [0259] Test Example 23: Anthelminticidal effect against mature larvae of
 5 Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (insect combating test in mice)
                    Compounds of the present invention were suspended in a
   0.05% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution to give a concentration of
   50 mg/kg, and the suspension was orally administered once with a
   stomach tube to a mouse artificially infected with N. brasiliensis.     Three
10 days after the administration, the mouse was autopsied to count the
   number of N. brasiliensis parasitic in small intestine, and the anthelmintic
   rate (%) was calculated by the following equation using infected mice
   without medication as control.       One adiminstration lot consisted of three
   mice, and the anthelmintic rate was expressed in terms of average value
15 per one administration lot.       When a mouse was dead during the test
   period, the anthelmintic rate was determined based on mice excluding
   the dead mouse.
   [0260] Anthelmintic rate (%) = {(number of parasites in control mice
   -number of parasites in medicated infected mice)/number of parasites in
20 control mice} x   100
                   As a result, compounds 4, 5, 10, and 21 had a high
   anthelmintic activity of not less than 70%.
   [0261]           Compounds according to the present invention had an
   excellent control     activity, for example,     against   Plutella xylostella,
25 Spodoptera litura, Aphis gossypii, Rhopalosiphum padi, Frankliniella
   occidentalis,  Trialeurodes       vaporariorum,   Trigonotylus caelestialium,
   Tetranychus uruticae, Tetranychus kanzawai, Panonychus citri, and
   Aculops lycopersici.     Accordingly, it was found that compounds of the
   present invention can be utilized as agricultural and horticultural harmful
30 organism    control    agents,     particularly as   control  agents   against
   Lepidopteran    insect pests, Hemipteran insect pests, Thysanopteran
   insect pests, and Acarina insect pests.
   [0262]           In   particular,   compounds    according   to   the present
   invention exerted control effect against both Tetranychidae of genus
35 Tetranychus and genus Panonychus in Acarina insect pests, exertedhigh
   activity against many strains having different drug sensitivity and

                                         98
   resistant strains of existing drugs, and, further, have been found to have
   control effect attained by treatment of adult insects and eggs.     Thus, it
   was found that compounds of the present invention can be utilized as
   control agents especially against Acarina insect pests (particularly
 5 Tetranychidae or rust mites).
   [0263]           Further, compounds of the present invention were also
   found to have an excellent control activity against Musca domestica,
   Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ascaridiidae galli, and Nippostrongylus
   brasiliensis.   Thus, compounds of the present invention were found to
10 be utilizable as control agents against hygiene pests, offensive insect
   pests, stored grain insect pests, stored food pests, house insect pests,
   and zooparasitic pests.
