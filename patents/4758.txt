           AN IMPORVED PET HARNESS WITH DETACHABLE PADDING
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]     The present disclosure generally relates to harnesses for pets, more specifically the
present invention relates to an improved pet harness with detachable neck cum chest pad that
ensures the pet doesn't strain against a leash coupled to the harness when a pet handler pulls
the leash.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0002]     Now days pets, such as dogs are becoming part of people's lifestyle. We see people
taking their dogs with them for beach trips, swimming, canine sporting etc, where it is desired
the harnesses that they use for their pets are lightweight, comfortable and at the same time
safe for the pets.
[0003]     It is known fact that the pets must be controlled when outside the owner's property
and trained to acceptable behavior in any location. The pets must also be exercised when not
allowed to run free, most generally by being taken on walks. Most pets have collars for
attachment to a leash. Mostly, rambunctious or energetic pets' pulls on the leash, which is
unpleasant for the pet handler and can cause dangerous falls and in many cases can cause
neck or chest injury to the pet itself. Therefore use of harnesses over collars has grown in the
past years for the purpose of comfort, and pet handling.
                                                 1

[00041     Traditionally, the harnesses fit around the pet's body with an attachment to the
leash for facilitating the pet handler to hold the pet. A conventional harness generally
includes a collar section that wounds on the neck of the pet, a torso section mounted
generally on a torso area of the pet and positioned between forelegs and hind legs, these two
sections are then connected by connecting means on the upper and ventral side of the pet. The
connecting means are provided with some metal ring to allow the leash connection. Such
conventional harnesses are not adaptive in nature that would allow the pet handler to
customize the harness for additional safety and comfort of the pets.
[0005]     Some of conventional pet harnesses are described in the prior art patents,
US6694923 assigned to Brandon K Fouche., US5893339 assigned to Chun Chien Liu,
US6167844 assigned to Kristen Ruth Cantrell, Jeffery Dirk Cantrell. All of these disclose
training and control collars or harnesses for pets which typically include a body band that is
fitted around the pet's body, a neck piece attached to the body band that fits around the pet's
neck, and a chest piece attaches to both the neck piece and the body band. Such chest piece
provides support and restricts the pet's neck and spreads the force applied from the leash to
the pet's upper body in addition to the pet's neck, however, these conventional harnesses,
particularly the collar section or neck piece can choke or put an enormous stress on the pet's
neck when the leash is pulled by the animal handler. Further, the neck or collar piece is not
very comfortable for the pets.
[0006]     In the past, attempts are made to withstand this shortcoming. One of those includes
US6662755 assigned to Poochie-Pompreece Co., Ltd, US '755 describes a conventional
harness with a moveable lead connecting ring to prevent reversal and torsion of the collar and
trunk bands of the harness. Further, US20060288958 assigned to Brad L. Schant discloses
                                                2

about a pet harness having chest and girth panel that's typically formed from a durable fabric
material and may include internal or surface padding.
[0007]      Although attempts are made but there still remains a room for further improvement
in the field of pet harnesses to provide a harness that would offer additional comfort and
adequate safety to the pets, particularly dogs and the like.
                                           SUMMARY
[0008]      It is an objective of the present invention to provide an improved pet harness that
would ensure the pet doesn't strain against the leash coupled to the harness when the pet
handler pulls the leash or the pet itself pulls the leash.
[0009]      Another objective of the present invention is to provide a pet harness that is
adaptable to the pet handler's need and can be customized for pet training, beach and lake
trips for the pets, swimming for the pets, canine sporting events for the pets.
[0010]      Another objective of the present invention is to provide a light weight and

the first ring at the proximal end, and fixedly connected to a mid region of a fourth strap at
the distal end, the fourth strap including a third engaging member, and a fourth engaging
member at two free ends thereof.
[0012]      The pet harness further comprises of a second section configured to cover dorsal
and torso region of the pet. The second section comprises of a fifth strap with a proximal end
and a distal end, wherein the fifth strap is connected to a second ring at the proximal end, and
includes a first set of eyelets configured to engage with the first engaging member of the first
strap, a sixth strap with a proximal end and a distal end, wherein the sixth strap is connected

[0027]      Referring to FIGs.1-2, there is shown a front view of an improved pet harness 100
with detachable neck cum chest pad or a Y-shaped padding 130. The improved pet harness
100 essentially comprises of two parts, namely a main body 102 of the harness 100 and the
detachable Y-shaped padding 130.
[0028]     As shown in FIG.3A, the main body 102 of the harness 100 includes a first section
and a second section. The first section and the second section are put together to cover the
pet's ventral region and dorsal region forming two loops or bands that are positioned around
collar and torso region of the pet 200. The first section covering the ventral region of the pet
                                                  7

200 comprises of a first strap 104 with a proximal end and a distal end. The first strap 104 is
connected to a first ring 105 at its proximal end, and to a first engaging member 106 at its
distal end. The first section further includes a second strap 107 with a proximal end and a
distal end. The second strap 107 is connected to the first ring 105 at its proximal end, and to a
second engaging member 108 at its distal end. The first section further includes a third strap
109 with a proximal end and a distal end. The third strap 109 is connected to the first ring 105
at its proximal end, and fixedly connected to a mid region of a fourth strap 110 at its distal
end. As seen, the fourth strap 110 includes a third engaging member 111, and a fourth
engaging member 112 at two free ends thereof. According to the embodiment, the first strap
104, the second strap 107 and the fourth strap 110 may also comprise of one or more strap
retainers 136 paired up with the first, the second , the third and the fourth engaging members
106, 108, 111, 112 respectively
[0029]     The main body 102 of the harness 100 further includes a second section configured
to cover dorsal region of the pet 200. The second section comprises of a fifth strap 113 with a
proximal end and a distal end. The fifth strap 113 is connected to a second ring 114 at the
proximal end and includes a first set of eyelets 115 configured to engage with the first
engaging member 106 of the first strap 104.
[0030]     The second section further comprises a sixth strap 116 with a proximal end and a
distal end. The sixth strap 116 is connected to the second ring 114 at the proximal end, and
includes a second set of eyelets 117 configured to engage with the second engaging member
108 of the second strap 107.
                                                8

[0031]     The second section further comprises a seventh strap 118 with a proximal end and
a distal end. The seventh strap 118 is connected to the second ring 114 at the proximal end,
and fixedly connected to a mid region of an eighth strap 119 at the distal end. The eighth
strap 119 includes a third set of eyelets 120, and a fourth set of eyelets 121 at two free ends
thereof for engagement to the third engaging member 111, and the fourth engaging member
112 of the fourth strap 110. Although, it is shown that number of eyelets 115, 117, 120,121 in
respective straps 113, 116, 119 are just 3 to 4 in number. It should be understood that, the
number of eyelets can vary based on the requirement.
[0032]     According to the embodiment, the rings 105, 114 present in the main body 102 of
the harness 100 may comprise but not limited to a circular ring, and a triangular ring or the
like or any combinations thereof. Further, the engaging members 106, 108, 111, 112 and
corresponding eyelets 115,117,120,121 to which the engaging members engage to are shown
to be one of preferred form of size adjustment mechanism to ensure the harness 100 allows
adjustment for different sized pets that may vary in height and girth. The engaging members
106, 108, 111, 112 may be any commonly available off-the-shelf buckles and adjusters used
for belts, backpacks, bags etc. or the like to allow adjustment for height and/or girth when
engage to the corresponding set of eyelets 115, 117, 120, 121. Although off-the-shelf
engaging members or buckles 106, 108, 111, 112 are depicted in the embodiment, it should
be understood that these buckles could be replaced with a multitude of fastening means for
example: hook and loop closures (Velcro or the like), snaps, buttons etc could easily be
integrated sewn, stitched, glued in such a way that they provide the same or similar
buckling/closure feature as that of eyelets 115, 117, 120, 121 and the engaging members 106,
108, 111, 112 shown in the accompanying figures.
                                                9

[0033]    Also, as seen in the accompanying figures, the proximal ends of the straps 104,
107, 109 are connected to the ring 105 by folding and sewing the ends onto the rings 104,
107,109. However, it should be understood that, many other ways of connecting the proximal
ends of the straps 104, 107,109 onto the ring 105 may be possible, for example, by means of
folding and gluing the ends onto the ring 105. Similarly, the proximal ends of the straps 113,
116,118 may be connected to the second ring 114 in the like fashion.
[0034]     Further, as can be seen, the distal ends of the straps 109, and 118 are fixedly
attached in the mid region of the straps 110 and 119 respectively. As seen, the distal ends of
the straps 109, and 118 may be fixedly attached onto the straps 110 and 119 by sewing.
However, any other suitable mechanism such as gluing or the like may also be used.
[0035]     Further as seen in FIG. 3A and FIG.5, the harness 100 of the present invention
may be provided with some metal ring (Eg. a D ring) 140 to allow the leash connection so
that an end of an external leash 150 may be hooked into the ring 140 and the other end could
be held by the pet handler when he/she takes the dog out for a walk or beach trips, swimming,
canine sporting etc.
[0036]     Referring now to FIG. 3B that shows front view of the detachable Y-shaped
padding or the detachable neck cum chest pad 130 of the improved pet harness of FIG.1. As
seen, the Y-shaped padding 130 comprises of a first arm 131, a second arm 132, and a linear
body 133 extending from a junction formed by the first arm 131 and the second arm 132. The
first arm 131, the second arm 132, and the linear body 133 includes one or more attaching
members 134 distributed over their top surface to facilitate attachment of the detachable Y
shaped padding 130 over the first strap 104, the second strap 107 and the third strap 109
                                              10

covering the ventral and collar region of the pet 200, when the harness 100 is put on the body
of the pet 200 as shown in FIGs.5-6.       The padding 130 may comprise of any suitable soft
materials (foam, fabric etc) covered with pieces of suitable fabrics on top and bottom be
suitably stitched or sewed so that the soft material embodied inside the padding 130 remains
in place when the padding is in use around the dogs body.
[0037]     According to the embodiments of the present invention, the first arm 131, the
second arm 132 and the linear body 133 forming the padding 130 comprises of a width
essentially more than the width of the first strap 104, the second strap 107, and the third strap
109 respectively as best shown in FIGs. 4A-4C.
[0038]     According to some other embodiments, the width of the first arm 131, the second
arm 132 and the linear body 133 forming the padding 130 can be made substantially same as
width of the first strap 104, the second strap 107, and the third strap 109 over which the
padding 130 is laid on. As seen in FIG. 4C, the first arm 131, the second arm 132, and the
linear body 133 comprises a plain surface at their bottom to provide comfort to the pet 200
when the harness 100 is wound around the pet 200 as shown in FIGs 5-6. Not only this, the
padding 130 (in fact the soft material filled inside the padding) ensures the pet 200 doesn't
strain against the leash 150 coupled to the harness 100 when the pet handler pulls the leash
150 or the pet 200 itself tries to pull the leash 150 when the pet 200 is taken beach trips, or
being trained etc.
[0039]     One of the advantages of the proposed improved pet harness 100 is that the harness
100 allows adaptability and the pet handler or care taker may chose to use padding 130 along
with the main body 102 of the harness 100 to provide safety when the pet 200 is being
                                                11

trained or taken to walk, or remove the padding 130 when the pet 200 needs to be taken out
for swimming, canine sporting which requires harnesses to be less heavy as well as less
hindering to the dog's movement.
[0040]     Further, as shown in FIGs.5-6, the first arm 131, the second arm 132, and the
linear body 133 forming the detachable Y-shaped padding 130 ensures safety to a neck
region, a chest region and/or ventral region of the pet 200 when in the harness 100 is in use.
[0041]     According to the embodiment, the attaching members 134 distributed over the top
surface of the padding 130 are provided in the form of Velcro closure, wherein male portions
and female portions of the Velcro closures 134 engage with each other to ensure the first
strap 106, the second strap 107 and the third strap 109 over which the padding 130 is laid
remains retained in place. Although, the attaching members 134 is preferably shown to be in
the form of the Velcro closure , it should be understood that various similar closure
techniques may alternatively be used that can retain the first strap 106, the second strap 107
and the third strap 109 over which the padding 130 is laid.
[0042]     Although the current disclosure doesn't emphasize more onto the way the harness
100 could be produced. It should be understood that the harness 100 of the present invention
can be produced or manufactured by weaving, cutting, fabricating, die-cutting or the like
some or all the straps together in one part (or more parts), then adding/combining
components (if desired) by sewing weaving, gluing, etc. or the like. It can be understood that
there are many ways of manufacturing the harness 100 within the scope of the invention by
combining, dividing, adding, removing, parts, pieces, features etc. Further, the pet harness
                                               12

100 of the present invention may be constructed in a wide variety of sizes and style
variations.
[0043]      Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail for
purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
