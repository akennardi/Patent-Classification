   SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ADMINISTRATION AND TRACKING
       OF NON-WAGERING ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH GAMING
                                         ENVIRONMENT
       The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn>, filed on 30 March 2016, the content of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety.
                                          BACKGROUND
       Within the gaming establishments, such as casinos, gaming devices are typically
networked via a central computer. Such configuration allows for the gaming establishment to
monitor a player's garneplay for tracking purposes. Gaming devices typically issue paper
tickets that are redeemable for cash. These paper tickets can be redeemed either rat assisted
service counters (i.e., a casino cage) or through self-service computer systems, sometimes call
Ticket-In-TickeOut (TITO) machines. Drawbacks of using paper tickets, however, is that the
players may very easily lose tickets, tickets can become destroyed or damaged, casinos incur
cost from replenishing tickets, and casinos incur costs for maintaining ticket printers.
Additionally, the use of tickets requires that operators of casinos ensure that sufficient amounts
of cash are available on the gaming floor to accommodate redemptions at both the assisted
service counters and the TITO machines. Players wishing to play a table game at a casino
typically first exchange cash for an amount of chips which can then be used for gaming. When
the player wants to convert the chips back to the cash, the player typically exchanges their chips
for an equivalent amount of cash at a cashier cage at the casino. Thus, in addition to ensure
sufficient cash is available for ticket redemptions, operators of casinos must ensure also
sufficient amounts of cash are available at the cashier cage to accommodate player exchanging
chips for cash. This process for routinely replenishing cash by the casino operator is both costly
and burdensome.
       Additionally, in many gaming establishments players can register demographic
information to obtain a player card, sometimes referred to as a loyalty card. Typical player
cards include a unique identifier that enables the casino to centrally track the player's wagering
activity. Applying the player's historic activity, the gaming establishment can, for example,

                                                 la
develop a targeted marketing campaign including promotions, gifts, and advertisements. A
problem with casino loyalty systems, however, is that they do not capture spending player
activity that occurs in non-gaming environments, such the player's purchases at a merchant or
the player's ATM activity.
       Therefore, the filed can be benefit from systems and methods providing cashless wagering
and redemption, which provides advantages to both game players and casino operators. The

                                                      2
   field can also benefit from systems and methods that conveniently allow a gaming establishment
   to track player gaming activity and player purchase activity, both inside and outside the casino,
   to associate such activity with the player's loyalty profile.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            The presently disclosed system and methods can generally allow for gaming-related
 0 financial transactions. As described in more detail below, utilizing a financial facilitator, a player
   can selectively transfer funds between various types of gaming accounts and an associated
   account, such as a stored value account and/or a casino level player account. The stored value
   account can be a financial account that is maintained by an issuing financial institution, with
   funds in the stored value account accessible to the cardholder through an associated stored value
 5 payment vehicle using open-loop or closed-loop payment processing, for example. The stored
   value payment vehicle can be any suitable payment vehicle, such as a physical card, a virtual
   payment device, or have any other suitable format. The stored value payment vehicle can be a
   general purpose reloadable prepaid card.
            Gaming environments can utilize different types of gaming accounts, such as casino level
 o player accounts and/or wagering accounts.       With regard to wagering accounts, some types of
   wagering accounts are regulated by jurisdictional gaming statutes.            For the purposes of
   illustration, three different types of wagering accounts are described herein (internet gaming
   wagering     accounts,   brick-and-mortar  wagering    accounts,   and   race-and-sports    wagering
   accounts), although this disclosure is not so limited. In fact, the systems and methods described
25 herein are generally applicable to the transfer of between any suitable wagering account and an
   associated stored value account, or intermediary account, such as a casino level player account,
   as described below.
            As used herein, internet gaming wagering account (or iGaming wagering account),
   generally means an electronic ledger wherein the following types of transactions relative to
30 internet or mobile gaming system are recorded:        (a) deposits; (b) withdrawals; (c) amounts
   wagered; (d) amounts paid on winning wagers; (e) service or other transaction-related charges
   authorized by the patron; and (f) adjustments to the account.

                                                     4
           As used herein, brick-and-mortar wagering account generally means an electronic ledger
   for a brick-and-mortar cashless wagering system patron deposit account wherein the following
   types of transactions are recorded to and from gaming devices (i.e.; slots):        (a) deposits and
   withdrawals of cash or cash equivalents at a designated area of accountability; (b) deposits
 5 initiated with a debit instrument; (c) wagering account transfers to and from gaming devices; (d)
   wagering account adjustments.
           As used herein, race-and-sports wagering account generally means an electronic ledger
   wherein the following types of transactions relative to sports and non-pari-mutuel race wagers
   are recorded: (a) deposits; (b) withdrawals; (c) amounts wagered; (d) amounts paid on winning
 0 wagers; (e) amounts paid for horse racing-related services or merchandise; (f) service or other
   transaction-related charges authorized by the patron; and (g) adjustments to the account.
           As described in more detail below, a financial facilitator can generally direct or enable
   transactions with the issuing financial institution to affect the increasing and decreasing of an
   account balance of the stored value account. A financial facilitator can also generally direct or
 5 enable transactions with a computing system that manages a gaming account of a gaming
   environment to affect the increasing and decreasing of an account balance of the gaming account.
   The issuing financial institution can also receive communications related to the stored value
   account in a traditional fashion via an open system from merchants through existing bank card
   networks. Such communications can authorize/decline purchases using funds held in the stored
 o value account.
           A player can be associated with a unique player identifier that can be used by a casino or
   other gaming environment to identify a particular player. Such a player identifier may be issued
   subsequent to the player enrolling in a casino loyalty program, for example. In some cases, the
   unique player identifier is embossed on a player card, sometimes referred to as a loyalty card, or
25 is otherwise accessible or presentable by a player. The player identifier can be a graphical code,
   such as a quick-response (QR) code displayable on a mobile computing device or the player
   identifier can be a barcode printed on a keychain fob or other substrate. In any event, the player
   identifier can be provided to a gaming device or casino representative to enable the casino to
   centrally track the player's wagering activity. The player identifier is linked by the issuing entity
30 (such as a casino) a loyalty profile that can be stored or otherwise maintained by customer
   relationship software that is maintained by the casino or on behalf of the casino by an affiliated
   service provider.

                                                     5
            As described in more detail below, a player identifier for a particular player can be linked
*  to, or otherwise associated with, a stored value account held by a financial institution and
   accessible by the particular player. Such a linkage or association offers a variety of benefits, both
   to players and an associated casino. For example, a player can interact with a gaming device
 5 (such as a slot machine) by providing a player identifier to the device. In some cases, additional
   credentials, such as a PIN or password, can be provided by the player. Through network
   communications, the gaming device can communicate with various computing platforms, such as
   a slot management system and/or casino management system, which generally may be referred to
   as a casino computing system, to authenticate the player's identity.        Once authenticated, the
 o player can selectively access funds that are maintained in the stored value account of an issuing
   financial institution for use at the gaming device. The casino computing system can communicate
   with a transaction facilitator (such as through API-calls, or other suitable communication
   techniques) to provide the information to identify the player that is seeking to access funds. A
   player identifier of the player can be provided to the transaction facilitator, and as described in
 5 more detail below, the player identifier can be the loyalty account number or other type of
   identifier. The transaction facilitator, in turn, can determine a stored value account associated
   with that player and, through closed network communications with the issuing financial
   institution, dispatch appropriate messaging to debit the stored value account. Indication of a
   successful debit can be provided to the casino computing system by the transaction facilitator.
 O The casino computing system can then credit a one or more gaming accounts of the player to
   increase their available balance. Funds, in the form of gaming credits, can then be distributed to
   the gaming device (sometimes referred to as a wagering account transfer in "WAT in"). At a
   later point in time, when the player wishes to "cash out," the credits of the gaming device can be
   transferred to a gaming account (sometimes referred to as a wagering account transfer out "WAT
25 out"). Once received into the gaming account, the gaming credits can be converted to a fund
   amount and used to credit the stored value account, held in the gaming account, or even
   transferred to another gaming account.
            Various transfers described below can be performed in substantially real-time. As used
   herein, substantially real-time means generally less than about 20 minutes, generally less than
30 about 10 minutes, generally less that about 5 minutes, generally less than about 1 minutes, or
   generally less than about 30 seconds. Therefore, in the example described above, subsequent to
   the player "cashing out", the funds transferred to the stored value account can be accessible to
   make purchases using the associated stored value payment vehicle in substantially real-time

                                                      6
           The stored value payment vehicle can be, for example, a general purpose reloadable card
   (sometimes referred to as a GPR card) that is an open-loop payment vehicle. Being an open loop
   payment vehicle, it is associated with a bank card network (MASTERCARD,                     VISA,
   DISCOVER, and so forth) and can generally be used at any merchant or ATM accepting
 5 payment cards associated with the bank card network.             Open loop transactions seeking
   authorization from funds of the stored value account send authorization requests to the issuing
   financial institution through an open bank card network. In accordance with the systems and
   methods disclosed herein, using secured communication links, the issuing financial institution
   can provide a financial facilitator with information based on stored value card transactions. The
 o financial facilitator can determine a player identifier associated with that stored value account
   and then provide reporting to the casino computing system.         This reporting can be used, for
   example, to supplement or update a loyalty profile of a player based on the increased knowledge
   about the player gained from tracking their spending.
           FIG. 1 is a schematically illustrates an association between a stored value payment
 5 vehicle 116 and a gaming account 188.         The gaming account 188 can be associated with a
   gaming environment 102. As used herein, gaming environment can refer to, without limitation, a
   brick-and-mortar casino and/or an online or virtual casino.           In some cases, the gaming
   environment also extends to entities or services, such as third party computer systems generally
   controlled by or operated on behalf of a casino operator. FIG. 2A depicts a system view and flow
 o process 100 utilizing the stored value payment vehicle 116.
           Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2A, a player 114 can be issued the stored value payment
   vehicle 116 that is associated with a stored value account 128 maintained by an issuer processor
   computing system 126. The issuer processor computing system 126 can be a system used to
   maintain and/or process transactions associated with the stored value payment vehicle 116 and
25 the stored value account 128. The stored value payment vehicle 116 can be a physical card, a
   virtual card, or any other suitable type of vehicle. The stored value payment vehicle 116 can be a
   general purpose reloadable card (sometimes referred to as a prepaid card).        The stored value
   payment vehicle 116 can be an "open-loop card," which a consumer can use anywhere that
   accepts payment from a retail electronic payments network associated with the stored value
30 payment vehicle , such as MASTERCARD, VISA, DISCOVER, and so forth, as discussed
   above. The stored value payment vehicle 116 can be a "closed-loop card", which a consumer can
   use at particular merchant locations, for example. The player 114 can fund (i.e., increase the
   available balance) the stored value account 128 through traditional techniques, such as by

                                                     7
   transfers funds from a demand access account (DDA) and/or funds loaded from a credit card to
   the stored value account 128 through an online interface. As described in more detail below, the
   player 114 can also selectively fund the stored value account 128 from the gaming environment
    102 using cash, jackpot payouts, and numerous other ways, such as chip and slot ticket
 5 redemption.
            The stored value payment vehicle 116 can be used by the player 114 to make "purchases
   at a variety of merchant types. As shown in FIG. 2B, example types of merchants include a
   brick-and-mortar merchant 118, an online merchant 120, an ATM machine 122, and a service
   provider 124. Accordingly, the stored value payment vehicle 116 can be used to facilitate the
 0 transfer of funds from the stored value account 128 through purchase transactions (schematically
   illustrated as transactions 132, 134, 136, and 138). In some cases, a particular merchant may be
   associated with the gaming environment 102, such as affiliated merchant 112. Example affiliated
   merchants 112 can include, without limitation, on-property retailers, restaurants, and hotels.
   While the affiliated merchant 112 is illustrated as being within the gaming environment 102, this
 5 disclosure is not so limited. The affiliated merchant 112 can be an online merchant, for example.
   The stored value payment vehicle 116 can be used for a purchase transaction 130 at such
   affiliated merchants 112.     The purchase transaction 130 can be processed as a closed-loop
   transaction due to the affiliation with the gaming environment or a transaction facilitator, as
   described below. As described in more detail below, the systems and methods described herein
 O can allow for such a purchase transaction 130 by the player 114 to be incentive and/or rewarded.
   The purchase transactions 32, 134, 136, and 138 by the player 114 can also be rewarded, with
   reward levels being the same or different as the rewards or comps associated with purchase
   transaction 130.
            A gaming account can be associated with the casino environment 102. As used herein, a
25 gaming account can be any type of financial account (i.e., electronic ledger) that is associated
   with a player, or collection of financial accounts that are associated with a player, and maintained
   by a casino, or at least on behalf of a casino. While FIG. 1 schematically shows one gaming
   account 188 for the sake of clarity, it is to be appreciated that the player 114 and/or the stored
   value payment vehicle 116 can be associated with any number of gaming accounts 188. Further,
30 the gaming account 188 can be any suitable account type, such as a wagering account(s) and/or a
   gaming account(s). In FIG. 2A, for example, the gaming accounts associated with the play 114
   are illustrated as wagering accounts 104. As described below in connection with FIG. 2B and
   FIG. 5, the gaming account 188 can comprise a casino level player account. Still referring to FIG.

                                                     8
    1, In accordance with the systems and methods described herein, the player 114 can selectively
   direct funds 116A associated with the stored value payment vehicle 116 to the gaming account
    188. The player 114 can also selectively direct funds 116B associated with the gaming account
    188to the stored value payment vehicle 116. In other words, in accordance with the disclosure,
 5 the player 114 can transfer funds, back and forth, in real-time, between a stored value account
    128 and the gaming account 188 of the player 114.            The directed funds 116A, 116B are
   transferred (i.e. credited) to the destination account in substantially real time or a "pause"
   between an initiated transfer and an availability of the transferred funds can be implemented. For
   example, to the extent that regulators and responsible gaming advocates believe that a "pause" is
 o significant to minimize reckless gaming, the systems and methods described herein are adaptable
   to institute certain pauses in accessing funds.
            Using directed funds 1 16A, 1 16B, a player 114 can supply funds for a gaming experience
   within the gaming environment 102, and subsequently cash-out from the gaming experience, all
   without physically handling cash or coins within the gaming environment 102. Since all of the
 5 funds are electronically transferred between a selected gaming account 188 and the stored value
   account 128 as credits and debits, for these particular transactions, the necessity for the player
    102 or the gaming environment 102 to physically handle cash or coins is eliminated. The player
    114 can also bring cash or coins into the gaming environment 102 and selectively transfer such
   funds to their stored value account 128, as described in more detail below (see FIGS. 9-10, for
 o example). Additionally, the player 114 withdraw cash from their stored value account 128 while
   in the gaming environment, as described in more detail below (see FIG. 13, for example).
            Referring again to FIG. 2A, gaming accounts associated with the player 114 are shown as
   wagering accounts 104, which can be managed by management computing system (not shown)
   affiliated with the gaming environment 102. The wagering accounts 104 include a brick-and
25 mortar wagering account 106, a race-and-sport wagering account 108, and an iGaming wagering
   account 110.      The brick-and-mortar wagering account 106 is generally an electronic ledger
   associated with a player's table and slot wagers. The race-and-sport wagering account 108 is
   generally an electronic ledger associated with a player's sports and non-pari-mutuel race wagers.
   The iGaming wagering account 110 is generally an electronic ledger associated with a player's
30 online wagers, such as online poker and virtual gaming. It is noted that in some jurisdictions,
   gaming regulations forbid the transferring of a player's funds stored in one wagering account
    106, 108, 110 directly to another wagering account 106, 108, 110

                                                      9
           FIG. 2B depicts another version of the system view and flow process 100 illustrated in
   FIG. 2A. As shown in FIG. 2B, the system view and flow process 200 additionally comprises a
   gaming account that is a casino level player account 250. The casino level player account 250
   can be generally an electronic ledger associated with a player. It can also be associated one or
 5 more wagering accounts 104. The casino level player account 250 can offer a variety of
   functionality to the player 114. For example, a player 114 can direct funds stored their stored
   value account 128 to the casino level player account 250. The player 114 can direct funds stored
   in one of the wagering accounts 104 or other gaming account to the casino level player account
   250, as opposed to directing the funds to the stored value account 128. The player 114 can then
 0 direct the funds held in the casino level player account 250 to a different wagering account 104.
   Additional details regarding example transfers of funds are described below in connection with
   FIG. 5. The player 114 can selectively utilize funds held by the casino level player account 250
   for closed-loop point of sale transactions, either retail transactions (such as at an affiliated
   merchant 112) or closed-loop cash outs, all while enjoying reduced interchange fees due to the
 5 closed-loop nature of the transactions.    Therefore, in some cases, performing transactions with
   funds in the casino level player account 250 is less costly to the gaming operator of the casino
   environment 102 and to the player 114. For some implementations comprising a casino level
   player account 250, when a player 114 directs funds 116A into the gaming environment 102, the
   player 116 can still direct them to a particular wagering account 104, as illustrated. In other
 o implementations comprising a casino level player account 250, a player 114 can direct funds
    116A into the casino level player account 250. The player 114 can subsequently direct those
   funds to a particular wagering account 104 or use the funds for closed-loop transactions.
           FIG. 3 is a diagrammatic representation of an association between a stored value payment
   vehicle 316 and a gaming account 388. Similar to FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B, the stored value payment
25 vehicle 316 is issued to a player 314, and in accordance with the systems and methods described
   herein, the player 314 can selectively direct the transfer of funds 316A into a gaming account 388
   of a casino environment 302. The player 314 can also direct the transfer of funds 316B from the
   gaming account 388. As is to be appreciated, the gaming account 388 illustrated in FIG. 3 can
   be, without limitation, a wagering account, a casino level player account, or a combination
30 thereof. The stored value payment vehicle 316 is linked to a stored value account (not shown).
           As illustrated, the gaming environment 302 is linked to a player loyalty database 350
   which stores data in the form of a player loyalty profile 352 associated with the player 314. The
   player loyalty profile 352 can include data associated with the gaming history of the player 314,

                                                     10
   incentives, comps, and other tracking-related information, as is known in the art. The loyalty
   profile 352 can also include information related to fund transfer data, as illustrated by data
   capturing 354. Accordingly, the player loyalty profile 352 can include, for example, dates of
   transfers, amounts of transfers, times of transfers, number of transfers, and so forth.
 5         FIG. 4 is similar to the diagrammatic representation of an association between a stored
   value payment vehicle 316 and a gaming account 388 shown in FIG. 3, although FIG. 4
   schematically illustrates additional functionality with regard to player tracking.       A financial
   transaction 364 in which the stored value payment vehicle 316 is used at a merchant 366 is
   shown. The merchant 366 can be, for example, any type of merchant or ATM that accepts the
 o stored value payment vehicle 316 as a form of payment. As illustrated by data capture 362,
   information regarding the financial transaction 364 is provided to the player loyalty profile 352
   utilizing data capture 362.      The player loyalty profile 352 is maintained by a customer
   relationship management engine 360, which can be operated by the gaming operator of the
   gaming environment 302 or a third party service provider. As described in more detail below,
 5 based on the player loyalty profile 352 and/or financial transactions 364, an operator of the
   gaming environment 302, or other parties or entities, can offer various incentives, discounts,
   coupons, deals, programs, or offerings to the player 314. Such offerings can be provided to the
   player 314 through a loyalty account associated with the player loyalty profile 352 and/or
   provided through the stored value payment account.
 O         FIG. 5 schematically illustrates example cash flows between example gaming accounts
   associated with a player 514 along with the cash flows between the gaming accounts and stored
   value payment vehicle 516 issued to the player. The gaming accounts in the casino environment
   502 are shown as a casino level player account a plurality of wagering accounts. In accordance
   with the systems and methods described herein, the player 514 can selectively direct the transfer
25 of funds 516A into a casino level player account 550. The player 514 can also direct the transfer
   of funds 516B from the casino level player account 550. As is to be appreciated, the stored value
   payment vehicle 516 is linked to a stored value account (not shown).          For funds held by the
   casino level player account 550, the player 514 can selectively transfer a portion (or all) of the
   funds in and out of various wagering accounts 506, 508, 510, shown as wagering account 1,
30 wagering account 2 and wagering account 3.         The player 514 can also utilize the casino level
   player account 550 to initiate financial transactions at an affiliated merchant 512 as a closed-loop
   transaction. The affiliated merchant 512 can be, for example, a retailer on a casino property, an
   ATM, or other type of closed-loop merchant.

                                                    11
            FIG. 6 is a diagrammatic representation of another example gaming system and flow
   process 600. This gaming system and flow process 600 includes a networked gaming device
   676, such as a slot machine, a casino kiosk, casino gaming pit computing system, sports book
   computing system, and so forth.. As is generally known in the art, the gaming device 676 can be
 5 in networked communication with a variety of computer-based entities, such as a slot
   management system (SMS) 672 and a casino management system (CMS) 674. In some gaming
   environments, the SMS 672 and the CMS 674 may collectively be considered components of a
   casino computing system. The networked arrangement can include wired and/or wireless
   communication links. Examples of suitable networks can include a local area network (LAN),
 0 virtual private network (VPN), an Internet connection, and/or any other network configuration
   that is capable to enable the CMS 674 and SMS 672 to communicate with the gaming device 676
   and other devices. The networked arrangement can provide two-way communications between
   the CMS 674 and SMS 672 and gaming device 676. The CMS 674 maintains a player loyalty
   profile 612 for a player 614 and maintains gaming accounts for the player 614, shown as
 5 wagering account 614. Other systems can use different configurations without departing from
   the scope of the invention. For example, the player loyalty profile 612 may be maintained by a
   third-party customer relationship management service or the casino gaming system.
            The gaming system can comprise one or more gaming accounts (shown as a single
   gaming account 688 in FIG. 6 for the sake of illustration). While the gaming account 688 is
 O schematically shown within the CMS 674, other gaming environments can maintain the gaming
   account 688 elsewhere, such as by a separate wagering account management entity or a third
   party wagering account provider.      The gaming account comprises a brick-and-mortar gaming
   account, so that gaming credits can be provided to the meter 680 of the gaming device 676, as
   described below.
25          A stored value payment vehicle 616, such as a prepaid debit card, or other suitable type of
   payment vehicle, is issued to the player 614 by a bank or other financial entity.          A player
   identifier 670 is also assigned to the player 614 so that an operator of the gaming environment
   602 can properly identify the player 614. The player identifier 670 can be expressed as a number
   or string that is provided to the player 614 on a physical card (such as a loyalty card or player's
30 card). The player identifier 670 can be graphical-based or be chip-based and utilize near-field
   communication (NFC) protocols, for example. In any event, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the player
   identifier 670 is provided to an input device 678 of the gaming device 676.            As is to be
   appreciated, the particular type of input device 678 used to read the player identifier 670 will

                                                     12
   depend on the particular format of the player identifier 670.      The input device 678 can be a
   magnetic card reader, an optical scanner, number pad, or other type of reader or scanner. In
   addition to providing the player identifier 670, additional credentials (such as a PIN) must be
   provided by the player 614 for authentication purposes. Further, while not illustrated, the gaming
 5 device 676 can be configured to read or scan the stored value payment vehicle 616.
            Upon receiving the player identifier 670, along with any other credentials, the gaming
   device 676 provides the data to the SMS 672 and/or the CMS 674 through network
   communications.      Upon authenticating the identification of the player 614, various types of
   financial transactions related to the stored value payment vehicle 616 and/or the gaming account
 0 688 can be offered to the player 614. Such offerings are provided on a graphical display on the
   gaming device, as provided to the gaming device 676 by communications from the SMS 672
   and/or CMS 674. FOr example, an available balance in a stored value account associated with
   the stored value payment vehicle 616 can be displayed to the player 614. Additional details
   regarding the retrieval of the available balance using a transaction facilitator is described in more
 5 detail below with regard to FIG. 7.      The gaming device 676 can request a dollar amount be
   inputted by the player 614 and once the player 614 selects a dollar amount, a transfer of funds
   616A can be initiated to direct funds associated with the stored value payment vehicle 616 to the
   gaming account 688. Depending on the type of gaming account 688 associated with the player,
   the funds can be transferred directly into a wagering account associated with the gaming device
 o 676. Alternatively, funds can be received in a casino level player account and subsequently
   transferred to a wagering account associated with the gaming device 676. In any event, upon
   receipt of the funds 616A, the funds can be converted to gaming credits. The gaming credits 682
   can then be metered into gaming device 676 by its meter 680.          The player can then use the
   gaming credits for wagering at the gaming device 676, as is known in the art.
25          At the conclusion of a gaming session, the player 614 may desire to transfer any gaming
   credits 682 to the stored value payment vehicle 616 in the form of funds. When the player 614
   initiates a "cash out" action at the gaming device 676, the gaming device 676 prompts the player
   614 to select the "cash out" technique, such as printing a ticket for subsequent redemption or a
   transfer to the stored value account that is associated with the stored value payment vehicle 616.
30 Should the player 614 choose the latter, the gaming credits 682 can be first transferred out of the
   gaming device 676 and into the gaming account 688, where it is converted to funds.             Then a
   transfer of funds 616B is initiated using a closed-loop communications with the financial
   institution maintaining the stored value account to credit that account.       As described in more

                                                      13
   detail below, a transaction facilitator (not shown) can be used to facilitate the transmission of
   such credit and debit messaging. From the perspective of the player 614, the gaming credits that
   had been associated with the gaming device 676 are converted to funds that are available for
   access by the player's stored value payment vehicle 616. Such conversion of gaming credits to
 5 available funds for access by the stored value payment vehicle 616 can be in substantially real
   time.
            FIG. 7 is an example arrangement 700 of a transaction facilitator 790 interacting with
   both a gaming environment 702 and an issuer processor computing system 726. Generally, the
   transaction facilitator 790 receives financial transaction communications from the gaming
 0 environment 702.      In some environments, such messages are received via a communications
   network, such as the SPANm network offered by Sightline Interactive LLC of Las Vegas,
   Nevada. The communications can be received, for example, through an application programing
   interface (API) or other web-based messaging. The transaction facilitator 790 can also be in
   closed communication with the issuer processor computing system 726 that maintains the stored
 5 value account 728 associated with a stored value payment vehicle 716. It is noted that while the
   transaction facilitator 790 is schematically illustrated as a single entity, it is to be appreciated that
   this disclosure is not so limited. Instead, the functionality of the transaction facilitator 790, as
   described herein, can be distributed across, or otherwise performed by, a plurality of various
   entities, such payment gateways, acquirer processors, and other types of payment intermediaries.
 O Also, the transaction facilitator 790, or at least components thereof, can reside within the gaming
   environment 702 or be controlled by an operator of the gaming environment. The transaction
   facilitator 790 can be configured to communicate with the issuer processor computing system
   726 through a secured communication link. Further, the transaction facilitator 790, or at least
   components thereof, can be controlled by the issuer processor computing system 726. Therefore,
25 the transaction facilitator 790 may be operated by, or otherwise controlled by a variety of
   different entities.    The transaction facilitator 790 can also have a one-to-one processing
   relationship with the gaming environment 702, as illustrated. It is to be appreciated, however,
   that the transaction facilitator 790 can also have a one-to-many configuration such that it has a
   processing relationship with a plurality of different gaming environments. The casino computing
30 system 720, which can include one or more processors 722 and one or more computer memory
   units 724, can process the player identifier. For convenience, only one processor 722 and only
   one memory unit 724 are shown in FIG. 7. The processor 722 can execute software instructions
   stored on the memory unit 724. The processor 722 can be implemented as an integrated circuit

                                                      14
   (IC) having one or multiple cores. The memory unit 724 can include volatile and/or non-volatile
   memory units. Volatile memory units can include random access memory (RAM), for example.
   Non-volatile memory units can include read only memory (ROM), for example, as well as
   mechanical non-volatile memory systems, such as, for example, a hard disk drive, an optical disk
 5 drive, etc. The RAM and/or ROM memory units can be implemented as discrete memory ICs,
   for example. The casino computing system 720 can execute the slot management system and the
   casino management system described above.
            Similar to input of the player identifier 670 described in FIG. 6, a player identifier 770
   associated with the player 714 can be provided to the input device 778 of a gaming device 776.
 o The gaming device can have one or more displays 784. The player identifier 712 can be used to
   identify a player loyalty profile 712 of the player. The casino computing system 720 can be
   configured to transmit the player identifier 770, or other player identifying data, to the transaction
   facilitator 790 using a suitable network interface 786.
            Upon receiving the player identifier 770, or other player identifying data, the transaction
 5 facilitator 790 can match the player identifying data to a particular stored value account 728, as
   can be maintained by a player database 792. While the player database 792 is illustrated as a
   component of the transaction facilitator 792, this disclosure is not so limited. Such information
   can be stored by any suitable entity in the system hierarchy, including by an entity within the
   gaming environment 702.        It is noted, however, that by maintaining the player database 792
 o outside the gaming environment 702, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance requirements of
   the gaming environment 702 may be reduced.
            Once the stored value account 728 of the player 714 has been identified by the transaction
   facilitator 790, the transaction facilitator 790 can transmit the appropriate messaging to the issuer
   processor computing system 726.         For example, messages may include a balance inquiry, an
25 authorization request, and so forth.        For fund transfers, the transaction facilitator 790 can
   facilitate the message flow to affect the transfers of funds 728A by debiting the stored value
   account 728 and crediting the gaming account 788 or the message flow to affect the transfers of
   funds 728B by debiting the gaming account 788 and crediting the stored value account 728. As
   described above, funds transferred into the gaming account 788 can be converted to gaming
30 credits 782 for gaming at the gaming device 776. Alternatively, depending on the type of the
   gaming account 788, the funds can be used for other types of gaming, such as iGaming, race-and
   sports gaming, and so forth.

                                                     15
           One deficiency of typical casino loyalty systems is that they cannot capture patron
   spending behavior that occurs in non-gaming environments, such as in casino related restaurants,
   hotel, retail stores, ATM, and so forth. Casino loyalty systems also do not capture spending
   behavior outside their physical property. Therefore, it may be desirable for casinos and other
 5 gaming environments to expand their customer's loyalty programs (i.e., point earning capability)
   to include related non-gaming activity. These expanded programs may encourage greater loyalty
   and patronage of the casino while also providing additional business intelligence regarding
   consumer behavior.
           FIG. 8 illustrates an aspect of the present disclosure that aims to capture patron spending
 0 behavior that occurs in non- gaming environments of a casino, such as in the restaurants, hotels,
   retail establishments, ATM's and well as spending behavior that occurs in non-casino
   environments, such as in the restaurants, hotels, retail establishments, ATM's. The spending
   behavior is captured and related to the consumer's loyalty program for processing. Capturing the
   behavior is possible because of a communication link that is established between a processor of
 5 the transactions based on a stored value payment vehicle and the casino loyalty program
   processor. The player 814 is issued a stored value payment vehicle 816. The player 814 also has
   a player loyalty profile 852 that is maintained by a customer relationship management computing
   system. In accordance with the presently disclosed systems and methods, tracking information
   regarding the player's 814 use of the stored value payment vehicle 816 can be provided to
 o improve the depth and value of player loyalty profile 852.
           The stored value payment vehicle 816 can be used for financial transactions at a variety
   of locations, such as an unaffiliated merchant 818 or an ATM machine 822. These transactions
   can use traditional open-loop payment network communications to seek authorizations from the
   issuer processor computing system 826 associated with the stored value payment vehicle 816, as
25 is known in the art. The stored value payment vehicle 816 can also be used at an affiliated
   merchant 812, such as at a casino hotel or restaurant. Depending on the acquirer processor used
   by the merchants 812, 818 the transaction may be routed to the issuer processor computing
   system 826 through either open-loop network communication links or closed-loop network
   communication links.
30         For both types of transactions, data regarding these transactions can be provided to the
   transaction facilitator 890. Upon receiving (or in some cases retrieving) transactional data, a
   player tracking engine 804 can determine a loyalty profile account associated with the
   cardholder. The player tracking engine 804 can utilize a player database, which may be similar

                                                    16
   to the player database 792 shown in FIG. 7. The transaction facilitator 890 can then dispatch an
   intelligence report 832 to the casino computing system 820 or otherwise make the intelligence
   report 832 available to the casino computing system 820. The intelligence report 832 can be in a
   variety of different forms and include a wide variety of information. The intelligence report 832
 5 can be, for example, data provided to a casino computing system and/or customer relationship
   platform. The intelligence report 832 can be provided using any suitable distribution technique
   and may vary based on implementation.          For example, the intelligence report 832 can be
   provided as a data feed, data file and/or other type of file.     The intelligence report 832 can
   include identifications of the various merchants where the player 814 used, or attempted to use,
 o the stored value payment vehicle 816.
            The player tracking engine 804 can be configured to assign a loyalty value, such as using
   a point system, or other metric, to various transactions involving the stored value payment
   vehicle 816, or the player based on the transactions of the stored value payment vehicle 816.
   Transactions at a first set of merchants, as identifiable by a merchant category code received
 5 from a POS device, may receive a higher point value or different value metric than transactions
   received from a second set of merchants. In one context, financial transactions at the affiliated
   merchant 812 can provide the player 814 with more loyalty "points" than financial transactions at
   the unaffiliated merchant 818. In some cases, the transaction at the unaffiliated merchant 818
   may have zero loyalty value or even have a negative loyalty value. For example, the unaffiliated
 o merchant 818 may be a merchant at a competing casino. Based on the incentivized behavior, the
   player 814 may decide not to use the stored value payment vehicle 816 at unaffiliated merchant
   818 and instead use it at affiliated merchant 812.
            The player tracking engine 804 can accumulate points or other loyalty data/values for the
   player 814 for a particular period and then provide a reporting of the points in the intelligence
25 report 832. Based on the points values, or other metrics, incentives 834 can be provided to the
   player through the player loyalty program.
             A couponing engine 806 can allow for the distribution of merchant-specific coupons as
   part of a loyalty program. The couponing engine 806 can store a table, for example, correlating
   the stored value payment vehicle 816 to particular discounts, coupons, or offers as part of a
30 loyalty program (collectively referred to as coupons) at particular merchants, which may be both
   affiliated and unaffiliated. When an authorization request is received by the issuer processor
   computing system 826 from a POS device associated with a merchant (which may be an

                                                     17
   affiliated or unaffiliated merchant), the issuer processor computing system 826 can query the
   couponing engine 806 to see if a coupon or other offering is available.
            By way of example, a player 814 may have a received a coupon from a casino for $10 off
   a meal at a specific restaurant. For this example, the player 814 has an available balance of $100
 5 in their stored value account 828. The player 814 dines at the restaurant and charges $50 to their
   stored value payment vehicle 816. The POS device seeks authorization from the issuer processor
   computing system, as is known in the art. Upon receiving the authorization request, the issuer
   processor computing system 826 uses the couponing engine 806 to see if a coupon is available
   for use (in this case, based on the cardholder and the merchant). The $10 off a meal coupon is
 0 identified as being applicable. The issuer processor computing system 826 returns a message to
   the POS device at the restaurant authorizing the full $50 charge. The stored value account 828,
   however, is only debited $40, thereby taking the available balance to $60.         Accordingly, a
   coupon was automatically applied to the open-loop transaction using the stored value payment
   vehicle 816 without needing the merchant to apply the coupon to the sale. Once the coupon is
 5 applied to a transaction, the player tracking engine 804 can report the redemption of the coupon
   in the intelligence report 832, or using other forms of reporting.
            Players using the systems and methods described herein in a gaming environment may
   desire to load funds into their stored value account. It may be desirable to load such funds in
   substantially real-time so that the funds are accessible via their stored value payment vehicle
 o relatively quickly. FIG. 9 schematically illustrates various techniques for a player 914 to load
   funds to a stored value account 900 that is associated with a stored value payment vehicle 916.
   The player 914 can utilize any number of fund sources 940, including player-sourced funds 942
   and jackpot funds 944. Referring first to the player-sourced funds 942, a player can approach a
   computing system 920 of the casino environment with the funds 942. The computing system 920
25 may be, for example, an attended computing system (such as a casino cage) or an unattended
   computing system (such as at a kiosk). The type of computing system 920 will determine which
   type of funding module can be executed. For example, the cage module may allow for a player
   914 to load both chips and cash into their stored value account 916. The cage module may also
   allow for the player 914 to load a jackpot 944 into their stored value account 916, which is
30 described in more detail below with regard to FIG. 12. The kiosk module may only allow for a
   player 914 to load cash, coins, or tickets to their stored value account 916. A pit module, which
   can be executed on a computing system accessible by a dealer or a pit boss, can allow for the
   loading of a stored value account 916 using chips. A mobile module may be executing on a

                                                   18
   mobile computing device 920, such as a tablet computer, that can read tickets.         The mobile
   module can facilitate a player 914 transferring funds to/from the stored value account 916
   to/from a gaming account (i.e., an iGaming wagering account). If the computing device 920 is
   part of a gaming device, the slot module can allow for the funding of the stored value account
 5 916 through gaming credits (as described above).
            The computing system 920 can communicate with a transaction facilitator 990 through
   network communications, as described above. The transaction facilitator 990 can be provided
   using any suitable processor-based device or system, such as a personal computer, laptop, server,
   mainframe, or a collection (e.g., network) of multiple computers, for example. The transaction
 0 facilitator 990 can include one or more processors 992 and one or more computer memory units
   994. For convenience, only one processor 992 and only one memory unit 994 are shown in FIG.
   9. The processor 992 can execute software instructions stored on the memory unit 994. The
   processor 992 can be implemented as an integrated circuit (IC) having one or multiple cores.
   The memory unit 994 can include volatile and/or non-volatile memory units. Volatile memory
 5 units can include random access memory (RAM), for example. Non-volatile memory units can
   include read only memory (ROM), for example, as well as mechanical non-volatile memory
   systems, such as, for example, a hard disk drive, an optical disk drive, etc. The RAM and/or
   ROM memory units can be implemented as discrete memory ICs, for example.
            A server 996 can provide a graphical web user interface through which various users
 o (such as players, casino operators, and so forth) can interact with the transaction facilitator 990.
   The server 996 can accept requests, such as HTTP requests, from clients (such as a web browser
   on the computing system 920), and serve the clients responses. The server 996 can provide a
   user interface for users who do not communicate with the transaction facilitator 990 using a web
   browser.    Such users can have special software installed on their computing system 920 that
25 allows them to communicate with the transaction facilitator 990 via the network.
            FIG. 10 is a diagrammatic representation of various computing devices associated with a
   casino that are in communication with a transaction facilitator 1090. The transaction facilitator
    1090 is configured to performs various financial transactions associated with a stored value
   account 1029 managed by an issuer processor computing system 1026.             Computing devices
30  1008, 1010, 1012 are shown that are respectively associated with a casino kiosk 1002, a casino
   gaming pit 1004, and a casino pit 1006. Each computing device 1008, 1010, and 1012 also has a
