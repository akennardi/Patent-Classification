   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   1.    Field of the Invention
 5   [0001.] The present invention relates to a turning signal assembly, and more particularly,
   to a vehicle turning signal assembly comprising at least two light units which are activated in
   sequence.
   2.    Description of the Prior Art
 0   [ 0002 1 The conventional turning signal assembly comprises a base and a light unit is
   located in the base. A cover is mounted to the base and the beams generated from the light
   unit pass through the cover to show the turning signal to other drivers. The conventional
   light unit is easily burned due to vibration or high temperature. The latest light units use Light
   Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to replace the conventional light bulbs. When the vehicle turns, the
 5 LEDs flash to show the intention of the driver. Nevertheless, the whole set of the LEDs has
   to be replaced if one of the LEDs fails.
     [ 0003 ] The present invention intends to provide a turning signal assembly which
   comprises at least two light units which are located side by side and being activated in
   sequence.

     [0004] The present invention relates to a turning signal assembly and comprises a base
   having at least two rooms, and at least two light units. The at least two light units are
   respectively located in the at least two rooms. The at least two light units are located side by
                                                      2

   side and are activated in sequence. Each light unit can be replaced individually.
     [0005 ] Preferably, each of the covers has multiple protrusions extending from the inside
   thereof. The protrusions are engaged with one end face of the seat.
     [ 0006 ] Preferably, each of the seats has multiple positioning holes. Each cover includes
 5 multiple columns which extend through the positioning holes. Each column includes one of
   the stepped holes. The locking members extend through the stepped holes to secure the
   light unit to the base.
     1,0007 ] Preferably, an end piece is engaged with each stepped hole of each cover so as to
   cover up the locking member.
 0   [ 0008 1The primary object of the present invention is to provide a turning signal assembly
   which includes at least two light units, and the at least two light units are located side by side
   and are activated in sequence to provide turning signals when the vehicle turns. The light
   units in the base may have different illumination patterns. Each light unit can be replaced
   individually.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
    [0010 ] Referring to Figs. 1 to 4, the turning signal assembly of the present invention
   comprises a base 1 having at least two rooms 10, and each room 10 has multiple tubes 11
   extending from the inner end thereof. Multiple passages 12 are located in the middle room
 0 10 and in communication between the two rooms 10 on two ends of the middle room 10.
   The passages 12 allow cables (not shown) to pass. One of the rooms 10 has multiple bores
   13 through which terminals (not shown) extend.
    [0011 ] At least two light units 2 are respectively located in the each rooms 10. Each light
   unit 2 has a seat 20, multiple light strips 21 and a cover 22. Each seat 20 has multiple
 5 recesses 200 in which the light strips 21 are received. The light strips 21 each have Light
   Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and a fixing member 211 connected to each end thereof. Multiple
   bolts 212 respectively extend through the fixing members 211 and are connected to the
   seat 20. The cover 22 is mounted to the seat 20 corresponding thereto, and each of the
   covers 22 has slots 221 defined therethrough which are located corresponding to the light
20 strips 21. Each of the covers 22 has multiple protrusions 220 extending from the inside
   thereof, and the protrusions 220 are engaged with one end face of the seat 20. Each cover
   22 has a refraction face 222 defined in the inside thereof.
    [0012 ] Each of the seats 20 has four positioning holes 201 on four comers thereof. Each
   cover 22 includes multiple columns 223 which extend through the positioning holes 201.
                                                    4

   Each column 223 includes a stepped hole 224 through which a locking member 225
   extends and is connected to the correspondent tube 11 of the base 1 to secure the light unit
   2 to the base 1. An end piece 226 is engaged with each stepped hole 224 of each cover 22
   so as to cover up the locking member 225.
 5   [0013 ] When assembling, the light strips 21 are inserted into the recesses 200 of each
   seat 20, and are secured to the seat 20 by extending the bolts 212 through the fixing
   members 211 and being connected to the seat 20. The columns 223 extend through the
   positioning holes 201 of the seat 20, and the locking member 225 extends through the
   stepped holes 224 of the columns 223 and is connected to the correspondent tubes 11 of
 0 the base 1 to secure the light unit 2 to the base 1. The protrusions 220 are engaged with
   one end face of the seat 20. The end piece 226 is then engaged with each stepped hole
   224 of each cover 22 so as to cover up the locking member 225. Cables (not shown)
   extend through the passages 12 and the bores 13 of the base 1, and are connected with
   terminals (not shown). The assembly is easy and can be completed quickly.
 5   [0014 ] When in use, as shown in Figs. 5 to 7, the base 1 is connected to the vehicle, and
   the light units 2 are located side by side and are activated in sequence. The lights
   generated by the LEDs 210 are evenly seen by the light strips 21. The light beams then
   pass through the slots 221 of the light units 2 so that the light beams are even and provide
   better illumination features. When the vehicle turns, the light units 2 are activated in
20 sequence to send obvious signals to other drivers. The illumination pattern of the light units
   2 can be varied, such as the outer most light unit 2 is seen as an arrowhead. The light units
   2 can be replaced individually.
     [0015 ] As shown in Fig. 8, the base 1 can be a vehicle body, wherein, the light units 2 are
   mounted to the vehicle body.
                                                   5

 [ 0016 ] While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the
present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may
be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
                                                6
