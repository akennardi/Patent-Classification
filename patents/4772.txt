 Device, Method, and Graphical User Interface for Manipulating Soft
                                         Keyboards
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       This relates generally to electronic     devices with touch-sensitive surfaces,
including but not limited to electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces that control a soft
keyboard on a display.
[0001A]      This application is related to Patent Cooperation Treaty Application No.
PCT/US2011/059106 filed on 3 November 2011, which is incorporated herein in its entirety
by reference.
                                       BACKGROUND
[0002]       The use of touch-sensitive surfaces as input devices for computers and other
electronic computing devices has increased significantly in recent years. Exemplary touch
sensitive surfaces include touch pads and touch screen displays. Such surfaces are widely
used to manipulate user interface objects on a display.
[0003]       Exemplary     user  interface   objects   include   soft  keyboards.    Exemplary
manipulations include selecting a soft keyboard, adjusting the position and/or size of the soft
keyboard, and activating keys in the soft keyboard. A user may need to perform such
manipulations on soft keyboards in a file management program (e.g., Finder from Apple Inc.
of Cupertino, California), an image management application (e.g., Aperture or iPhoto from
Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California), a digital content (e.g., videos and music) management
application (e.g., iTunes from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California), a drawing application, a
presentation application (e.g., Keynote from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California), a word
processing application (e.g., Pages from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California), a website
creation application (e.g., iWeb from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California), a disk authoring
application (e.g., iDVD from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California), or a spreadsheet
application (e.g., Numbers from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California).
[0004]       But existing methods for performing these manipulations are cumbersome and
inefficient. For example, two-thumb typing on an unsplit soft keyboard on a tablet-sized
portable device while a user is holding the device is tedious and creates a significant
cognitive burden on the user. In addition, existing methods take longer than necessary,
thereby wasting energy. This latter consideration is particularly important in battery-operated
devices.
                                                1

                                          SUMMARY
[00051         Accordingly, there is a need for electronic devices with faster, more efficient
methods and interfaces for manipulating soft keyboards. Such methods and interfaces may
complement or replace conventional methods for manipulating soft keyboards. Such methods
and interfaces reduce the cognitive burden on a user and produce a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated devices, such methods and interfaces conserve power
and increase the time between battery charges.
[00061         The above deficiencies and other problems associated with user interfaces for
electronic devices with touch-sensitive surfaces are reduced or eliminated by the disclosed
devices. In some embodiments, the device is a desktop computer. In some embodiments, the
device is portable (e.g., a notebook computer, tablet computer, or handheld device). In some
embodiments, the device has a touchpad. In some embodiments, the device has a touch
sensitive display (also known as a "touch screen" or "touch screen display"). In some
embodiments, the device has a graphical user interface (GUI), one or more processors,
memory and one or more modules, programs or sets of instructions stored in the memory for
performing multiple functions. In some embodiments, the user interacts with the GUI
primarily through finger contacts and gestures on the touch-sensitive surface. In some
embodiments, the functions may include image editing, drawing, presenting, word processing,
website creating, disk authoring, spreadsheet making, game playing, telephoning, video
conferencing, e-mailing, instant messaging, workout support, digital photographing, digital
videoing, web browsing, digital music playing, and/or digital video playing. Executable
instructions for performing these functions may be included in a non-transitory computer
readable storage medium or other computer program product configured for execution by one
or more processors.

                            DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[00971         Many electronic devices have graphical user interfaces with soft keyboards for
character entry. On a relatively large portable device, such as a tablet computer, typing on
an unsplit soft keyboard may be fine in certain situations, such as when the computer is
                                              27

resting on a solid surface, but problematic in other situations. For example, unsplit keyboards
are not convenient for typing when both hands are holding onto the device.              Split soft
keyboards may be better in these situations. But the use of split keyboards for two-thumb
typing when both hands are holding onto the device raises new issues that have not been
recognized and/or properly addressed, such as:
    .   Easily converting between an unsplit keyboard and an integrated input area that
        includes a split keyboard;
    .   Preventing accidentally changing soft keyboards while typing (e.g., from an unsplit
        keyboard to an integrated input area with a split keyboard, or vice versa);
    .   Moving an integrated input area when desired, but preventing accidental movement of
        the integrated input area when a user contact moves during typing with the split
        keyboard;
    .   Moving an input area and adjusting the size of an application content area to display
        more of the application;
    .   More efficiently entering characters during two-thumb typing with a split soft
        keyboard;
    *   Using the center portion of an integrated input area to make character entry faster and
        more efficient during two-thumb typing;
    .   Moving an input area that includes a keyboard over an application content area so that
        the input area is just below a text entry area in the application;
    .   Easily customizing a split keyboard in an integrated input area to the size of the user's
        thumbs; and
    .   Automatically converting between an unsplit keyboard and a split keyboard.
[0098]          The embodiments described below address these issues and related issues.
[0099]          Below, Figures 1A-IB, 2, 3, and 15-23 provide a description of exemplary
devices.   Figures 4A-4B and 5A-5TTT illustrate exemplary user interfaces for manipulating
soft keyboards. Figures 6A-6B, 7A-7B, 8A-8B, 9, 10A-1OB, 11A-11D, 12A-12B, 13A-13B,
and 14 are flow diagrams illustrating methods of manipulating soft keyboards.           The user
interfaces in Figures 5A-5TTT are used to illustrate the processes in Figures 6A-6B, 7A-7B,
8A-8B, 9, 10A-OB, 11A-I1D, 12A-12B, 13A-13B, and 14.
                                                 28

                                    EXEMPLARY DEVICES
[00100]         Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous
specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present
invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present
invention may be practiced without these specific details.       In other instances, well-known
methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not been described in detail so
as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.
[00101]         It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be
used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms.
These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first
contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second contact could be termed a
first contact, without departing from the scope of the present invention.    The first contact and
the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the same contact.
[00102]         The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for the
purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the
invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular
forms "a , an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term "and/or" as used herein
refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated
listed items.     It will be further understood that the terms "includes," "including,"
"comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the presence of
stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude
the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements,
components, and/or groups thereof.
[001031         As used herein, the term "if' may be construed to mean "when" or "upon" or
"in response to determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context.
Similarly, the phrase "if it is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" may
be construed to mean "upon determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting
[the stated condition or event]" or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event],"
depending on the context.
                                                 29

[001041          Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device
is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other
functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable
multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@
devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as
laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or
touch pads), may also be used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments, the
device is not a portable communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad).
[001051          In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display and
a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the electronic
device may include one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a physical
keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick.
[001061          The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or more of
the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing
application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet
application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application,
an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a
photo management application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera
application, a web browsing application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital
video player application.
[001071          The various applications that may be executed on the device may use at least
one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or
more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed
on the device may be adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or within a
respective application.     In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the touch
sensitive surface) of the device may support the variety of applications with user interfaces
that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[00108]          Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays. Figure 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device
100 with touch-sensitive displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments.                 Touch
                                                 30

sensitive display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and may also be
known as or called a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 may include memory 102
(which may include one or more computer readable storage mediums), memory controller
122, one or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF circuitry 108,
audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (I/O) subsystem 106, other
input or control devices 116, and external port 124.     Device 100 may include one or more
optical sensors 164. These components may communicate over one or more communication
buses or signal lines 103.
[00109]         It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 may have more or fewer components than shown,
may combine two or more components, or may have a different configuration or arrangement
of the components.     The various components shown in Figure 1A may be implemented in
hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software, including one or more
signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits.
[00110]         Memory 102 may include high-speed random access memory and may also
include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash
memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory devices. Access to memory 102
by other components of device 100, such as CPU 120 and the peripherals interface 118, may
be controlled by memory controller 122.
[00111]         Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of
the device to CPU 120 and memory 102.         The one or more processors 120 run or execute
various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform
various functions for device 100 and to process data.
[00112]         In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and memory
controller 122 may be implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104.            In some other
embodiments, they may be implemented on separate chips.
[00113]         RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices
via the electromagnetic signals.     RF circuitry 108 may include well-known circuitry for
performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF transceiver,
one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC
                                               31

chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108
may communicate with networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World Wide
Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a
wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN), and other
devices by wireless communication.     The wireless communication may use any of a plurality
of communications standards, protocols and technologies, including but not limited to Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE),
high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA),
wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA),
time division multiple access (TDMA), Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) (e.g., IEEE
802.1la, IEEE 802.1lb, IEEE 802.11g and/or IEEE 802.11n), voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP), Wi-MAX, a protocol for e-mail (e.g., Internet message access protocol (IMAP)
and/or post office protocol (POP)), instant messaging (e.g., extensible messaging and
presence protocol (XMPP), Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence
Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), and/or
Short Message Service (SMS), or any other suitable communication protocol, including
communication protocols not yet developed as of the filing date of this document.
[00114]         Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio
interface between a user and device 100.       Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from
peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the
electrical signal to speaker 111.  Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human-audible
sound waves.     Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by microphone
113 from sound waves.      Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to audio data and
transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing.       Audio data may be
retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals
interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes a headset jack (e.g.,
212, Figure 2).     The headset jack provides an interface between audio circuitry 110 and
removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only headphones or a headset with
both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and input (e.g., a microphone).
[001151         I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as
touch screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118.         I/O
subsystem 106 may include display controller 156 and one or more input controllers 160 for
other input or control devices.   The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical
                                               32

signals from/to other input or control devices 116.    The other input control devices 116 may
include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches,
joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160
may be coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB port, and a
pointer device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Figure 2) may include
an up/down button for volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113.           The one or
more buttons may include a push button (e.g., 206, Figure 2).
 [001161        Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output
interface between the device and a user.         Display controller 156 receives and/or sends
electrical signals from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the
user.   The visual output may include graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination
thereof (collectively termed "graphics").     In some embodiments, some or all of the visual
output may correspond to user-interface objects.
 [001171        Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors that
accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and
display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in
memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen
 112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or
more soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
corresponds to a finger of the user.
 [00118]        Touch screen 112 may use LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD
(light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology,
although other display technologies may be used in other embodiments.         Touch screen 112
and display controller 156 may detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using
any of a plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but
not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well
as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of
contact with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance
sensing technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@ from
Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
                                                33

[00119]         Touch screen 112 may have a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user
may make contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such as a
stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to work
primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus-based
input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some embodiments,
the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor position or
command for performing the actions desired by the user.
[00120]         In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 may include
a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions.              In some
embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad may be a touch-sensitive surface that is
separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed by the
touch screen.
[00121]         Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components.     Power system 162 may include a power management system, one or more
power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure
detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light-emitting
diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation, management and
distribution of power in portable devices.
[00122]         Device 100 may also include one or more optical sensors 164.            Figure 1A
shows an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem 106.
Optical sensor 164 may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors.           Optical sensor 164 receives light from the
environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the light to data representing
an image.    In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a camera module), optical
sensor 164 may capture still images or video. In some embodiments, an optical sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on the front of the
device, so that the touch screen display may be used as a viewfinder for still and/or video
image acquisition. In some embodiments, another optical sensor is located on the front of
the device so that the user's image may be obtained for videoconferencing while the user
views the other video conference participants on the touch screen display.
                                                34

[001231         Device 100 may also include one or more proximity sensors 166.          Figure 1A
shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118.           Alternately, proximity
sensor 166 may be coupled to input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. In some
embodiments, the proximity sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the
multifunction device is placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone call).
[00124]         Device 100 may also include one or more accelerometers 168.             Figure 1A
shows accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, accelerometer
168 may be coupled to an input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. In some embodiments,
information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait view or a landscape view
based on an analysis of data received from the one or more accelerometers.             Device 100
optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a magnetometer (not shown) and a
GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system) receiver (not shown) for obtaining
information concerning the location and orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape) of device 100.
[001251         In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102 include
operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128, contact/motion
module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of instructions) 132, text input
module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of
instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some
embodiments memory 102 stores device/global internal state 157, as shown in Figures 1A
and 3.   Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active application state,
indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state, indicating what
applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch screen display 112;
sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various sensors and input
control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's location and/or attitude.
[00126]         Operating system      126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX,                OS X,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software
components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory
management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication
between various hardware and software components.
[001271         Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices
over one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for
handling data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124.      External port 124 (e.g.,
                                                35

Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other
devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.).         In some
embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or
similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of Apple
Inc.) devices.
[00128]         Contact/motion module 130 may detect contact with touch screen 112 (in
conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or
physical click wheel).   Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components
for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if
contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining if there is movement
of the contact and tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting
one or more finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g.,
detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact).     Contact/motion module 130 receives
contact data from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact,
which is represented by a series of contact data, may include determining speed (magnitude),
velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or
direction) of the point of contact. These operations may be applied to single contacts (e.g.,
one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts (e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger
contacts).  In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 and display controller 156
detect contact on a touchpad.
[00129]         Contact/motion module 130 may detect a gesture input by a user. Different
gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns.   Thus, a gesture may
be detected by detecting a particular contact pattern.   For example, detecting a finger tap
gesture includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off)
event at the same position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g.,
at the position of an icon).   As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or
more finger-dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off)
event.
[00130]         Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the intensity of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the
term "graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without
                                               36

limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys), digital
images, videos, animations and the like.
[00131]         In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics
to be used.    Each graphic may be assigned a corresponding code.       Graphics module 132
receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along
with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic property data, and then generates screen
image data to output to display controller 156.
[00132]         Text input module 134, which may be a component of graphics module 132,
provides soft keyboards for entering text in various applications (e.g., contacts 137, e-mail
140, IM 141, browser 147, and any other application that needs text input).
[00133]         GPS module 135 determines the location of the device and provides this
information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location-based
dialing, to camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications that provide location
based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and map/navigation
widgets).

[00153]          Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (i.e., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus
various subsets of these modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various
embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 may store a subset of the modules and
data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 102 may store additional modules
and data structures not described above.
[00154]          In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a predefined
set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen and/or a
touchpad. By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control device for
operation of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons,
dials, and the like) on device 100 may be reduced.
[001551          The predefined set of functions that may be performed exclusively through a
touch screen and/or a touchpad include navigation between user interfaces.            In some
embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home,
or root menu from any user interface that may be displayed on device 100.              In such
embodiments, the touchpad may be referred to as a "menu button."                In some other
embodiments, the menu button may be a physical push button or other physical input control
device instead of a touchpad.

handling in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (in
Figure 1A) or 370 (Figure 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a
respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155, 380
390).
[001571          Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application
136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event
information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174.
In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which
                                                42

indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch sensitive display 112 when the
application is active or executing.   In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is
used by event sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently active, and
application internal state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191
to which to deliver event information.
[00158]         In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed
or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go
back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions
taken by the user.
[001591         Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture).   Peripherals interface 118 transmits
information it receives from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information
that peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from
touch-sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
[00160]         In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals.    In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
[00161]         In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination
module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[00162]         Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch
sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other
elements that a user can see on the display.
[00163]         Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur.      The application views (of a
                                                 43

respective application) in which a touch is detected may correspond to programmatic levels
within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application.       For example, the lowest level
view in which a touch is detected may be called the hit view, and the set of events that are
recognized as proper inputs may be determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the
initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
[00164]          Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub-events
of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy,
hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy
which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level
view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (i.e., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub
events that form an event or potential event).   Once the hit view is identified by the hit view
determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch
or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
[001651          Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events.      In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events.      In other embodiments, active event
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical
location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively
involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events.       In other embodiments,
even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular
view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[001661          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173.        In some
embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module 182.
[001671          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170.     In yet other embodiments, event
sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102, such
as contact/motion module 130.
                                                44

[001681         In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180.
In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module,
such as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1
inherits methods and other properties.   In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190
includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event
data 179 received from event sorter 170.    Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater
176, object updater 177 or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192.
Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 includes one or more respective event
handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater
177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[00169]         A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information. Event
recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event
delivery instructions 188 (which may include sub-event delivery instructions).
[001701         Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The
event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch the event information may also include speed and direction of the sub-event. In some
embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another (e.g.,
from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event
information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called
device attitude) of the device.
[001711         Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or
sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186.     Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187
                                                45

2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event 187 include, for example,
touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one
example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
(touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch
end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact)
on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
sensitive display 112, and lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[00172]          In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event
for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs
a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For
example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch
sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event
comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is
associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a
respective event handler 190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine
which event handler 190 should be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an
event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
[001731          In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's
event type.
[00174]          When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub
events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event
recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it
disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event
recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub
events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.
                                                 46

[001751         In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata
183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery
system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
how event recognizers may interact with one another. In some embodiments, metadata 183
includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate whether sub-events are
delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[00176]         In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event
handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
[001771         In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event
delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an
event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
event information and perform a predetermined process.
[00178]         In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1.   For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1.     For
example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
sensitive display.
[001791         In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater
176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective
                                               47

application 136-1 or application view 191.      In other embodiments, they are included in two
or more software modules.
[001801          It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling
of user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to
operate multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all of which are initiated on touch
screens, e.g., coordinating mouse movement and mouse button presses with or without single
or multiple keyboard presses or holds, user movements taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on touch
pads, pen stylus inputs, movement of the device, oral instructions, detected eye movements,
biometric inputs, and/or any combination thereof, which may be utilized as inputs
corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[00181]          Figure 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen
112 in accordance with some embodiments.             The touch screen may display one or more
graphics within user interface (UI) 200.       In this embodiment, as well as others described
below, a user may select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics, for
example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or more
styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure).       In some embodiments, selection of one or
more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics.         In some
embodiments, the gesture may include one or more taps, one or more swipes (from left to
right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a finger (from right to left,
left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with device 100.           In some
embodiments, inadvertent contact with a graphic may not select the graphic. For example, a
swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon may not select the corresponding
application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a tap.
[00182]          Device 100 may also include one or more physical buttons, such as "home" or
menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 may be used to navigate to any
application 136 in a set of applications that may be executed on device 100. Alternatively,
in some embodiments, the menu button is implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on
touch screen 112.
[00183]          In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204,
push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210, head set jack 212, and
docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 may be used to turn the power on/off
                                                  48

on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for a
predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the button
before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate an
unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also may accept verbal input for
activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113.
[00184]         Figure 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300
need not be portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop
computer, a tablet computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational
device (such as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or
industrial controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's)
310, one or more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or
more communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components.            Communication
buses 320 may include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls
communications between system components.           Device 300 includes input/output (I/O)
interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display.           I/O
interface 330 also may include a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and
touchpad 355. Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM,
SRAM, DDR RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and may include
non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory
370 may optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310.
In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous
to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100 (Figure 1), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional
programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100.    For example, memory 370 of device 300 may store drawing module 380,
presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module 386, disk
authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100 (Figure 1) may not store these modules.
[001851         Each of the above identified elements in Figure 3 may be stored in one or
more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified modules
corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above
                                              49

identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these
modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments.               In some
embodiments, memory 370 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified
above.    Furthermore, memory 370 may store additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[00186]         Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UT") that
may be implemented on portable multifunction device 100.
[001871         Figure 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications on
portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments.       Similar user
interfaces may be implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user interface 400
includes the following elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
    .   Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular and
        Wi-Fi signals;
    .   Time 404;
    .   Bluetooth indicator 405;
    .   Battery status indicator 406;
    .   Tray 408 with icons for frequently used applications, such as:
            o   Phone 138, which may include an indicator 414 of the number of missed calls
                or voicemail messages;
            o   E-mail client 140, which may include an indicator 410 of the number of
                unread e-mails;
            o   Browser 147; and
            o   Video and music player 152, also referred to as iPod (trademark of Apple Inc.)
                module 152; and
*       Icons for other applications, such as:
            o IM 141;
            o   Image management 144;
            o   Camera 143;
                                               50

            o   Weather 149-1;
            o   Stocks 149-2;
            o   Workout support 142;
            o   Calendar 148;
            o   Alarm clock 149-4;
            o   Map 154;
            o Notes 153;
            o   Settings 412, which provides access to settings for device 100 and its various
                applications 136; and
            o   Online video module 155, also referred to as YouTube (trademark of Google
                Inc.) module 155.
[00188]         Figure 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300,
Figure 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Figure 3) that is
separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Although many of the
examples which follow will be given with reference to inputs on touch screen display 112
(where the touch sensitive surface and the display are combined), in some embodiments, the
device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from the display, as shown
in Figure 4B. In some embodiments the touch sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Figure 4B) has
a primary axis (e.g., 452 in Figure 4B) that corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Figure
4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with these embodiments, the device detects
contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in Figure 4B) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations
that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g., in Figure 4B, 460 corresponds to
468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and
movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Figure
4B) are used by the device to manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in Figure
4B) of the multifunction device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the display.
It should be understood that similar methods may be used for other user interfaces described
herein.
                 USER INTERFACES AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSES
                                               51

[001891          Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") and
associated processes that may be implemented on an electronic device with a display and a
touch-sensitive surface, such as device 300 or portable multifunction device 100.
[00190]          Figures 5A-5TTT illustrate exemplary user interfaces for manipulating soft
keyboards in accordance with some embodiments. The user interfaces in these figures are
used to illustrate the processes described below, including the processes in Figures 6A-6B,
7A-7B, 8A-8B, 9, 10A-10B, 11A-I1D, 12A-12B, 13A-13B, and 14.
[00191]          Figure 5A depicts user interface (UI) 5000A displayed on touch-sensitive
display 112 of a device (e.g., device 100). UI 5000A may be a user interface in an
application (e.g., a notes application, a web browser application, etc.) on device 100. UI
5000A includes text entry area 5002. Cursor 5004 and input text 5006 are displayed in text
entry area 5002.
[00192]          Unsplit soft keyboard 5008 is displayed on display 112. The keys of unsplit
soft keyboard 5008 are not split amongst two or more distinct keyboard portions. In some
embodiments, unsplit soft keyboard 5008 includes keyboard split key 5012. In some
embodiments, keyboard split key 5012 shows an icon or other graphical indicia (e.g., an icon
or graphic showing two halves moving, as in splitting, apart) that keyboard split key 5012
may be used to switch to an integrated input area that includes a split soft keyboard.
[00193]          Figure 5A also depicts exemplary gestures that, if detected, activate splitting
of unsplit soft keyboard 5008 in response. Gesture 5010 is a two-finger de-pinch gesture
performed on unsplit soft keyboard 5008. Gesture 5010 includes finger contacts 5010-A and
5010-B moving apart from each other in directions 5011-A and 5011-B, respectively, on
display 112. On the other hand, gesture 5014 is a tap gesture on keyboard split key 5012.
[00194]          In response to detection of either gesture 5010 or 5014 on display 112, device
100 changes unsplit soft keyboard 5008 (Figure 5A) into integrated input area 5016 (Figure
5C).   In some embodiments, an animation showing the transition from unsplit soft keyboard
5008 to integrated input area 5016 is displayed on display 112. For example, the transitional
animation may show unsplit soft keyboard 5008 splitting into halves and center area 5016-C
appearing between the halves, with the halves moving apart from each other in directions
5017-A and 5017-B (Figure 5B). The halves become split keyboard portions 5016-A and
5016-B (Figure B) and the keys of unsplit soft keyboard 5008 are divided amongst the halves.
In some embodiments, some keys are included in both left and right portions 5016-A and
                                                 52

5016-B of integrated input area 5016.     Figure 5B depicts user interface 5000B at an instant
in the transitional animation from unsplit soft keyboard 5008 to integrated input area 5016.
What was unsplit soft keyboard 5008 has transitioned into integrated input area 5016, with
the keys of unsplit soft keyboard 5008 divided between two opposing portions.             Upon
completion of the transition animation, integrated input area 5016 is displayed, as shown in
Figure 5C.
[001951          Figure 5C depicts user interface 5000C, with integrated input area 5016
displayed after completion of the transition animation. Integrated input area 5016 includes
left split keyboard portion 5016-A and right split keyboard portion 5016-B, and center area
5016-C between split keyboard portions 5016-A and 5016-B.        Split keyboard portions 5016
A and 5016-B and center area 5016-C form integrated input area 5016.                  In some
embodiments, integrated input area 5016 includes keyboard unsplit key 5018, replacing
keyboard split key 5012. In some embodiments, a character key is included in both split
keyboard portions 5016-A and 5016-B.          For example, "G" key 5019 is included in both
portions 5016-A and 5016-B.       In some embodiments, some keys in unsplit soft keyboard
5008 are not displayed in integrated input area 5016.    For example, hide keyboard key 5009
(Figure 5A) in unsplit soft keyboard 5008 is not displayed in integrated input area 5016.
[00196]          In some embodiments, center area 5016-C displays duplicate cursor 5020 and
duplicate input text 5022. Duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text 5022 mirror cursor
5004 and at least a portion of input text 5006, respectively.   The portion of input text 5006
that is visible in center area 5016-C as duplicate input text 5022 at any moment is typically
the portion of input text 5006 that is in the immediate vicinity of cursor 5004.       In some
embodiments, duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text 5006 are displayed at larger
sizes than cursor 5004 and input text 5006, respectively. In some other embodiments, center
area 5016 is empty, and text entry area 5002 is visible through center area 5016-C, as shown
in Figure 5K.
[001971          Figure 5D depicts user interface 5000D, with gesture 5026 detected on display
112.   Gesture 5026 is detected on "T" key 5024 in left split keyboard portion 5016-A.       In
response to detection of gesture 5026 on "T" key 5024, "T" key 5024 is activated and a "t"
character is entered into input text 5006. Duplicate input text 5022 in center area 5016-C
also shows the "t" character being entered, mirroring the entering of the "t" character into
input text 5006.
                                                53

[001981          Figure 5E depicts user interface 5000E, showing gestures that, if detected,
activate un-splitting of the split soft keyboard in integrated input area 5016 in response.
Gesture 5028 is a two-finger pinch gesture performed on integrated input area 5016. Gesture
5028 includes finger contacts 5028-A and 5028-B moving toward each other in directions
5030-A and 5030-B, respectively, on display 112. On the other hand, gesture 5032 is a tap
gesture on keyboard unsplit key 5018.
[00199]          In response to detection of either gesture 5028 or 5032 on display 112, device
100 changes integrated input area 5016 into unsplit soft keyboard 5008.                 In some
embodiments, an animation showing the transition from integrated input area 5016 to unsplit
soft keyboard 5008 is displayed on display 112.         For example, the transitional animation
may show split keyboard portions 5016-A and 5016-B merging together and center area
5016-C reducing in size and eventually ceasing to be displayed.           Figure 5F depicts user
interface 500OF at a point in the transitional animation. Integrated input area portions 5016
A and 5016-B are merging together in directions 5034-A and 5034-B and center area 5016-C
continually reduces in size.      Upon completion of the transition animation, unsplit soft
keyboard 5008, including keyboard split key 5012, is displayed in UI 5000G, as shown in
Figure 5G.
[00200]          Figure 5H depicts user interface 5000H displayed on display 112.            Tap
gesture 5038 is detected at some time on "T" key 5036 in unsplit soft keyboard 5008.           In
response, "T" key 5036 is activated; a "t" character is entered into input text 5006 displayed
in UI 50001, as shown in Figure 5I.
[00201]          Figure 5I also depicts gesture 5010 detected on display 112 at a time after the
time of detection of gesture 5038. In some embodiments, whether integrated input area 5016
is displayed in place of unsplit soft keyboard 5008, in response to detection of gesture 5010
depends on the time when gesture 5038 is detected and the time when gesture 5010 is
detected.   If the time period between the time when gesture 5038 is detected and the time
when gesture 5010 is detected exceeds a predefined period of time (e.g., 0.3, 0.5, or 1.0
seconds), then integrated input area 5016 is displayed in UI 5000K, as shown in Figure 5K.
In some embodiments, a transitional animation is displayed in UI 5000J, as shown in Figure
5J. Figure 5J is similar to Figure 5B, and thus a detailed description of Figure 5J is omitted
for brevity. If the time period between the time when gesture 5038 is detected and the time
when gesture 5010 is detected does not exceed the predefined period of time, then the display
of unsplit soft keyboard 5008 is maintained.     This use of a time threshold prevents accidental
                                                 54

conversion of the unsplit keyboard 5008 into an integrated input area 5016 when the user is in
the middle of typing using the unsplit keyboard.
[00202]         Figure 5L depicts user interface 5000L displayed on display 112.          User
interface 5000L may be a user interface in an application (e.g., a notes application, a web
browser application, etc.) on device 100. User interface 5000L includes text entry area 5002
and integrated input area 5039. Integrated input area 5039 includes split keyboard portions
5039-A and 5039-B, and center area 5039-C. In some embodiments, integrated input area
5039 is integrated input area 5016, with duplicate input text and a duplicate cursor displayed
in center area 5039-C.
[00203]         In some embodiments, integrated input area 5039 may move to a different
location on display 112 in response to a gesture (e.g., a dragging gesture). In Figure 5L, two
gestures are shown: gesture 5040 and gesture 5044.         Gesture 5040 is a dragging gesture
where the finger contact begins in center area 5039-C, as indicated by finger contact position
5040-1, and moves to position 5040-2. Gesture 5044 is a dragging gesture where the finger
contact begins in split keyboard portion 5039-B, as indicated by finger contact position 5044
1, and moves to position 5044-2.
[00204]         Whether integrated input area 5039 does move in response to detection of
gesture 5040 or gesture 5044 depends on whether the magnitude of respective gesture 5040
or 5044, i.e., a distance the finger contact moves in the gesture, exceeds a respective
predefined threshold. The amount of the threshold depends on whether the detected gesture
begins in center area 5039 or in split keyboard portion 5039-A or 5039-B.    For a gesture that
starts in center area 5039-C, threshold 5042 is a predefined distance from the start of the
gesture. For a gesture that starts in split keyboard portion 5039-B or 5039-A, threshold 5046
is a predefined distance from the start of the gesture. The distance for threshold 5046 is
longer than the distance for threshold 5042. Thus, the integrated input area will start moving
in accordance with the movement of the contact in gesture 5040 before the integrated input
area will start moving in accordance with the movement of the contact in gesture 5044. The
distance threshold is greater over the split keyboard portions of the integrated input area (as
compared to the center portion of the integrated input area) to prevent accidental movement
of the integrated input area when a user contact moves during typing with the split keyboard.
[002051         In some embodiments, a distance threshold is compared against the vertical
distance component of the gesture. In some other embodiments, the distance threshold is
                                                55

compared against the complete gesture, including both the horizontal and vertical distance
components; the threshold is compared against the absolute distance of the gesture. Thus,
for example, alternative thresholds 5046 and 5048 are shown for gesture 5044. Threshold
5046 is compared to the vertical component of gesture 5044. Threshold 5048, on the other
hand, is compared to the complete gesture 5044.
[00206]         If either gesture 5040 or 5044 is detected, and the detected gesture exceeds a
respective threshold in accordance with where the detected gesture began, then integrated
input area 5039 moves vertically in accordance with the direction of the detected gesture in
UI 5000M, as shown in Figure 5M. Split keyboard portions 5039-A, 5039-B, and center
area 5039-C move together as one integrated unit in a vertical direction. Movement of
integrated input area 5039 is typically restricted to vertical - up or down - movement, which
keeps the left and right split keyboard portions adjacent to the left and right sides of the
display, respectively, when the integrated input area is moved. In turn, this keeps the keys in
the left and right split keyboard portions easily reachable by the left and right thumbs,
respectively, during two-thumb typing.
[002071         Figure 5N illustrates two charts showing the amount of the threshold based on
where on display 112 the gesture begins. Chart 5050 shows the amount of the threshold
according to some embodiments.         Chart 5050 has an x-axis being the position along the
width of display 112 and the y-axis being the magnitude of the threshold, with the ends of the
x-axis representing the left and right edges of display 112. Line 5052 is a line marking the
center axis of display 112. Span 5055 between lines 5054-A and 5054-B represent the width
of center area 5039-C. The areas outside of span 5055 represent the widths of split keyboard
portions 5039-A and 5039-B. A first value is defined for threshold 5056-B, for gestures that
begin in center area 5039-C. Threshold 5056-B is constant for the width of center area
5039-C. A second value is defined for threshold 5056-A, for gestures that begin in either
split keyboard portion 5039-A or 5039-B. Threshold 5056-A is constant for the widths of
split keyboard portions 5039-A or 5039-B.
[00208]         Chart 5058 shows the amount of the threshold according to some alternative
embodiments. Chart 5058 has an x-axis being the position along the width of display 112
and the y-axis being the magnitude of the threshold, with the ends of the x-axis representing
the left and right edges of display 112.       Span 5055 between lines 5054-A and 5054-B
represents the width of center area 5039-C. The areas outside of span 5055 represent the
widths of split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B. Chart 5058 shows threshold amounts
                                                56

5060-A and 5060-B defined to be a particular amount at center line 5052 and increasing
linearly from that amount with the distance from center line 5052. Under either chart 5050
or 5058, the threshold within center area 5039-C is lower than the threshold in split keyboard
portion 5039-A or 5039-B. In center area 5039-C, the distance threshold is lower because
there is less opportunity for confusing a dragging gesture (for moving integrated input area
5039) with a key activation gesture (for entering a character).
[00209]         Figure 50 depicts UI 50000. UI 50000 includes application content area
5062, with height 5064, displayed on display 112. UI 50000 also includes integrated input
area 5039, with height 5065, docked at the bottom on display 112.        The sum of height 5064
and height 5065 is equal (or substantially equal, e.g., within 10 pixels) to height 5066 of
display 112.    Gesture 5068 is detected on display 112.        Gesture 5068 includes a finger
contact moving on display 112 from position 5068-1 to position 5068-2.
[00210]         In response to detecting gesture 5068, integrated input area 5039 is undocked
and moves vertically in accordance with the direction of gesture 5068 in UI 5000P, as shown
in Figure 5P. Integrated input area 5039 is displayed as an overlay over application content
area 5062 in Figure 5P. Also in response to detecting gesture 5068, application content area
5062 increases in size to occupy height 5066.      As a result of the increase in size, content in
application content area 5062 that was previously not visible in UI 50000 absent scrolling
may become visible in UI 5000P.      For example, instant messaging (IM) field 5067 is visible
in UI 5000P without scrolling. Thus, when an input area with a keyboard is "undocked"
from the bottom of the display, more display area is used to display the application content
area and the input area "floats" over the application content area.
[00211]         Figure 5Q depicts UI 5000Q displayed on display 112. UI 5000Q includes
text entry area 5002 and split soft keyboard 5069. In some embodiments, split soft keyboard
5069 is part of integrated input area 5016 or 5039. Cursor 5004 and input text 5006 are
displayed in text entry area 5002.    Split keyboard 5069 includes left split keyboard portion
5069-A and right split keyboard portion 5069-B.       In left split keyboard portion 5069-A, the
rightmost letter keys include "T" key 5070, "F" key 5072, and "V" key 5074.          In right split
keyboard portion 5039-B, the leftmost letter keys include "Y" key 5076, "G" key 5078, and
"B" key 5080.
[00212]         To the right of "T" key 5070, "F" key 5072, and "V" key 5074 in left split
keyboard portion 5069-A are undisplayed key activation areas 5082, 5084, and 5086,
                                                57

respectively.   Activation area 5082 corresponds to "Y" key 5076.          Activation area 5084
corresponds to "G" key 5078. Activation area 5086 corresponds to "B" key 5080.                The
undisplayed key activation areas are typically the same size as or slightly larger (e.g., up to
10% larger) than the corresponding key. The diagonal lines in activation areas 5082, 5084,
and 5086 in the figures are used to indicate that these activation areas are not displayed to the
user, whereas the corresponding keys are displayed.
[00213]         To the left of "Y" key 5076, "G" key 5078, and "B" key 5080 are undisplayed
key activation areas 5088, 5090, and 5092, respectively.      Activation area 5088 corresponds
to "T" key 5070.    Activation area 5090 corresponds to "F" key 5072. Activation area 5092
corresponds to "V" key 5074.       The undisplayed key activation areas are typically the same
size as or slightly larger (e.g., up to 10% larger) than the corresponding key. The diagonal
lines in activation areas 5088, 5090, and 5092 in the figures are used to indicate that these
activation areas are not displayed to the user, whereas the corresponding keys are displayed.
[00214]         Figure 5Q also shows gesture 5096 (e.g., a tap gesture) detected on "0" key
5094 in right split keyboard portion 5069-B.       In response to detection of gesture 5096, a
character "o" is entered into input text 5006 in UI 5000R, as shown in Figure 5R.
[002151         Figure 5R also shows gesture 5098 detected on key activation area 5086
following detection of gesture 5096.       In some embodiments, in response to detection of
gesture 5098, a character "b" is entered into input text 5006 in UI 5000S, as shown in Figure
5S, as key activation area 5086 corresponds to "B" key 5080.
[00216]         In some other embodiments, a character "b" is entered into input text 5006 in
response to detection of gesture 5098 if the time period between the time of detection for
gesture 5096 and the time of detection for gesture 5098 is less than a predefined period of
time.   If the time period exceeds the predefined period, entering of the character "b" is
foregone; gesture 5098 is ignored.
[002171         Figure 5T shows UI 500OT, with gesture 5100 detected on key activation area
5088.   In response to detection of gesture 5100, a character "t" is entered into input text 5006
in UI 5000U, as shown in Figure 5U, as key activation area 5088 corresponds to "T" key
5070.
[00218]         Figure 5V depicts UI 500OV.       UI 5000V includes text entry area 5002 and
integrated input area 5016.      Integrated input area 5016 includes split keyboard portions
5016-A (the left portion) and 5016-B (the right portion) and center area 5016-C.           Cursor
                                                58

5004 and input text 5006 are also displayed in text entry area 5002.     Cursor 5004 and input
text 5006 are mirrored in center area 5016-C as duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text
5022, respectively.    In some embodiments, duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text
5022 are displayed at larger sizes than cursor 5004 and input text 5006, respectively.
[00219]         Figure 5V also shows gesture 5102 (e.g., a tap gesture) detected on "T" key
5024 in left split keyboard portion 5016-A.        In response to detection of gesture 5102, a
character "t" is entered into input text 5006 in UI 5000W, as shown in Figure 5W. Input text
5006, including the newly entered character "t," is mirrored in center area 5016-C, as
duplicate input text 5022 also shows the newly entered letter "t."
[00220]         Figure 5X shows UI 500OX, with gesture 5102 detected on duplicate cursor
5020 in center area 5016-C, while duplicate cursor 5020 is located at the end of duplicate
input text 5022 (mirroring cursor 5004 being located at the end of input text 5006).     Gesture
5102 is a dragging gesture, with the finger contact moving in direction 5103.     In response to
detection of gesture 5102 on duplicate cursor 5020, cursor 5004 is moved to a different
position in input text 5006 in accordance with direction 5103 in UI 5000Y, as shown in
Figure 5Y. The result of the movement of cursor 5004 is mirrored in center area 5016-C, as
duplicate input text 5022 is moved so that duplicate cursor 5020 is in the same position
relative to duplicate input text 5022 as cursor 5004 is relative to input text 5006. In some
embodiments, duplicate cursor 5020 remains stationary within center area 5016-C, and its
position relative to duplicate input text 5022 changes by advancing or retreating duplicate
input text 5022, as shown in Figure 5Y.
[00221]         Figure 5Z depicts UI 500OZ. Editing control object 5104, corresponding to a
text editing operation, is displayed in UI 500OZ near input text 5006. Editing control object
5104 corresponds to a text pasting operation to be performed on input text 5006 if activated.
Duplicate editing control object 5106, corresponding to editing control object 5104, is
displayed in center area 5016-C near duplicate input text 5022. Gesture 5108 (e.g., a tap
gesture) is detected on duplicate editing control object 5106.
[00222]         In response to detection of gesture 5108 on duplicate editing control object
5106, the text pasting operation corresponding to editing control object 5104 is activated in
UI 5000AA, as shown in Figure 5AA.        Text "ahead" is pasted into input text 5006. The text
pasting is mirrored in center area 5016-C, as duplicate text 5022 is updated to also include the
pasted text "ahead."
                                                59

[002231         Figure 5BB depicts UI 500OBB. UI 500OBB includes form 5110 displayed in
text entry area 5002.    Form 5110 includes one or more text entry fields 5114 and one or
more checkboxes 5112, each respective checkbox 5112 associated with an option in form
5110.   For example, checkbox 5112-A in form 5110 is associated with the "Vegetarian"
option. Duplicate checkboxes 5116 and the corresponding options mirror checkboxes 5112
and the corresponding options and are displayed in center area 5016-C.            For example,
duplicate checkbox 5116-A corresponds to checkbox 5112-A, duplicate checkbox 5116-B
corresponds to checkbox 5112-B, and so on forth.            In some embodiments, duplicate
checkboxes 5116 and the corresponding options are displayed at larger sizes than their
corresponding checkboxes 5112.      Gesture 5118 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected on duplicate
checkbox 5116-A, which is unselected (i.e., not checked), as is checkbox 5112-A.
[00224]         In response to detection of gesture 5118 on duplicate checkbox 5116-A,
checkbox 5112-A is selected in UI 5000CC, as shown in Figure 5CC. Duplicate checkbox
5116-A is also selected, mirroring the selection of checkbox 5112-A.
[002251         Figure 5DD depicts UI 500ODD.      UI 500ODD shows gesture 5120 detected in
center area 5016-C, away from duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text 5022. In some
embodiments, gesture 5120 is a double tap gesture or a finger contact held in place.         In
response to detection of gesture 5120 in center area 5016-C, pop-up menu 5122 is displayed
in UI 5000EE, as shown in Figure 5EE. Duplicate menu 5124 is displayed in center area
5016-C.    Selection of an option in duplicate menu 5124 has the same effect as selecting the
corresponding option in pop-up menu 5122. In other embodiments (not shown), in response
to detection of gesture 5120, menu 5124 is displayed in center area 5016-C, without
concurrently displaying 5122; in other words, a pop-up menu is just displayed in the center
area 5016-C.
[00226]         Figure 5FF depicts UI 5000FF. UI 5000FF includes handwriting 5126 made
using one or more finger strokes 5128 made within center area 5016-C. Handwriting 5126 is
recognized to resemble a Chinese character, and one or more candidate characters (not
shown) may be displayed in center area 5016-C.        In response to selection of a candidate
character, the selected candidate character is entered into input text 5006 in UI 500OGG, as
shown in Figure 5GG. In UI 500OGG, the character "P" is entered into input text 5006.        In
some embodiments, duplicate input text 5022 also shows the character     "@"  being entered.

5130 is entered into text entry area 5002 in UI 500011, as shown in Figure 511.
[00228]         Figure 5JJ depicts UI 5000JJ. UI 5000JJ includes input text 5006 and cursor
5004 displayed in text entry area 5002.         Suggested word 5134 for input text 5006 is
displayed.    Duplicate suggested word 5136, corresponding to suggested word 5134, is
displayed in center area 5016-C near duplicate input text 5022. Gesture 5138 (e.g., a tap
gesture) is detected on X-icon 5137 (which corresponds to X-icon 5135 accompanying
suggested word 5134) accompanying duplicate suggested word 5136.
[00229]         In response to detection of gesture 5138 on X-icon 5137, suggested word 5134
is rejected, and input text 5006 remains as is in UI 500OKK, as shown in Figure 5KK.
[00230]         Figure 5LL depicts UI 500OLL.        UI 500OLL includes input text 5006 and
cursor 5004 displayed in text entry area 5002.      One or more emoticons 5140 available for
entry into input text 5006 are displayed.        Duplicate emoticons 5142, corresponding to
emoticons 5140, are displayed in center area 5016-C near duplicate input text 5022.     Gesture
5144 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected on duplicate emoticon 5142-A, which corresponds to
emoticon 5140-A.
[00231]         In response to detection of gesture 5144 on duplicate emoticon 5142-A,
emoticon 5140-A is entered into input text 5006 in UI 5000MM, as shown in Figure 5MM.
The changed text input 5006 is mirrored in center area 5016-C, as duplicate emoticon 5142-A
is entered into duplicate input text 5022. In other embodiments (not shown), emoticons 5142
are displayed in center area 5016-C, without concurrently displaying emoticons 5140; in
other words, the emoticons available for input are just displayed in the center area 5016-C.
[00232]         Figure 5NN depicts UI 500ONN, which includes input text 5006 and cursor
5004 displayed in text entry area 5002.     One or more Unicode characters 5146 available for
entry into input text 5006 are displayed. Duplicate Unicode characters 5148, corresponding
to Unicode characters 5146, are displayed in center area 5016-C near duplicate input text
5022.    Gesture 5149 (e.g., a tap gesture) is detected on duplicate Unicode character 5148-A,
which corresponds to Unicode character 5146-A.
[00233]         In response to detection of gesture 5149 on duplicate Unicode character 5148
A, Unicode character 5146-A is entered into input text 5006 in UI 500000, as shown in
                                                61

Figure 500. The changed text input 5006 is mirrored in center area 5016-C, as duplicate
input text 5022 also includes duplicate Unicode character 5148-A. In other embodiments (not
shown), Unicode characters 5148 are displayed in center area 5016-C, without concurrently
displaying Unicode characters 5146; in other words, the Unicode characters available for
input are just displayed in the center area 5016-C.
[00234]         Figure 5PP depicts UI 5000PP, which includes input text 5006 and cursor
5004 displayed in text entry area 5002.     Cursor 5004 and at least a portion of input text 5006
are mirrored in center area 5016-C as duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text 5022,
respectively.   Gesture 5150 is detected in center area 5016-C.         Gesture 5150 includes a
finger contact moving from position 5150-A to position 5150-B, going over duplicate input
text 5022.
[002351         In response to detection of gesture 5150 over duplicate input text 5022,
duplicate input text 5022 is displayed with shading 5154 (or other highlighting) (Figure 5QQ),
indicating that duplicate input text 5022 is selected. The corresponding text in input text
5006 is displayed with shading 5152 (or other highlighting) as well.
[00236]         Figure 5RR depicts UI 500ORR, which includes input text 5006 and cursor
5004 displayed in text entry area 5002.       Cursor 5004 and input text 5006 is mirrored in
center area 5016-C as duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text 5022, respectively.
Gesture 5156 (e.g., a double tap gesture, a triple tap gesture, or a tap and hold gesture) is
detected in center area 5016-C on duplicate input text 5022.    Gesture 5156 is associated with
a text formatting operation (e.g., making text bold, underling text, italicizing text, etc.).
[002371         In response to detection of gesture 5156 on duplicate input text 5022, the
formatting of input text 5006 is changed in UI 500OSS, as shown in Figure 5SS.            Input text
5006 is changed to bold text. Duplicate input text 5022 is also changed to bold text to mirror
the change in the formatting of input text 5006.
[00238]         Figure 5TT depicts UI 5000TT.       Displayed in UI 5000TT is a menu 5158 of
input options for center area 5016-C.     Menu 5158 includes options for allowable user inputs
in center area 5016-C, such as gestures associated with text formatting operations, gestures
associated with text editing operations, Chinese character handwriting, drawing, emoticons,
and so forth. A user may select, in menu 5158, inputs that they want enabled or disabled in
center area 5016-C.
                                                62

[002391         Figure 5UU depicts UI 5000UU.          UI 5000UU includes application content
area 5160 (e.g., a content area in a web browser, content area in a word processing
application, etc.). Displayed in application content area 5160 are one or more text entry
areas 5162 (e.g., text fields in an online form).    For example, application content area 5160
includes text entry areas 5162-A thru 5162-F that are a part of an online form.              Soft
keyboard 5164 is also displayed.       While soft keyboard 5164 is shown as an unsplit soft
keyboard, in some embodiments, the input area is a split soft keyboard or an integrated input
area that includes a split keyboard, such as integrated input area 5016 or 5039.
[00240]         Gesture 5166 is detected on display 112.      Gesture 5166 is a dragging gesture
that includes a finger contact starting at position 5166-A and moving to position 5166-B.      In
response to detection of gesture 5166, soft keyboard 5164 moves vertically in accordance
with the direction of gesture 5166 and final position 5166-B in UI 5000VV, as shown in
Figure 5VV. After drag gesture 5166, soft keyboard 5164 may partially obscure a text entry
area 5162. For example, in UI 5000VV, soft keyboard 5164 partially obscures text entry
area 5162-F.
[00241]         Figure 5UU depicts UI 500OWW.         In UI 500OWW, gesture 5168 is detected.
Gesture 5168 is a flick gesture in a vertical direction starting from a location on soft keyboard
5164.    In response to detection of gesture 5168, movement trajectory 5170, including
movement inertia, is imparted to soft keyboard 5164 in accordance with gesture 5168. For
example, a short trajectory is imparted in response to a small flicking gesture, and a long
trajectory is imparted in response to a large flicking gesture. Movement trajectory 5170 has
termination point 5171.
[00242]         Soft keyboard 5164 moves with inertia in accordance with movement
trajectory 5170 in UI 500OXX, as shown in Figure 5XX, and comes to rest at a position
adjacent to and below text entry area 5162-F.       As soft keyboard 5164 stops just below text
entry area 5162-F, none of text entry area 5162-F is obscured by soft keyboard 5164. Even
though trajectory 5170 and the associated movement inertia would otherwise carry soft
keyboard 5164 to termination point 5171, which is above the bottom of text entry area 5162
F (Figure 5WW), trajectory 5170 is adjusted so that soft keyboard 5164 stops just below text
entry area 5162-F.
[00243]         Figure 5YY depicts UI 5000YY.         In UI 5000YY, gesture 5172 is detected.
Gesture 5172 is a flicking gesture in a vertical direction starting from a location on soft
                                                 63

keyboard 5164, and is a larger flicking gesture than gesture 5168. In response to detection
of gesture 5172, movement trajectory 5174, including movement inertia, is imparted onto soft
keyboard 5164 in accordance with gesture 5172. Movement trajectory 5174 is larger than
movement trajectory 5170 and has termination point 5175.
[00244]        Soft keyboard 5164 moves with inertia in accordance with movement
trajectory 5174 in UI 5000ZZ, as shown in Figure 5ZZ, and comes to rest at a position
adjacent to and below text entry area 5162-A.     As soft keyboard stops just below text entry
area 5162-A, none of text entry area 5162-A is obscured by soft keyboard 5164.             Even
though trajectory 5174 and the associated inertia would otherwise carry soft keyboard 5164
to termination point 5175, which is above the bottom of text entry area 5162-A (Figure 5YY),
trajectory 5174 is adjusted so that soft keyboard 5164 stops just below text entry area 5162-A.
[002451        In some embodiments, when the keyboard is "thrown" or "flung," the
keyboard bounces off the top or bottom of the display by some amount (e.g., an amount
corresponding to a top or bottom toolbar height, respectively) if there is some appreciable
velocity component of the touch at the time the touch lifts off. Conversely, when the
keyboard is dragged to the edge of the display and released with no or very little velocity, the
keyboard "docks" flush with the edge of the display (not shown).
[00246]        Figure 5AAA depicts UI 5000AAA displayed on display 112. UI 5000AAA
includes text entry area 5002, with cursor 5004 and input text 5006 displayed in text entry
area 5002.   Integrated input area 5039 is also displayed in UI 5000AAA.       Integrated input
area 5039 includes split keyboard portions 5039-A (the left portion) and 5039-B (the right
portion) and center area 5039-C.
[002471        Gesture 5176 is detected on display 112. In some embodiments, gesture 5176
is a two-thumb tap gesture, with one thumb on location 5176-A over split keyboard portion
5039-A and the other thumb on location 5176-B over split keyboard portion 5039-B.
[00248]        In response to detection of gesture 5176, device 100 enters a reconfiguration
mode for integrated input area 5039 in UI 500OBBB (Figure 5BBB). While device 100 is in
the reconfiguration mode, gesture 5178 is detected on display 112.     Gesture 5178 includes a
left thumb contact moving toward the left edge of display 112. In response to detection of
gesture 5178, split keyboard portion 5039-A reduces in size (e.g., in width, height, or both
width and height) in UI 500OCCC, as shown in Figure 5CCC, and the keys in split keyboard
portion 5039-A rescale in accordance with the size reduction of split keyboard portion 5039
                                               64

A. In some embodiments, center area 5039-C increases in size and split keyboard portion
5039-B maintains the same size in response.    In some other embodiments, both center area
5039-C and split keyboard portion 5039-B increases in size in response.
[00249]        Figure 5DDD depicts UI 5000DDD, which shows gesture 5180 detected on
display 112 while in the reconfiguration mode.    Gesture 5180 includes a left thumb contact
moving away from the left edge of display 112. In response to detection of gesture 5180,
split keyboard portion 5039-A increases in size (e.g., in width, height, or both width and
height) in UI 5000EEE, as shown in Figure 5EEE, and the keys in split keyboard portion
5039-A rescale in accordance with the size increase of split keyboard portion 5039-A.      In
some embodiments, center area 5039-C decreases in size and split keyboard portion 5039-B
maintains the same size in response.   In some other embodiments, both center area 5039-C
and split keyboard portion 5039-B decreases in size in response.
[002501        Figure 5FFF depicts UI 500OFFF, which shows gesture 5182 detected on
display 112 while in the reconfiguration mode.   Gesture 5182 includes a right thumb contact
moving toward the right edge of display 112. In response to detection of gesture 5182, split
keyboard portion 5039-B reduces in size (e.g., in width, height, or both width and height) in
UI 500OGGG, as shown in Figure 5GGG, and the keys in split keyboard portion 5039-B
rescale in accordance with the size reduction of split keyboard portion 5039-B.      In some
embodiments, center area 5039-C increases in size and split keyboard portion 5039-A
maintains the same size in response.   In some other embodiments, both center area 5039-C
and split keyboard portion 5039-A increases in size in response.
[002511        Figure 5HHH depicts UI 5000HHH, which shows gesture 5184 detected on
display 112 while in the reconfiguration mode.   Gesture 5184 includes a right thumb contact
moving away from the right edge of display 112. In response to detection of gesture 5184,
split keyboard portion 5039-B increases in size (e.g., in width, height, or both width and
height) in UI 5000II, as shown in Figure 5III, and the keys in split keyboard portion 5039-B
rescale in accordance with the size reduction of split keyboard portion 5039-B.      In some
embodiments, center area 5039-C decreases in size and split keyboard portion 5039-A
maintains the same size in response.   In some other embodiments, both center area 5039-C
and split keyboard portion 5039-A decreases in size in response.
[00252]        Figure 5JJJ depicts UI 5000JJJ, which shows gesture 5186 being detected on
display 112 while in the reconfiguration mode, in some other embodiments.       Gesture 5186
                                             65

includes a left thumb contact moving toward the left edge of display 112. In response to
detection of gesture 5186, both split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B reduce in size
(e.g., in width, height, or both width and height) in UI 5000KKK, as shown in Figure 5KKK,
and the keys in split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B rescale in accordance with the
size reduction of split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B, respectively.          Center area
5039-C also increases in size as a result.
[00253]          Figure 5LLL depicts UI 500OLLL, which shows gesture 5188 being detected
on display 112 while in the reconfiguration mode, in some other embodiments.            Gesture
5188 includes a left thumb contact moving away from the left edge of display 112.             In
response to detection of gesture 5188, both split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B
increase in size (e.g., in width, height, or both width and height) in UI 5000MMM, as shown
in Figure 5MMM, and the keys in split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B rescale in
accordance with the size increase of split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B, respectively.
Center area 5039-C also decreases in size as a result.
[00254]          Figure 5NNN depicts UI 500ONNN, where gesture 5190 is detected on display
112.    In some embodiments, gesture 5190 is a two-thumb tap gesture, with one thumb on
location 5190-A over split keyboard portion 5039-A and the other thumb on location 5190-B
over split keyboard portion 5039-B.       In response to detection of gesture 5190, device 100
exits the reconfiguration mode for integrated input area 5039.
[002551          It should be appreciated that, while the details of Figures 5A and 5NNN were
described in the context of display 112 in portrait orientation, the details of Figures 5A
5NNN also apply in an analogous manner to a display (e.g., display 112) in landscape
orientation.
[00256]          Figure 5000 depicts UI 5000000 displayed on touch-sensitive display 112
of device 100.       UI 5000000 may be a user interface in an application (e.g., a notes
application, a web browser application, etc.) on device 100.         UI 5000000 includes text
entry area 5002. A cursor and input text may be displayed in text entry area 5002. Unsplit
soft keyboard 5008 is displayed on touch-sensitive display 112 at the bottom of the display.
In some embodiments, unsplit soft keyboard includes keyboard split key 5012, the details of
which are described above and are not repeated here.
[002571          Gesture 5194 is detected on touch-sensitive display 112. Gesture 5194 is a
dragging or flick gesture starting from a location on touch-sensitive              display  112
                                                 66

corresponding to unsplit keyboard 5008. Gesture 5194 moves in direction 5196 away from
the bottom of touch-sensitive display 112.
[00258]         In response to detection of gesture 5194 on display 112, device 100 changes
unsplit soft keyboard 5008 (Figure 5000) into split keyboard 5198 (Figure 5RRR).           In
some embodiments, an animation showing the transition from unsplit soft keyboard 5008 to
split keyboard 5198 is displayed on display 112.     For example, the transitional animation
may show unsplit soft keyboard 5008 moving away from the bottom of display 112 over text
entry area 5002, in direction 5199, and splitting into split keyboard portions 5198-A and
5198-B, as shown in Figures 5PPP and 5QQQ. As unsplit soft keyboard 5008 splits into
portions 5198-A and 5198-B, portions 5198-A and 5198-B move apart in directions 5200-A
and 5200-B, respectively.     In some embodiments, unsplit keyboard 5008 is moved away
from the bottom of display 112 before the splitting begins, as shown in Figure 5PPP. Upon
completion of the transition animation, split keyboard 5198 is displayed, as shown in Figure
5RRR.
[002591         Figure 5PPP depicts UI 500OPPP, which shows an instant in the transition
from unsplit keyboard 5008 to split keyboard 5198. Unsplit keyboard 5008 is moved away
from the bottom of display 112, in direction 5199 (in accordance with direction 5196 of
gesture 5194), but splitting has yet to begin.
[00260]         Figure 5QQQ depicts UI 5000QQQ, which shows an instant, subsequent to the
instant depicted in Figure 5PPP, in the transition from unsplit keyboard 5008 to split
keyboard 5198. Splitting of unsplit keyboard 5008 is ongoing, as split keyboard portions
5198-A and 5198-B are displayed and continue to move in direction 5199. Split keyboard
portions 5198-A and 5198-B also move away from each other in directions 5200-A and 5200
B, respectively.
[00261]         Figure 5RRR depicts UI 500ORRR, in which split keyboard 5198 is displayed.
In some embodiments, split keyboard 5198 also includes keyboard unsplit key 5018, the
details of which are described above and are not repeated here. Gesture 5202, starting from a
location on display 112 corresponding to split keyboard 5198 and moving in direction 5204,
is detected. In some embodiments, gesture 5202 is a dragging or a flick gesture.
[00262]         Figure 5SSS depicts UI 500OSSS, which shows an instant in the transition
from split keyboard 5198 to unsplit keyboard 5008. Split keyboard 5198 is moved toward the
                                               67

bottom of display 112, in direction 5206 (in accordance with direction 5204 of gesture 5202),
but the merging of split keyboard portions 5198-A and 5198-B has yet to begin.
[00263]         Figure 5TTT depicts UI 5000TTT, which shows an instant, subsequent to the
instant depicted in Figure 5SSS, in the transition from split keyboard 5198 to unsplit
keyboard 5008. Merging of split keyboard portions 5198-A and 5198-B is ongoing, as split
keyboard portions 5198-A and 5198-B move toward each other in directions 5208-A and
5208-B, respectively, as well as move in direction 5206. When the merging is complete,
unsplit keyboard 5008 is displayed at the bottom of display 112, as in Figure 5000.
[00264]         Figures 6A-6B are flow diagrams illustrating a method 600 of replacing an
unsplit keyboard with an integrated input area in accordance with some embodiments. The
method 600 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable
multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface.      In some
embodiments, the display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the
display.   In some embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface.
Some operations in method 600 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may
be changed.
[002651         As described below, the method 600 provides an intuitive way to replace an
unsplit keyboard with an integrated input area for text entry. The method is particularly
useful when a user is typing with a tablet computer and wants to change from using an unsplit
keyboard (e.g., for ten-finger typing when the tablet computer is resting on a solid surface) to
using an integrated input area with a split keyboard (e.g., for two-thumb typing when the
tablet computer is being held by the user's remaining eight fingers) or vice versa. The method
reduces the cognitive burden on a user when manipulating soft keyboards, thereby creating a
more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated electronic devices, enabling a
user to manipulate a soft keyboard faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases
the time between battery charges.
[00266]         The device concurrently displays (602) a first text entry area (e.g., in an
application content area) and an unsplit keyboard (e.g. a single, unitary, or merged keyboard
that includes character keys from the left and right sides of a split keyboard) on the display.
Figure 5A, for example, shows text entry area 5002 and unsplit soft keyboard 5008 being
displayed concurrently on display 112.
                                               68

[002671         The device detects (604) a gesture on the touch-sensitive surface.             For
example, in Figure 5A, gesture 5010 or 5014 is detected on display 112, which is a touch
screen.
[00268]         In some embodiments, the gesture is (606) a multifinger (i.e., more than one
finger) depinch gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the
location of the unsplit keyboard on the display. For example, in Figure 5A, gesture 5010 is a
two-finger depinch gesture on unsplit soft keyboard 5008. In some embodiments, the two
finger depinch gesture requires symmetric horizontal movement (or movement within a
predetermined angle of horizontal, such as 50, 100, 150 or 20') on the touch-sensitive surface.
Requiring symmetric horizontal movement helps filter out anchored depinch gestures where
only one touch moves, non-horizontal depinch gestures, and other gestures that may not be
intended to replace the unsplit keyboard with an integrated input area.
[00269]         In some embodiments, the gesture is (608) a tap gesture on a keyboard
selection icon (e.g., a finger tap gesture on an icon that toggles between the unsplit keyboard,
the integrated input area, and possibly other types of keyboard input areas; a finger tap
gesture on an icon that activates replacement of the unsplit keyboard with the integrated input
area).   For example, in Figure 5A, gesture 5014 is a tap gesture on keyboard split key 5012,
which shows an icon of two halves moving apart in a split.
[002701         In response to detecting the gesture on the touch-sensitive surface, the device
replaces (610) the unsplit keyboard with an integrated input area. The integrated input area
includes a left portion with a left side of a split keyboard, a right portion with a right side of
the split keyboard, and a center portion in between the left portion and the right portion. For
example, in Figures 5A-5C, in response to detection of gesture 5010, unsplit soft keyboard
5008 is replaced with integrated input area 5016. Integrated input area 5016 includes left
split keyboard portion 5016-A, right split keyboard portion 5016-B, and center area 5016-C
situated between the left and right portions 5016-A, 5016-B.
[002711         In some embodiments, the width of the integrated input area is the same (or
substantially the same, e.g., 90% or 95%) as the width of the display. This width makes the
left side of the split keyboard more accessible to the left thumb of a user.       Similarly, this
width makes the right side of the split keyboard more accessible to the right thumb of a user.
[00272]         In some embodiments, the integrated input area is visually distinguished from
other user interface elements in the display, for example by providing the left portion, center
                                                69

portion, and right portion of the integrated input area with a common distinct shading,
background color or pattern, and/or by providing a distinctive border around the left portion,
center portion, and right portion of the integrated input area.
[00273]         In some embodiments, the integrated input area includes a second text entry
area (612).   The second text entry area typically displays a duplicate portion of the first text
entry area, such as an area near the cursor in first text entry area. For example, the second
text entry area may contain a duplicate of the cursor/insertion point in the first text entry area
and one or more words from the most recent text entered by the user adjacent to the
cursor/insertion point. For example, integrated input area 5016 includes center area 5016-C.
Center area 5016-C displays duplicate input text 5022, making center area 5016-C a second
text entry area to the first text entry area 5002.
[00274]         In some embodiment, the first text entry area displays (614) text at a first size,
and the second text entry area displays a portion of the text in the first text entry area at a
second size that is larger than the first size. For example, in Figure 5C, duplicate text input
5022 is displayed in center area 5016-C at a larger size than input text 5006 in text entry area
5002.
[002751         In some embodiments, while displaying the integrated input area, the device
detects (616) a gesture (e.g., a tap gesture 5026 on the "T" key 5024, Figure 5D) at a location
on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a location of a character key in the split
keyboard. In response to detecting the gesture at the location on the touch-sensitive surface
that corresponds to the location of the character key in the split keyboard, the device inputs
and concurrently displays (618) the corresponding character in the first text entry area and the
second text entry area on the display. For example, in Figure 5D, in response to detection of
gesture 5026, a character "t" is entered into input text 5006 and duplicate input text 5022.
[00276]         In some embodiments, replacing the unsplit keyboard with the integrated input
area includes displaying (620) an animation that transitions the unsplit keyboard to the
integrated input area. For example, Figure 5B shows an instant in a transition animation
from unsplit soft keyboard 5008 to integrated input area 5016.
[002771         In some embodiments, the transition for each character key is a linear
interpolation between two states, the unsplit (or merged) state and the split state. In some
embodiments, at least one character key is duplicated during the transition so that the left
portion of the split keyboard and the right portion of the split keyboard contain at least one
                                                 70

common character key (e.g., the "g" keys 5019-A and 5019-B in Figure 5C).               In some
embodiments, some keys in the unsplit keyboard are not displayed in the split keyboard (e.g.,
hide keyboard key 5009 in the unsplit keyboard (Figure 5A) is not displayed in the split
keyboard (Figure 5C)). In some embodiments, during the animated transition to the integrated
input area, keys that are not displayed in the split keyboard appear to be pushed off-screen as
they fade to zero opacity during the transition.
[00278]         In some embodiments, while displaying the integrated input area, the device
detects (622) a second gesture on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a gesture 5028 or 5032 on
display 112, Figure 5E).
[002791         In some embodiments, the second gesture is (624) a multifinger (i.e., more
than one finger) pinch gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to
the location of the integrated input area on the display. For example, in Figure 5E, gesture
5028 is a two-finger pinch gesture on display 112. In some embodiments, the two-finger
pinch gesture requires symmetric horizontal movement (or movement within a predetermined
angle of horizontal, such as 5', 100, 15      or 200) on the touch-sensitive surface. Requiring
symmetric horizontal movement helps filter out anchored pinch gestures where only one
touch moves, non-horizontal pinch gestures, and other gestures that may not be intended to
replace the integrated input area with the unsplit keyboard.
[00280]         In some embodiments, the second gesture is (626) a tap gesture on a keyboard
selection icon (e.g., a finger tap gesture on an icon that toggles between the unsplit keyboard,
the integrated input area, and possibly other types of keyboard input areas; a finger tap
gesture on an icon that activates replacement of the unsplit keyboard with the integrated input
area). For example, in Figure 5E, gesture 5032 is a tap gesture on keyboard unsplit key 5018,
which shows an icon of two halves merging together.
[00281]         In response to detecting the second gesture on the touch-sensitive surface, the
device replaces (628) the integrated input area with the unsplit keyboard. For example, in
Figures 5E-5G, in response to gesture 5028 or 5032, integrated input area 5016 is replaced
with unsplit keyboard 5008.
[00282]         In some embodiments, replacing the integrated input area with the unsplit
keyboard includes displaying (630) an animation that transitions the integrated input area to
the unsplit keyboard.     For example, Figure 5F shows an instant in a transition animation
from integrated input area 5016 to unsplit soft keyboard 5008.
                                                 71

[002831          In some embodiments, the electronic device is (632) a portable electronic
device (e.g., a tablet computer such as the iPad@ device from Apple Inc. of Cupertino,
California). For example, device 100 or 300 may be a portable tablet computer.
[00284]          In some embodiments, the display is (634) a touch-sensitive display that
includes the touch-sensitive surface. For example, display 112 is a touch screen.
[002851          Details in method 600 apply to the methods described below, and are omitted
for brevity.
[00286]          Figures 7A-7B are flow diagrams illustrating a method 700 of responding to a
keyboard selection gesture in accordance with some embodiments. The method 700 is
performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction device
100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the
display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some
embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface. Some operations in
method 700 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
[002871          As described below, the method 700 provides a way to prevent accidentally
changing soft keyboards while typing (e.g., from an unsplit keyboard to an integrated input
area with a split keyboard, or vice versa). The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user
when manipulating and using soft keyboards, thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated electronic devices, enabling a user to manipulate and
use soft keyboards faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the time
between battery charges.
[00288]          The device displays (702) a first keyboard on the display, the first keyboard
comprising a first plurality of keys (e.g. a split keyboard or, conversely, a single, unitary, or
merged keyboard that includes character keys from the left and right portions of the split
keyboard).     For example, in Figure 5H, unsplit keyboard 5008 is displayed.               Unsplit
keyboard 5008 includes a plurality of letter keys, an example of which is "T" key 5036.
[00289]          The device detects (704) a key activation gesture at a first time at a location on
the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a location of a first key in the first keyboard
(e.g., a tap gesture 5038 on the "T" key 5036, Figure 5H).
[00290]          In response to detecting the key activation gesture at the first time, the device
activates (706) the first key (e.g., entering a character that corresponds to the first key or
                                                72

performing an action that corresponds to the first key). For example, in Figures 5H-51, in
response to gesture 5038 on "T" key 536, a character "t" is entered into input text 5006.
[00291]           In some embodiments, in response to detecting the key activation gesture at
the first time, the device disables (708) a gesture recognizer for the keyboard selection
gesture for the predefined period of time.        For example, in Figure 5H, in response to
detection of gesture 5038, the device disables a gesture recognizer for the keyboard selection
gesture for the predefined period of time.
[00292]           The device detects (710) one or more contacts on the touch-sensitive surface at
a second time after the first time, the one or more contacts corresponding to a keyboard
selection gesture. For example, in Figure 51, gesture 5010, which includes two contacts, is
detected.
[00293]           In some embodiments, the keyboard selection gesture is (712) a multifinger
gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the location of the first
keyboard on the display. For example, in Figure 51, gesture 5010 is a two-finger depinch
gesture on unsplit soft keyboard 5008.
[00294]           In response to detecting the one or more contacts that correspond to the
keyboard selection gesture at the second time after the first time (713), the device replaces
(714) the first keyboard with a second keyboard when the second time exceeds a predefined
period of time after the first time.
[002951            In some embodiments, replacing the first keyboard with the second keyboard
includes displaying (716) an animation that transitions the first keyboard to the second
keyboard. For example, Figure 5J shows an instant in a transition animation from unsplit
soft keyboard 5008 to integrated input area 5016.
[00296]           In some embodiments, although the contacts that correspond to a keyboard
selection gesture are detected on the touch-sensitive surface, the keyboard selection gesture is
not recognized because the gesture recognizers for the keyboard selection gesture are
disabled for a predefined period of time after a key activation gesture is detected.
[002971           In response to detecting the one or more contacts that correspond to the
keyboard selection gesture at the second time after the first time, the device maintains (718)
display of the first keyboard when the second time is less than the predefined period of time
after the first time.
                                                73

[002981         For example, in response to detecting a multifinger pinch gesture to select a
merged keyboard when a split keyboard is currently displayed, the split keyboard is replaced
by the merged keyboard if more than a predefined period of time (e.g., 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6
seconds or some other reasonable period of time) has elapsed since a key in the split
keyboard was activated.    But the split keyboard remains displayed if less than the predefined
period of time has elapsed since a key in the split keyboard was activated, thereby preventing
accidentally changing the keyboard when the user is actively typing.            Conversely, in
response to detecting a multifinger depinch gesture to select a split keyboard when a merged
keyboard is currently displayed, the merged keyboard is replaced by the split keyboard if
more than the predefined period of time has elapsed since a key in the merged keyboard was
activated.  But the merged keyboard remains displayed if less than the predefined period of
time has elapsed since a key in the merged keyboard was activated.
[00299]         As an example, in Figures 5H-51, if the time period from gesture 5038 to
gesture 5010 exceeds the predefined period of time, then unsplit soft keyboard 5008 is
replaced with split soft keyboard area 5016, as shown in Figure 5K. If the time period from
gesture 5038 to gesture 5010 does not exceeds the predefined period of time, then unsplit soft
keyboard 5008 remains displayed.
[00300]         In some embodiments, the electronic device is (720) a portable electronic
device (e.g., a tablet computer). For example, device 100 or 300 may be a portable tablet
computer.
[00301]         In some embodiments, the display is (722) a touch-sensitive display that
includes the touch-sensitive surface.   For example, display 112 is a touch screen.
[00302]         Figures 8A-8B are flow diagrams illustrating a method 800 of moving an
integrated input area in accordance with some embodiments. The method 800 is performed at
an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable multifunction device 100, Figure
1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the display is a touch
screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the display. In some embodiments, the
display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface.  Some operations in method 800 may be
combined and/or the order of some operations may be changed.
[00303]         As described below, the method 800 provides a way to prevent accidental
movement of an integrated input area when a user contact moves during typing with the split
keyboard. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when repositioning and using
                                               74

an integrated input area that includes a split keyboard, thereby creating a more efficient
human-machine interface. For battery-operated          electronic devices, enabling a user to
reposition and use a soft keyboard faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases
the time between battery charges.
[00304]         The device concurrently displays (802) a first text entry area and an integrated
input area on the display, the integrated input area including: a left portion with a left side of
a split keyboard, a right portion with a right side of the split keyboard, and a center portion in
between the left portion and the right portion. For example, in Figure 5L, text entry area
5002 and integrated input area 5039 are displayed on display 112.           Integrated input area
5039 includes left split keyboard portion 5039-A, right split keyboard portion 5039-B, and
center area 5039-C between left and right split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B.
[003051         The device detects (804) a first contact on the touch-sensitive surface at a
location that corresponds to the center portion of the integrated input area. For example, in
Figure 5L, a finger contact corresponding to gesture 5040 is detected at position 5040-1 in
center area 5039-C.
[00306]         The device detects (806) movement of the first contact along the touch
sensitive surface. For example, in Figure 5L, the finger contact in gesture 5040 moves from
position 5040-1 to position 5040-2.
[003071         In response to detecting movement of the first contact along the touch
sensitive surface, the device moves (808) the integrated input area in accordance with the
movement of the first contact when the movement of the first contact exceeds a first
movement threshold.      For example, in Figures 5L-5M, when the movement of gesture 5040
exceeds threshold 5042, then integrated input area 5039 moves in accordance with the
movement gesture 5040.
[00308]         The device detects (810) a second contact, distinct from the first contact, on
the touch-sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to the split keyboard. For example,
in Figure 5L, a finger contact corresponding to gesture 5044 is detected at position 5044-1 in
right split keyboard portion 5039-B.
[00309]         The device detects (812) movement of the second contact along the touch
sensitive surface. For example, in Figure 5L, the finger contact in gesture 5044 moves from
position 5044-1 to position 5044-2.
                                                75

[003101         In response to detecting movement of the second contact along the touch
sensitive surface, the device moves (814) the integrated input area in accordance with the
movement of the second contact when the movement of the second contact exceeds a second
movement threshold, the second movement threshold being greater than the first movement
threshold. For example, in Figures 5L-5M, when the movement of gesture 5044 exceeds
threshold distance 5046 (or threshold distance 5048, depending on the implementation), then
integrated input area 5039 moves in accordance with the movement gesture 5044.
[003111         In some embodiments, a respective movement threshold is a function of a
horizontal distance of a respective contact from a vertical centerline of the integrated input
area (816).   For example, in Figure 5N, charts 5050 and 5058 show the threshold distance as
a function of distance from the centerline of integrated input area 5039.             In some
embodiments, the movement threshold increases as the horizontal distance of the contact
from the vertical centerline increases. For example, in Figure 5L, threshold distance 5046 in
right soft keyboard portion 5039-B is greater than threshold distance 5042 in center area
5039-C.     As another example. chart 5058 in Figure 5N shows the threshold distance
varying linearly with distance from a centerline of integrated input area 5039.
[00312]         In some embodiments, the integrated input area is constrained to vertical
movement on the display (e.g., when the width of the integrated input area is the same (or
substantially the same, e.g., 90% or 95%) as the width of the display) and the integrated input
area moves in accordance with a vertical component of movement of a respective contact
when a movement threshold for the respective contact is exceeded (818). For example, in
Figure 5L-5M, even with gesture 5044 having an angular movement (and thus having a
horizontal component and a vertical component), movement of integrated input area 5039 is
constrained to vertical movement. The horizontal movement of gesture 5044 is ignored.
[00313]         In some embodiments, the left side of the split keyboard and the right side of
the split keyboard maintain fixed positions relative to each other within the integrated input
area during movement of the integrated input area (820). For example, in Figures 5L-5M,
left and right split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B remain in fixed positions relative to
each other during the movement.
[00314]         Figure 9 is a flow diagram illustrating a method 900 of moving an input area
and adjusting the size of an application content area in accordance with some embodiments.
The method 900 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable
                                               76

multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface.       In some
embodiments, the display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the
display.   In some embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface.
Some operations in method 900 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may
be changed.
[003151         As described below, the method 900 provides a way to increase the size of an
application content area (e.g., an application view or window) when an input area with a
keyboard is moved from the bottom of a display. The method is particularly useful when a
user is typing with a tablet computer with a limited display area because it allows for more of
an application to be viewed, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For
battery-operated electronic devices, enabling a user to manipulate a soft keyboard and see
more of an application lets the user work faster, which conserves power and increases the
time between battery charges.
[003161         The device concurrently displays (902) on the display an application content
area with a first size and an input area with a keyboard (e.g., a split keyboard or a merged
keyboard), with the input area being adjacent to and separate from the application content
area with the first size and the input area being at a bottom of the display. For example, in
Figure 50, application content area 5062 with height 5064 and integrated input area 5039
with height 5065 are displayed.      Integrated input area 5039 is docked at the bottom of
display 112 and is adjacent to and separate from application content area 5062.
[003171         The device detects (904) a gesture on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., an
upward flick or drag gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to
the input area at the bottom of the display).  For example, in Figure 50, gesture 5068, which
is a dragging gesture, is detected on display 112.
[00318]         In response to detecting the gesture on the touch-sensitive surface, the device
moves (906) the input area away from the bottom of the display over the application content
area, and increases (908) the application content area to a second size larger than the first size.
For example, in Figure 5P, in response to detection of gesture 5068, integrated input area
5039 moves away from the bottom of display 112 and over application content area 5062.
Additionally, application content area 5062 (Figure 5P) increases in size to a size with height
5066, which is larger than the size of the application content area with height 5064 (Figure
50).
                                               77

[003191          In some embodiments, the first size of the application content area has a first
height, the second size of the application content area has a second height, the input area has
an input area height, and the second height is greater than the first height by an amount equal
to (or substantially equal to (e.g., up to 5% or 10% difference)) the input area height (910).
For example, in Figure 50, application content area 5062 has height 5064, and integrated
input area 5039 has height 5065. In Figure 5P, application content area 5062 has height
5066, which is the sum of height 5064 and height 5065.
[00320]          In other words, when the keyboard is "anchored" at the bottom of the screen,
an application treats the keyboard as being an area with non-zero height that cannot be used
to display the application content area. Thus, the application reduces the size of its
application content area accordingly. But, when the keyboard is moved away from the bottom
of the screen (becomes "unanchored" from the bottom of the display), the application treats
the keyboard as being an area with zero height (even though the actual displayed height of the
input area is non-zero) and so the application increases its content display area to use more of
the display (e.g., to use all or substantially all of the display area). When unanchored, the
keyboard floats over the application content area. The keyboard moves vertically in response
to detecting an upward finger gesture. The keyboard may move with inertia if the velocity
upon liftoff of the finger is above a predefined threshold.
[00321]          Figures 10A-10B are flow diagrams illustrating a method 1000 of entering
characters with a split soft keyboard in accordance with some embodiments. The method
1000 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable
multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some
embodiments, the display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the
display.    In some embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface.
Some operations in method 900 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may
be changed.
[00322]          As described below, the method 1000 makes two-thumb typing with a split
keyboard (e.g., on a tablet computer that is being held by the user's remaining eight fingers)
faster and more efficient by letting a user easily activate certain keys on the right side of a
split keyboard with a left thumb (and conversely, letting a user easily activate certain keys on
the left side of a split keyboard with a right thumb), thereby creating a more efficient human
machine interface. For battery-operated electronic devices, enabling a two-thumb typist to
                                                 78

enter characters in a split soft keyboard faster and more efficiently conserves power and
increases the time between battery charges.
[003231         The device concurrently displays (1002) a text entry area, a left side of a split
keyboard, and a right side of a split keyboard, with the left side of the split keyboard
including a plurality of rows of keys and the right side of the split keyboard including a
corresponding plurality of rows of keys. A row of keys on the left side of the split keyboard
and a row of keys on the right side of the keyboard are corresponding if the rows belong in
the same row in the unsplit keyboard corresponding to the split keyboard.
[00324]         For example, in Figure 5Q, text entry area 5002 and split soft keyboard 5069
are displayed.   Split soft keyboard 5069 includes left split keyboard portion 5069-A and right
split keyboard portion 5069-B.      Split soft keyboard 5069 includes letter keys arranged in
accordance with the QWERTY layout. In left portion 5069-A, the top row of letter keys
includes "Q," "W," "E," "R," and "T" keys.         The middle row of letter keys includes "A,"
"S," "D," and "F" keys.     The lower row of letter keys includes "Z," "X," "C," and "V" keys.
In right portion 5069-B, the top row of letter keys include "Y," "U," "I," "0," and "P" keys.
The middle row of letter keys includes "G," "H," "J," "K," and "L" keys.      The lower row of
letter keys includes "B," "N," and "M" keys. The row with "Q," "W," "E," "R," and "T"
keys on left portion 5069-A and the row with "Y," "U," "I," "0," and "P" keys on right
portion 5069-B are corresponding because these rows belong to the same top row in an
unsplit QWERTY keyboard.           Similarly, the row with "A," "S," "D," and "F" keys
correspond to the row with "G," "H," "J," "K," and "L" keys, and the row with "Z," "X,"
"C," and "V" keys correspond to the row with "B," "N," and "M" keys. On the other hand,
the row with "Q," "W," "E," "R," and "T" keys on left portion 5069-A does not correspond
to the row with "G," "H," "J," "K," and "L" keys or to the row with "B," "N," and "M" keys
in right portion 5069-B because they do not belong to the same row in an unsplit QWERTY
keyboard.
[003251         The device (1004) detects a gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface
that corresponds to a predefined area adjacent to and to the right of a rightmost key in a
respective row of the left side of the split keyboard. For example, in Figure 5R, gesture
5098 is detected on predefined key activation area 5086, which is to the right of "V" key
5074 in the lower row of letter keys in left split keyboard portion 5069-A.
                                                79

[003261         In some embodiments, the predefined area adjacent to and to the right of the
rightmost key in the respective row of the left side of the split keyboard is an undisplayed key
activation area that corresponds to the leftmost key in the corresponding respective row of the
right side of the split keyboard (1006).   For example, in Figure 5Q, key activation areas 5082,
5084, and 5086, which are adjacent to and to right of keys 5070, 5072, and 5074, respectively,
correspond to keys 5076, 5078, and 5080, respectively.
[003271         In response to detecting the gesture at the location on the touch-sensitive
surface that corresponds to the predefined area adjacent to and to the right of the rightmost
key in the respective row of the left side of the split keyboard, the device enters (1008) in the
text entry area a character that corresponds to a leftmost key in a corresponding respective
row of the right side of the split keyboard. For example, in Figures 5R-5S, in response to
detection of gesture 5098, a character "b" is entered into input text 5006, as key activation
area 5086 corresponds to "B" key 5080 in right split keyboard portion 5069-B; "B" key 5080
is the leftmost key in the corresponding row in right split keyboard portion 5069-B.
[00328]         If the leftmost key in the corresponding respective row of the right side of the
split keyboard is a duplicate of the rightmost key in the respective row of the left side of the
split keyboard, then the key adjacent to and to the right of the leftmost key in the
corresponding respective row of the right side of the split keyboard is entered instead. For
example, returning to the lower rows of letter keys in left and right split keyboard portions
5069-A and 5069-B in Figure 5Q, if undisplayed key activation area 5092 corresponding to
"V" key 5074 is instead a displayed duplicate "V" key, then in response to detection of a
gesture on key activation area 5086 to the right of the rightmost "V" key 5074 in the lower
row in left portion 5069-A, a character "b" (corresponding to "B" key 5080) is entered
instead of a character "v" corresponding to the duplicate "V" key.
[00329]         In some embodiments, the device detects (1010) a gesture at a location on the
touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a predefined area adjacent to and to the left of a
leftmost key in a respective row of the right side of the split keyboard. For example, in
Figure 5T, gesture 5100 is detected on predefined key activation area 5088, which is to the
left of the rightmost "Y" key in the top row of letter keys in right split keyboard portion
5069-B.
[00330]         In some embodiments, the predefined area adjacent to and to the left of the
leftmost key in the respective row of the right side of the split keyboard is an undisplayed key
                                                80

activation area that corresponds to the rightmost key in the corresponding respective row of
the left side of the split keyboard (1012).   For example, in Figure 5Q, key activation areas
5088, 5090, and 5092, which are adjacent to and to left of keys 5076, 5078, and 5080,
respectively, correspond to keys 5070, 5072, and 5074, respectively.
[00331]         In response to detecting the gesture at the location on the touch-sensitive
surface that corresponds to the predefined area adjacent to and to the left of the leftmost key
in the respective row of the right side of the split keyboard, the device enters (1014) in the
text entry area a character that corresponds to a rightmost key in a corresponding respective
row of the left side of the split keyboard. For example, in Figures 5T-5U, in response to
detection of gesture 5100, a character "t" is entered into input text 5006, as key activation
area 5088 corresponds to "T" key 5070 in left split keyboard portion 5069-A; "T" key 5070 is
the rightmost key in the corresponding row in left split keyboard portion 5069-B.
[00332]         If the rightmost key in the corresponding respective row of the left side of the
split keyboard is a duplicate of the leftmost key in the respective row of the right side of the
split keyboard, then the key adjacent to and to the left of the rightmost key in the
corresponding respective row of the left side of the split keyboard is entered instead. For
example, in the middle rows of letter keys in left and right split keyboard portions 5069-A
and 5069-B in Figure 5Q, if undisplayed key activation area 5084 corresponding to "G" key
5078 is instead a displayed duplicate "G" key, then in response to detection of a gesture on
key activation area 5090 to the left of the leftmost "G" key 5078 in the middle row in right
portion 5069-B, a character "f' (corresponding to "F" key 5072) is entered instead of a
character "g" corresponding to the duplicate "G" key.
[00333]         In some embodiments, prior to detecting the gesture, the device detects (1016)
a key activation gesture at a first time at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that
corresponds to a location of a visible key in the split keyboard. For example, in Figures 5Q
5R, prior to detection of gesture 5098, gesture 5096 is detected on "0" key 5094.              A
character "o" is entered into input text 5006 in response to detection of gesture 5096.
[00334]         In response to detecting the gesture at a second time after the first time, the
device enters (1018) in the text entry area the character that corresponds to the leftmost key in
the corresponding respective row of the right side of the split keyboard when the second time
is less than a predefined period of time after the first time, but the device foregoes (1020)
entering in the text entry area the character that corresponds to the leftmost key in the
                                                81

corresponding respective row of the right side of the split keyboard when the second time
exceeds the predefined period of time after the first time.         In some embodiments, the
undisplayed keys areas are only activatable when the user is actively typing, as determined by
detecting activation of visible keys in the split keyboard within a predefined period of time
(e.g., 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 seconds or some other reasonable period of time) of detecting the
gesture in the undisplayed key area. When the gesture in the undisplayed key area is detected
after the predefined period of time has elapsed since detecting activation of a visible key, the
character corresponding to the undisplayed key is not entered. This prevents accidental text
entry of characters that correspond to the undisplayed key areas when the user is not actively
typing.
[00335]         For example, if the time period between when gesture 5096 is detected and
when gesture 5098 is detected is less than a predefined period of time, then a character "b" is
entered in response to gesture 5098. On the other hand, if the time period between when
gesture 5096 is detected and when gesture 5098 is detected is more than the predefined
period of time, then the character "b" is not entered in response to gesture 5098.
[003361         Figures 11A-IID are flow diagrams illustrating a method 1100 of using a
center portion of an integrated input area in accordance with some embodiments. The method
1100 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable
multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface.       In some
embodiments, the display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the
display.   In some embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface.
Some operations in method 1100 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may
be changed.
[003371         As described below, the method 1100 provides a way to use the center portion
of an integrated input area to make character entry faster and more efficient. The method is
particularly useful when a user is performing two-thumb typing with a tablet computer. The
method makes additional character entry functions readily accessible to the user's thumbs,
thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated electronic
devices, enabling a user to perform character entry faster and more efficiently conserves
power and increases the time between battery charges.
[003381         The device concurrently displays (1102)        a first text entry area and an
integrated input area, the integrated input area including a left portion with a left side of a
                                                82

split keyboard, a right portion with a right side of the split keyboard, and a center portion
with a second text entry area, the center portion in between the left portion and the right
portion. For example, in Figure 5V, text entry area 5002 and integrated input area 5016 are
displayed on display 112. Integrated input area 5016 includes left split keyboard portion
5016-A, right split keyboard portion 5016-B, and center area 5016-C between left and right
portions 5016-A and 5016-B.         Center area 5016-C serves as a second text entry area, as
duplicate cursor 5020 and duplicate input text 5022 are displayed in center area 5016-C.
[00339]          The device detects (1104) a gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface
that corresponds to a location of a character key in the split keyboard (e.g., a tap gesture 5102
on "T" key 5024 key on left portion 5016-A, Figure 5V).
[00340]          In response to detecting the gesture at the location on the touch-sensitive
surface that corresponds to the location of the character key in the split keyboard, the device
inputs and concurrently displays (1106) the corresponding character in the first text entry area
and the second text entry area on the display. In Figure 5W, in response to detection of
gesture 5102 on "T" key 5024, a character "t"is entered into input text 5006 and concurrently
displayed. A character "t" is also entered into duplicate input text 5022 and concurrently
displayed in center area 5016-C. Having a second text entry area in the center portion of the
integrated input area that shows a portion of the text being entered in the first text entry area
makes text input faster, more efficient, and less stressful by reducing the amount of eye
movement when a user is thumb typing with the split keyboard.
[00341]          In some embodiments, the first text entry area displays text at a first size, and
the second text entry area displays a portion of the text in the first text entry area at a second
size that is larger than the first size (1108). For example, in Figure 5V, duplicate text input
5022 is displayed in center area 5016-C at a larger size than input text 5006 in text entry area
5002.
[00342]          In some embodiments, the width of the integrated input area is the same (or
substantially the same, e.g., 90% or 95%) as the width of the display (1110).           Integrated
input area 5016 in Figure 5V, for example, has a width that spans the width of display 112.
[00343]          In some embodiments, the left side of the split keyboard and the right side of
the split keyboard maintain fixed positions relative to each other within the integrated input
area during movement of the integrated input area (1112).      Having the left and right portions
maintain fixed positions relative to each other keeps the left and right portions at relative
                                                83

positions on the display that are more familiar to the use, and thus less cognitive readjustment
is needed on the part of the user to maintain typing efficiency.
[00344]         For example, Figure 5M shows integrated input area 5039 moving in response
to detection of a gesture (e.g., gesture 5040). Within integrated input area 5039, left portion
5039-A and right portion 5039-B maintain fixed positions relative to each other during the
movement. Integrated input areas 5039 and 5016 are similar, and thus when integrated input
area 5016 moves, left and right portions 5016-A and 5016-B maintain fixed positions relative
to each other.
[003451         In some embodiments, the second text entry area includes an insertion point
that remains stationary on the display as text is entered (1114).    A stationary insertion point
in the second text entry area provides a stable focal point for the user that helps reduce lateral
eye movement. For example, in Figure 5X-5Y, duplicate cursor 5020 is stationary within
center area 5016-C; when the position of duplicate 5020 relative to duplicate input text 5022
changes, duplicate input text 5022 is displayed as advancing or retreating relative to duplicate
cursor 5020.
[00346]         In some embodiments, the second text entry area includes an insertion point
(1116).   The device detects (1118) a gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at a location that
corresponds to the insertion point in the second text entry area, and moves (1120) the
insertion point in the second text entry area in accordance with the gesture on the touch
sensitive surface at the location that corresponds to the insertion point in the second text entry
area.   The insertion point in the first text entry area is also moved in accordance with the
gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at the location that corresponds to the insertion point in
the second text entry area.    For example, a leftward swipe moves the insertion point to the
beginning of a word, while a rightward swipe moves the insertion point to the end of a word.
Adjusting the insertion point via gestures in the second text entry area has the advantage of
requiring the user to move their thumb only a small distance from where they are typing
(versus the alternative of reaching to the first text entry area (or a menu bar at the top of the
display) each time an adjustment is needed.
[003471         For example, in Figure 5X-5Y, gesture 5102, moving in direction 5103, is
detected on duplicate cursor 5020 in center area 5016-C.      In response to detection of gesture
5102, duplicate cursor 5020 changes position relative to duplicate input text 5022 within
                                                84

center area 5016-C in accordance with gesture 5102 (and cursor 5004 does the same relative
to input text 5006).
[00348]          In some embodiments, the device displays (1122) text editing controls (e.g.,
icons, or graphical or user interface objects for selecting, cutting, copying, and/or pasting
text) in the center portion of the integrated input area. In some embodiments, the text editing
controls in the center portion of the integrated input area have corresponding text editing
controls in the first text entry area (1124).     For example, the text editing controls in the
center portion may be duplicates of text editing controls in the first text entry area.        For
example, in Figure 5Z, text editing control 5104, corresponding to text editing control 5106,
is displayed in text entry area 5002. In some embodiments, the device detects (1126) a
gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to a text editing control
in the center portion of the integrated input area, and executes (1128) a text editing command
in accordance with the gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at the location that corresponds
to the text editing control. Editing the text via gestures in the center portion of the integrated
input area has the advantage of requiring the user to move their thumb only a small distance
from where they are typing (versus the alternative of reaching to the first text entry area (or a
menu bar at the top of the display) each time an edit function is needed.
[00349]          For example, in Figure 5Z-5AA, text editing control 5106 corresponding to a
paste operation is displayed in center area 5016-C.        Gesture 5108 on text editing control
5106 is detected in center area 516-C.       In response to detection of gesture 5108, a paste
operation is executed; text "ahead" is pasted into duplicate text 5022 and input text 5006.
[003501          In some embodiments, the device displays (1130)           user-selectable input
elements (e.g., radio buttons, check boxes, pick lists, time pickers, and/or date pickers) in the
center portion of the integrated input area, detects (1132) a gesture on the touch-sensitive
surface at a location that corresponds to a user-selectable input element in the center portion
of the integrated input area, and, in response to detecting the gesture on the touch-sensitive
surface at the location that corresponds to the user-selectable input element, selects (1134) the
user-selectable input element.    Selecting radio buttons, check boxes, items in pick lists, times
and dates via gestures in the center portion of the integrated input area has the advantage of
requiring the user to move their thumb only a small distance from where they are typing each
time a selection is needed.
                                                85

[003511         For example, in Figure 5BB-5CC, form 5110 is displayed in text entry area
5002.   Form 5110 includes checkboxes 5112, each respective checkbox corresponding to an
option in the form. At least some of checkboxes 5112 are displayed in center area 5016-C as
duplicate checkboxes 5116.      Gesture 5118 is detected on duplicate checkbox 5116-A in
center area 5016-C.    In response to detection of gesture 5118, checkbox 5116-A is selected.
[00352]         In some embodiments, the device detects (1136) a gesture on the touch
sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to the center portion of the integrated input
area (e.g., a tap gesture on an icon to activate a popup menu or a predefined multifinger
gesture within the center portion), and, in response to detecting the gesture on the touch
sensitive surface at the location that corresponds to the center portion of the integrated input
area, displays (1138) a popup view. Accessing a popup view (e.g., a window or menu in an
application) via a gesture in the center portion of the integrated input area has the advantage
of requiring the user to move their thumb only a small distance from where they are typing
(versus the alternative of reaching to the first text entry area (or a menu bar at the top of the
display) each time a popup view is needed.
[00353]         For example, in Figures 5DD-5EE, gesture 5120 is detected in center area
5016-C.    In response to detection of gesture 5120, popup menu 5124 is displayed.       In some
embodiments, popup menu 5122, corresponding to popup menu 5124, is displayed in text
entry area 5002.
[00354]         In some embodiments, the device detects (1140) a plurality of gestures on the
touch-sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to the center portion of the integrated
input area (e.g., a series of finger strokes and taps that correspond to Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, or other characters), and enters (1142) in the first text entry area and the second text
entry area a character that corresponds to the plurality of gestures.     Exemplary characters
include alphabetic characters, numeric characters, symbols, punctuation characters, Arabic
script characters, Cyrillic characters, Greek characters, emoji symbols, emoticon symbols,
Asian characters such as sinographs, Japanese Kanji, katakana, or hiragana, etc., Devanagari
characters, Perso-Arabic characters, Gurmukhi characters, and Hebrew characters.        Drawing
characters via gestures in the center portion of the integrated input area has the advantage of
requiring the user to move their finger only a small distance from where they are typing.
                                                86

[003551         For example, in Figures 5FF-5GG, one or more gestures 5128 corresponding
to handwriting 5126 are detected in center area 5016-C.         Character "P"    corresponding to
handwriting 5126 is entered into input text 5006 and duplicate input text 5022.
[00356]         In some embodiments, the device detects (1144) a plurality of gestures on the
touch-sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to the center portion of the integrated
input area (e.g., a series of finger strokes and taps that correspond to a simple drawing), and
makes (1146) a drawing in accordance with the plurality of gestures.        Drawing via gestures
in the center portion of the integrated input area has the advantage of requiring the user to
move their finger only a small distance from where they are typing.
[003571         For example, in Figures 5HH-511, one or more gestures 5132 corresponding to
drawing 5130 are detected in center area 5016-C.       Drawing 5133, corresponding to drawing
5130 is entered into input text 5006.
[00358]         In some embodiments, the device displays (1148) a suggested word in the
center portion of the integrated input area (e.g., a word automatically suggested to complete
or correct a series of characters displayed in the first text entry area and the second text entry
area), detects (1150) a gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to
the suggested word, and executes (1152) a text editing command in accordance with the
gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at the location that corresponds to the suggested word.
In some embodiments, tapping the suggested word accepts and inputs the suggested word.
In some embodiments, tapping the suggested word (or an X icon) rejects and terminates
display of the suggested word. Editing the text via gestures in the center portion of the
integrated input area has the advantage of requiring the user to move their thumb only a small
distance from where they are typing (versus the alternative of reaching to the first text entry
area (or a menu bar at the top of the display) each time an edit function is needed.
[003591         For example, in Figures 5JJ-5KK, suggested word 5134 is displayed in text
entry area 5002, and duplicate suggested word 5136, corresponding to suggested word 5134,
is displayed in center area 5016-C.      Suggested word 5136 is displayed with X icon 5137.
Gesture 5138 is detected on X icon 5137 associated with suggested word 5136. In response
to detection of gesture 5138, suggested word 5136 is rejected and display of suggested word
5136 and suggested word 5134 are terminated.
[00360]         In some embodiments, the device displays (1154)             a plurality of emoji
characters in the center portion of the integrated input area, detects (1156) a gesture on the
                                                87

touch-sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to an emoji character in the plurality of
emoji characters (e.g., a tap gesture on the emoji character), and, in response to detecting the
gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at the location that corresponds to the emoji character,
inputs and displays (1158) the emoji character in the first text entry area and the second text
entry area on the display. Entering emoji characters via gestures in the center portion of the
integrated input area has the advantage of requiring the user to move their thumb only a small
distance from where they are typing (versus the alternative of reaching to the first text entry
area (or a menu bar at the top of the display) each time an emoji character is needed.
[003611          For example, in Figures 5LL-5MM, emoji characters 5140, including emoji
character 5140-A, are displayed in text entry area 5002.      Duplicate emoji characters 5142 are
displayed in center area 5016-C.     Duplicate emoji character 5142-A is a duplicate of emoji
character 5140-A.       Gesture 5144 is detected on duplicate emoji character 5142-A.          In
response to detection of gesture 5144, emoji character 5140-A is entered into input text 5006
and displayed, and duplicate emoji character 5142-A is entered into duplicate input text 5022
and displayed.
[00362]          In some embodiments, the device displays (1160) a plurality of unicode
characters in the center portion of the integrated input area, detects (1162) a gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to a unicode character in the plurality of
unicode characters (e.g., a tap gesture on the unicode character), and, in response to detecting
the gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at the location that corresponds to the unicode
character, inputs and displays (1164) the unicode character in the first text entry area and the
second text entry area on the display. Entering unicode characters via gestures in the center
portion of the integrated input area has the advantage of requiring the user to move their
thumb only a small distance from where they are typing (versus the alternative of reaching to
the first text entry area (or a menu bar at the top of the display) each time a unicode character
is needed.
[00363]          For example, in Figures 5NN-500, unicode characters 5146, including
unicode character 5146-A, are displayed in text entry area 5002.              Duplicate unicode
characters 5148 are displayed in center area 5016-C.      Duplicate unicode character 5148-A is
a duplicate of unicode character 5146-A.        Gesture 5149 is detected on duplicate unicode
character 5148-A.      In response to detection of gesture 5149, unicode character 5146-A is
entered into input text 5006 and displayed, and duplicate unicode character 5148-A is entered
into duplicate input text 5022 and displayed.
                                                 88

[003641          In some embodiments, the device detects (1166) a gesture on the touch
sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to the second text entry area (e.g., a tap and
drag gesture over text in the second text entry area), and, in response to detecting the gesture
on the touch-sensitive surface at the location that corresponds to the second text entry area,
selects (1168) a range of text.      Selecting text via gestures in the center portion of the
integrated input area has the advantage of requiring the user to move their thumb only a small
distance from where they are typing.
[003651          For example, in Figures 5PP-5QQ, gesture 5150 is detected over duplicate
input text 5022 in center area 5016-C.      Gesture 5150 includes a tap and drag gesture from
position 5150-A to position 5150-B. In response to gesture 5150, duplicate input text 5022
is selected, as indicated by highlighting 5154.
[00366]          In some embodiments, the device detects (1170) a gesture on the touch
sensitive surface at a location that corresponds to one or more words in the second text entry
area (e.g., a swipe or double-tap gesture on a word in the second text entry area), and, in
response to detecting the gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at the location that
corresponds to the second text entry area, formats (1172) the one or more words. Formatting
text via gestures in the center portion of the integrated input area has the advantage of
requiring the user to move their thumb only a small distance from where they are typing.
[003671          For example, in Figures 5RR-5SS, gesture 5156 is detected on word "gotten"
in duplicate input text 5022, in center area 5016-C. In response to detection of gesture 5156,
the word "gotten" in duplicate input text 5022 and the corresponding word in input text 5006
are formatted as bold text.
[00368]          In some embodiments, input elements in the center portion of the integrated
input area are user-configurable (e.g., via a tool bar or settings menu) (1174).    The various
features described above with respect to the center portion (e.g., character handwriting,
drawing, selecting user selectable elements, text editing operations, etc.) may be selectively
enabled by a user. For example, in Figure 5TT, an options page showing 5158 showing the
available input elements for center area 5016-C is displayed. Options page 5158 includes
input element options for center area 5016-C and corresponding checkboxes for enabling or
disabling those options.
[00369]          Figures 12A-12B are flow diagrams illustrating a method 1200 of moving an
input area that includes a keyboard over an application content area in accordance with some
                                                89

embodiments. The method 1200 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure
3, or portable multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface.
In some embodiments, the display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is
on the display.    In some embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive
surface.   Some operations in method 1200 may be combined and/or the order of some
operations may be changed.
[003701         As described below, the method 1200 provides a way to use an imprecise flick
gesture to precisely and automatically place a soft keyboard just below a text entry area in an
application. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when positioning and using a
soft keyboard, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery
operated electronic devices, enabling a user to manipulate a soft keyboard faster and more
efficiently conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[003711         The device concurrently displays (1202) on the display an application content
area that includes one or more text entry areas and an input area with a keyboard (e.g., a
merged keyboard or an integrated input area with a split keyboard) that is displayed over the
application content area.   Figure 5UU, for example, shows application content area 5160
displayed on display 112.    Text entry areas 5162 are displayed in application content area
5160.    Soft keyboard 5164 is also displayed on display 112.
[00372]         The device detects (1204) a drag gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at a
location that corresponds to the input area on the display.  For example, in Figure 5UU, drag
gesture 5166 is detected on display 112.      Drag gesture 5166 starts from position 5166-1,
which is located in soft keyboard 5164.
[00373]         The device, in response to detecting the drag gesture, moves (1206) the input
area on the display in accordance with the drag gesture.      In response to detection of drag
gesture 5166, soft keyboard 5164 is moved in accordance with drag gesture 5166, as shown
in Figure 5VV.
[00374]         The device detects (1208) a flick gesture on the touch-sensitive surface at a
location that corresponds to the input area on the display. For example, in Figure 5WW,
gesture 5168 is detected on display 112.    Gesture 5168 starts from a location corresponding
to soft keyboard 5164.
[003751         The device, in response to detecting the flick gesture, moves (1210) the input
area on the display with inertia in accordance with the flick gesture such that the input area
                                               90

comes to rest at a location adjacent to and just below a text entry area in the application
content area.
[00376]         In other words, when a drag gesture is applied to the input area, the input area
tracks (follows) the movement of the finger making the drag gesture. When lift-off of the
finger making the drag gesture is detected, the movement of the input area stops. In contrast,
when a flick gesture is applied to the input area, the input area is 'thrown' in the direction of
the flick gesture with some simulated inertia and friction, so the input area does not stop at a
location that corresponds to where lift-off of the finger making the flick gesture occurred.
Instead, the input area continues to move in the direction of the flick gesture, gradually slows
down, and comes to rest at a location adjacent to and just below a text entry area in the
application.   Thus, an imprecise flick gesture results in automatic, precise placement of a
keyboard just below a text entry area in an application, whereas a more precise drag gesture
enables a user to manually position the text entry area.
[003771         For example, in Figures 5WW-5XX,            in response to gesture 5168, soft
keyboard 5164 moves with trajectory 5170, including movement inertia, in accordance with
gesture 5168.    Soft keyboard 5164 comes to rest adjacent to and below text entry area 5162
F; soft keyboard 5164 docks just below text entry area 5162-F.
[00378]         In some embodiments, moving the input area on the display with inertia in
accordance with the flick gesture includes calculating (1212) a trajectory of the input area
based on the flick gesture, searching (1214) for one or more text entry areas in the application
content area that meet predefined candidate criteria, and, when one or more candidate text
entry areas are found, identifying (1216) a respective candidate text entry area as the text
entry area that the input area will come to rest adjacent to and just below and adjusting the
trajectory accordingly.      For example, in Figures        5WW-5XX, trajectory 5170 with
termination point 5171 is calculated based on gesture 5168. One or more text entry areas
5162 in application content area 5160 that meet predefined criteria (e.g., within a predefined
distance from termination point 5171) are searched. Among candidates text entry areas that
are found, one (e.g., 5162-F) is selected as the text entry area under which soft keyboard 5164
will come to rest. Trajectory 5170 is adjusted so that soft keyboard 5164 comes to rest under
text entry area 5162-F.
[003791         As another example, in Figures 5YY-5ZZ, trajectory 5174 with termination
point 5175 is calculated based on flick gesture 5172. One or more text entry areas 5162 in
                                                91

application content area 5160 that meet predefined criteria (e.g., within a predefined distance
from termination point 5175) are searched. Among candidates text entry areas that are found,
one (e.g., 5162-A) is selected as the text entry area under which soft keyboard 5164 will
come to rest. Trajectory 5174 is adjusted so that soft keyboard 5164 comes to rest under text
entry area 5162-A.
[00380]          In some embodiments, identifying one of the candidate text entry areas as the
text entry area that the input area will come to rest adjacent to and just below includes
selecting (1218) a respective candidate text entry area that is closest to a termination point of
the trajectory as the text entry area that the input area will come to rest adjacent to and just
below. For example, in Figure 5YY, text entry area 5162-A is selected as the text entry area
under which soft keyboard 5164 come to rest; text entry area 5162-A is closest to termination
point 5175.    In 5ZZ, soft keyboard 5164 comes to rest adjacent to and under text entry area
5162-A.
[00381]          In some embodiments, the respective candidate text entry area is identified as
the text entry area that the input area will come to rest adjacent to and just below based on
proximity of the respective candidate text entry area to a termination point of the trajectory
(1220).   For example, in Figure 5YY-5ZZ, text entry area 5162-A is selected as the text
entry area under which soft keyboard 5164 comes to rest based on the fact that it is the closest
among text entry areas 5162 to termination point 5175.
[00382]          In some embodiments, the trajectory is calculated based on simulated physical
properties of the input area (1222).   For example, one or more simulated physical properties
are associated with application content area 5160.           Examples of simulated physical
properties include properties that affect the motion of an object, such as density, friction
coefficient, and so forth.     Values for the properties are predefined.      A trajectory (e.g.,
trajectory 5170) is calculated based on the properties and the corresponding gesture (e.g.,
gesture 5168).
[00383]          In some embodiments, the candidate criteria are met for a respective text entry
area if the respective text entry area is within a predefined distance of a termination point of
the trajectory (1224).    For example, in Figure 5YY, text entry areas that are within a
predefined distance (e.g., distance 5177) from termination point 5175 are identified as
candidate text entry areas under which soft keyboard 5164 may come to rest in accordance
                                                92

with trajectory 5175.    Text entry areas 5162-A and 5162-B are within distance 5177 and are
thus identified as candidate text entry areas.
[003841          Figures  13A-13B     are  flow diagrams       illustrating a method     1300    of
reconfiguring an integrated input area in accordance with some embodiments. The method
1300 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable
multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface.         In some
embodiments, the display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the
display.    In some embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface.
Some operations in method 1300 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may
be changed.
[003851          As described below, the method 1300 provides an intuitive way to reconfigure
the sizes and positions of the left side and right side of a soft split keyboard in an integrated
input area. The method is particularly useful when a user is performing two-thumb typing
with a tablet computer (e.g., when the tablet computer is being held by the user's remaining
eight fingers). The method makes it fast and easy for a user to customize a split keyboard in
an integrated input area to the size of the user's thumbs, thereby creating a more efficient
human-machine interface. For battery-operated electronic devices, using a split keyboard that
is customized to the size of the user's thumbs enables the user to perform character entry
faster and more efficiently, thereby conserving power and increasing the time between
battery charges.
[003861          The device concurrently displays (1302) on the display a first text entry area,
and an integrated input area, the integrated input area including a left portion with a left side
of a split keyboard, a right portion with a right side of the split keyboard, and a center portion
in between the left portion and the right portion.     For example, in Figure 5AAA, text entry
area 5002 and integrated input area 5039 are displayed.       Integrated input area 5039 includes
left split keyboard portion 5039-A, right soft keyboard portion 5039-B, and center area 5039
C between left and right portions 5039-A and 5039-B.
[003871          The device detects (1304) a first input on the touch-sensitive surface. In some
embodiments, the first input is by a first thumb and a second thumb, distinct from the first
thumb, on the touch-sensitive surface (1305) (e.g., a single tap gesture by the first thumb
concurrent with a single tap gesture by the second thumb; a double tap gesture by the first
thumb concurrent with a double tap gesture by the second thumb; or a swipe gesture by the
                                                93

first thumb concurrent with a swipe gesture by the second thumb). In some embodiments,
the first input is detected at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the
location of the integrated input area on the display. For example, returning to Figure 5AA,
gesture 5176 is detected in split soft keyboard 5039.         Gesture 5176 includes concurrent
thumb contacts 5176-A and 5176-B on display 112.
[00388]          In response to detecting the first input, the device enters (1306)            a
reconfiguration mode for the integrated input area. In response to detection of gesture 5176
(Figure 5AAA), for example, device 100 enters a reconfiguration mode for integrated input
area 5039. While in reconfiguration mode, device 100 is receptive to one or more gestures
for resizing portions of the split keyboard in integrated input area 5039. One advantage of
having a distinct reconfiguration mode for the integrated input area is that this prevents the
split keyboard from being accidentally reconfigured when the user is thumb typing.
[00389]          While in the reconfiguration mode for the integrated input area, the device
detects (1308) a second input by the first thumb and/or the second thumb. In response to
detecting the second input, the device adjusts (1310) the size of at least one of the left side
and the right side of the split keyboard in the integrated input area.
[00390]           While in the reconfiguration mode for the integrated input area, the device
detects (1312) a third input. In some embodiments, the third input is by the first thumb and/or
the second thumb (1313 e.g., a single tap gesture by the first thumb concurrent with a single
tap gesture by the second thumb; a double tap gesture by the first thumb concurrent with a
double tap gesture by the second thumb; or a swipe gesture by the first thumb concurrent with
a swipe gesture by the second thumb). In response to detecting the third input, the device
exits (1314) the reconfiguration mode for the integrated input area. In some embodiments,
the third input is detected at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to the
location of the integrated input area on the display.
[00391]          For example, Figures 5BBB thru 5MMM shows various gestures detected
while in reconfiguration mode and the resulting change to integrated input area 5039 in
response to the respective detected gesture. To take just one of these examples, Figure 5LLL
shows gesture 5188 being detected. Gesture 5188 includes a left thumb moving away from
the left edge of display 112. In response to detection of gesture 5188, left portion 5039-A
and right portion 5039-B increase in size, as shown in Figure 5MMM. Figure 5NNN shows
gesture 5190 detected on display 112. In response to gesture 5190, device 100 exits the
                                                 94

reconfiguration mode, and split keyboard portions 5039-A and 5039-B maintain their new
sizes.
[00392]          In some embodiments, the second input includes a horizontal movement of a
left thumb towards a left vertical side of the display, and in response to detecting the
horizontal movement of the left thumb towards the left vertical side of the display, the device
reduces (1316) the size of the left side of the split keyboard.           In some embodiments,
movement by one thumb adjusts the size of the corresponding side of the split keyboard.        For
example in Figures 5BBB-5CCC, gesture 5178 is detected on display 112.              Gesture 5178
includes a left thumb moving horizontally toward the left vertical side of display 112.          In
response to detection of gesture 5178, left split keyboard portion 5039-A reduces in size.
[00393]          In some embodiments, the second input includes a horizontal movement of a
left thumb away from a left vertical side of the display, and in response to detecting the
horizontal movement of the left thumb away from the left vertical side of the display, the
device increases (1318) the size of the left side of the split keyboard.   For example in Figures
5DDD-5EEE, gesture 5180 is detected on display 112.           Gesture 5180 includes a left thumb
moving horizontally away from the left vertical side of display 112.      In response to detection
of gesture 5180, left split keyboard portion 5039-A increases in size.
[00394]          Analogously, in some embodiments, movement by the right thumb toward the
right vertical side of the display and away from the right vertical side of the display decreases
and increases, respectively, the size of the right side of the split keyboard, as shown in
Figures 5FFF-5III.
[003951          In some embodiments, the second input includes a horizontal movement of the
first thumb towards a vertical side of the display closest to the first thumb (e.g., moving the
left thumb towards the left vertical side of the display or moving the right thumb towards the
right vertical side of the display), and in response to detecting the horizontal movement of the
first thumb towards the vertical side of the display closest to the first thumb, the device
reduces the size of the left side and the right side of the split keyboard (1320).        In some
embodiments, movement by just one thumb concurrently reduces the size of both the left side
and the right side of the split keyboard. For example, in Figures 5JJJ-5KKK, gesture 5186 is
detected on display 112.     Gesture 5186 includes a left thumb moving toward the left vertical
side of display 112.     In response to detection of gesture 5186, left split keyboard portion
5039-A and right split keyboard portion 5039-B are concurrently reduced in size.
                                                 95

[003961          In some embodiments, the left edge of the left side of the split keyboard
maintains its position (which is typically near the left vertical side of the display) as the left
side of the split keyboard is reduced. Thus, the right edge of the left side of the split keyboard
moves closer to the left vertical side of the display as the left side of the split keyboard is
reduced. This makes it easier for the left thumb to reach the keys near the right edge of the
left side of the split keyboard and eliminates the need for the user to reposition the left edge
of the left side of the keyboard after the left side of the keyboard is reduced. Similarly, in
some embodiments, the right edge of the right side of the split keyboard maintains its position
(which is typically near the right vertical side of the display) as the right side of the split
keyboard is reduced. Thus, the left edge of the right side of the split keyboard moves closer to
the right vertical side of the display as the right side of the split keyboard is reduced. This
makes it easier for the right thumb to reach the keys near the left edge of the right side of the
split keyboard and eliminates the need for the user to reposition the right edge of the right
side of the keyboard after the right side of the keyboard is reduced.
[00397]          In some embodiments, the second input includes a horizontal movement of the
first thumb away from a vertical side of the display closest to the first thumb (e.g., moving
the left thumb away from the left vertical side of the display or moving the right thumb away
from the right vertical side of the display), and in response to detecting the horizontal
movement of the first thumb away from the vertical side of the display closest to the first
thumb, the device increases (1322) the size of the left side and the right side of the split
keyboard. In some embodiments, movement by just one thumb concurrently increases the
size of both the left side and the right side of the split keyboard. For example, in Figures
5LLL-5MMM, gesture 5188 is detected on display 112. Gesture 5188 includes a left thumb
moving away from the left vertical side of display 112. In response to detection of gesture
5188, left split keyboard portion 5039-A and right split keyboard portion 5039-B increase in
size.
[003981          Figure 14 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of automatically converting
between an unsplit keyboard and a split keyboard in accordance with some embodiments.
The method 1400 is performed at an electronic device (e.g., device 300, Figure 3, or portable
multifunction device 100, Figure 1) with a display and a touch-sensitive surface. In some
embodiments, the display is a touch screen display and the touch-sensitive surface is on the
display.    In some embodiments, the display is separate from the touch-sensitive surface.
                                                96

Some operations in method 1400 may be combined and/or the order of some operations may
be changed.
[00399]         As described below, the method 1400 provides an efficient way to manipulate
a soft keyboard into a position and configuration that best suits the user's needs. The method
is particularly useful when the user alternates between placing a tablet computer on a surface
(where typing on an unsplit keyboard at the bottom of the display is more efficient) and
holding the tablet computer with both hands (where two-thumb typing on a split keyboard
away from the bottom of the display is more efficient). The method reduces the cognitive
burden on a user when configuring the soft keyboard for use, thereby creating a more
efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated electronic devices, enabling a user to
configure a soft keyboard faster and more efficiently conserves power and increases the time
between battery charges.
[00400]         The device concurrently displays (1402) on the display an application content
area, and an unsplit keyboard (e.g. a single, unitary, or merged keyboard that includes
character keys from the left and right sides of the split keyboard). The unsplit keyboard is
located at the bottom of the display. For example, in Figure 5000, text entry area 5002 (e.g.,
of a notes application) and unsplit keyboard 5008 are displayed on display 112. Unsplit
keyboard 5008 is displayed at the bottom of display 112.
[00401]         The device detects (1404) a first gesture on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g.,
an upward flick or drag gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds
to the unsplit keyboard at the bottom of the display, or an upward drag gesture that starts at a
location on the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a location of a predefined key on
the unsplit keyboard, such as key 5012 in Figure 5000). For example, in Figure 5000,
gesture 5194, with upward movement 5196 away from the bottom of display 112, is detected
on display 112.
[00402]         In response to detecting the first gesture on the touch-sensitive surface, the
device converts the unsplit keyboard into a split keyboard and moves the split keyboard away
from the bottom of the display over the application content area in accordance with the first
gesture (1406). For example, in response to the detection of gesture 5194, unsplit keyboard
5008 is converted to split keyboard 5198, and split keyboard 5198 is moved away from the
bottom of display 112, as shown in Figures 5PPP-5RRR. In some embodiments, the
application content area remains the same size before and after the first gesture, as shown in
                                               97

Figure 5000. In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first gesture, the
application content area changes from a first size to a second size larger than the first size, as
described above with respect to method 900.
[00403]           In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first gesture on the touch
sensitive surface and prior to converting the unsplit keyboard into the split keyboard, the
device moves (1408) the unsplit keyboard away from the bottom of the display over the
application content area in accordance with the first gesture. For example, in Figure 5PPP,
unsplit keyboard 5008 is moved away from the bottom of display 112 prior to the start of the
split into split keyboard portions 5198-A and 5198-B.
[00404]           In some embodiments, in response to detecting the first gesture on the touch
sensitive surface, the device displays (1410) an animation of the unsplit keyboard converting
into the split keyboard while moving the keyboard away from the bottom of the display. For
example, Figures 5PPP and 5QQQ illustrate instants in an animated transition from unsplit
keyboard 5008 to split keyboard 5198.
[004051           In some embodiments, while concurrently displaying on the display the
application content area, and the split keyboard, the split keyboard being located away from
the bottom of the display, the device detects a second gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., an downward flick or drag gesture at a location on the touch-sensitive surface that
corresponds to the split keyboard, or a downward drag gesture that starts at a location on the
touch-sensitive surface that corresponds to a location of a predefined key on the split
keyboard, such as key 5018 in Figure 5RRR). In response to detecting the second gesture on
the touch-sensitive surface, the device converts the split keyboard into the unsplit keyboard
and moves the unsplit keyboard to the bottom of the display in accordance with the second
gesture (1412). For example, in Figure 5RRR, split keyboard 5198 is displayed on display
112. Split keyboard 5198 is displayed away from the bottom of display 112. Gesture 5202,
with downward movement 5204 toward the bottom of display 112, is detected on display 112.
In response to the detection of gesture 5202, split keyboard 5198 is converted to unsplit
keyboard 5008, and unsplit keyboard 5008 is moved to the bottom of display 112, as shown
in Figures 5SSS-5TTT and 5000.
[00406]           In some embodiments, in response to detecting the second gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface and prior to converting the split keyboard into the unsplit keyboard,
the device moves (1414) the unsplit keyboard towards the bottom of the display over the
                                              98

application content area in accordance with the second gesture. For example, in Figure 5SSS,
split keyboard 5198 is moved toward the bottom of display 112 prior to the start of the
merging of split keyboard portions 5198-A and 5198-B.
[004071         In some embodiments, in response to detecting the second gesture on the
touch-sensitive surface, the device displays (1416) an animation of the split keyboard
converting into the unsplit keyboard while moving the keyboard towards the bottom of the
display. For example, Figures 5SSS and 5TTT illustrate instants in an animated transition
from split keyboard 5198 to unsplit keyboard 5008.

[00493]         The operations in the information processing methods described above may be
implemented by running one or more functional modules in information processing apparatus
such as general purpose processors or application specific chips.            These modules,

described above with respect to Figures 1A and 3) are all included within the scope of
protection of the invention.
[00494]         The operations described above with reference to Figures 6A-6B, 7A-7B, 8A
8B, 9, 10A-OB, 11 A-1 ID, 12A-12B, 13A-13B, and 14 may be implemented by components
depicted in Figures lA-1B.     For example, detection operation 604, and replacing operation
610 may be implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190.
Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and
event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1.              A
respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location on
the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection
of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected,
event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event
or sub-event. Event handler 190 may utilize or call data updater 176 or object updater 177 to
update the application internal state 192.  In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses
a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application.       Similarly, it
would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be
implemented based on the components depicted in Figures 1A-lB.
