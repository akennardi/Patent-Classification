MENTORING TOOL
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]     The present invention generally relates to a mentoring tool to facilitate
mentoring between a mentor and mentee.
BACKGROUND
[0002]     The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be
taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the prior art forms part of
the common general knowledge.
[0003]     Mentoring is a mutually beneficial relationship which involves a more
experienced mentor helping a less experienced mentee to achieve their goals.
[0004]     In practice, it can be difficult for the mentee to locate and engage a suitable
mentor. The mentee in a particular area may be forced to choose from a limited number
of mentors. Similarly, distance between the mentor and mentee can inhibit the
conduction of mentoring sessions and increase costs.
[0005]     The preferred embodiment facilitates location and engagement of a suitable
mentor for regular mentoring sessions, irrespective of location.
[0006]     Invariably, many mentoring relationships are informal with no tangible
outcomes or benefits for the mentor or mentee.
[0007]     The preferred embodiment provides for a more formal mentoring structure
which benefits the mentee or mentor.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]     According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an online
mentoring method involving the steps of electronically:
       assigning a goal to be performed to a mentee at a promotional level;
       receiving, from a mentor, scoring of the mentee in achieving the goal; and

                                             2
        promoting the mentee to a higher promotional level using the scoring.
[0009]      Advantageously, the structured assigning and scoring is of benefit to the
mentee during mentoring, and promotion of the mentee in this structured environment
increases the perceived value of the mentee so that the mentee can gain improved
access to in demand mentors.
[00010]     The promoting may further involve using time the mentee has spent at the
promotional level and/or number of mentoring sessions between the mentor and the
mentee.
[00011]     The goal may include one or more tasks. The scoring may include a star
rating for each task. The scoring may involve applying a weighting by the mentor
according to difficulty. The scoring may involve automatically decreasing the star rating
when the goal is not achieved within a specified time
[00012]     The method may involve resetting a scoring of the mentee upon promotion.
The method may involve displaying the promotional level and an overall rating of the
mentee. The overall rating may be a moving average of the star ratings.
[00013]     The method may involve receiving, from the mentee, scoring of the mentor.
The method may involve promoting the mentor to a higher promotional level. The
scoring from the mentor and mentee may only be received subsequent to the goal being
completed.
[00014]     The method may involve displaying an overall rating of the mentor to assist
with promotion and perceived value of the mentor in the case of a favourable rating, or
to assist with informing the mentee in the case of an unfavourable rating. The overall
rating may be a moving average of star ratings from mentees the mentor has mentored.
[00015]     The method may involve the mentee accepting the goal from the mentor. The
method may involve the mentee search for the mentor from a number of possible
mentors including criteria such as experience, industry, function, personality, location, or
company.

                                               3
[00016]      The method may involve generate a company report including goal details
relating to the mentee or other mentees that are employees of the company. The
method may involve displaying one or more graphs showing percentage completion of
one or more goals over time.
[00017]      The method may involve holding mentoring sessions between the mentor
and mentee using an inbuilt video chat tool and/or messaging.
[00018]      According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
online mentoring tool configured to:
         assign a goal to be performed to a mentee at a promotional level;
         receive, from a mentor, scoring of the mentee in achieving the goal; and
         promote the mentee to a higher promotional level using the scoring.
[00019]      The tool may include a website or an App. The tool may be further configured
to establish a relationship between the mentor and mentee.
[00020]      The mentoring tool may include a searching tool to enable the mentee to
search for the mentor from a number of possible mentors, irrespective of location. The
method may involve recommending the mentors to the mentees based upon
personality.
[00021]      The mentoring tool may include an inbuilt video chat tool to advantageously
facilitate communication during sessions between the mentor and mentee, without the
need to travel to a common location.
[00022]      The mentoring tool may include a company reporting tool for generating
reports including goal details relating to the mentee or other mentees that are
employees of the company.
[00023]      The mentoring tool may include a competition tool for enabling mentors to
compete with each other.
[00024]      According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an
online mentoring system including the tool, a computer of the mentee, a computer of
the mentor and an administration server for administering the tool.

                                               4
[00025]    Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination
with any one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the
invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[00034]    According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an
online mentoring system 100 including a mentoring tool 102, including a website or an
App (i.e. application software). An administration server 104 includes the mentoring tool
102 and administers the online system 100.

                                               5
[00035]      The system 100 further includes a mentee's computer 106 and a mentor's
computer 108, through which a mentee 110 and mentor 112 interact with the tool 102,
and communicate with each other over a network 114 including the Internet.
[00036]      The system 100 further includes a database 116 administered by the
administration server 104, and storing information relating to the mentee 110 and
mentor 112.
[00037]      The online mentoring tool 102 is configured to assign a goal to be performed
to the mentee 110 at a hierarchical promotional level. The online mentoring tool 102
also receives, from the mentor 112, scoring of the mentee 110 in achieving the goal.
Finally, the online mentoring tool 102 promotes the mentee to a higher promotional level
using the scoring, time the mentee has spent at the level and number of mentoring
sessions between the mentor 112 and the mentee 110.
[00038]      Advantageously, the structured assigning and scoring provided by the tool
102 is of benefit to the mentee 110 during mentoring, and promotion of the mentee 110
in this structured environment increases the perceived value of the mentee 110 so that
the mentee 110 can gain improved access to higher level mentors 112.
[00039]      The mentoring tool 102 includes a searching tool 118 to enable the mentee
110 to search for the mentor 112 from a number of possible mentors, irrespective of
location of either. The mentoring tool 102 includes an inbuilt video chat tool 120 to
advantageously facilitate communication during mentoring sessions between the
mentor 112 and mentee 110, without the need to travel to a common location. The
inbuilt chat tool 120 also includes a messaging tool to enable the mentor 112 and
mentee 110 to message each other.
[00040]      Further, the mentoring tool 102 includes a company reporting tool 122 for
generating reports including goal details relating to the mentee 110, or other mentees
that are employees of a company. The mentoring tool 102 also includes a competition
tool 124 for enabling subscribed mentees 110 or mentors 112 to compete with each
other.
[00041]      Figure 2 shown an online mentoring method 200 performed using the tool
102. Initially, the mentor 112 and mentee 110 have subscribed to the tool 102 and

                                                6
opened accounts in database 116. The mentee 110 is assigned a promotional level,
which is initially the lowest level if there has been no prior mentoring, or the previous
level if the mentee 110 is resuming mentoring after a hiatus.
[00042]      At step 202, the mentee 110 using computer 106 and searching tool 118,
searches the database 116 for the mentor 112 from a number of possible mentors 112
as shown in Figure 3. The search criteria 300 includes any one or more of: position,
experience, industry, function, personality, location, and company. The mentoring tool
102 enables mentors 112 to broadcast their skills and experience to everyone
subscribed to the mentoring tool 102 on the platform, without having to pay extra for this
feature as long as they have the right subscription level.
[00043]      The mentee 110 can select a mentor 112 to view a displayed overall star
rating 400 and promotional level 402 of the mentor 112 as shown in Figure 4, which
assists with marketing and perceived value of the mentor 112 in the case of a
favourable rating 400, and which assists with informing the mentee 110 to steer clear in
the case of an unfavourable rating 400. The overall rating 400 is a moving average of
star ratings from mentees 110 the mentor 112 has previously mentored.
[00044]      The mentee 110 engages the mentor 112 by way of an invitation 300 (Fig. 3)
which is accepted to form the mentoring relationship and the details are logged in the
database 116. The mentee 110 can send the invitation 300 to any mentor 112 on the
platform, without restriction and irrespective of business, company, location or any other
restricting factors. As can best be seen in Figure 5, the mentor 112 can view a
displayed promotional level 500 and an overall star rating 502 of the mentee 110 before
deciding whether to enter into the mentoring relationship. The overall rating 502 is
typically a moving average of star ratings associated with mentee goals.
[00045]      The mentors 112 can charge for their time in mentoring mentees 110.
Depending on the level of the mentee 110 who wants to engage with a mentor 112, the
cost to do so varies. The higher the level of the mentee 110, the lower the cost to
engage a higher level mentor 112. Not all mentors 112 will charge for their time, but
those who do could benefit from higher scores from mentees 110, so that the mentees
110 themselves are rated higher and can charge a higher amount as mentors 112. The
system 100 is fully flexible and the amount charged by the mentor 112 is set by them in
order to create a self-governing ecosystem.

                                             7
[00046]    At step 204, the tool 102 assigns a goal 600 to be performed by the mentee
110 to that mentee 110 as shown in Figure 6. The goal 600 includes one or more tasks
602 often associated with a completion deadline 604. The goal 600 can be developed
by the mentor 112 and then accepted by the mentee 110, or visa versa.
[00047]    The inbuilt chat tool 120 of the mentoring tool 102 is used to hold mentoring
sessions between the mentor 112 and mentee 110 to discuss the progress of the goal
600 and associated tasks 602. The mentor 112 and mentee 110 can also message
each other without the need to leave the mentoring tool 102 and remain on the same
platform. Details of the sessions are logged in the database 116.
[00048]    At step 206, the tool 102 receives, from the mentor 112, scoring of the
mentee 110 in achieving the goal 600. The scoring includes a star rating for each task
602. The scoring involves applying weighting by the mentor 112 according to difficulty
(e.g. easy = score x 0.6, moderate = score x 0.8, challenging = score by 1, hard = score
by 1.2).
[00049]    Furthermore, the scoring may involve automatically decreasing the star rating
when the goal 600 is not achieved within a specified time. A grace period may be
applied, but then the score is diminished linearly over time. Upon scoring, the goal 600
and tasks 602 cannot be changed.
[00050]    At step 208, the tool 102 queries whether to promote the mentee 110 to a
higher promotional level. The promotion is automatically determined using stored
information in the database 116 including the scoring at step 208, time the mentee has
spent at the current promotional level 500 and number of mentoring sessions between
the mentor 112 and the mentee 110.
[00051]     For example, FAST TRACK promotion involves:
       - Mentee 110 scoring in top 10% in the current promotion level 500 at end of
month
       - Mentee 110 exceeding minimum time spent at the current promotional level 500
(e.g. minimum 2 months)
       - Mentee 110 has achieved minimum number of mentoring sessions with mentor
112 that month (e.g. 2)

                                              8
[00052]      For example, SLOW TRACK promotion involves:
         - Mentee 110 scoring in top 30% in the current promotion level 500 at end of 3
months
         - Mentee 110 exceeding minimum time spent at the current promotional level
500(e.g. minimum 3 months) or subscribed to the system 100
         - Mentee 110 has achieved minimum number of mentoring sessions with mentor
112 in 3 months (e.g. 4)
[00053]      If not promoted at step 208, a new goal 600 is assigned to the mentee 110 at
step 204.
[00054]      If promoted at step 208, the database 116 is updated to reflect the new
promotional level 500 of the mentee 110, and current scoring rating 502 of the mentee
110 is reset.
[00055]      At query step 210, the tool 102 receives confirmation from the mentee 110 as
to whether a change of mentor 112 is required.
[00056]      If no change of mentor 112 is required at step 210, a new goal 600 is
assigned to the mentee 110 at step 204.
[00057]      If a change of mentor 112 is required in view of the promotion at step 210,
the method 200 proceeds to step 212.
[00058]      At step 212, the tool 102 receives scoring of the mentor 112 from the mentee
110. The scoring typically includes a star rating 400. In a similar promotional manner to
the mentee 110, the tool 102 can promote the mentor 112 to a higher promotional level
402 using an aggregate rating 400 of mentee scoring. The mentor rating is displayed on
their profile.
[00059]      A company representative can generate a company report including goal
details relating to the mentee 110 or any other mentees that are employees of the
company. All information will be available according to strict confidentiality principles
built into the database 116. Advantageously, the mentoring tool provides companies
with the means for mentoring specific people 110 for a specific purpose. For example,
this mentoring platform or tool 102 can be used to make informed recruitment decisions.

                                               9
By mentoring several (e.g. 3 - 5) possible candidates 110 for a given role that is vacant
within the company, the company has first-hand experience in working with these
people 110 on a number of mentoring goals already. Both the company and mentee
110 will get a clear idea in advance of whether or not the mentee 110 would be suited to
work for the mentor 112, or the company in a given role.
[00060]     Furthermore, the mentor 112 can use the tool 102 to generate a graphical
statistics report 700 for performance of the mentee 110 as shown in Figure 7. The
report 700 shows statistics 702 for the mentee 110, a first graph 704 showing
percentage completion of the goal 600 over time, and a second graph 706 showing
percentage completion of goals for all mentees 110 associated with the mentor 112
over time.
[00061]     The competition tool 124 can award prizes to subscribed mentees 110 or
mentors 112 based upon the scoring when compared with scoring of other subscribed
mentees 110 or mentors 112.
[00062]     A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many embodiments and
variations can be made without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
[00063]     For example, at step 204, the mentee 110 may be assigned with multiple
goals at once.
In one embodiment, a fixed percentage of all charges made by all the mentors 112 will
be donated to one or more good causes (e.g. charities). The donations are deducted
automatically by the mentoring tool 102 before paying the mentors 112 for their time
and efforts based on a preset agreement of percentages.
[00064]      In one embodiment, the mentoring tool 102 recommends mentors 112 to
mentees 110, based upon personality matches. Mentors 112 and mentees 110
complete a personality test upon registration to the system 100, which automatically
analyses the tests and provides recommendations on the best possible matches. The
system 100 can also combine these personality matches with other types of matches,
such as industry, position, etc..
