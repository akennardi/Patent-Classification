            TREATMENT OF STROKE USING ISOLATED PLACENTAL CELLS
[0001] The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application
number 2015268614, which itself is a divisional of Australian patent application 2009283217,
the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by way of this reference.
1.       FIELD
[0002] Provided herein are methods of using isolated placental cells, e.g., placental
multipotent cells, populations of such isolated placental cells, and/or compositions comprising
the cells in the treatment of an individual having hypoxic injury or a disruption in the flow of
blood in or around the brain, e.g., a symptom of or a defect, e.g., a neurological deficit
attributable to a disruption in the flow of blood in or around the brain.
2.       BACKGROUND
[0003] A stroke, also known as a "brain attack," cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or acute
ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome, is a loss of brain function(s), usually rapidly developing,
that is due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain or brainstem. The
disturbance can be ischemia (lack of blood) caused by, e.g., thrombosis or embolism, or can be
due to a hemorrhage. According to the World Health Organization, stroke is a "neurological
deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within
24 hours." Persistence of symptoms beyond 24 hours separates stroke from Transient Ischemic
Attack (TIA), in which symptoms persist for less than 24 hours.
[0004] Currently, treatment of ischemic stroke typically includes antiplatelet medication such
as aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, or anticoagulant medication, such as warfarin, to reduce
or relieve blockage causing the ischemia. In addition, blood sugar levels are brought to as
normal as possible, and the stroke patient is provided adequate oxygen and intravenous fluids.
Treatment of hemorrhagic stroke generally comprises one or more of administration of a blood
pressure-lowering drug, administration of a pain medication other than a nonsteroidal anti
inflammatory drug (NSAID), administration of a calcium channel blocker (e.g., Nimodipine),
and surgery, if indicated, to repair the vessel ruptures responsible for hemorrhage.
[0005] However, such treatments only attempt to mitigate ongoing neurological damage, and
do nothing to restore lost function. Numerous non-cellular neuroprotective agents have been
                                                  1

     WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
tested for efficacy in treatment of stroke, and have failed, including N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor antagonists, nalmefene, lubeluzole, clomethiazole, calcium channel blockers
(including a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid antagonists, serotonin
agonists (e.g., repinotan), and transmembrane potassium channel modulators), tirilazad, anti
ICAM-1 antibody, human antileukocytic antibody (Hu23F2G), antiplatelet antibody (e.g.,
abciximab), citicoline (an exogenous form of cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine), and basic
fibroblast growth factor.
[0006] There are no effective treatments for stroke. Thus, a need exists for therapies that not
only mitigate neurological damage arising from either condition, but improve neural function
and prognosis.
3.      SUMMARY
[0007] Provided herein, in one aspect, are methods for the use of isolated placental cells,
populations of isolated placental cells, populations of cells comprising isolated placental stem
cells and compositions comprising the isolated placental cells in the treatment of an
individual having a disruption of the flow of blood in or around the individual's central
nervous system (CNS), e.g. brain or spinal cord. The methods comprise, e.g., treatment of a
symptom or neurological deficit in an individual attributable to a disruption of the flow of
blood in or around the individual's brain, such as hypoxic injury, anoxic injury, stroke (e.g.,
ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke), non-stroke hemorrhage or TIA. As contemplated herein,
treatment of a symptom or neurological deficit in an individual attributable to a disruption of
the flow of blood in or around the individual's brain includes treatment of symptoms or
neurological deficits attributable to reperfusion injury that may accompany such a disruption
of flow of blood in or around the individual's brain. Successful treatment of ischemic stroke,
e.g., anoxic injury or hypoxic injury, has been demonstrated herein in an accepted animal
stroke model. See Example 1 and Example 2.
[00081 In one aspect, provided herein is a method of treating an individual who has a
disruption of the flow of blood in or around the individual's brain, e.g., who has a symptom
or neurological deficit attributable to a disruption of the flow of blood in or around the
individual's brain or central nervous system (CNS), comprising administering to said
individual a therapeutically effective amount of isolated tissue culture plastic-adherent human
placental cells, wherein said isolated placental cells have characteristics of multipotent cells
or stem cells. In certain embodiments, the disruption of flow of blood results in anoxic injury
or hypoxic injury to the individual's brain or CNS.

        3.1     DEFINITIONS
 10033] As used herein, the term "about," when referring to a stated numeric value, indicates a
value within plus or minus 20% of the stated numeric value.
 [0034] As used herein, the term "anoxic injury" refers to an injury, e.g., a neurological injury
or symptom, caused by a total lack of oxygen to an area of the brain or CNS.
 [0035] As used herein, the term "hypoxic injury" refers to an injury, e.g., a neurological
injury or symptom, caused by a partial lack of oxygen to an area of the brain or CNS.
 [0036] As used herein, the term "SH2" refers to an antibody that binds an epitope on the
cellular marker CD 105. Thus, cells that are referred to as SH2* are CD 105*.
 [0037] As used herein, the terms "SH3" and SH4" refer to antibodies that bind epitopes
present on the cellular marker CD73. Thus, cells that are referred to as SH3* and/or SH4* are
CD73*.
 [0038] A placenta has the genotype of the fetus that develops within it, but is also in close
physical contact with maternal tissues during gestation. As such, as used herein, the term
"fetal genotype" means the genotype of the fetus, e.g., the genotype of the fetus associated
with the placenta from which particular isolated placental cells, as described herein, are
                                                11

     WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
obtained, as opposed to the genotype of the mother that carried the fetus. As used herein, the
term "maternal genotype" means the genotype of the mother that carried the fetus, e.g., the
fetus associated with the placenta from which particular isolated placental cells, as described
herein, are obtained.
10039] As used herein, the term "isolated cell," e.g., "isolated stem cell," means a cell that is
substantially separated from other, different cells of the tissue, e.g., placenta, from which the
stem cell is derived. A cell is "isolated" if at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or at
least 99% of the cells, e.g., non-stem cells, with which the stem cell is naturally associated, or
stem cells displaying a different marker profile, are removed from the stem cell, e.g., during
collection and/or culture of the stem cell.
[00401 As used herein, "multipotent," when referring to a cell, means that the cell has the
ability to differentiate into some, but not necessarily all, types of cells of the body, or into
cells having characteristics of some, but not all, types of cells of the body. In certain
embodiments, for example, an isolated placental cell that has the capacity to differentiate into
a cell having characteristics of neurogenic, chondrogenic and/or osteogenic cells is a
multipotent cell.
 [0041] As used herein, the term "population of isolated cells" means a population of cells
that is substantially separated from other cells of a tissue, e.g., placenta, from which the
population of cells is derived.
 [00421 As used herein, the term "placental stem cell" refers to a stem cell or progenitor cell
that is derived from a mammalian placenta, regardless of morphology, cell surface markers,
or the number of passages after a primary culture. The term "placental stem cell" as used
herein does not, however, refer to, and a placental stem cell is not, however, a trophoblast,
angioblast, a hemangioblast, an embryonic germ cell, an embryonic stem cell, a cell obtained
from an inner cell mass of a blastocyst, or a cell obtained from a gonadal ridge of a late
embryo, e.g., an embryonic germ cell. A cell is considered a "stem cell" if the cell displays
attributes of a stem cell, e.g., a marker or gene expression profile associated with one or more
types of stem cells; the ability to replicate at least 10-40 times in culture, and the ability to
differentiate into cells displaying characteristics of differentiated cells of one or more of the
three germ layers. The terms "placental stem cell" and "placenta-derived stem cell" may be
used interchangeably. Unless otherwise noted herein, the term "placental" includes the
 umbilical cord. The isolated placental cells disclosed herein, in certain embodiments,
 differentiate in vitro under differentiating conditions, differentiate in vivo, or both.
                                                  12

     WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
[0043] As used herein, a placental cell is "positive" for a particular marker when that marker
is detectable above background. For example, a placental cell is positive for, e.g., CD73
because CD73 is detectable on placental cells in an amount detectably greater than
background (in comparison to, e.g., an isotype control). A cell is also positive for a marker
when that marker can be used to distinguish the cell from at least one other cell type, or can
be used to select or isolate the cell when present or expressed by the cell. In the context of,
e.g., antibody-mediated detection, "positive," as an indication a particular cell surface marker
is present, means that the marker is detectable using an antibody, e.g., a fluorescently-labeled
antibody, specific for that marker; "positive" also refers to a cell exhibiting the marker in an
amount that produces a signal, e.g., in a cytometer, that is detectably above background. For
example, a cell is "CD200*" where the cell is detectably labeled with an antibody specific to
CD200, and the signal from the antibody is detectably higher than that of a control (e.g.,
background or an isotype control). Conversely, "negative" in the same context means that
the cell surface marker is not detectable using an antibody specific for that marker compared
a control (e.g., background or an isotype control). For example, a cell is "CD34" where the
cell is not reproducibly detectably labeled with an antibody specific to CD34 to a greater
degree than a control (e.g., background or an isotype control). Markers not detected, or not
detectable, using antibodies are determined to be positive or negative in a similar manner,
using an appropriate control. For example, a cell or population of cells can be determined to
be OCT-4* if the amount of OCT-4 RNA detected in RNA from the cell or population of cells
is detectably greater than background as determined, e.g., by a method of detecting RNA
such as RT-PCR, slot blots, etc. Unless otherwise noted herein, cluster of differentiation
("CD") markers are detected using antibodies. In certain embodiments, OCT-4 is determined
to be present, and a cell is "OCT-4*" if OCT-4 is detectable using RT-PCR.
[0044] As used herein, "treat" encompasses the cure of, remediation of, improvement of,
lessening of the severity of, or reduction in the time course of, a disease, disorder or
condition, or any parameter or symptom thereof.

5.      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
        5.1      TREATMENT OF DISRUPTIONS OF BLOOD FLOW IN AND AROUND
                 THE BRAIN
[00541 Provided herein are methods for the treatment of an individual having a disruption of
the flow of blood in or around the individual's brain, e.g., treatment of one or more symptoms
or neurological deficit attributable to the disruption of blood flow in or around the
individual's brain, comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective
amount of isolated tissue culture plastic-adherent human placental cells, wherein said isolated
placental cells have characteristics of multipotent cells or stem cells, and wherein said
isolated placental cells are not bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cells, or mesenchymal cells obtained from umbilical cord blood, placental
blood, or peripheral blood. In certain embodiments, the injury is hypoxic injury or anoxic
injury. In certain embodiments provided herein, said therapeutically effective amount is an
amount that results in the elimination of, a detectable improvement in, lessening of the
severity of, or slowing of the progression of one or more symptoms of, or neurological deficit
attributable to, the disruption of blood flow in or around the individual's brain exhibited by
said individual.
[0055] In a specific embodiment, the one or more symptoms or neurological deficit, e.g.,
symptom of stroke, hypoxic injury or anoxic injury, is attributable at least in part, or wholly,
to reperfusion injury following disruption of the flow of blood. As used herein, "reperfusion
injury" refers to tissue damage caused when interrupted blood supply returns to tissue after a
period of ischemia. The absence of blood-borne oxygen and nutrition during ischemia
creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and
oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress rather than the restoration of
normal function.
[0056] As used herein, the term "disruption of the flow of blood in or around the brain" in the
context of treatment of such a disruption, encompasses treatment of one or more symptoms
exhibited by an individual having the disruption and treatment of neurological deficits in the
individual that are attributable to the disruption, e.g., one or more symptoms of stroke,
hypoxic injury or anoxic injury. In certain embodiments, the one or more symptoms are one
or more symptoms attributable primarily, or wholly, to ischemia itself. In certain other
embodiments, the one or more symptoms are one or more symptoms attributable primarily, or
wholly, to reperfusion injury, e.g., associated with ischemia.

     WO 2010/021715                                                             PCT/US2009/004741
          5.2    STROKE
 [0057] The disruption of blood flow in or around the brain or CNS treatable by the methods
provided herein can be any disruption of the flow of blood that causes one or more detectable
 symptoms or neurological deficits in the affected individual (see below). In certain
embodiments, the disruption of blood flow is a stroke, e.g., an ischemic stroke or a
hemorrhagic stroke, e.g., an intracranial cerebral hemorrhage. In certain other embodiments,
the disruption of blood flow is a hemorrhage outside the brain, e.g., a dural hematoma, a
subdural hematoma or subarachnoid hematoma. In certain other embodiments, the disruption
of flow of blood is transient, e.g., a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). In certain other
embodiments, the disruption of blood flow is a vasospasm. In a specific embodiment, the
disruption of blood flow in the brain occurs in the cerebrum. In more specific embodiments,
the disruption occurs in the parietal lobe, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, or occipital lobe of the
cerebrum. In another specific embodiment, the disruption occurs in the cerebellum. In
another specific embodiment, the disruption occurs in the brainstem or spinal column. In
certain embodiments, the disruption causes hypoxic injury or anoxic injury
 [0058] In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating an individual suffering
from hypoxic injury or anoxic injury, e.g., stroke (e.g., a stroke victim) comprising
administering to said individual a therapeutically effective amount of isolated, tissue culture
plastic-adherent placental cells, as described herein, e.g., in Section 5.4.2, below. In a
specific embodiment, said therapeutically effective amount is an amount that results in the
elimination of, a detectable improvement in, lessening of the severity of, or slowing of the
progression of one or more symptoms of stroke exhibited by said individual. The isolated
placental cells, e.g., a plurality or isolated population of isolated placental cells, can be any of
the isolated placental cells described elsewhere herein, e.g., in Section 5.4.2, below.
[0059] Stroke treatable according to the methods provided herein can be stroke attributable to
any cause. In a specific embodiment, the stroke is ischemic stroke. In more specific
embodiments, the ischemic stroke is thrombotic stroke or embolic stroke. In another specific
embodiment, the stroke is due to systemic hypoperfusion, i.e., a reduction of blood flow to all
parts of the body; or is due to venous thrombosis. In other specific embodiments, the
ischemic stroke is caused by fibrillation of the heart, e.g., atrial fibrillation; paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation; rheumatic disease; mitral or aortic valve disease; artificial heart valves; cardiac
thrombus of the atrium or vertricle; sick sinus syndrome; sustained atrial flutter; myocardial
infarction; chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction of less than 28
percent; symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of less than 30 percent;

     WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
cardiomyopathy; endocarditis, e.g., Libman-Sacks endocarditis, Marantic endocarditis or
infective endocarditis; papillary fibroelastoma; left atrial myxoma; coronary artery bypass
graft surgery; calcification of the annulus of the mitral valve; patent foramen ovale; atrial
septal aneurysm, left ventricular aneurysm without thrombus, isolated left atrial "smoke" on
echocardiography without mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation; and/or complex atheroma in
the ascending aorta or proximal arch.
[00601 In another specific embodiment, the stroke is hemorrhagic stroke. In more specific
embodiments, the hemorrhagic stroke is caused by intra-axial hemorrhage (leakage of blood
inside the brain). In another more specific embodiment, said hemorrhagic stroke is caused by
extra-axial hemorrhage (blood inside the skull but outside the brain). In more specific
embodiments, the stroke is caused by intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular
hemorrhage (blood in the ventricular system), epidural hematoma (bleeding between the dura
mater and the skull), subdural hematoma (bleeding in the subdural space), or subarachnoid
hemorrhage (between the arachnoid mater and pia mater). Most hemorrhagic stroke
syndromes have specific symptoms (e.g. headache, previous head injury). In other more
specific embodiments, the hemorrhagic stroke is caused by or associated with hypertension,
trauma, bleeding disorders, amyloid angiopathy, illicit drug use (e.g. amphetamines or

100611 In another embodiment, provided herein is a method of treatment of an individual
having a disruption of the flow of blood in or around the individual's brain or CNS, e.g.,
treatment of one or more symptoms or neurological deficit attributable to the disruption of
blood flow in or around the individual's brain or CNS comprising administering to said
individual a therapeutically effective amount of isolated placental cells, e.g., placental stem
cells or placental multipotent cells, wherein said disruption of the flow of blood arises from
an immediate cause other than stroke, e.g., a closed-head injury or non-impact-related
hematoma. In a specific embodiment, said therapeutically effective amount is an amount that
results in the elimination of, a detectable improvement in, lessening of the severity of, or
slowing of the progression of one or more symptoms of the disruption exhibited by said
individual. As with stroke, the isolated placental cells can be any of the placental cells, e.g.,
placental stem cells or placental multipotent cells, described elsewhere herein, e.g., in Section
5.4.2, below.
 [00621 As noted above, in certain embodiments, the method of treatment provided herein
results in the elimination of, a detectable improvement in, a lessening of the severity of, or a
slowing of the progression of one or more symptoms of a disruption of blood flow in or

around the brain or CNS or a neurological deficit attributable to a disruption of blood flow in
or around the brain or CNS, e.g., stroke, hematoma, e.g., causing hypoxic injury or anoxic
injury. In specific embodiments, said symptoms or neurological deficits comprise hemiplegia
(paralysis of one side of the body); hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body); muscle
weakness of the face; numbness; reduction in sensation; altered smell, taste, hearing, or
vision; loss of smell, taste, hearing, or vision; drooping of eyelid (ptosis); weakness of ocular
muscles; decreased gag reflexes; decreased ability to swallow; decreased pupil reactivity to
light; decreased sensation of the face; decreased balance; nystagmus; altered breathing rate;
altered heart rate; weakness in sternocleidomastoid muscle with decreased ability or inability
to turn the head to one side; weakness in the tongue; aphasia (inability to speak or understand
language); apraxia (altered voluntary movements); a visual field defect; a memory deficit;
hemineglect or hemispatial neglect (deficit in attention to the space on the side of the visual
field opposite the lesion); disorganized thinking; confusion; development of hypersexual
gestures; anosognosia (persistent denial of the existence of a deficit); difficulty walking;
altered movement coordination; vertigo; disequilibrium; loss of consciousness; headache;
and/or vomiting.
[0063] The severity of disruption of the flow of blood in or around the brain or CNS, e.g.,
severity of stroke, or of stroke symptoms and/or neurological deficits attributable to stroke,
can be assessed using one or more widely-accepted neurological function scales.
[00641 For example, in one embodiment, provided herein a method of treatment of an
individual who has a disruption of the flow of blood in or around the individual's brain or
CNS, e.g., an individual who has a symptom or neurological deficit attributable to a
disruption of the flow of blood in or around the individual's brain, e.g., hypoxic injury or
anoxic injury, comprising administering to said individual a therapeutically effective amount
of isolated human adherent placental cells, wherein said therapeutically effective amount is
an amount of placental cells sufficient to result in a detectable, or detectable and sustained,
improvement in the individual's neurological function as assessed by one or more of the
Modified Rankin Scale, NIH Stroke Scale, Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS), Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS), Hempispheric Stroke Scale, Hunt & Hess Scale, Mathew Stroke Scale,
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Orgogozo Stroke Scale, Oxfordshire Community
Stroke Project Classification (Bamford), Scandinavian Stroke Scale, Japan Coma Scale
(JCS), Barthel Index and/or Japan Stroke Scale (JSS). In specific embodiments, the
improvement is detectable within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 days, or within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11
or 12 weeks after initial assessment, and after one or more administrations of isolated

         5.3      ADMINISTRATION OF ISOLATED PLACENTAL CELLS
[0065] The isolated placental cells used in the methods of treatment provided herein can be
administered to an individual exhibiting one or more symptoms or neurological deficits
caused by or attributable to a disruption of blood flow in or around the brain or CNS of the
individual by any medically-acceptable method or route. In one embodiment, the
therapeutically effective amount of isolated placental cells is administered to the individual
intracranially, e.g., to an ischemic or hemorrhagic site in the affected brain or CNS of the
individual. For intracranial administration, the situs of stroke (e.g., the affected area) may be
visualized, e.g., by CT scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (e.g., T1-, T2-,
diffusion- and/or perfusion-weighted MR), cobalt-55 Positron Emission tomography, or
similar technology. In another embodiment, said isolated placental cells are administered to
the individual intravenously or intra-arterially. In other embodiments, the therapeutically
effective amount of isolated placental cells is administered to the individual intramuscularly,
intraperitoneally, intradermally, subcutaneously, intraocularly or parenterally. The isolated
placental cells can be administered by bolus injection, or by intravenous infusion. In a
specific embodiment, said intravenous infusion is intravenous infusion over about 1 to about
8 hours. In certain embodiments, the isolated placental cells are administered to the
individual by a combination of routes, e.g., intracranially and by intravenous infusion.
[0066] The therapeutically effective amount of isolated placental cells can vary according to
the age and/or size of the individual, and the approximate volume of the ischemic area. The
approximate volume and location of the ischemic area can be estimated, e.g., by serial
magnetic resonance imaging images or computed tomography (CT) scanning.
[0067] The number of isolated placental cells administered, e.g., in a single dose, can be
about, or at least, or more than, e.g., 1 x 10', 5 x 10', 1 x 106, 5 x 106, 1 x 107, 5 x 107, 1 x
108, 5 x 108, 1 x 109, 5 x 109, 1 x 101", 5 x 1010, 1 x 10"1 or 5 x 1011 isolated placental cells
per administration. In specific embodiments, an individual suffering from a disruption of
blood flow in or around the brain or CNS, e.g., an individual suffering from a stroke, anoxic
injury or hypoxic injury, can be administered between about 5 x 107 to about 3 x 109 isolated
                                                   20

placental cells intravenously. In more specific embodiments, an individual suffering from a
disruption of blood flow in or around the brain or CNS, e.g., an individual suffering from a
stroke, hypoxic injury or anoxic injury, can be administered about 9 x 107 isolated placental
cells, about 3.6 x 108 isolated placental cells, about 9 x 108 isolated placental cells, or about
1.8 x 109 isolated placental cells intravenously. In another specific embodiment, the
individual is administered one dose of about 2 x 108 isolated placental cells intravenously. In
another specific embodiment, the individual is administered one dose of about 8 x 108
isolated placental cells intravenously. In another specific embodiment, the individual is
administered two doses, each comprising about 2 x 108 isolated placental cells, intravenously.
In another specific embodiment, the individual is administered two doses, each comprising
about 8 x 108 isolated placental cells, intravenously. In other more specific embodiments, an
individual suffering from a disruption of blood flow in or around the brain or CNS, e.g., an
individual suffering from a stroke, hypoxic injury or anoxic injury, can be administered
between about 5 x 107 and 1 x 108 isolated placental cells intracranially. In a more specific
embodiment, said individual is administered about 9 x 107 isolated placental cells
intracranially.
[00681 An individual suffering from a disruption of the flow of blood in or around the brain
or CNS, a symptom of the disruption, and/or a neurological deficit attributable to the
disruption, can be administered isolated placental cells once, or more than once, e.g., two or
more times in the course of treatment. The isolated placental cells can be administered in a
suitable volume for intracranial administration, e.g., in about 100 pL, 200 RL, 300 LL, 400
 tL, 500 pL, 600 pL, 700 ptL, 800 ptL, 900 pL, 1000 pL, 1.5 mL, 2 mL, 2.5 mL, 3 mL, 3.5

and about 9 x 106 isolated placental cells per kilogram of said individual; or between about 9
x 106 and about 1 x 107 isolated placental cells per kilogram of said individual are
administered to said individual. In another specific embodiment, said administering
comprises administering between about 1 x 107 and about 2 x 107 isolated placental cells per
kilogram of said individual to said individual. In another specific embodiment, said
administering comprises administering between about 1.3 x 107 and about 1.5 x 107 isolated
placental cells per kilogram of said individual to said individual. In another specific
embodiment, said administering comprises administering up to about 3 x 107 isolated
placental cells per kilogram of said individual to said individual. In another specific
embodiment, said administering comprises administering about 15 x 107 isolated placental
cells in about 20 milliliters of solution to said individual. In a preferred embodiment,
administration of isolated placental cells comprises administration of no more than 7.5 x 106
isolated placental cells per kg of a recipient, in no more than about 1 liter of solution. In a
specific embodiment, said administering comprises administering between about 5 x 106 and
about 2 x 107 isolated placental cells to said individual, e.g., intracranially. In a specific
embodiment, said administering comprises administering between about 5 x 106 and about 3

x 109 placental multipotent cells to said individual, wherein said cells are contained in a
solution comprising 10% dextran, 5% human serum albumin, and optionally an
immunosuppressant, e.g., cyclosporine A. In another specific embodiment, said
administering comprises administering about 15 x 107 to about 25 x 107 isolated placental
cells in about 20 milliliters of solution to said individual. In any of the above embodiments,
the isolated placental cells can be administered intravenously or intraarterially, e.g., as a
                                                  22

bolus or drip. In yet another specific embodiment, said administering comprises
administering about 200 million cells in about 20 milliliters of solution to said individual.
 [00701 The isolated placental cells can be infused for any medically-acceptable period of
time. In various embodiments, for example, the number of isolated placental cells described
above can be administered, e.g., infused, e.g., intravenously or intraarterially, over the course
of about, or no more than, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or 55 minutes, or over the course of
about, or no more than, 1 hour, or 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 or 6 hours.
 [0071] Isolated placental cells can be administered to an individual having a disruption in the
flow of blood in or around the brain or CNS at any time after development of one or more
symptoms of or neurological deficits, e.g., hypoxic injury or anoxic injury, attributable to, the
individual's disruption in the individual. In various embodiment, isolated placental cells are
administered within the first 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4,3 or
2 days of development of the first symptom or neurological deficit exhibited by the
individual; preferably isolated placental cells are administered within the first 48, 47, 46, 45,
44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 21, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20,

detectable symptom or neurological deficit in the individual, or within the first hour of
development of the first detectable symptom or neurological deficit in the individual.
 [0072] In other embodiments, the isolated placental cells are administered prophylactically,
e.g., before one or more symptoms of said disruption of flow of blood in or around the brain
or CNS, symptom of stroke, hypoxic injury or anoxic injury manifests, or is detectable.
[0073] Treatment of an individual having a disruption of the flow of blood in or around the
brain or CNS of an individual, comprising administration of isolated placental cells to the
individual, can further comprise administration to the individual of one or more second
therapeutic agents. Such second therapeutic agents can be administered before administration
of isolated placental cells, during administration of the isolated placental cells, or after
administration of the isolated placental cells. Said second therapeutic agents can be
administered fewer, more, or an equal number of times as the isolated placental cells are
administered.
[0074] A second therapeutic agent can be any agent that has therapeutic benefit to an
individual having a disruption of blood flow in or around the brain or CNS. In one
embodiment, the therapeutic agent is an agent, e.g., a drug, that is used to treat stroke,
hypoxic injury or anoxic injury. In a specific embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is a
neuroprotective agent. In a specific embodiment, the neuroprotective agent is disufenton

[0075] In another embodiment, in which the individual suffers from hemorrhagic stroke, the
second therapeutic agent is a therapeutic agent that lowers blood pressure of said individual.
In another embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is a thrombolytic agent. In a specific
embodiment, the thrombolytic agent is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The tPA can be
from a natural source or recombinant. In a more specific embodiment, the tPA is
administered within the first three hours after development of one or more symptoms or
neurological deficits in the individual. In another more specific embodiment, the tPA is
administered after the first three hours after development of one or more symptoms of stroke
in a stroke victim. In certain embodiments, the use of a thrombolytic agent is
contraindicated, e.g., when the stroke victim has a head injury, or when the stroke is caused
by a head injury. In another specific embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is an
anticoagulant or an antiplatelet agent. In embodiments in which the disruption of flow of
blood in or around the brain or CNS is a hemorrhage, the second therapeutic agent can be an
antihypertensive drug, e.g., a beta blocker or diuretic drug, a combination of a diuretic drug
and a potassium-sparing diuretic drug, a combination of a beta blocker and a diuretic drug, a
combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a diuretic, an
angiotensin-II antagonist and a diuretic drug, and/or a calcium channel blocker and an ACE
inhibitor. In another embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is administered in order to
reduce intracranial pressure. In a more specific embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is
a diuretic.
[0076] In embodiments in which the administered isolated placental cells are not autologous
to the individual having a disruption of flow of blood in or around the brain or CNS, the
second therapeutic agent can be an immunosuppressive agent. Immunosuppressive agents
are well-known in the art and include, e.g., anti-T cell receptor antibodies (monoclonal or
polyclonal, or antibody fragments or derivatives thereof, e.g., Muromonab-CD3), anti-IL-2
receptor antibodies (e.g., Basiliximab (SIMULECT@) or daclizumab (ZENAPAX)@),
azathioprine, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus,

calcineurin inhibitors, and the like. In a specific embodiment, the immumosuppressive agent
is a neutralizing antibody to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-la or MIP-1 P.
Preferably, the anti-MIP- 1a or MIP- 1P antibody is administered in an amount sufficient to
cause a detectable reduction in the amount of MIP- 1a and/or MIP- 11P in said individual, e.g.,
at the time of administration.
         5.4     ISOLATED PLACENTAL CELLS AND ISOLATED PLACENTAL CELL
                 POPULATIONS
[00771 The isolated placental cells useful in the treatment of individuals having a disruption
of blood flow in or around the brain or CNS, including symptoms and neurological deficits
attributable thereto, are cells, obtainable from a placenta or part thereof, that adhere to a
tissue culture substrate and have characteristics of multipotent cells or stem cells, but are not
trophoblasts. In certain embodiments, the isolated placental cells useful in the methods
disclosed herein have the capacity to differentiate into non-placental cell types. The isolated
placental cells useful in the methods disclosed herein can be either fetal or maternal in origin
(that is, can have the genotype of either the fetus or mother, respectively). Preferably, the
isolated placental cells and populations of isolated placental cells are fetal in origin. As used
herein, the phrase "fetal in origin" or "non-maternal in origin" indicates that the isolated
placental cells or populations of isolated placental cells are obtained from the umbilical cord
or placental structures associated with the fetus, i.e., that have the fetal genotype. As used
herein, the phrase "maternal in origin" indicates that the cells or populations of cells are
obtained from a placental structures associated with the mother, e.g., which have the maternal
genotype. Isolated placental cells, or populations of cells comprising the isolated placental
cells, can comprise isolated placental cells that are solely fetal or maternal in origin, or can
comprise a mixed population of isolated placental cells of both fetal and maternal origin. The
isolated placental cells, and populations of cells comprising the isolated placental cells, can
be identified and selected by the morphological, marker, and culture characteristics discussed
below. In certain embodiments, any of the placental cells, e.g., placental stem cells or
placental multipotent cells described herein, are autologous to a recipient, e.g., an individual
who has had a stroke, or has a symptom of a stroke. In certain other embodiments, any of the
placental cells, e.g., placental stem cells or placental multipotent cells described herein, are
heterologous to a recipient, e.g., an individual who has had a stroke, or has a symptom of a
stroke.

     WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
                5.4.1    Physical and Morphological Characteristics
[0078] The isolated placental cells described herein, when cultured in primary cultures or in
cell culture, adhere to the tissue culture substrate, e.g., tissue culture container surface (e.g.,
tissue culture plastic), or to a tissue culture surface coated with extracellular matrix or ligands
such as laminin, collagen (e.g., native or denatured), gelatin, fibronectin, ornithine,
vitronectin, and extracellular membrane protein (e.g., MATRIGEL@ (BD Discovery
Labware, Bedford, Mass.)). The isolated placental cells in culture assume a generally
fibroblastoid, stellate appearance, with a number of cytoplasmic processes extending from the
central cell body. The cells are, however, morphologically distinguishable from fibroblasts
cultured under the same conditions, as the isolated placental cells exhibit a greater number of
such processes than do fibroblasts. Morphologically, isolated placental cells are also
distinguishable from hematopoietic stem cells, which generally assume a more rounded, or
cobblestone, morphology in culture.
[0079] In certain embodiments, the isolated placental cells useful in the methods of treatment
disclosed herein, when cultured in a growth medium, develop embryoid-like bodies.
Embryoid-like bodies are noncontiguous clumps of cells that can grow on top of an adherent
layer of proliferating isolated placental cells. The term "embryoid-like" is used because the
clumps of cells resemble embryoid bodies, clumps of cells that grow from cultures of
embryonic stem cells. Growth medium in which embryoid-like bodies can develop in a
proliferating culture of isolated placental cells includes medium comprising, e.g., DMEM-LG
(e.g., from Gibco); 2% fetal calf serum (e.g., from Hyclone Labs.); 1x insulin-transferrin
selenium (ITS); lx linoleic acid-bovine serum albumin (LA-BSA); 10-9 M dexamethasone
(e.g., from Sigma);   10 4 M ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (e.g., from Sigma); epidermal growth
factor 10 ng/mL (e.g., from R&D Systems); and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB)
10 ng/mL (e.g., from R&D Systems).

Isolated placental cell populations also include populations of (that is, two or more) isolated
placental cells in culture, and a population in a container, e.g., a bag. The isolated placental
cells described herein are not bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cells, or mesenchymal cells obtained from umbilical cord blood, placental
blood, or peripheral blood.

[0084] In certain embodiments, the cells are one or more of SSEA3-, SSEA4- or ABC-p.
The isolated placental cells can also express HLA-ABC (MHC-1). These markers can be
used, in any combination, to identify the isolated placental cells, e.g., isolated placental stem
cells or isolated multipotent cells and to distinguish the isolated placental cells from other cell
types. Because the isolated placental cells can express CD73 and CD105, they can have
mesenchymal stem cell-like characteristics. Lack of expression of CD34, CD38 and/or
CD45, for example, identifies the isolated placental cells as non-hematopoietic stem cells.

level than an equivalent number of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, when the
cells are grown under equivalent conditions.
[0114] Expression of the above-referenced genes can be assessed by standard techniques.
For example, probes based on the sequence of the gene(s) can be individually selected and
constructed by conventional techniques. Expression of the genes can be assessed, e.g., on a
microarray comprising probes to one or more of the genes, e.g., an Affymetrix GENECHIP@
Human Genome U 13 3A 2.0 array, or an Affymetrix GENECHIP@ Human Genome U 133
Plus 2.0 (Santa Clara, California). Expression of these genes can be assessed even if the
sequence for a particular GenBank accession number is amended because probes specific for
the amended sequence can readily be generated using well-known standard techniques.
[0115] The level of expression of these genes can be used to confirm the identity of a
population of isolated placental cells, to identify a population of cells as comprising at least a
plurality of isolated placental cells, or the like. Populations of isolated placental cells, the
identity of which is confirmed, can be clonal, e.g., populations of isolated placental cells
expanded from a single isolated placental cell, or a mixed population of stem cells, e.g., a
population of cells comprising solely isolated placental cells that are expanded from multiple
isolated placental cells, or a population of cells comprising isolated placental cells, as
described herein, and at least one other type of cell.
[01161 The level of expression of these genes can be used to select populations of isolated
placental cells. For example, a population of cells, e.g., clonally-expanded cells, may be
selected if the expression of one or more of the genes listed above is significantly higher in a
sample from the population of cells than in an equivalent population of mesenchymal stem
cells. Such selecting can be of a population from a plurality of isolated placental cell
populations, from a plurality of cell populations, the identity of which is not known, etc.
[01171 Isolated placental cells can be selected on the basis of the level of expression of one or
more such genes as compared to the level of expression in said one or more genes in, e.g., a

 mesenchymal stem cell control, for example, the level of expression in said one or more
 genes in an equivalent number of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. In one
embodiment, the level of expression of said one or more genes in a sample comprising an
equivalent number of mesenchymal stem cells is used as a control. In another embodiment,
the control, for isolated placental cells tested under certain conditions, is a numeric value
representing the level of expression of said one or more genes in mesenchymal stem cells
under said conditions.
 [01181 The isolated placental cells described herein display the above characteristics (e.g.,
combinations of cell surface markers and/or gene expression profiles) in primary culture, or
during proliferation in medium comprising, e.g., DMEM-LG (Gibco), 2% fetal calf serum
(FCS) (Hyclone Laboratories), 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS), lx lenolenic-acid
bovine-serum-albumin (LA-BSA), 10-9 M dexamethasone (Sigma), 104M ascorbic acid 2
phosphate (Sigma), epidermal growth factor (EGF)Ong/ml (R&D Systems), platelet derived
growth factor (PDGF-BB) 1Ong/ml (R&D Systems), and 100U penicillin/IOOOU
streptomycin.
[0119] In another specific embodiment of said isolated placental cells or populations of cells
comprising the isolated placental cells, said cells or population have been expanded, for
example, passaged at least, about, or no more than, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 times, or proliferated for at least, about, or no more than, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 or 40 population doublings.
In another specific embodiment of the isolated placental cells, or populations of cells
comprising isolated placental cells, that are disclosed herein, said isolated placental cells are
fetal in origin (that is, have the fetal genotype).
[01201 In certain embodiments of isolated placental cells, said isolated placental cells do not
differentiate during culturing in growth medium, i.e., medium formulated to promote
proliferation, e.g., during proliferation in growth medium. In another specific embodiment,
said isolated placental cells do not require a feeder layer in order to proliferate. In another
specific embodiment, said isolated placental cells do not differentiate in culture in the
absence of a feeder layer, solely because of the lack of a feeder cell layer.
[01211 In another embodiment, cells useful in the treatment of disruption of blood flow in or
around the brain or CNS are isolated placental cells, wherein a plurality of said isolated
placental cells are positive for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), as assessed by an aldehyde
dehydrogenase activity assay. Such assays are known in the art (see, e.g., Bostian and Betts,
Biochem. J., 173, 787, (1978)). In a specific embodiment, said ALDH assay uses
                                                  42

     WO 2010/021715                                                           PCT/US2009/004741
ALDEFLUOR@ (Aldagen, Inc., Ashland, Oregon) as a marker of aldehyde dehydrogenase
activity. In a specific embodiment, said plurality is between about 3% and about 25% of cells
in said population of cells. In another embodiment, provided herein is a population of
isolated umbilical cord cells, e.g., multipotent isolated umbilical cord cells, wherein a
plurality of said isolated umbilical cord cells are positive for aldehyde dehydrogenase, as
assessed by an aldehyde dehydrogenase activity assay that uses ALDEFLUOR@ as an
indicator of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. In a specific embodiment, said plurality is
between about 3% and about 25% of cells in said population of cells. In another
embodiment, said population of isolated placental cells or isolated umbilical cord cells shows
at least three-fold, or at least five-fold, higher ALDH activity than a population of bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells having about the same number of cells and cultured
under the same conditions.
[0122] In certain embodiments of any of the populations of cells comprising the isolated
placental cells described herein, the placental cells in said populations of cells are
substantially free of cells having a maternal genotype; e.g., at least 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%,
60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% of the placental cells in said
population have a fetal genotype. In certain other embodiments of any of the populations of
cells comprising the isolated placental cells described herein, the populations of cells
comprising said placental cells are substantially free of cells having a maternal genotype; e.g.,
at least 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% of
the cells in said population have a fetal genotype.
[0123] In a specific embodiment of any of the above isolated placental cells or cell
populations of isolated placental cells, the karyotype of the cells, or at least about 95% or
about 99% of the cells in said population, is normal. In another specific embodiment of any
of the above placental cells or cell populations, the cells, or cells in the population of cells,
are non-maternal in origin.
[0124] Isolated placental cells, or populations of isolated placental cells, bearing any of the
above combinations of markers, can be combined in any ratio. Any two or more of the above
isolated placental cell populations can be combined to form an isolated placental cell
population. For example, an population of isolated placental cells can comprise a first
population of isolated placental cells defined by one of the marker combinations described
above, and a second population of isolated placental cells defined by another of the marker
combinations described above, wherein said first and second populations are combined in a
ratio of about 1:99, 2:98, 3:97, 4:96, 5:95, 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 70:30,

     WO 2010/021715                                                           PCT/US2009/004741
 80:20, 90:10, 95:5, 96:4, 97:3, 98:2, or about 99:1. In like fashion, any three, four, five or
more of the above-described isolated placental cells or isolated placental cells populations
can be combined.
 [0125] Isolated placental cells useful for the treatment of disruption of blood flow in or
around the brain or CNS can be obtained, e.g., by disruption of placental tissue, with or
without enzymatic digestion (see Section 5.5.3) or perfusion (see Section 5.5.4). For
example, populations of isolated placental cells can be produced according to a method
comprising perfusing a mammalian placenta that has been drained of cord blood and perfused
to remove residual blood; perfusing said placenta with a perfusion solution; and collecting
said perfusion solution, wherein said perfusion solution after perfusion comprises a
population of placental cells that comprises isolated placental cells; and isolating a plurality
of said isolated placental cells from said population of cells. In a specific embodiment, the
perfusion solution is passed through both the umbilical vein and umbilical arteries and
collected after it exudes from the placenta. In another specific embodiment, the perfusion
solution is passed through the umbilical vein and collected from the umbilical arteries, or
passed through the umbilical arteries and collected from the umbilical vein
[0126] In various embodiments, the isolated placental cells, contained within a population of
cells obtained from perfusion of a placenta, are at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%,
99% or at least 99.5% of said population of placental cells. In another specific embodiment,
the isolated placental cells collected by perfusion comprise fetal and maternal cells. In
another specific embodiment, the isolated placental cells collected by perfusion are at least
50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or at least 99.5% fetal cells.
[0127] In another specific embodiment, provided herein is a composition comprising a
population of the isolated placental cells, as described herein, collected by perfusion, wherein
said composition comprises at least a portion of the perfusion solution used to collect the
isolated placental cells.
[0128] Isolated populations of the isolated placental cells described herein can be produced
by digesting placental tissue with a tissue-disrupting enzyme to obtain a population of
placental cells comprising the cells, and isolating, or substantially isolating, a plurality of the
placental cells from the remainder of said placental cells. The whole, or any part of, the
placenta can be digested to obtain the isolated placental cells described herein. In specific
embodiments, for example, said placental tissue can be a whole placenta, an amniotic
membrane, chorion, a combination of amnion and chorion, or a combination of any of the
foregoing. In other specific embodiment, the tissue-disrupting enzyme is trypsin or
                                                 44

      WO 2010/021715                                                           PCT/US2009/004741
collagenase. In various embodiments, the isolated placental cells, contained within a
population of cells obtained from digesting a placenta, are at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,
 90%, 95%, 99% or at least 99.5% of said population of placental cells.
 [01291 The isolated populations of placental cells described above, and populations of
isolated placental cells generally, can comprise about, at least, or no more than, 1 x 105, 5 x
 10 5, 1 x 10 6 5x10 6, 1 x 10 7 ,5x10 7, 1 x 10 8 ,x08,    1 x 109, 5 x 109, 1 x 10'0, 5 x 10", 1 x
 10" or more of the isolated placental cells. Populations of isolated placental cells useful in
the methods of treatment described herein comprise at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%,
75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% viable isolated placental cells, as determined by,
e.g., trypan blue exclusion
                 5.4.3   Growth in Culture
 [0130] The growth of the isolated placental cells described herein in Section 5.4.2, as for any
mammalian cell, depends in part upon the particular medium selected for growth. Under
optimum conditions, the isolated placental cells typically double in number in about 1 day.
During culture, the isolated placental cells described herein adhere to a substrate in culture,
e.g. the surface of a tissue culture container (e.g., tissue culture dish plastic, fibronectin
coated plastic, and the like) and form a monolayer.
 [0131] Populations of placental cells that comprise the isolated placental cells described
herein, when cultured under appropriate conditions, can form embryoid-like bodies, that is,
three-dimensional clusters of cells grow atop the adherent cell layer. Cells within the
embryoid-like bodies express markers associated with very early stem cells, e.g., OCT-4,
Nanog, SSEA3 and SSEA4. Cells within the embryoid-like bodies are typically not adherent
to the culture substrate, as are the isolated placental cells described herein, but remain
attached to the adherent cells during culture. Embryoid-like body cells are dependent upon
the adherent isolated placental cells for viability, as embryoid-like bodies do not form in the
absence of the adherent isolated placental cells. The adherent isolated placental cells thus
facilitate the growth of one or more embryoid-like bodies in a population of placental cells
that comprise the adherent isolated placental cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory,
the cells of the embryoid-like bodies are thought to grow on the adherent isolated placental
cells much as embryonic stem cells grow on a feeder layer of cells.

     WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
         5.5    METHODS OF OBTAINING ISOLATED PLACENTAL CELLS
                5.5.1    Stem Cell Collection Composition
 [0132] Further provided herein are methods of collecting and isolating placental cells, e.g.,
the isolated placental cells described in Section 5.4.2, above. Generally, such cells are
obtained from a mammalian placenta using a physiologically-acceptable solution, e.g., a cell
collection composition. An exemplary cell collection composition is described in detail in
related U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0190042, entitled "Improved Medium
for Collecting Placental Stem Cells and Preserving Organs," the disclosure of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety
[0133] The cell collection composition can comprise any physiologically-acceptable solution
suitable for the collection and/or culture of cells, e.g., the isolated placental cells described
herein, for example, a saline solution (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, Kreb's solution,
modified Kreb's solution, Eagle's solution, 0.9% NaCl. etc.), a culture medium (e.g., DMEM,
H.DMEM, etc.), and the like.
[0134] The cell collection composition can comprise one or more components that tend to
preserve isolated placental cells, that is, prevent the isolated placental cells from dying, or
delay the death of the isolated placental cells, reduce the number of isolated placental cells in
a population of cells that die, or the like, from the time of collection to the time of culturing.
Such components can be, e.g., an apoptosis inhibitor (e.g., a caspase inhibitor or JNK
inhibitor); a vasodilator (e.g., magnesium sulfate, an antihypertensive drug, atrial natriuretic
peptide (ANP), adrenocorticotropin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, sodium nitroprusside,
hydralazine, adenosine triphosphate, adenosine, indomethacin or magnesium sulfate, a
phosphodiesterase inhibitor, etc.); a necrosis inhibitor (e.g., 2-(l H-Indol-3-yl)-3-pentylamino
maleimide, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, or clonazepam); a TNF-a inhibitor; and/or an
oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon (e.g., perfluorooctyl bromide, perfluorodecyl bromide, etc.).
[01351 The cell collection composition can comprise one or more tissue-degrading enzymes,
e.g., a metalloprotease, a serine protease, a neutral protease, an RNase, or a DNase, or the
like. Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, collagenases (e.g., collagenase I, II, III or
IV, a collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum, etc.); dispase, thermolysin, elastase, trypsin,
LIBERASE, hyaluronidase, and the like.
[0136] The cell collection composition can comprise a bacteriocidally or bacteriostatically
effective amount of an antibiotic. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the antibiotic is a
macrolide (e.g., tobramycin), a cephalosporin (e.g., cephalexin, cephradine, cefuroxime,
                                                 46

      WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
cefprozil, cefaclor, cefixime or cefadroxil), a clarithromycin, an erythromycin, a penicillin
(e.g., penicillin V) or a quinolone (e.g., ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), a
tetracycline, a streptomycin, etc. In a particular embodiment, the antibiotic is active against
Gram(+) and/or Gram(-) bacteria, e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,
and the like. In one embodiment, the antibiotic is gentamycin, e.g., about 0.005% to about
0.01% (w/v) in culture medium
[01371 The cell collection composition can also comprise one or more of the following
compounds: adenosine (about 1 mM to about 50 mM); D-glucose (about 20 mM to about
100 mM); magnesium ions (about 1 mM to about 50 mM); a macromolecule of molecular
weight greater than 20,000 daltons, in one embodiment, present in an amount sufficient to
maintain endothelial integrity and cellular viability (e.g., a synthetic or naturally occurring
colloid, a polysaccharide such as dextran or a polyethylene glycol present at about 25 g/l to
about 100 g/l, or about 40 g/l to about 60 g/l); an antioxidant (e.g., butylated hydroxyanisole,
butylated hydroxytoluene, glutathione, vitamin C or vitamin E present at about 25 pM to
about 100 pM); a reducing agent (e.g., N-acetylcysteine present at about 0.1 mM to about 5
mM); an agent that prevents calcium entry into cells (e.g., verapamil present at about 2 pM to
about 25 p.M); nitroglycerin (e.g., about 0.05 g/L to about 0.2 g/L); an anticoagulant, in one
embodiment, present in an amount sufficient to help prevent clotting of residual blood (e.g.,
heparin or hirudin present at a concentration of about 1000 units/1 to about 100,000 units/l);
or an amiloride containing compound (e.g., amiloride, ethyl isopropyl amiloride,
hexamethylene amiloride, dimethyl amiloride or isobutyl amiloride present at about 1.0 pM
to about 5 p.M).
                 5.5.2   Collection and Handling of Placenta
[01381 Generally, a human placenta is recovered shortly after its expulsion after birth. In a
preferred embodiment, the placenta is recovered from a patient after informed consent and
after a complete medical history of the patient is taken and is associated with the placenta.
Preferably, the medical history continues after delivery. Such a medical history can be used
to coordinate subsequent use of the placenta or the isolated placental cells harvested
therefrom. For example, isolated human placental cells can be used, in light of the medical
history, for personalized medicine for the infant associated with the placenta, or for parents,
siblings or other relatives of the infant.
[01391 Prior to recovery of isolated placental cells, the umbilical cord blood and placental
blood are preferably removed. In certain embodiments, after delivery, the cord blood in the
                                                 47

     WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
placenta is recovered. The placenta can be subjected to a conventional cord blood recovery
process. Typically a needle or cannula is used, with the aid of gravity, to exsanguinate the
placenta (see, e.g., Anderson, U.S. Patent No. 5,372,581; Hessel et al., U.S. Patent No.
 5,415,665). The needle or cannula is usually placed in the umbilical vein and the placenta
can be gently massaged to aid in draining cord blood from the placenta. Such cord blood
recovery may be performed commercially, e.g., LifeBank USA, Cedar Knolls, N.J.
Preferably, the placenta is gravity drained without further manipulation so as to minimize
tissue disruption during cord blood recovery.
 [01401 Typically, a placenta is transported from the delivery or birthing room to another
location, e.g., a laboratory, for recovery of cord blood and collection of stem cells by, e.g.,
perfusion or tissue dissociation. The placenta is preferably transported in a sterile, thermally
insulated transport device (maintaining the temperature of the placenta between 20-28*C), for
example, by placing the placenta, with clamped proximal umbilical cord, in a sterile zip-lock
plastic bag, which is then placed in an insulated container. In another embodiment, the
placenta is transported in a cord blood collection kit substantially as described in pending
United States Patent No. 7,147,626, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference
herein. Preferably, the placenta is delivered to the laboratory four to twenty-four hours
following delivery. In certain embodiments, the proximal umbilical cord is clamped,
preferably within 4-5 cm (centimeter) of the insertion into the placental disc prior to cord
blood recovery. In other embodiments, the proximal umbilical cord is clamped after cord
blood recovery but prior to further processing of the placenta.
 [0141] The placenta, prior to cell collection, can be stored under sterile conditions and at
either room temperature or at a temperature of 5*C to 25*C. The placenta may be stored for a
period of for a period of four to twenty-four hours, up to forty-eight hours, or longer than
forty eight hours, prior to perfusing the placenta to remove any residual cord blood. In one
embodiment, the placenta is harvested from between about zero hours to about two hours
post-expulsion. The placenta is preferably stored in an anticoagulant solution at a
temperature of 5*C to 25'C. Suitable anticoagulant solutions are well known in the art. For
example, a solution of heparin or warfarin sodium can be used. In a preferred embodiment,
the anticoagulant solution comprises a solution of heparin (e.g., 1%w/w in 1:1000 solution).
The exsanguinated placenta is preferably stored for no more than 36 hours before placental
cells are collected.

[0142] The mammalian placenta or a part thereof, once collected and prepared generally as
above, can be treated in any art-known manner, e.g., can be perfused or disrupted, e.g.,
digested with one or more tissue-disrupting enzymes, to obtain isolated placental cells.
                5.5.3    Physical Disruption and Enzymatic Digestion of Placental Tissue
[0143] In one embodiment, stem cells are collected from a mammalian placenta by physical
disruption of part of all of the organ. For example, the placenta, or a portion thereof, may be,
e.g., crushed, sheared, minced, diced, chopped, macerated or the like. The tissue can then be
cultured to obtain a population of isolated placental cells. Typically, the placental tissue is
disrupted using, e.g., culture medium, a saline solution, or a stem cell collection composition
(see Section 5.5.1 and below).
[01441 The placenta can be dissected into components prior to physical disruption and/or
enzymatic digestion and stem cell recovery. Isolated placental cells can be obtained from all
or a portion of the amniotic membrane, chorion, umbilical cord, placental cotyledons, or any
combination thereof, including from a whole placenta. Preferably, isolated placental cells are
obtained from placental tissue comprising amnion and chorion. Typically, isolated placental
cells can be obtained by disruption of a small block of placental tissue, e.g., a block of
placental tissue that is about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100,
200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 or about 1000 cubic millimeters in volume. Any
method of physical disruption can be used, provided that the method of disruption leaves a
plurality, more preferably a majority, and more preferably at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%,
95%, 98%, or 99% of the cells in said organ viable, as determined by, e.g., trypan blue
exclusion.
[0145] The isolated adherent placental cells can generally be collected from a placenta, or
portion thereof, at any time within about the first three days post-expulsion, but preferably
between about 8 hours and about 18 hours post-expulsion.
[0146] In a specific embodiment, the disrupted tissue is cultured in tissue culture medium
suitable for the proliferation of isolated placental cells (see, e.g., Section 5.6, below,
describing the culture of placental stem cells).
[0147] In another specific embodiment, isolated placental cells are collected by physical
disruption of placental tissue, wherein the physical disruption includes enzymatic digestion,
which can be accomplished by use of one or more tissue-digesting enzymes. The placenta, or
a portion thereof, may also be physically disrupted and digested with one or more enzymes,
and the resulting material then immersed in, or mixed into, a cell collection composition.

      WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
[0148] A preferred cell collection composition comprises one or more tissue-disruptive
enzyme(s). Enzymes that can be used to disrupt placenta tissue include papain,
deoxyribonucleases, serine proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, collagenase, dispase or
elastase. Serine proteases may be inhibited by alpha 2 microglobulin in serum and therefore
the medium used for digestion is usually serum-free. EDTA and DNase are commonly used
in enzyme digestion procedures to increase the efficiency of cell recovery. The digestate is
preferably diluted so as to avoid trapping cells within the viscous digest.
[01491 Any combination of tissue digestion enzymes can be used. Typical concentrations for
digestion using trypsin include, 0.1% to about 2% trypsin, e.g,. about 0.25% trypsin.
Proteases can be used in combination, that is, two or more proteases in the same digestion
reaction, or can be used sequentially in order to liberate placental cells, e.g., placental stem
cells and placental multipotent cells. For example, in one embodiment, a placenta, or part
thereof, is digested first with an appropriate amount of collagenase I at about 1 to about 2
mg/ml for, e.g., 30 minutes, followed by digestion with trypsin, at a concentration of about
0.25%, for, e.g., 10 minutes, at 37*C. Serine proteases are preferably used consecutively
following use of other enzymes.
[01501 In another embodiment, the tissue can further be disrupted by the addition of a
chelator, e.g., ethylene glycol bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to the stem cell collection composition comprising
the stem cells, or to a solution in which the tissue is disrupted and/or digested prior to
isolation of the stem cells with the stem cell collection composition.
[01511 Following digestion, the digestate is washed, for example, three times with culture
medium, and the washed cells are seeded into culture flasks. The cells are then isolated by
differential adherence, and characterized for, e.g., viability, cell surface markers,
differentiation, and the like.
[0152] It will be appreciated that where an entire placenta, or portion of a placenta
comprising both fetal and maternal cells (for example, where the portion of the placenta
comprises the chorion or cotyledons), the placental cells isolated can comprise a mix of
placental cells derived from both fetal and maternal sources. Where a portion of the placenta
that comprises no, or a negligible number of, maternal cells (for example, amnion), the
placental cells isolated therefrom will comprise almost exclusively fetal placental cells (that
is, placental cells having the genotype of the fetus).
[0153] Placental cells, e.g., the placental cells described in Section 5.4.2, above, can be
isolated from disrupted placental tissue by differential trypsinization (see Section 5.5.5,

     WO 2010/021715                                                           PCT/US2009/004741

medium, optionally followed by a second differential trypsinization step.
                 5.5.4   Placental Perfusion
 101541 Placental cells, e.g., the placental cells described in Section 5.4.2, above, can also be
obtained by perfusion of the mammalian placenta. Methods of perfusing mammalian
placenta to obtain placental cells are disclosed, e.g., in Hariri, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,045,148 and
7,255,729, in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2007/0275362 and 2007/0190042, the
disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
 [0155] Placental cells can be collected by perfusion, e.g., through the placental vasculature,
using, e.g., a cell collection composition as a perfusion solution. In one embodiment, a
mammalian placenta is perfused by passage of perfusion solution through either or both of
the umbilical artery and umbilical vein. The flow of perfusion solution through the placenta
may be accomplished using, e.g., gravity flow into the placenta. Preferably, the perfusion
solution is forced through the placenta using a pump, e.g., a peristaltic pump. The umbilical
vein can be, e.g., cannulated with a cannula, e.g., a TEFLON* or plastic cannula, that is
connected to a sterile connection apparatus, such as sterile tubing. The sterile connection
apparatus is connected to a perfusion manifold.
 [0156] In preparation for perfusion, the placenta is preferably oriented (e.g., suspended) in
such a manner that the umbilical artery and umbilical vein are located at the highest point of
the placenta. The placenta can be perfused by passage of a perfusion fluid through the
placental vasculature and surrounding tissue. The placenta can also be perfused by passage
of a perfusion fluid into the umbilical vein and collection from the umbilical arteries, or
passage of a perfusion fluid into the umbilical arteries and collection from the umbilical vein.
 [0157] In one embodiment, for example, the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein are
connected simultaneously, e.g., to a pipette that is connected via a flexible connector to a
reservoir of the perfusion solution. The perfusion solution is passed into the umbilical vein
and artery. The perfusion solution exudes from and/or passes through the walls of the blood
vessels into the surrounding tissues of the placenta, and is collected in a suitable open vessel
from the surface of the placenta that was attached to the uterus of the mother during
gestation. The perfusion solution may also be introduced through the umbilical cord opening
and allowed to flow or percolate out of openings in the wall of the placenta which interfaced
with the maternal uterine wall. Placental cells that are collected by this method, which can be
referred to as a "pan" method, are typically a mixture of fetal and maternal cells.
                                                  51

      WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
 [0158] In another embodiment, the perfusion solution is passed through the umbilical veins
and collected from the umbilical artery, or is passed through the umbilical artery and
collected from the umbilical veins. Placental cells collected by this method, which can be
referred to as a "closed circuit" method, are typically almost exclusively fetal.
 [0159] It will be appreciated that perfusion using the pan method, that is, whereby perfusate
is collected after it has exuded from the maternal side of the placenta, results in a mix of fetal
and maternal cells. As a result, the cells collected by this method can comprise a mixed
population of placental cells, e.g., placental stem cells or placental multipotent cells, of both
fetal and maternal origin. In contrast, perfusion solely through the placental vasculature in
the closed circuit method, whereby perfusion fluid is passed through one or two placental
vessels and is collected solely through the remaining vessel(s), results in the collection of a
population of placental cells almost exclusively of fetal origin.
 [01601 The closed circuit perfusion method can, in one embodiment, be performed as
follows. A post-partum placenta is obtained within about 48 hours after birth. The umbilical
cord is clamped and cut above the clamp. The umbilical cord can be discarded, or can
processed to recover, e.g., umbilical cord stem cells, and/or to process the umbilical cord
membrane for the production of a biomaterial. The amniotic membrane can be retained
during perfusion, or can be separated from the chorion, e.g., using blunt dissection with the
fingers. If the amniotic membrane is separated from the chorion prior to perfusion, it can be,
e.g., discarded, or processed, e.g., to obtain stem cells by enzymatic digestion, or to produce,
e.g., an amniotic membrane biomaterial, e.g., the biomaterial described in U.S. Application
Publication No. 2004/0048796, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in
its entirety. After cleaning the placenta of all visible blood clots and residual blood, e.g.,
using sterile gauze, the umbilical cord vessels are exposed, e.g., by partially cutting the
umbilical cord membrane to expose a cross-section of the cord. The vessels are identified,
and opened, e.g., by advancing a closed alligator clamp through the cut end of each vessel.
The apparatus, e.g., plastic tubing connected to a perfusion device or peristaltic pump, is then
inserted into each of the placental arteries. The pump can be any pump suitable for the
purpose, e.g., a peristaltic pump. Plastic tubing, connected to a sterile collection reservoir,
e.g., a blood bag such as a 250 mL collection bag, is then inserted into the placental vein.
Alternatively, the tubing connected to the pump is inserted into the placental vein, and tubes
to a collection reservoir(s) are inserted into one or both of the placental arteries. The placenta
is then perfused with a volume of perfusion solution, e.g., about 750 ml of perfusion solution.
Cells in the perfusate are then collected, e.g., by centrifugation. In certain embodiments, the
                                                 52

      WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
 placenta is perfused with perfusion solution, e.g., 100-300 mL perfusion solution, to remove
 residual blood prior to perfusion to collect placental cells, e.g., placental stem cells and/or
 placental multipotent cells. In another embodiment, the placenta is not perfused with
perfusion solution to remove residual blood prior to perfusion to collect placental cells.
 [0161] In one embodiment, the proximal umbilical cord is clamped during perfusion, and
 more preferably, is clamped within 4-5 cm (centimeter) of the cord's insertion into the
placental disc.
 [0162] The first collection of perfusion fluid from a mammalian placenta during the
exsanguination process is generally colored with residual red blood cells of the cord blood
and/or placental blood. The perfusion fluid becomes more colorless as perfusion proceeds
and the residual cord blood cells are washed out of the placenta. Generally from 30 to 100 ml
(milliliter) of perfusion fluid is adequate to initially exsanguinate the placenta, but more or
less perfusion fluid may be used depending on the observed results.
 [0163] The volume of perfusion liquid used to isolate placental cells may vary depending
upon the number of cells to be collected, the size of the placenta, the number of collections to
be made from a single placenta, etc. In various embodiments, the volume of perfusion liquid
may be from 50 mL to 5000 mL, 50 mL to 4000 mL, 50 mL to 3000 mL, 100 mL to 2000
mL, 250 mL to 2000 mL, 500 mL to 2000 mL, or 750 mL to 2000 mL. Typically, the
placenta is perfused with 700-800 mL of perfusion liquid following exsanguination.
 [0164] The placenta can be perfused a plurality of times over the course of several hours or
several days. Where the placenta is to be perfused a plurality of times, it may be maintained
or cultured under aseptic conditions in a container or other suitable vessel, and perfused with
the cell collection composition, or a standard perfusion solution (e.g., a normal saline solution
such as phosphate buffered saline ("PBS")) with or without an anticoagulant (e.g., heparin,
warfarin sodium, coumarin, bishydroxycoumarin), and/or with or without an antimicrobial
agent (e.g., p-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM); antibiotics such as streptomycin (e.g., at 40-100
  tg/ml), penicillin (e.g., at 40U/ml), amphotericin B (e.g., at 0.5 Rg/ml). In one embodiment,
an isolated placenta is maintained or cultured for a period of time without collecting the
perfusate, such that the placenta is maintained or cultured for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 hours, or 2 or 3 or more days before
perfusion and collection of perfusate. The perfused placenta can be maintained for one or
more additional time(s), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24 or more hours, and perfused a second time with, e.g., 700-800 mL perfusion
fluid. The placenta can be perfused 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more times, for example, once every 1, 2,
                                                  53

      WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
3, 4, 5 or 6 hours. In a preferred embodiment, perfusion of the placenta and collection of
perfusion solution, e.g., cell collection composition, is repeated until the number of recovered
nucleated cells falls below 100 cells/ml. The perfusates at different time points can be further
processed individually to recover time-dependent populations of cells, e.g., stem cells.
Perfusates from different time points can also be pooled. In a preferred embodiment,
placental cells are collected at a time or times between about 8 hours and about 18 hours
post-expulsion.
[0165] Perfusion preferably results in the collection of significantly more placental cells than
the number obtainable from a mammalian placenta not perfused with said solution, and not
otherwise treated to obtain placental cells (e.g., by tissue disruption, e.g., enzymatic
digestion). In this context, "significantly more" means at least 10% more. Perfusion yields
significantly more placental cells than, e.g., the number of placental cells isolatable from
culture medium in which a placenta, or portion thereof, has been cultured.
[0166] Placental cells can be isolated from placenta by perfusion with a solution comprising
one or more proteases or other tissue-disruptive enzymes. In a specific embodiment, a
placenta or portion thereof (e.g., amniotic membrane, amnion and chorion, placental lobule or
cotyledon, umbilical cord, or combination of any of the foregoing) is brought to 25-37 0C, and
is incubated with one or more tissue-disruptive enzymes in 200 mL of a culture medium for
30 minutes. Cells from the perfusate are collected, brought to 4*C, and washed with a cold
inhibitor mix comprising 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol and 2 mM beta-mercaptoethanol.
The placental cells are washed after several minutes with a cold (e.g., 4*C) stem cell
collection composition.
                5.5.5    Isolation, Sorting, and Characterization of Placental Cells
[0167] The isolated placental cells, e.g., the cells described in Section 5.4.2, above, whether
obtained by perfusion or physical disruption, e.g., by enzymatic digestion, can initially be
purified from (i.e., be isolated from) other cells by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Such
centrifugation can follow any standard protocol for centrifugation speed, etc. In one
embodiment, for example, cells collected from the placenta are recovered from perfusate by
centrifugation at 5000 x g for 15 minutes at room temperature, which separates cells from,
e.g., contaminating debris and platelets. In another embodiment, placental perfusate is
concentrated to about 200 ml, gently layered over Ficoll, and centrifuged at about 1100 x g
for 20 minutes at 22*C, and the low-density interface layer of cells is collected for further
processing.
                                                 54

     WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
[0168] Cell pellets can be resuspended in fresh stem cell collection composition, or a medium
suitable for cell maintenance, e.g., stem cell maintenance, for example, IMDM serum-free
medium containing 2U/ml heparin and 2 mM EDTA (GibcoBRL, NY). The total
mononuclear cell fraction can be isolated, e.g., using Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo,
Norway) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure.
[01691 Placental cells obtained by perfusion or digestion can, for example, be further, or
initially, isolated by differential trypsinization using, e.g., a solution of 0.05% trypsin with
0.2% EDTA (Sigma, St. Louis MO). Differential trypsinization is possible because the
isolated placental cells, which are tissue culture plastic-adherent, typically detach from the
plastic surfaces within about five minutes whereas other adherent populations typically
require more than 20-30 minutes incubation. The detached placental cells can be harvested
following trypsinization and trypsin neutralization, using, e.g., Trypsin Neutralizing Solution
(TNS, Cambrex). In one embodiment of isolation of adherent cells, aliquots of, for example,
about 5-10 x 106 cells are placed in each of several T-75 flasks, preferably fibronectin-coated
T75 flasks. In such an embodiment, the cells can be cultured with commercially available
Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium (MSCGM) (Cambrex), and placed in a tissue
culture incubator (37*C, 5% C0 2 ). After 10 to 15 days, non-adherent cells are removed from
the flasks by washing with PBS. The PBS is then replaced by MSCGM. Flasks are
preferably examined daily for the presence of various adherent cell types and in particular,
for identification and expansion of clusters of fibroblastoid cells.
10170] The number and type of cells collected from a mammalian placenta can be monitored,
for example, by measuring changes in morphology and cell surface markers using standard
cell detection techniques such as flow cytometry, cell sorting, immunocytochemistry (e.g.,
staining with tissue specific or cell-marker specific antibodies) fluorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS), magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS), by examination of the morphology
of cells using light or confocal microscopy, and/or by measuring changes in gene expression
using techniques well known in the art, such as PCR and gene expression profiling. These
techniques can be used, too, to identify cells that are positive for one or more particular
markers. For example, using antibodies to CD34, one can determine, using the techniques
above, whether a cell comprises a detectable amount of CD34; if so, the cell is CD34*.
Likewise, if a cell produces enough OCT-4 RNA to be detectable by RT-PCR, or
significantly more OCT-4 RNA than an adult cell, the cell is OCT-4*. Antibodies to cell
surface markers (e.g., CD markers such as CD34) and the sequence of stem cell-specific
genes, such as OCT-4, are well-known in the art.
                                                  55

     WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
[0171] Placental cells, particularly cells that have been isolated by Ficoll separation,
differential adherence, or a combination of both, may be sorted using a fluorescence activated
cell sorter (FACS). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) is a well-known method for
separating particles, including cells, based on the fluorescent properties of the particles
(Kamarch, 1987, Methods Enzymol, 151:150-165). Laser excitation of fluorescent moieties
in the individual particles results in a small electrical charge allowing electromagnetic
separation of positive and negative particles from a mixture. In one embodiment, cell surface
marker-specific antibodies or ligands are labeled with distinct fluorescent labels. Cells are
processed through the cell sorter, allowing separation of cells based on their ability to bind to
the antibodies used. FACS sorted particles may be directly deposited into individual wells of
96-well or 384-well plates to facilitate separation and cloning.
[0172] In one sorting scheme, cells from placenta, e.g., are sorted on the basis of expression
of one or more of the markers CD34, CD38, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD105, OCT-4 and/or
HLA-G. This can be accomplished in connection with procedures to select such cells on the
basis of their adherence properties in culture. For example, tissue culture plastic adherence
selection can be accomplished before or after sorting on the basis of marker expression. In
one embodiment, for example, cells are sorted first on the basis of their expression of CD34;
CD34 cells are retained, and CD34~ cells that are additionally CD200HLA-G* are separated
from all other CD34- cells. In another embodiment, cells from placenta are sorted based on
their expression of markers CD200 and/or HLA-G; for example, cells displaying either of
these markers are isolated for further use. Cells that express, e.g., CD200 and/or HLA-G can,
in a specific embodiment, be further sorted based on their expression of CD73 and/or CD 105,
or epitopes recognized by antibodies SH2, SH3 or SH4, or lack of expression of CD34, CD38
or CD45. For example, in another embodiment, placental cells are sorted by expression, or
lack thereof, of CD200, HLA-G, CD73, CD105, CD34, CD38 and CD45, and placental cells
that are CD200*, HLA-G*, CD73*, CD105*, CD34~, CD38- and CD45- are isolated from
other placental cells for further use.
[0173] In specific embodiments of any of the above embodiments of sorted placental cells, at
least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% of the cells in a cell population remaining after
sorting are said isolated placental cells. Placental cells can be sorted by one or more of any
of the markers described in Section 5.4.2, above.
[0174] In a specific embodiment, placental cells that are (1) adherent to tissue culture plastic,
and (2) CDl0*, CD34- and CD105* are sorted from (i.e., isolated from) other placental cells.
In another specific embodiment, placental cells that are (1) adherent to tissue culture plastic,

and (2) CD10+, CD34-, CD105* and CD200* are sorted from (i.e., isolated from) other
placental cells. In another specific embodiment, placental cells that are (1) adherent to tissue
culture plastic, and (2) CD10, CD34~, CD45~, CD90*, CD105+ and CD200* are sorted from
(i.e., isolated from) other placental cells.
[0175] With respect to antibody-mediated detection and sorting of placental cells, e.g.,
placental stem cells or placental multipotent cells, any antibody, specific for a particular
marker, can be used, in combination with any fluorophore or other label suitable for the
detection and sorting of cells (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting).
Antibody/fluorophore combinations to specific markers include, but are not limited to,
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated monoclonal antibodies against HLA-G
(available from Serotec, Raleigh, North Carolina), CD10 (available from BD
Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, California), CD44 (available from BD Biosciences
Pharmingen, San Jose, California), and CD105 (available from R&D Systems Inc.,
Minneapolis, Minnesota); phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated monoclonal antibodies against
CD44, CD200, CD 117, and CD13 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen); phycoerythrin-Cy7 (PE
Cy7) conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD33 and CD 10 (BD Biosciences
Pharmingen); allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated streptavidin and monoclonal antibodies
against CD38 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen); and Biotinylated CD90 (BD Biosciences
Pharmingen). Other antibodies that can be used include, but are not limited to, CD133-APC
(Miltenyi), KDR-Biotin (CD309, Abcam), CytokeratinK-Fitc (Sigma or Dako), HLA ABC
Fitc (BD), HLA DR,DQ,DP-PE (BD),          p-2-microglobulin-PE   (BD), CD80-PE (BD) and
CD86-APC (BD).
[01761 Other antibody/label combinations that can be used include, but are not limited to,
CD45-PerCP (peridin chlorophyll protein); CD44-PE; CD 19-PE; CD10-F (fluorescein);
HLA-G-F and 7-amino-actinomycin-D (7-AAD); HLA-ABC-F; and the like.
[01771 The isolated placental cells provided herein can be assayed for CD1 17 or CD133
using, for example, phycoerythrin-Cy5 (PE Cy5) conjugated streptavidin and biotin
conjugated monoclonal antibodies against CD 117 or CD133; however, using this system, the
cells can appear to be positive for CD 117 or CD 133, respectively, because of a relatively
high background.
[01781 The isolated placental cells can be labeled with an antibody to a single marker and
detected and/sorted. Placental cells can also be simultaneously labeled with multiple
antibodies to different markers.

 101791 In another embodiment, magnetic beads can be used to separate cells. The cells may
be sorted using a magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) technique, a method for separating
particles based on their ability to bind magnetic beads (0.5-100 pm diameter). A variety of
useful modifications can be performed on the magnetic microspheres, including covalent
 addition of antibody that specifically recognizes a particular cell surface molecule or hapten.
The beads are then mixed with the cells to allow binding. Cells are then passed through a
magnetic field to separate out cells having the specific cell surface marker. In one
embodiment, these cells can then isolated and re-mixed with magnetic beads coupled to an
antibody against additional cell surface markers. The cells are again passed through a
magnetic field, isolating cells that bound both the antibodies. Such cells can then be diluted
into separate dishes, such as microtiter dishes for clonal isolation.
 [01801 Isolated placental cells can also be characterized and/or sorted based on cell
morphology and growth characteristics. For example, isolated placental cells can be
characterized as having, and/or selected on the basis of, e.g., a fibroblastoid appearance in
culture. The isolated placental cells can also be characterized as having, and/or be selected,
on the basis of their ability to form embryoid-like bodies. In one embodiment, for example,
placental cells that are fibroblastoid in shape, express CD73 and CD 105, and produce one or
more embryoid-like bodies in culture are isolated from other placental cells. In another
embodiment, OCT-4* placental cells that produce one or more embryoid-like bodies in
culture are isolated from other placental cells.
 [0181] In another embodiment, isolated placental cells can be identified and characterized by
a colony forming unit assay. Colony forming unit assays are commonly known in the art,
such as MESEN CULTTM medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver British
Columbia)
[01821 The isolated placental cells can be assessed for viability, proliferation potential, and
longevity using standard techniques known in the art, such as trypan blue exclusion assay,
fluorescein diacetate uptake assay, propidium iodide uptake assay (to assess viability); and
thymidine uptake assay, MTT cell proliferation assay (to assess proliferation). Longevity
may be determined by methods well known in the art, such as by determining the maximum
number of population doubling in an extended culture.
[0183] Isolated placental cells, e.g., the isolated placental cells described in Section 5.4.2,
above, can also be separated from other placental cells using other techniques known in the
art, e.g., selective growth of desired cells (positive selection), selective destruction of
unwanted cells (negative selection); separation based upon differential cell agglutinability in

         5.6    CULTURE OF ISOLATED PLACENTAL CELLS
                5.6.1   Culture Media
 [0184] Isolated placental cells, or populations of isolated placental cells, or cells or placental
tissue from which placental stem cells grow out, can be used to initiate, or seed, cell cultures.
Cells are generally transferred to sterile tissue culture vessels either uncoated or coated with
extracellular matrix or ligands such as laminin, collagen (e.g., native or denatured), gelatin,
fibronectin, ornithine, vitronectin, and extracellular membrane protein (e.g., MATRIGEL@
(BD Discovery Labware, Bedford, Mass.)).
[01851 Isolated placental cells can be cultured in any medium, and under any conditions,
recognized in the art as acceptable for the culture of cells, e.g., stem cells. Preferably, the
culture medium comprises serum. The isolated placental cells can be cultured in, for
example, DMEM-LG (Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium, low glucose)/MCDB 201
(chick fibroblast basal medium) containing ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenium), LA+BSA
(linoleic acid-bovine serum albumin), dexamethasone L-ascorbic acid, PDGF, EGF, IGF-1,
and penicillin/streptomycin; DMEM-HG (high glucose) comprising 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS); DMEM-HG comprising 15% FBS; IMDM (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium)
comprising 10% FBS, 10% horse serum, and hydrocortisone; M199 comprising 1%to 20%
FBS, EGF, and heparin; a-MEM (minimal essential medium) comprising 10% FBS,
GLUTAMAX'" and gentamicin; DMEM comprising 10% FBS, GLUTAMAX h and
gentamicin, etc.
[0186] Other media in that can be used to culture placental cells include DMEM (high or low
glucose), Eagle's basal medium, Ham's F10 medium (F10), Ham's F-12 medium (F12),
Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium (MSCGM),
Liebovitz's L-15 medium, MCDB, DMEM/F 12, RPMI 1640, advanced DMEM (Gibco),
DMEM/MCDB201 (Sigma), and CELL-GRO FREE.
10187] The culture medium can be supplemented with one or more components including,
for example, serum (e.g., fetal bovine serum (FBS), preferably about 2-15% (v/v); equine
(horse) serum (ES); human serum (HS)); beta-mercaptoethanol (BME), preferably about
0.00 1%(v/v); one or more growth factors, for example, platelet-derived growth factor
                                                 59

      WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
(PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like
growth factor-i (IGF-1), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), and erythropoietin (EPO); amino acids, including L-valine; and one or more
antibiotic and/or antimycotic agents to control microbial contamination, such as, for example,
penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, amphotericin B, gentamicin, and nystatin, either alone or
in combination.
[0188] The isolated placental cells can be cultured in standard tissue culture conditions, e.g.,
in tissue culture dishes or multiwell plates. The isolated placental cells can also be cultured
using a hanging drop method. In this method, isolated placental cells are suspended at about
 1 x 104 cells per mL in about 5 mL of medium, and one or more drops of the medium are
placed on the inside of the lid of a tissue culture container, e.g., a 100 mL Petri dish. The
drops can be, e.g., single drops, or multiple drops from, e.g., a multichannel pipetter. The lid
is carefully inverted and placed on top of the bottom of the dish, which contains a volume of
liquid, e.g., sterile PBS sufficient to maintain the moisture content in the dish atmosphere,
and the stem cells are cultured.
[0189] In one embodiment, isolated placental cells are cultured in the presence of a
compound that acts to maintain an undifferentiated phenotype in the isolated placental cells.
In a specific embodiment, the compound is a substituted 3,4-dihydropyridimol[4,5
d]pyrimidine. In a more specific embodiment, the compound is a compound having the
following chemical structure:
                                           H3C                 0
                                         N        O                          CH3
                     NN     NI             Ni               N
                       |    H               IH3
The compound can be contacted with isolated placental cells, or a population of isolated
placental cells, at a concentration of, for example, between about 1 pM to about 10 pM.
                 5.6.2   Expansion and Proliferation of Placental Cells
[0190] Once an isolated placental cell, or population of isolated placental cells (e.g., a
placental cell or population of placental cells separated from at least 50% of the placental
cells with which the stem cell or population of stem cells is normally associated in vivo), the
cell or population of cells can be proliferated and expanded in vitro. For example, a
                                                 60

     WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
population of the isolated placental cells can be cultured in tissue culture containers, e.g.,
dishes, flasks, multiwell plates, or the like, for a sufficient time for the cells to proliferate to
70-90% confluence, that is, until the cells and their progeny occupy 70-90% of the culturing
surface area of the tissue culture container.
 [0191] The isolated placental cells can be seeded in culture vessels at a density that allows
cell growth. For example, the cells may be seeded at low density (e.g., about 1,000 to about
5,000 cells/cm 2 ) to high density (e.g., about 50,000 or more cells/cm 2 ). In a preferred
embodiment, the cells are cultured in the presence of about 0 to about 5 percent by volume
CO 2 in air. In some preferred embodiments, the cells are cultured at about 2 to about 25
percent 02 in air, preferably about 5 to about 20 percent 02 in air. The cells preferably are
cultured at about 25*C to about 40*C, preferably 37*C. The cells are preferably cultured in an
incubator. The culture medium can be static or agitated, for example, using a bioreactor.
Placental cells, e.g., placental stem cells or placental multipotent cells, preferably are grown
under low oxidative stress (e.g., with addition of glutathione, ascorbic acid, catalase,
tocopherol, N-acetylcysteine, or the like).
[01921 Once confluence of less than 100%, for example, 70% to 90% is obtained, the cells
may be passaged. For example, the cells can be enzymatically treated, e.g., trypsinized, using
techniques well-known in the art, to separate them from the tissue culture surface. After
removing the cells by pipetting and counting the cells, about 10,000-100,000 cells/cm2 are
passaged to a new culture container containing fresh culture medium. Typically, the new
medium is the same type of medium from which the isolated placental cells were removed.
The isolated placental cells can be passaged about, at least, or no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 times, or more.
                5.6.3    Populations of Isolated Placental Cells
[0193] Also provided herein are populations of isolated placental cells, e.g., the isolated
placental cells described in Section 5.4.2, above, useful in the treatment of disruption of
blood flow in or around the brain or CNS. Populations of isolated placental cells can be
isolated directly from one or more placentas; that is, the cell population can be a population
of placental cells comprising the isolated placental cells, wherein the isolated placental cells
are obtained from, or contained within, perfusate, or obtained from, or contained within,
disrupted placental tissue, e.g., placental tissue digestate (that is, the collection of cells
obtained by enzymatic digestion of a placenta or part thereof). The isolated placental cells
described herein can also be cultured and expanded to produce populations of the isolated
                                                  61

      WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
 placental cells. Populations of placental cells comprising the isolated placental cells can also
 be cultured and expanded to produce placental cell populations.
 [01941 Placental cell populations useful in the methods of treatment provided herein
 comprise the isolated placental cells, for example, the isolated placental cells as described in
 Section 5.4.2 herein. In various embodiments, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%,
 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of the cells in a placental cell population are the isolated
 placental cells. That is, a population of the isolated placental cells can comprise, e.g., as
 much as 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% cells that are not the
 isolated placental cells.
 [01951 Isolated placental cell populations useful in the treatment of disruption of blood flow
 in or around the brain or CNS can be produced by, e.g., selecting isolated placental cells,
whether derived from enzymatic digestion or perfusion, that express particular markers
and/or particular culture or morphological characteristics. In one embodiment, for example, a
cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that (a) adhere to a substrate, and (b)
express CD200 and HLA-G; and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell
population. In another embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells
that express CD200 and HLA-G, and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell
population. In another embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells
that (a) adhere to a substrate, and (b) express CD73, CD105, and CD200; and isolating said

produced by identifying placental cells that express CD73, CD 105, and CD200, and isolating
said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment, a cell
population is produced by selecting placental cells that (a) adhere to a substrate and (b)

In another embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that express
CD200 and OCT-4, and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In
another embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that (a) adhere
to a substrate, (b) express CD73 and CD 105, and (c) facilitate the formation of one or more
embryoid-like bodies in a population of placental cells comprising said stem cell when said
population is cultured under conditions that allow for the formation of an embryoid-like
body; and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another
embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that express CD73 and
CD 105, and facilitate the formation of one or more embryoid-like bodies in a population of
placental cells comprising said stem cell when said population is cultured under conditions

that allow for the formation of an embryoid-like body, and isolating said cells from other
cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment, a cell population is produced by
selecting placental cells that (a) adhere to a substrate, and (b) express CD73, CD105 and
HLA-G; and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another
embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that express CD73,
CD 105 and HLA-G, and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In
another embodiment, the method of producing a cell population comprises selecting placental
cells that (a) adhere to a substrate, (b) express OCT-4, and (c) facilitate the formation of one
or more embryoid-like bodies in a population of placental cells comprising said stem cell
when said population is cultured under conditions that allow for the formation of an
embryoid-like body; and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In
another embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that express
OCT-4, and facilitate the formation of one or more embryoid-like bodies in a population of
placental cells comprising said stem cell when said population is cultured under conditions
that allow for the formation of an embryoid-like body, and isolating said cells from other
cells to form a cell population.
[01961 In another embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that
(a) adhere to a substrate, and (b) express CD10 and CD105, and do not express CD34; and
isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment, a cell
population is produced by selecting placental cells that express CD10 and CD 105, and do not
express CD34, and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another
embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental cells that (a) adhere to a
substrate, and (b) express CD 10, CD 105, and CD200, and do not express CD34; and isolating
said cells from other cells to form a cell population. In another embodiment, a cell
population is produced by selecting placental cells that express CD 10, CD 105, and CD200,
and do not express CD34, and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population.
In another more specific embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting placental
cells that (a) adhere to a substrate, and (b) express CD10, CD90, CD105 and CD200, and do
not express CD34 and CD45; and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell
population. In another more specific embodiment, a cell population is produced by selecting
placental cells that express CD 10, CD90, CD105 and CD200, and do not express CD34 and
CD45, and isolating said cells from other cells to form a cell population.

      WO 2010/021715                                                           PCT/US2009/004741
 [01971 Such cell populations, or combinations thereof, can be used to treat disruption of
 blood flow in or around the brain or CNS, e.g., a symptom of a disruption or a neurological
 deficit attributable to such a disruption.
 [01981 In any of the above embodiments, selection of the isolated cell populations can
 additionally comprise selecting placental cells that express ABC-p (a placenta-specific ABC
 transporter protein; see, e.g., Allikmets et al., CancerRes. 58(23):5337-9 (1998)). The
 method can also comprise selecting cells exhibiting at least one characteristic specific to, e.g.,
 a mesenchymal stem cell, for example, expression of CD44, expression of CD90, or
 expression of a combination of the foregoing.
 [0199] In the above embodiments, the substrate can be any surface on which culture and/or
 selection of cells, e.g., isolated placental cells, can be accomplished. Typically, the substrate
is plastic, e.g., tissue culture dish or multiwell plate plastic. Tissue culture plastic can be
coated with a biomolecule, e.g., laminin or fibronectin.
 [0200] Cells, e.g., isolated placental cells, can be selected for a placental cell population by
any means known in the art of cell selection. For example, cells can be selected using an
antibody or antibodies to one or more cell surface markers, for example, in flow cytometry or
FACS. Selection can be accomplished using antibodies in conjunction with magnetic beads.
Antibodies that are specific for certain stem cell-related markers are known in the art. For
example, antibodies to OCT-4 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), CD200 (Abcam), HLA-G
(Abcam), CD73 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), CD 105 (Abcam; BioDesign
International, Saco, ME), etc. Antibodies to other markers are also available commercially,
e.g., CD34, CD38 and CD45 are available from, e.g., StemCell Technologies or BioDesign
International.
 [0201] The isolated placental cell populations can comprise placental cells that are not stem
cells, or cells that are not placental cells.
[0202] The isolated placental cell populations provided herein can be combined with one or
more populations of non-stem cells or non-placental cells. For example, a population of
isolated placental cells can be combined with blood (e.g., placental blood or umbilical cord
blood), blood-derived stem cells (e.g., stem cells derived from placental blood or umbilical
cord blood), umbilical cord stem cells, populations of blood-derived nucleated cells, bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, bone-derived stem cell populations, crude bone marrow,
adult (somatic) stem cells, populations of stem cells contained within tissue, cultured stem
cells, populations of fully-differentiated cells (e.g., chondrocytes, fibroblasts, amniotic cells,
osteoblasts, muscle cells, cardiac cells, etc.) and the like. In a specific embodiment, a

population of cells useful for the treatment of disruption of blood flow in or around the brain
or CNS comprises isolated placental cells and isolated umbilical cord cells. Cells in an
isolated placental cell population can be combined with a plurality of cells of another type in
ratios of about 100,000,000:1, 50,000,000:1, 20,000,000:1, 10,000,000:1, 5,000,000:1,

population. Cells in an isolated placental cell population can be combined with a plurality of
cells of a plurality of cell types, as well.
[0203] In one embodiment, an isolated population of placental cells is combined with a
plurality of hematopoietic stem cells. Such hematopoietic stem cells can be, for example,
contained within unprocessed placental, umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood; in total
nucleated cells from placental blood, umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood; in an isolated
population of CD34* cells from placental blood, umbilical cord blood or.peripheral blood; in
unprocessed bone marrow; in total nucleated cells from bone marrow; in an isolated
population of CD34* cells from bone marrow, or the like.
         5.7     PRODUCTION OF A PLACENTAL CELL BANK
[02041 Isolated cells from postpartum placentas, e.g., the isolated placental cells described in
Section 5.4.2, above, can be cultured in a number of different ways to produce a set of lots,
e.g., wherein a lot is a set of individually-administrable doses, of isolated placental cells.
Such lots can, for example, be obtained from cells from placental perfusate or from cells from
enzyme-digested placental tissue. Sets of lots of placental cells, obtained from a plurality of
placentas, can be arranged in a bank of isolated placental cells for, e.g., long-term storage.
Generally, tissue culture plastic-adherent placental cells are obtained from an initial culture of
placental material to form a seed culture, which is expanded under controlled conditions to
form populations of cells from approximately equivalent numbers of doublings. Lots are
preferably derived from the tissue of a single placenta, but can be derived from the tissue of a
plurality of placentas.
[0205] In one embodiment, placental cell lots are obtained as follows. Placental tissue is first
disrupted, e.g., by mincing, digested with a suitable enzyme, e.g., trypsin or collagenase (see
Section 5.5.3, above). The placental tissue preferably comprises, e.g., the entire amnion,
                                                65

      WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
entire chorion, or both, from a single placenta, but can comprise only a part of either the
amnion or chorion. The digested tissue is cultured, e.g., for about 1-3 weeks, preferably
about 2 weeks. After removal of non-adherent cells, high-density colonies that form are
collected, e.g., by trypsinization. These cells are collected and resuspended in a convenient
volume of culture medium, and are then used to seed expansion cultures. Expansion cultures
can be any arrangement of separate cell culture apparatuses, e.g., a Cell Factory by NUNCTM.
Cells can be subdivided to any degree so as to seed expansion cultures with, e.g., 1 x 103, 2 x
10, 3 x 103, 4 x 103, 5 x 103, 6 x 103, 7 x 103 , 8 x 103,9 x 103 , 1 x 104 , 1 x 104, 2x 104 , 3 x
104,4 x 104 5 x 104, 6 x 104, 7 x 104, 8 x 104, 9 x 104 , or 10 x 104 cells/cm 2 . Preferably, from
about 1 x 103 to about 1 x 104 cells/cm 2 are used to seed each expansion culture. The number
of expansion cultures may be greater or fewer in number depending upon the particular
placenta(s) from which the cells are obtained.
[0206] Expansion cultures are grown until the density of cells in culture reaches a certain
value, e.g., about 1 x 105 cells/cm 2 . Cells can either be collected and cryopreserved at this
point, or passaged into new expansion cultures as described above. Cells can be passaged,
e.g., 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 times prior to use. A
record of the cumulative number of population doublings is preferably maintained during
expansion culture(s). The cells from a culture can be expanded for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 or 40 doublings, or up to 60 doublings.
Preferably, however, the number of population doublings, prior to dividing the population of
cells into individual doses, is from about 15 to about 30. The cells can be culture
continuously throughout the expansion process, or can be frozen at one or more points during
expansion.
[0207] Cells to be used for individual doses can be frozen, e.g., cryopreserved for later use.
Individual doses can comprise, e.g., about 1 million to about 50 million cells per ml, and can
comprise between about 106 and about 1010 cells in total.
[0208] In one embodiment, therefore, a placental cell bank can be made by a method
comprising: expanding primary culture placental cells from a human post-partum placenta for
a first plurality of population doublings; cryopreserving said placental cells to form a Master
Cell Bank; expanding a plurality of placental cells from the Master Cell Bank for a second
plurality of population doublings; cryopreserving said placental cells to form a Working Cell
Bank; expanding a plurality of placental cells from the Working Cell Bank for a third
plurality of population doublings; and cryopreserving said placental cells in individual doses,
wherein said individual doses collectively compose a placental cell bank. Optionally, a
                                                    66

      WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
plurality of placental cells from said third plurality of population doublings can be expanded
 for a fourth plurality of population doublings and cryopreserved in individual doses, wherein
 said individual doses collectively compose a placental stem cell bank.
 [0209] In another specific embodiment, said primary culture placental cells comprise
placental cells from placental perfusate. In another specific embodiment, said primary
culture placental cells comprise placental cells from digested placental tissue. In another
specific embodiment, said primary culture placental cells comprise placental cells from
placental perfusate and from digested placental tissue. In another specific embodiment, all of

         5.8     PRESERVATION OF PLACENTAL CELLS
[0211] Isolated placental cells, e.g., the isolated placental cells described in Section 5.4.2,
above, can be preserved, that is, placed under conditions that allow for long-term storage, or
conditions that inhibit cell death by, e.g., apoptosis or necrosis.
[0212] Placental cells can be preserved using, e.g., a composition comprising an apoptosis
inhibitor, necrosis inhibitor and/or an oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon, as described in
related U.S. Application Publication No. 2007/0190042, the disclosure of which is
                                                 67

     WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, a method of preserving a
population of cells, useful in the treatment of disruption of blood flow in or around the brain
or CNS, comprises contacting said population of cells with a cell collection composition
comprising an inhibitor of apoptosis and an oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon, wherein said
inhibitor of apoptosis is present in an amount and for a time sufficient to reduce or prevent
apoptosis in the population of cells, as compared to a population of cells not contacted with
the inhibitor of apoptosis. In a specific embodiment, said inhibitor of apoptosis is a caspase
inhibitor. In another specific embodiment, said inhibitor of apoptosis is a JNK inhibitor. In a
more specific embodiment, said JNK inhibitor does not modulate differentiation or
proliferation of said cells. In another embodiment, said cell collection composition comprises
said inhibitor of apoptosis and said oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon in separate phases. In
another embodiment, said cell collection composition comprises said inhibitor of apoptosis
and said oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon in an emulsion. In another embodiment, the cell
collection composition additionally comprises an emulsifier, e.g., lecithin. In another
embodiment, said apoptosis inhibitor and said perfluorocarbon are between about 0*C and
about 25*C at the time of contacting the cells. In another more specific embodiment, said
apoptosis inhibitor and said perfluorocarbon are between about 2*C and 10*C, or between
about 2"C and about 5"C, at the time of contacting the cells. In another more specific
embodiment, said contacting is performed during transport of said population of cells. In
another more specific embodiment, said contacting is performed during freezing and thawing
of said population of cells.
[0213] Populations of placental cells can be preserved, e.g., by a method comprising
contacting said population of cells with an inhibitor of apoptosis and an organ-preserving
compound, wherein said inhibitor of apoptosis is present in an amount and for a time
sufficient to reduce or prevent apoptosis in the population of cells, as compared to a
population of cells not contacted with the inhibitor of apoptosis. In a specific embodiment,
the organ-preserving compound is UW solution (described in U.S. Patent No. 4,798,824; also
known as ViaSpan; see also Southard et al., Transplantation49(2):251-257 (1990)) or a
solution described in Stem et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,552,267. In another embodiment, said
organ-preserving compound is hydroxyethyl starch, lactobionic acid, raffinose, or a
combination thereof. In another embodiment, the cell collection composition additionally
comprises an oxygen-carrying perfluorocarbon, either in two phases or as an emulsion.
[0214] In another embodiment of the method, placental cells are contacted with a cell
collection composition comprising an apoptosis inhibitor and oxygen-carrying
                                                68

     WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
perfluorocarbon, organ-preserving compound, or combination thereof, during perfusion. In
another embodiment, said cells are contacted during a process of tissue disruption, e.g.,
enzymatic digestion. In another embodiment, placental cells are contacted with said cell
collection compound after collection by perfusion, or after collection by tissue disruption,
e.g., enzymatic digestion.
[0215] Typically, during placental cell collection, enrichment and isolation, it is preferable to
minimize or eliminate cell stress due to hypoxia and mechanical stress. In another
embodiment of the method, therefore, a cell, or population of cells, is exposed to a hypoxic
condition during collection, enrichment or isolation for less than six hours during said
preservation, wherein a hypoxic condition is a concentration of oxygen that is less than
normal blood oxygen concentration. In a more specific embodiment, said population of cells
is exposed to said hypoxic condition for less than two hours during said preservation. In
another more specific embodiment, said population of cells is exposed to said hypoxic
condition for less than one hour, or less than thirty minutes, or is not exposed to a hypoxic
condition, during collection, enrichment or isolation. In another specific embodiment, said
population of cells is not exposed to shear stress during collection, enrichment or isolation.
[0216] Placental cells can be cryopreserved, e.g., in cryopreservation medium in small
containers, e.g., ampoules. Suitable cryopreservation medium includes, but is not limited to,
culture medium including, e.g., growth medium, or cell freezing medium, for example
commercially available cell freezing medium, e.g., C2695, C2639 or C6039 (Sigma).
Cryopreservation medium preferably comprises DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide), at a
concentration of about 2% to about 15% (v/v), e.g., about 10% (v/v). Cryopreservation
medium may comprise additional agents, for example, methylcellulose and/or glycerol.
Placental cells are preferably cooled at about 1*C/min during cryopreservation. A preferred
cryopreservation temperature is about -80*C to about -180*C, preferably about -125"C to
about -140*C. Cryopreserved cells can be transferred to liquid nitrogen prior to thawing for
use. In some embodiments, for example, once the ampoules have reached about -90 0 C, they
are transferred to a liquid nitrogen storage area. Cryopreservation can also be done using a
controlled-rate freezer. Cryopreserved cells preferably are thawed at a temperature of about
25 0C to about 40*C, preferably to a temperature of about 37"C.

[0240] The compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical compositions comprising the isolated
placental cells, described herein can comprise any of the isolated placental cells described
herein.
[0241] Other injectable formulations, suitable for the administration of cellular products, may
be used.
[0242] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises isolated placental
cells that are substantially, or completely, non-maternal in origin, that is, have the fetal
genotype; e.g., at least about 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or about 100% are non-maternal in origin.
For example, in one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition comprises a population of
isolated placental cells that are CD200* and HLA-G*; CD73*, CD 105*, and CD200*; CD200*
and OCT-4*; CD73*, CD105+ and HLA-G*; CD73* and CD105+ and facilitate the formation

wherein at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% of said isolated placental cells are non
maternal in origin. In a specific embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition additionally
comprises a stem cell that is not obtained from a placenta.
[0243] Isolated placental cells in the compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical compositions,
provided herein, can comprise placental cells derived from a single donor, or from multiple
donors. The isolated placental cells can be completely HLA-matched to an intended
recipient, or partially or completely HLA-mismatched.
                5.9.3    Matrices Comprising Isolated Placental Cells
102441 Further provided herein are compositions comprising matrices, hydrogels, scaffolds,
and the like that comprise a placental stem cell, or a population of isolated placental cells.
Such compositions can be used in the place of, or in addition to, cells in liquid suspension for
the treatment of disruption of blood flow in or around the brain or CNS.
[0245] The isolated placental cells described herein can be seeded onto a natural matrix, e.g.,
a placental biomaterial such as an amniotic membrane material. Such an amniotic membrane
material can be, e.g., amniotic membrane dissected directly from a mammalian placenta;
fixed or heat-treated amniotic membrane, substantially dry (i.e., <20% H2 0) amniotic
membrane, chorionic membrane, substantially dry chorionic membrane, substantially dry
amniotic and chorionic membrane, and the like. Preferred placental biomaterials on which
isolated placental cells can be seeded are described in Hariri, U.S. Application Publication
No. 2004/0048796, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

      WO 2010/021715                                                        PCT/US2009/004741
[0246] The isolated placental cells described herein can be suspended in a hydrogel solution
suitable for, e.g., injection. Suitable hydrogels for such compositions include self-assembling
peptides, such as RAD 16. In one embodiment, a hydrogel solution comprising the cells can
be allowed to harden, for instance in a mold, to form a matrix having cells dispersed therein
for implantation. Isolated placental cells in such a matrix can also be cultured so that the
cells are mitotically expanded prior to implantation. The hydrogel is, e.g., an organic
polymer (natural or synthetic) that is cross-linked via covalent, ionic, or hydrogen bonds to
create a three-dimensional open-lattice structure that entraps water molecules to form a gel.
Hydrogel-forming materials include polysaccharides such as alginate and salts thereof,
peptides, polyphosphazines, and polyacrylates, which are crosslinked ionically, or block
polymers such as polyethylene oxide-polypropylene glycol block copolymers which are
crosslinked by temperature or pH, respectively. In some embodiments, the hydrogel or
matrix is biodegradable.
[0247] In some embodiments, the formulation comprises an in situ polymerizable gel (see.,
e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication 2002/0022676, the disclosure of which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Anseth et al., J. Control Release, 78(1
3):199-209 (2002); Wang et al., Biomaterials,24(22):3969-80 (2003).
[0248] In some embodiments, the polymers are at least partially soluble in aqueous solutions,
such as water, buffered salt solutions, or aqueous alcohol solutions, that have charged side
groups, or a monovalent ionic salt thereof. Examples of polymers having acidic side groups
that can be reacted with cations are poly(phosphazenes), poly(acrylic acids), poly(methacrylic
acids), copolymers of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, poly(vinyl acetate), and sulfonated
polymers, such as sulfonated polystyrene. Copolymers having acidic side groups formed by
reaction of acrylic or methacrylic acid and vinyl ether monomers or polymers can also be
used. Examples of acidic groups are carboxylic acid groups, sulfonic acid groups,
halogenated (preferably fluorinated) alcohol groups, phenolic OH groups, and acidic OH
groups.
[0249] The isolated placental cells described herein or co-cultures thereof can be seeded onto
a three-dimensional framework or scaffold and implanted in vivo. Such a framework can be
implanted in combination with any one or more growth factors, cells, drugs or other
components that, e.g., stimulate tissue formation.
[0250] Examples of scaffolds that can be used include nonwoven mats, porous foams, or self
assembling peptides. Nonwoven mats can be formed using fibers comprised of a synthetic
absorbable copolymer of glycolic and lactic acids (e.g., PGA/PLA) (VICRYL, Ethicon, Inc.,
                                                80

      WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
 Somerville, N.J.). Foams, composed of, e.g., poly(6-caprolactone)/poly(glycolic acid)
 (PCL/PGA) copolymer, formed by processes such as freeze-drying, or lyophilization (see,
e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,355,699), can also be used as scaffolds.
 [0251] In another embodiment, isolated placental cells can be seeded onto, or contacted with,
a felt, which can be, e.g., composed of a multifilament yam made from a bioabsorbable
material such as PGA, PLA, PCL copolymers or blends, or hyaluronic acid.
 [0252] The isolated placental cells provided herein can, in another embodiment, be seeded
onto foam scaffolds that may be composite structures. Such foam scaffolds can be molded
into a useful shape, such as that of a portion of a specific structure in the body to be repaired,
replaced or augmented. In some embodiments, the framework is treated, e.g., with O.1M
acetic acid followed by incubation in polylysine, PBS, and/or collagen, prior to inoculation of
the cells in order to enhance cell attachment. External surfaces of a matrix may be modified
to improve the attachment or growth of cells and differentiation of tissue, such as by plasma
coating the matrix, or addition of one or more proteins (e.g., collagens, elastic fibers, reticular
fibers), glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans (e.g., heparin sulfate, chondroitin-4-sulfate,
chondroitin-6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratin sulfate, etc.), a cellular matrix, and/or other
materials such as, but not limited to, gelatin, alginates, agar, agarose, and plant gums, and the
like.
 [0253] In some embodiments, the scaffold comprises, or is treated with, materials that render
it non-thrombogenic. These treatments and materials may also promote and sustain
endothelial growth, migration, and extracellular matrix deposition. Examples of these
materials and treatments include but are not limited to natural materials such as basement
membrane proteins such as laminin and Type IV collagen, synthetic materials such as
EPTFE, and segmented polyurethaneurea silicones, such as PURSPANT M (The Polymer
Technology Group, Inc., Berkeley, Calif.). The scaffold can also comprise anti-thrombotic
agents such as heparin; the scaffolds can also be treated to alter the surface charge (e.g.,
coating with plasma) prior to seeding with isolated placental cells.
 [02541 In one embodiment, the isolated placental cells are seeded onto, or contacted with, a
suitable scaffold at about 0.5 x 106 to about 8 x 106 cells/mL.
         5.10   IMMORTALIZED PLACENTAL CELL LINES
[0255] Mammalian placental cells can be conditionally immortalized by transfection with
any suitable vector containing a growth-promoting gene, that is, a gene encoding a protein
that, under appropriate conditions, promotes growth of the transfected cell, such that the
                                                 81

     WO 2010/021715                                                           PCT/US2009/004741
production and/or activity of the growth-promoting protein is regulatable by an external
factor. In a preferred embodiment the growth-promoting gene is an oncogene such as, but
not limited to, v-myc, N-myc, c-myc, p53, SV40 large T antigen, polyoma large T antigen,
El a adenovirus or E7 protein of human papillomavirus.
[0256] External regulation of the growth-promoting protein can be achieved by placing the
growth-promoting gene under the control of an externally-regulatable promoter, e.g., a
promoter the activity of which can be controlled by, for example, modifying the temperature
of the transfected cells or the composition of the medium in contact with the cells. in one
embodiment, a tetracycline (tet)-controlled gene expression system can be employed (see
Gossen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 89:5547-5551, 1992; Hoshimaru et al., Proc. Natl.
A cad. Sci. USA 93:1518-1523, 1996). In the absence of tet, a tet-controlled transactivator
(tTA) within this vector strongly activates transcription from phcMv*-1, a minimal promoter
from human cytomegalovirus fused to tet operator sequences. tTA is a fusion protein of the
repressor (tetR) of the transposon- 10-derived tet resistance operon of Escherichiacoli and the
acidic domain of VP16 of herpes simplex virus. Low, non-toxic concentrations of tet (e.g.,
0.01-1.0 pg/mL) almost completely abolish transactivation by tTA.
[0257] In one embodiment, the vector further contains a gene encoding a selectable marker,
e.g., a protein that confers drug resistance. The bacterial neomycin resistance gene (neo R) is
one such marker that may be employed within the present methods. Cells carrying neoR may
be selected by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as the addition of, e.g.,
 100-200 pg/mL G418 to the growth medium.
[0258] Transfection can be achieved by any of a variety of means known to those of ordinary
skill in the art including, but not limited to, retroviral infection. In general, a cell culture may
be transfected by incubation with a mixture of conditioned medium collected from the
producer cell line for the vector and DMEM/F12 containing N2 supplements. For example, a
placental cell culture prepared as described above may be infected after, e.g., five days in
vitro by incubation for about 20 hours in one volume of conditioned medium and two
volumes of DMEM/F 12 containing N2 supplements. Transfected cells carrying a selectable
marker may then be selected as described above.
10259] Following transfection, cultures are passaged onto a surface that permits proliferation,
e.g., allows at least 30% of the cells to double in a 24 hour period. Preferably, the substrate is
a polyornithine/laminin substrate, consisting of tissue culture plastic coated with
polyornithine (10 pg/mL) and/or laminin (10 pg/mL), a polylysine/laminin substrate or a
surface treated with fibronectin. Cultures are then fed every 3-4 days with growth medium,
                                                  82

     WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
which may or may not be supplemented with one or more proliferation-enhancing factors.
Proliferation-enhancing factors may be added to the growth medium when cultures are less
than 50% confluent.
[0260] The conditionally-immortalized placental cell lines can be passaged using standard
techniques, such as by trypsinization, when 80-95% confluent. Up to approximately the
twentieth passage, it is, in some embodiments, beneficial to maintain selection (by, for
example, the addition of G418 for cells containing a neomycin resistance gene). Cells may
also be frozen in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.
[0261] Clonal cell lines can be isolated from a conditionally-immortalized human placental
cell line prepared as described above. In general, such clonal cell lines may be isolated using
standard techniques, such as by limit dilution or using cloning rings, and expanded. Clonal
cell lines may generally be fed and passaged as described above.
[0262] Conditionally-immortalized human placental cell lines, which may, but need not, be
clonal, may generally be induced to differentiate by suppressing the production and/or
activity of the growth-promoting protein under culture conditions that facilitate
differentiation. For example, if the gene encoding the growth-promoting protein is under the
control of an externally-regulatable promoter, the conditions, e.g., temperature or
composition of medium, may be modified to suppress transcription of the growth-promoting
gene. For the tetracycline-controlled gene expression system discussed above, differentiation
can be achieved by the addition of tetracycline to suppress transcription of the growth
promoting gene. In general, 1 pg/mL tetracycline for 4-5 days is sufficient to initiate
differentiation. To promote further differentiation, additional agents may be included in the
growth medium.
         5.11 KITS
[0263] In another aspect, provided herein are kits, suitable for the treatment of an individual
who has had a disruption of blood flow in or around the CNS, e.g., an individual who has had
a stroke, comprising, in a container separate from remaining kit contents, tissue culture
plastic adherent multipotent placental cells, e.g., placental stem cells or placental multipotent
cells, and isolated populations thereof, e.g., the cells described in Section 5.4.2, above, and
instructions for use. Preferably, the placental stem cells are provided in a pharmaceutically
acceptable solution, e.g., a solution suitable for intracranial administration or a solution
suitable for intravenous administration. In certain embodiments, the placental stem cells or

placental multipotent cells are any of the CD10*, CD34-, CD105* placental cells described
herein, e.g., CD1O*, CD34-, CD105*, CD200* placental cells.
 [0264] In certain embodiments, the kits comprise one or more components that facilitate
delivery of the placental cells to the individual. For example, in certain embodiments, the kit
comprises components that facilitate intracranial delivery of the placental cells to the
individual. In such embodiments, the kit can comprise, e.g., syringes and needles suitable for
delivery of cells to the individual; radioactive or non-radioactive compounds that enable
visualization of affected CNS tissue (e.g., cobalt 55), and the like. In such embodiments, the
placental cells may be contained in the kit in a bag, or in one or more vials. In certain other
embodiments, the kit comprises components that facilitate intravenous or intra-arterial
delivery of the placental cells to the individual. In such embodiments, the placental cells may
be contained, e.g., within a bottle or bag (for example, a blood bag or similar bag able to
contain up to about 1.5 L solution comprising the cells), and the kit additionally comprises
tubing and needles suitable for the delivery of cells to the individual.
[02651 Additionally, the kit may comprise one or more compounds that reduce pain or
inflammation in the individual (e.g., an analgesic, steroidal or non-steroidal anti
inflammatory compound, or the like. The kit may also comprise an antibacterial or antiviral
compound (e.g., one or more antibiotics), a compound to reduce anxiety in the individual
(e.g., alaprazolam), a compound that reduces an immune response in the individual (e.g.,
cyclosporine A), an antihistamine (diphenhydramine, loratadine, desloratadine, quetiapine,
fexofenadine, cetirizine, promethazine, chlorepheniramine, levocetirizine, cimetidine,
famotidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, roxatidine, lafutidine, or the like).
[0266] Additionally, the kit can comprise disposables, e.g., sterile wipes, disposable paper
goods, gloves, or the like, which facilitate preparation of the individual for delivery, or which
reduce the likelihood of infection in the individual as a result of the administration of the
placental cells.

                 PLACENTAL CELLS ADMINISTERED INTRACRANIALLY
[0267] This Example demonstrates the efficacy of administration of isolated placental cells,
administered, in the treatment of symptoms associated with disruption of blood flow in or
around the brain or CNS.

[0268] CD34-, CD 10*, CD 105*, CD200* tissue culture plastic-adherent placental cells were
obtained by enzymatic digestion using collagenase I at about 1 to about 2 mg/ml for, e.g., 30
minutes, followed by digestion with trypsin at a concentration of about 0.25%, for 10 minutes
at 37"C. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as a stroke model. Rats are an established model
animal in which to study the effects of stroke and the effects of various therapies on stroke
symptoms. See, e.g., Chen et al., "A Model of Focal Ischemic Stroke in the Rat:
Reproducible Extensive Cortical Infarction," Stroke 17(4):738-743 (1986). 10 animals were
used per condition.
[0269] MCA Stroke Surgery: All surgical procedures were conducted under aseptic
conditions. Animals were anesthetized with equithesin (300 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and
checked for pain reflexes. The MCA occlusion surgery was performed on the animals under
deep anesthesia. The MCA suture technique involves insertion of a filament through the
carotid artery to reach the junction of the MCA, thus blocking the blood flow from the
common carotid artery, as well as from the circle of Willis. The right common carotid artery
was identified and isolated through a ventral midline cervical incision. The suture size was 4
0, made of sterile, non-absorbable suture (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ), with the diameter of
the suture tip tapered to 24 to 26-gauge size using a rubber cement. About 15 to 17 mm of
the filament was inserted from the junction of the external and internal carotid arteries to
block the MCA. The right MCA was occluded for one hour. Based on published studies, a
one-hour occlusion of the MCA results in maximal infarction. See Borlongan et al.,
Neurorep. 9(16):3615-3621 (1998); Borlongan et al., Pharmacol.Biochem. Behav.
52(1):225-229 (1995); Borlongan et al., Physiol. Behav. 58(5):909-917 (1995). A heating
pad and a rectal thermometer were used to maintain body temperature within normal limits.
To determine succesful occlusion and reperfusion, a laser Doppler was used. The laser
Doppler probe was placed at the distal end of the MCA to measure cerebral blood flow
before, during and after occlusion.
[0270] The adherent placental cells were administered by intracranial injection
(approximately 400,000 cells in 5 microliters) directly to the ischemic site at 2 days post
ischemia. Rats were administered vehicle (10% dextran and 5% human serum albumin)
alone, 4 x 105 viable cells, 4 x 105 viable cells in conjunction with 10 mg/kg cyclosporine A,
or 4 x 105 nonviable cells and cyclosporine A.
[0271] On days 7 and 14 post-ischemia, the animals were assayed for stroke induced motor
asymmetry. Motor asymmetry was assessed using the Elevated Body Swing Test (EBST) or
Bederson Test. See Borlongan & Sanberg, J. Neurosci 15(7):5372-5378 (1995). In the
                                                 85

      WO 2010/021715                                                        PCT/US2009/004741
EBST, the animal was elevated by handling its tail, and the frequency and direction of the
swing behavior was recorded. Rats were placed into a Plexiglass box and allowed to
habituate for about 2 minutes. Rats were held at approximately 1 inch from the base of the
tail, such that the rats' nose was approximately 1 inch from a surface. The rats were held to a
vertical axis, or neutral position, defined as no more than 10* swing of the head to the right or
left. A swing was recorded whenever the rat moved its head out of the vertical axis to the
right or left; right swings or left swings were counted when the head of the animal moved 100
or more from the vertical axis right or left, respectively. Where the rat redoubled its efforts to
a particular side, only a single swing was recorded. After a single swing, the animal was
placed back in the Plexiglass box and allowed to move freely for 30 seconds prior to
retesting. These steps were repeated 20 times for each animal (10 animals per condition).
[0272] The total number of swings was counted, as was the number of right and left swings.
Swing behavior was deemed to be biased when the number of swings equaled or exceeded
70%. Results were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post hoc
tests were carried out using the Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) test.
[0273] Placental cell-induced repair of neurological deficits in rats was also assessed using
the Bederson Neurological Test, which measures sensorimotor tasks. See Bederson et al.,
Stroke 17:472-6 (1986); Altumbabic, Stroke 29:1917-22 (1998).
[0274] For the Bederson Test, a neurologic score for each rat was obtained using 4 tests that
include: (a) observation of spontaneous ipsilateral circling, graded from 0 (no circling) to 3
(continuous circling); (b) contralateral hindlimb retraction, which measures the ability of the
animal to replace the hindlimb after it is displaced laterally by 2 to 3 cm, graded from 0
(immediate replacement) to 3 (replacement after minutes or no replacement); (c) beam
walking ability, graded 0 for a rat that readily traverses a 2.4-cm- wide, 80-cm-long beam to
3 for a rat unable to stay on the beam for 10 seconds; and (d) bilateral forepaw grasp, which
measures the ability to hold onto a 2-mm- diameter steel rod, graded 0 for a rat with normal
forepaw grasping behavior to 3 for a rat unable to grasp with the forepaws. The scores from
all 4 tests, performed over a period of about 15 minutes on assessment days 7 and 14, were
added to give a neurologic deficit score from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating more
neurologically normal rats.
Results
[0275] At Day 0, immediately prior to induction of ischemia, all animals displayed
approximately normal (unbiased) swing behavior (FIG. 1, Baseline). At day 2 post-ischemia,
the day of placental cell administration, all animals displayed nearly 100% ischemia-induced
                                                 86

     WO 2010/021715                                                        PCT/US2009/004741
bias in swing behavior (FIG. 1), as expected. At Day 7 and Day 14, animals receiving viable
placental cells showed significant improvement, demonstrating approximately 65% and 60%
swing bias, respectively (FIG. 1, Day 7 and Day 14). Animals receiving nonviable placental
cells and cyclosporine A, or vehicle alone, showed no statistically significant improvement.
[0276] Rats evaluated at Day 0, prior to induction of ischemia, were all neurologically
normal, and were given a deficit score of zero (FIG. 2, Baseline) in the Bederson test. At day
two after induction of ischemia, the day isolated placental cells were administered, rats
receiving only vehicle showed an aggregate mean deficit score of approximately 2.5 (FIG. 2,
Day 2). By Days 7 and 14, rats receiving placental cells showed statistically significant
improvement in the neurological deficit score, improving from a score of approximately 2.5
to a score of about 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. As with the EBST, rats receiving only vehicle
or nonviable placental cells and cyclosporine A showed no statistically significant
improvement in the neurologic deficit score.
[0277] In conclusion, it was demonstrated by two tests of neurological deficit that
administration of 4 x 105 human placental cells at two days after the induction of ischemia in
an accepted animal model of ischemia significantly improves neurological function in the
model animals. Administration of cyclosporine A, to suppress any host immune reaction to
the placental cells, did not appear to be necessary for neurological improvement due to the
placental cells.
        6.2      EXAMPLE 2: TREATMENT OF STROKE USING ISOLATED
                 PLACENTAL CELLS ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY
[0278] This Example demonstrates the efficacy of administration of isolated placental cells,
administered intravenously, in the treatment of symptoms associated with disruption of blood
flow in or around the brain or CNS, e.g., of hypoxic injury or anoxic injury. For example, the
results presented herein indicate that intravenous administration of placental cells promotes
dose-dependent behavioral recovery in both motor and neurologic tests in animals
administered viable human placental cells compared to animals receiving non-viable human
placental cells.
[0279] Isolated CD34-, CD10*, CD105+, CD200* tissue culture plastic-adherent placental
cells were obtained by enzymatic digestion, as described elsewhere herein. Sprague-Dawley
rats were used as a stroke model, and middle artery occlusion was performed as described in
Example 1, above. On Day 2 post-occlusion, the subject rats were administered 4 x 105, 1 x
106, 4 x 106, or 8 x 106 placental cells in approximately 5 gL vehicle (10% dextran and 5%
                                                87

     WO 2010/021715                                                          PCT/US2009/004741
 human serum albumin), or nonviable cells in vehicle as a control. Rats were evaluated at day
 0 prior to surgery, and at days 2, 14, 28, 56 and 84 post-surgery by the Elevated Body Swing
Test (EBST), as described in Example 1, above. A modified Bederson Test was performed,
 in which the subject rats were evaluated for (1) forelimb retraction, which measured the
ability of the animal to replace the forelimb after it was displaced laterally by 2 to 3 cm,
graded from 0 (immediate replacement) to 3 (replacement after several seconds or no
replacement); (2) beam walking ability, graded 0 for a rat that readily traversed a 2.4-cm
wide, 80-cm-long beam to 3 for a rat unable to stay on the beam for 10 seconds; and (3)
bilateral forepaw grasp, which measured the ability to hold onto a 2-mm-diameter steel rod,
graded 0 for a rat with normal forepaw grasping behavior to 3 for a rat unable to grasp with
the forepaws. The scores from all 3 tests, which were done over a period of about 15
minutes on each assessment day, were added to give a mean neurologic deficit score
(maximum possible score, 9 points divided by 3 tests = 3). Results of the EBST and
Bederson tests were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) Tukey HSD test as
described in Example 1, above.
 [0280] Rats were killed on Day 84 for necropsy and evaluation of engraftment and
differentiation of the placental cells. Briefly, 20 pm cryostat sectioned tissues were examined
at 40X magnification and digitized using a PC-based Image Tools computer program. Brain
sections were blind-coded. Tissues sections were processed using standard ABC method. Cell
engraftment and differentiation indices for human placenta-derived stem cell graft survival
were assessed using the human specific antibody HuNu, which does not cross react with
rodent cell surface markers or other rodent proteins. To detect expression of neuronal
phenotype in cell grafts, immunohistochemical analysis using the neuronal marker MAP2
was used. Additional brain sections were processed for GFAP and 04 to reveal glial and
oligodendroglial phenotypic expression of transplanted cells.
[0281] Intravenous transplantation of human placenta-derived cells did not require
immunosuppression.
[0282] All animals included in this study displayed normal behaviors at baseline, and reached
the criteria of successful cerebral ischemia induction at day 2 post-stroke prior to
transplantation. Starting at the earliest time point of post-transplantation testing at post
stroke day 7, behavioral tests revealed a dose-dependent significant improvement in both
locomotor and neurological functions in stroke animals that received viable human placenta
derived cells compared to stroke animals that received non-viable human placenta-derived
cells. Over time up to 84 days post-stroke, there was an increasing trend in further
                                                 88

      WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
improvement in both tasks in stroke animals that received viable human placenta-derived
cells. There was no detectable exacerbation of stroke-induced behavioral deficits in any of
the transplanted animals, including those that received non-viable cells. During the transplant
maturation period, there was a general trend of spontaneous behavioral recovery in those that
received non-viable cells, but this non-specific, non-transplant-mediated functional
improvement did not reach statistical significance compared to pre-transplantation surgery
(i.e., day 2 post-stroke).
 [0283] Stroke animals that received the high dose of 8 million viable cells clearly exhibited
the most robust improvement in both locomotor and neurological task as the early post
transplantation period. However, over time the stroke animals that received lower doses of
viable cells also displayed profound attenuation of behavioral deficits which are generally
comparable with the high dose of 8 million viable cells.
[0284] Rats evaluated at Day 0, prior to induction of ischemia, were all neurologically
normal, and were given a deficit score of zero (FIG. 3, Baseline). At day 2 post-ischemia, the
day of placental stem cell administration, all animals displayed nearly 100% ischemia
induced bias in swing behavior (FIG. 3), as expected. Animals receiving viable isolated
placental cells showed significant, dose-dependent improvement in the EBST for each of
Days 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84, as compared to control, and additionally showed significant
improvement (p < 0.01) between doses, with the exception of 4 x 106 vs. 8 x 106 isolated
placental cells for all days, and 4 x 105 x 1x 106 isolated placental cells at Day 7 (p =
0.0454). See FIG. 3. Animals receiving nonviable isolated placental cells showed no
statistically significant improvement compared to controls.
[0285] For the Bederson test, rats evaluated at Day 0, prior to induction of ischemia, were all
neurologically normal, and were given a deficit score of zero (FIG. 4, Baseline). At day two
after induction of ischemia, the day the isolated placental cells were administered, rats
receiving only non-viable cells showed an aggregate mean deficit score of approximately 2.5
- 3.0 (FIG. 2, Day 2). At Days 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84, rats receiving the isolated placental cells
showed statistically significant improvement in the neurological deficit score compared to
rats receiving nonviable cells (p < 0.01 in each case). Improvement was additionally
significantly (p < 0.01) dose-dependent at Day 7 (4 x 105 vs. 8 x 106 and 1 x 106 vs. 8 x 106),
and Days 14 and 28 (4 x 105 vs. 4 x 106 and 4 x 105 vs. 8 x 106), respectively. As with the
EBST, rats receiving only vehicle or nonviable isolated placental cells and cyclosporine A
showed no statistically significant improvement in the neurologic deficit score.
                                                89

     WO 2010/021715                                                         PCT/US2009/004741
[0286] Thus, intravenous administration of isolated placental cells promotes dose-dependent
behavioral recovery in both motor and neurological tests. Functional improvement was
evident as early as 7 days post-administration, with an increasing trend of better recovery
over the 3 month post-transplant period. No overt adverse behavioral side effects were
observed in any of the subject rats.
[02871 Thus, the results presented herein demonstrate the safety and efficacy of intravenous
administration of isolated placental cells for treatment of symptoms associated with
disruptions of blood flow in or around the brain. For example, none of the transplanted
animals show any exacerbation of stroke-induced behavioral abnormalities. Compared to
animals receiving non-viable human placenta-derived cells, those that received viable cells
displayed significant improvement in stroke-induced behavioral deficits and significant
rescue of host cells in the ischemic penumbra. Moreover, no tumors or ectopic tissue
formation were detected in any of the transplanted animals.

                VIA INTRAVENOUS ROUTE - ASSESSMENT BY OTHER
                NEUROLOGICAL TESTS
[0288] This Example demonstrates the effectiveness of treating stroke using placental stem
cells, as assessed by neurological tests other than the elevated swing test and Bederson test.
                6.3.1   Neurological Tests
[0289] Middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery was performed on Wistar rats as follows.
Male Wistar rats (270-300g, 2-3 m) were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) induced by advancing a surgical nylon filament into the internal carotid artery (ICA)
to block the origin of MCA. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in a jar for
pre anesthetic, and spontaneously respired with 1.5% isoflurane in 2:1 N 2 0:0 2 mixture using
a facemask connected and regulated with a modified FLUOTEC 3 Vaporizer (Fraser Harlake,
Orchard Park, New York). Rectal temperature was maintained at 37"C throughout the
surgical procedure using a feedback regulated water heating system (a recirculating pad and
K module and monitored via an intrarectal type T thermocouple). A 1 cm incision was made
at the center of the neck, and the right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery
(ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed under an operating microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The CCA and ICA were temporarily clamped using
microsurgical clips (Codman & Shurtleff, Inc., Randolf, MA). A 4-0 nylon suture with its tip
rounded by heating near a flame was inserted into the ECA through a small puncture. The
                                                90

     WO 2010/021715                                                            PCT/US2009/004741
microsurgical clips were removed. The length of nylon suture, determined according to the
animal's weight, was gently advanced from the ECA into the lumen of the ICA until the
suture blocked the origin of the MCA. The nylon filament was retained inside the ICA for 2
hours (h) and the neck incision was closed. The animals were moved to their cage to awake.
After 2 h of MCAo, animals were reanesthetized with isoflurane, and restoration of blood
flow was performed by withdrawal of the filament until the tip cleared the lumen of the ECA.
The incision was then closed.
[02901 Adherent CD 10*, CD34-, CD 105*, CD200* tissue culture plastic-adherent placental
cells were administered by intravenous route (tail vein injection). Animals subjected to
MCAo were randomized into one of five groups: (1) human dermal fibroblast as cell control,
(2) dextran control, placental cell dose of (3) 1 x 106, (4) 4 x 106 and (5) 8 x 106 cells,
administered at day 1 after MCAo. Behavior tests (adhesive test, foot-fault test and mNSS)
were performed at day 1 after MCAo before the study treatment (baseline), and at days 7, 14,
21, 28, 42, and 56 after MCAo. The dose-response effects of placental cells on the functional
recovery were measured from the three behavior tests described below.
[02911 Modified neurological severity score (mNSS Table 1): is graded on a scale of 0 to 18
(normal score 0; maximal deficit score 18, Table 1). One score point is awarded for the
inability to perform the test or for the lack of a tested reflex; thus, the higher score, the more
severe is the injury.

[02921 Adhesive-removal somatosensory test: All rats were familiarized with the testing
environment. In an initial test, two small pieces of adhesive-backed paper dots (of equal size,
113.1 mm2 for test within one month; 56.6 mm 2 for test after one month) were used as
bilateral tactile stimuli occupying the distal-radial region on the wrist of each forelimb. The
rats were then returned to their cages. The time to remove each stimulus from forelimbs was
recorded for 5 trials per day.
[02931 Foot-fault test: Animals were placed on an elevated grid floor (45 cm by 30 cm), 2.5
cm higher than a solid base floor, with 2.5 cm X 2.5 cm diameter openings. Animals tend to
move on the grid with their paws placed on the wire frame. When animals inaccurately place
a paw, the front limb falls through one of the openings in the grid. When a paw fell or
slipped between wires, this was recorded as a foot fault. Total 100 of steps (movement of
each forelimb) were counted, and the total number of foot faults for left forelimb was
recorded, and the percentage of foot fault of left paw to total steps was determined.

 [0297] Based on the above studies, it was determined that treatment of stroke dose
dependently improves functional outcome after stroke in rats compared to fibroblast-control
and dextran control. The optimal dose of placental stem cell treatment in the rats used in this
study was determined to be 4 x 106.
                6.3.2   Proliferation and Synaptic Plasticity Studies
10298] To assess whether administration of placental stem cells facilitated
neovascularization, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg in 0.007 N NaOH
physiological saline, Sigma, St, Louis MO)) was injected into experimental animals starting
24h after MCAo and daily for 14 days. Experimental animals were sacrificed and brain
tissue sections of the occluded area were obtained and stained with BrdU. Experimental
animals were reanesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg i.p. injection)
and the depth of anesthesia was monitored by paw pinch reflex. After anesthesia, 2 mL blood
was withdrawn from the heart. The serum was prepared and stored at -20*C. Then the
animals were subjected to cardiac puncture with saline (about 200 ml for rats) perfusion and
then 4% paraformaldehyde (about 50 ml for rats) perfusion using Simon Varistaltic Pump.
[0299] The brain was cut down and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48h-72h, followed by
embedding in paraffin for immunostaining. Using a rat brain matrix (Activational Systems
Inc., Warren, MI), each forebrain was cut into 2 mm thick coronal blocks for a total 7 blocks
per animal. Brain sections obtained from the optimal dose (4 x 106 cells) of placental stem
cell treatment, Dextran MCAo control and FBC control groups were used for
immunostaining. A standard paraffin block was obtained from the center of the lesion
(bregma -1 mm to +1 mm). A series of 6 pm thick sections were cut from the block. Three
coronal brain sections were used for each immunohistochemical staining. Antibody against
BrdU, a proliferating cell marker (1:100, Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), Von

synaptophysin (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica, Monoclonal antibody, clone SY 38, 1:40)
immunostaining were performed. BrdU immunostained sections were digitized using a 40X
objective (Olympus BX40) via an MCID computer imaging analysis system (Imaging
Research, St. Catharines, Canada). BrdU positive cells within a total of 10 enlarged and thin
walled vessels located in the boundary area of the ischemic lesion were counted in each
section.
[03001 For semi-quantification of synaptophysin immunoreactivity, the immunostained
coronal section and eight fields of view from the ischemic penumbra (cortex and striatum) in
each section were digitized under a 20x objective. The positive area was measured. Data was
presented as percentage of positive area.
Results:
[0301] Administration of 4 x 106 placental stem cells was found to significantly increase
angiogenesis as measured by increasing endothelial cell proliferation and vascular density in
the ischemic brain compared to FBC-control and Dextran control (Figure 8). Moreover,
administration of 4 x 106 placental stem cells significantly increases synaptic plasticity as
measured by increased synaptophysin expression in the ischemic brain compared to FBC
control.
