SYSTEMS, METHODS, AND APPARATUS FOR AGRICULTURAL
IMPLEMENT TRENCH DEPTH CONTROL AND SOIL MONITORING
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] The present application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
2014236244, filed 14 March 2014 which is herein incorporated by reference in entirety.
BACKGROUND
[0001a] In recent years, the availability of advanced location-specific agricultural application
and measurement systems (used in so-called "precision farming" practices) has increased grower
interest in determining spatial variations in soil properties and in varying input application
variables (e.g., planting depth) in light of such variations. However, the available mechanisms
for measuring properties such as temperature are either not effectively locally made throughout
the field or are not made at the same time as an input (e.g. planting) operation. Moreover,
available methods for adjusting depth are not effectively responsive to changes in soil properties
such as depth and temperature.
[0002] Thus there is a need in the art for a method for monitoring soil properties during an
agricultural input application. Moreover, there is a need in the art for adjusting depth based on
the monitored soil properties.
SUMMARY
[0002a] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome, or at least ameliorate,
at least one disadvantage of present arrangements.
[0002b] One aspect of the present disclosure provides a monitoring system for an agricultural
implement having a plurality of row units comprising: a soil reflectivity sensor comprising light
emitting diodes and disposed in an implement associated with at least one row unit and
configured to resiliently engage a bottom of a trench opened by said at least one row unit to
measure light reflected from a soil surface within said trench; and a processor in electrical
communication with said soil reflectivity sensor.

Depth Control and Soil Monitoring System
[0032] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or
corresponding parts throughout the several views, FIG. 1 illustrates a tractor 5 drawing an
agricultural implement, e.g., a planter 10, comprising a toolbar 14 operatively supporting
multiple row units 200. An implement monitor 50 preferably including a central processing
unit ("CPU"), memory and graphical user interface ("GUI") (e.g., a touch-screen interface) is
preferably located in the cab of the tractor 10. A global positioning system ("GPS") receiver
52 is preferably mounted to the tractor 10.
[0033] Turing to FIG. 2, an embodiment is illustrated in which the row unit 200 is a planter
row unit. The row unit 200 is preferably pivotally connected to the toolbar 14 by a parallel
linkage 216. An actuator 218 is preferably disposed to apply lift and/or downforce on the

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
row unit 200. A solenoid valve 390 is preferably in fluid communication with the actuator
218 for modifying the lift and/or downforce applied by the actuator. An opening system 234
preferably includes two opening discs 244 rollingly mounted to a downwardly-extending
shank 254 and disposed to open a v-shaped trench 38 in the soil 40. A pair of gauge wheels
248 is pivotally supported by a pair of corresponding gauge wheel arms 260; the height of the
gauge wheels 248 relative to the opener discs 244 sets the depth of the trench 38. A depth
adjustment rocker 268 limits the upward travel of the gauge wheel arms 260 and thus the
upward travel of the gauge wheels 248. A depth adjustment actuator 380 is preferably
configured to modify a position of the depth adjustment rocker 268 and thus the height of the
gauge wheels 248. The actuator 380 is preferably a linear actuator mounted to the row unit
200 and pivotally coupled to an upper end of the rocker 268. In some embodiments the depth
adjustment actuator 380 comprises a device such as that disclosed in International Patent
Application No. PCT/US2012/035585, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein
by reference. An encoder 382 is preferably configured to generate a signal related to the
linear extension of the actuator 380; it should be appreciated that the linear extension of the
actuator 380 is related to the depth of the trench 38 when the gauge wheel arms 260 are in
contact with the rocker 268. A downforce sensor 392 is preferably configured to generate a
signal related to the amount of force imposed by the gauge wheels 248 on the soil 40; in some
embodiments the downforce sensor 392 comprises an instrumented pin about which the
rocker 268 is pivotally coupled to the row unit 200, such as those instrumented pins disclosed
in Applicant's co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 12/522,253 (Pub. No. US
2010/0180695), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
[0034] Continuing to refer to FIG. 2, a seed meter 230 such as that disclosed in Applicant's
co-pending International Patent Application No. PCT/US2012/030192, the disclosure of
which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, is preferably disposed to deposit seeds 42
from a hopper 226 into the trench 38, e.g., through a seed tube 232 disposed to guide the
seeds toward the trench. In some embodiments, the meter is powered by an electric drive 315
configured to drive a seed disc within the seed meter. In other embodiments, the drive 315
may comprise a hydraulic drive configured to drive the seed disc. A seed sensor 305 (e.g., an
optical or electromagnetic seed sensor configured to generate a signal indicating passage of a
seed) is preferably mounted to the seed tube 232 and disposed to send light or
electromagnetic waves across the path of seeds 42. A closing system 236 including one or
more closing wheels is pivotally coupled to the row unit 200 and configured to close the
                                                 A

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
trench 38.
[0035]   Turning to FIG. 3, a depth control and soil monitoring system 300 is schematically
illustrated. The monitor 50 is preferably in electrical communication with components
associated with each row unit 200 including the drives 315, the seed sensors 305, the GPS
receiver 52, the downforce sensors 392, the valves 390, the depth adjustment actuator 380,
the depth actuator encoders 382 (and in some embodiments an actual depth sensor 385
described later herein), and the solenoid valves 390. In some embodiments, particularly those
in which each seed meter 230 is not driven by an individual drive 315, the monitor 50 is also
preferably in electrical communication with clutches 310 configured to selectively operably
couple the seed meter 230 to the drive 315.
[0036] Continuing to refer to FIG. 3, the monitor 50 is preferably in electrical
communication with a cellular modem 330 or other component configured to place the
monitor 50 in data communication with the Internet, indicated by reference numeral 335. Via
the Internet connection, the monitor 50 preferably receives data from a weather data server
340 and a soil data server 345.
[0037] Continuing to refer to FIG. 3, the monitor 50 is also preferably in electrical
communication with one or more temperature sensors 360 mounted to the planter 10 and
configured to generate a signal related to the temperature of soil being worked by the planter
row units 200. In some embodiments one or more of the temperature sensors 360 comprise
thermocouples disposed to engage the soil; in such embodiments the temperature sensors 360
preferably engage the soil at the bottom of the trench 38. One such embodiment is illustrated
in FIG. 4A, in which a seed firmer 410 is illustrated mounted to the shank 254 by a bracket
415. As is known in the art, the seed firmer is preferably designed to resiliently engage the
bottom of the trench 38 in order to press seeds 42 into the soil before the trench is closed. In
the embodiment of FIG. 4A, the thermocouple is housed partially inside the firmer 410 and
extends slightly from a bottom surface of the firmer in order to engage the soil such that the
temperature sensor 360 generates a signal related to the temperature of the soil at the bottom
of the trench 38. As illustrated in the rear elevation view of FIG. 4B, the temperature sensor
360 preferably extends from the firmer 410 at a transverse distance from the centerline of the
firmer such that the temperature sensor does not contact seeds 42 passing beneath the bottom
surface of the firmer. In another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4C, the thermocouple is in
contact with a soil-contacting component, e.g., a hollow copper tube 420 housed partially

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
within the firmer 410 and extending therefrom to contact the soil near the bottom of the
trench 38. In the illustrated embodiment, the tube 420 contacts the soil on both sides of the
trench 38 such that the signal generated by the thermocouple is related to the temperature of
the soil at the points of contact between the tube 420 and the soil. In other embodiments, one
or more of the temperature sensors 360 may comprise a sensor disposed and configured to
measure the temperature of the soil without contacting the soil as disclosed in International
Patent Application No. PCT/US2012/035563, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated
herein in its entirety by reference.
[0038]   Referring to FIG. 3, the monitor 50 is preferably in electrical communication with one
or more moisture sensors 350 mounted to the planter 10 and configured to generate a signal
related to the temperature of soil being worked by the planter row units 200. In some
embodiments one or more of the moisture sensors 350 comprise moisture probes (e.g.,
sensors configured to measure the electrical conductivity or dielectric permittivity) disposed
to engage the soil; in such embodiments the temperature sensors 360 preferably engage the
soil at the bottom of the trench 38. One such embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 4A, in which
the moisture sensor 350 is housed partially inside the firmer 410 and extends slightly from a
bottom surface of the firmer in order to engage the soil such that the moisture sensor 350
generates a signal related to the temperature of the soil at the bottom of the trench 38. As
illustrated in the rear elevation view of FIG. 4B, the moisture sensor 350 preferably extends
from the bottom of the firmer 410 at a transverse distance from the centerline of the firmer
such that the moisture sensor does not contact seeds 42 passing beneath the bottom surface of
the firmer. In another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 10, the moisture sensor 350 includes
two co-planar capacitor plates 1020a and 1020b housed within the firmer 410 which pass
adjacent to the bottom of the trench without displacing soil at the bottom of the trench. In
some embodiments, the firmer 410 includes a region 1030 disposed above the capacitor
plates 1020, the region 1030 having a low permittivity (e.g., in embodiments in which the
region 1030 comprises an air cavity or a material having a low permittivity) or a high
permittivity (e.g., in embodiments in which the region 1030 contains a material having high
permittivity). In other embodiments, one or more of the moisture sensors 350 may comprise
a sensor disposed and configured to measure the moisture content of the soil without
contacting the soil, e.g., one or more infrared or near-infra-red sensors disposed to measure
electromagnetic waves generated by one or more emitters (e.g., light-emitting diodes) and
reflected from the soil surface (e.g., the bottom of the trench 38).

   WO 2014/153157                                                             PCT/US2014/029352
[0039] Referring to FIG. 3, the monitor 50 is preferably in electrical communication with a
mobile receiver 54 (e.g., a wireless data receiver) configured to receive data wirelessly (e.g.,
via a radio transmitter) from a base station 325 located in a field of interest. Turning to FIG.
24, the base station 325 preferably includes one or more temperature probes 2420, 2422
disposed at multiple depths in the soil in order to measure soil temperature at multiple depths.
The base station 325 preferably includes one or more moisture probes 2430, 2432 disposed at
multiple depths in the soil 40 in order to measure soil moisture at multiple depths. Each soil
and moisture probe is preferably in electrical communication with a processor 2405. The
processor 2405 is preferably in communication with a wireless transmitter 2415. The
processor 2405 is preferably configured to convert signals to a format suitable for
transmission via the wireless transmitter 2415 and to transmit the resulting formatted signals
via the wireless transmitter. The base station 325 preferably includes a digital rain gauge
2410 (e.g., an optical, acoustic or weighing-type gauge) and a digital air temperature sensor
2412, both of which are preferably in electrical communication with the processor 2405.
[0040] In some embodiments, a temperature and/or moisture measurement may be made by a
measurement unit independent of the row units 200. An embodiment of a measurement unit
2500 is illustrated in FIG. 25. The measurement unit 2500 preferably includes a coulter 2530
disposed to open a trench 39 in the soil 40; in some embodiments the measurement unit
instead includes two angled opening discs disposed to open a more v-shaped trench). The
coulter 2530 is preferably rollingly mounted to a bracket 2540. The bracket 2540 preferably
has sufficient weight to urge the coulter 2530 into the soil. A gauge wheel 2520 (or pair of
gauge wheels) is preferably rollingly mounted to the bracket 2540 and disposed to ride along
the surface of the soil, thus limiting the depth of the trench 39. The depth of the trench 39 is
preferably set to a depth of interest; e.g., a default trench depth such as 1.75 inches. In some
embodiments, the measuring unit 2500 incorporates a depth adjustment actuator in electrical
communication with the monitor 50 and configured to modify the vertical distance between
the mounting points of the coulter 2530 and the gauge wheel 2520 in order to adjust the
trench depth. The bracket 2540 is preferably mounted to the toolbar 14 via a parallel arm
arrangement 2526 such that the bracket is permitted to translate vertically with respect to the
toolbar. A spring 2518 is preferably mounted to the parallel arm arrangement in order to urge
the coulter 2530 into the soil 40. A temperature and/or moisture sensor 2550 is preferably
mounted to the measurement unit 2500 (or in some embodiments the toolbar 14) and
configured to measure temperature and/or moisture of soil in the trench 39. As in the
                                                  7

    WO 2014/153157                                                            PCT/US2014/029352
illustrated embodiment, the sensor 2550 may comprise a sensor configured to measure
temperature and/or moisture without contacting the soil such as an infrared sensor. In other
embodiments, the sensor 2550 may incorporate sensors configured to engage the soil at the
bottom of the trench 39 similar to those described herein, e.g., with respect to FIG. 4A.
Depth Adjustment Methods
[0041] Various methods disclosed herein in the section titled "Depth Control Methods"
determine desired depths and/or desired depth adjustments. The actual adjustment of depth to
the desired depth may be accomplished according to one of several methods as described in
this section.
[0042] In a first method, the system 300 sends a command signal to the depth adjustment
actuator 380 which corresponds to a desired depth or desired depth adjustment. The actuator
380 is preferably calibrated such that a set of depths and corresponding command signals are
stored in the memory of the monitor 50.
[0043] In a second method, the system 300 sends a command signal to the depth adjustment
actuator 380 in order to increase or decrease the trench depth until the desired depth or depth
adjustment has been indicated by the depth actuator encoder 382.
[0044] In a third method, the system 300 sends a command signal to the depth adjustment
actuator 380 in order to increase or decrease the trench depth until the desired depth or depth
adjustment has been indicated by a depth sensor 385 configured to measure the actual depth
of the trench. In some embodiments, the depth sensor 385 may comprise a sensor (or
multiple sensors) disposed to measure a rotational position of the gauge wheel arms 260
relative to the row unit 200 as disclosed in Applicant's co-pending Provisional Patent
Application No. 61/718,073, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its
entirety by reference. In other embodiments, the depth sensor 385 comprises a sensor
disposed to directly measure the depth of the trench 38. One such embodiment is illustrated
in FIG. 26, in which the depth sensor 385 includes a ski 2610 configured to ride along the
surface of the soil to the side of the trench 38. In some embodiments, the ski 2610 includes
two ground-engaging portions disposed to ride the surface of the soil on either side of the
trench 38. An arm 2620 is preferably mounted to an upper surface of a portion of the firmer
410 which engages the trench 38. The arm 2620 preferably extends through an aperture in
the ski 2610 such that the arm slides vertically relative to the ski as the firmer 410 deflects up

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
and down. A magnet 2640 is preferably mounted to the arm 2620. A Hall-effect sensor 2630
is preferably mounted to the ski 2610. The Hall-effect sensor 2630 preferably comprises a
circuit board including multiple Hall-effect sensors vertically spaced along a surface of the
circuit board adjacent a plane defined by the range of motion of the magnet 2640. The Hall
effect sensor 2630 is preferably configured to generate a signal related to the position of the
magnet 2640. The Hall-effect sensor 2630 is preferably in electrical communication with the
monitor 50. The monitor 50 is preferably configured to determine the depth of the trench 38
based on the signal generated by the Hall-effect sensor 2630, for example, using an empirical
lookup table.
Depth Control Methods
[0045] The system 300 preferably controls the depth of the trench 38 in which seeds are
planted according to various processes based on one or more measurements or data inputs
obtained by the system 300. It should be appreciated that the trench depth for an individual
row unit 200 or group of row units may be controlled by measurements made by a sensor on
the row unit or by a sensor on another row unit or remote from the row units 200 (e.g., on a
measurement unit 2500 as described herein) or remote from the implement 10 (e.g., on a base
station 325 as described herein). Likewise, the depth control methods described herein may
be used to control the trench depth for a single row unit or a group of row units. Thus, for
example, a single temperature measurement may be made at a single row unit 200 and used
to determine a desired depth at multiple row units 200. Additionally, the moisture
measurements used in the processes described herein may be obtained either from one of the
moisture sensors described herein or using multiple temperature measurements at multiple
depths, e.g., by generating a best-fit linear temperature-depth relationship and consulting a
lookup table or empirically-developed equation correlating the slope of the temperature-depth
relationship to soil moisture.
[0046] A process 500 for controlling trench depth based on soil moisture is illustrated in FIG.
5. At step 505, the system 300 preferably commands the depth adjustment actuator 380 to set
the trench depth to a default depth Dd, e.g., 1.75 inches. At step 510, the system 300
preferably monitors the signal from a moisture sensor 350. At step 515, the system 300
preferably compares the measured moisture M to a predetermined range, preferably defined
by a low moisture Ml (e.g., 15%) and an high moisture Mh (e.g., 35%). Moisture values are
expressed herein as a volumetric percentage of water content; it should be appreciated that
                                                 a

    WO 2014/153157                                                           PCT/US2014/029352
other units or measures of soil moisture as are known in the art may be substituted for these
values. If the moisture M is less than Ml, then at step 520 the system 300 preferably
determines whether the current depth D is less than or equal to a maximum depth Dmax (e.g.,
2.25 inches); if it is, then at step 525 the system 300 preferably increases the depth D by an
increment (e.g., .175 inches) and again monitors the soil moisture; if not, then at step 505 the
system 300 preferably sets the depth D to the default depth. If at step 515 the moisture M is
greater than Mh, then at step 530 the system 300 preferably determines whether the current
depth D is greater than or equal to a minimum depth Dmin (e.g., 1.25 inches); if it is, then at
step 535 the system 300 preferably decreases the depth D by an increment (e.g., .175 inches);
if not, then at step 510 the system 300 preferably again monitors the moisture measurement
signal. If at step 515 the current moisture M is between Ml and Mh, then at step 517 the
system 300 preferably retains the current depth setting D and returns to monitoring the
moisture measurement signal. In some embodiments of the method 500 reflected by alternate
path 524, if M is greater than Mh and D is less than Dmin, the system adjusts the depth D to
the default depth. In other embodiments of the method 500 reflected by alternate path 522, if
M is less than Ml and D is greater than Dmax, then the system 300 returns to monitoring the
moisture measurement signal without adjusting the depth D to the default depth.
[0047] A process 600 for controlling trench depth based on soil temperature is illustrated in
FIG. 6. At step 605, the system 300 preferably commands the depth adjustment actuator 380
to set the trench depth to a default depth, e.g., 1.75 inches. At step 610, the system 300
preferably monitors the signal from a temperature sensor 360. At step 615, the system 300
preferably compares the measured temperature T to a predetermined range, preferably
defined by a low temperature Tl (e.g., 55 degrees Fahrenheit) and a high temperature Th
(e.g., 65 degrees Fahrenheit). If the temperature T is greater than Th, then at step 620 the
system 300 preferably determines whether the current depth D is less than or equal to a
maximum depth Dmax (e.g., 2.25 inches); if it is, then at step 625 the system 300 preferably
increases the depth D by an increment (e.g., .175 inches) and again monitors the soil
temperature; if not, then at step 605 the system 300 preferably sets the depth D to the default
depth. If at step 615 the temperature T is less than T1, then at step 630 the system 300
preferably determines whether the current depth D is greater than or equal to a minimum
depth Dmin (e.g., 1.25 inches); if it is, then at step 635 the system 300 preferably decreases
the depth D by an increment (e.g., .175 inches); if not, then at step 610 the system 300
preferably again monitors the moisture measurement signal. If at step 615 the current
                                                  1I(

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
temperature T is between Tl and Th, then at step 617 the system 300 preferably retains the
current depth D and returns to monitoring the temperature measurement signal. In some
embodiments of the process 600 reflected by alternate path 622, if T is greater than Th and D
is greater than Dmax, the system 300 returns to monitoring the temperature measurement
signal without adjusting the depth D to the default depth. In other embodiments of the
process 600 reflected by alternate path 624, if T is less than Tl and D is less than Dmin, then
the system 300 adjusts the depth D to the default depth before returning to monitoring the
moisture measurement signal. In still other embodiments of the process 600 reflected by
alternate path 626, if T is greater than Th and D is less than or equal to Dmax, then the
system 300 returns to monitoring the temperature measurement signal without adjusting the
depth D to the default depth.
[0048] In other embodiments of the process 600, a stationary probe or on-planter temperature
probe is configured and disposed to determine the soil temperature at a constant depth (e.g., 4
inches) Dc greater than or equal to Dmax. The system preferably compares the measured
temperature at depth D to the measured temperature at Dc and determines a distribution of
temperatures between D and Dc. The desired depth is then selected corresponding to a
desired temperature within the distribution.
[0049] A process 700 for controlling depth based on soil moisture and soil temperature is
illustrated in FIG. 7. At step 705, the system 300 preferably runs the process 500 and the
process 600 simultaneously. The term "simultaneously" as used herein means that the
processes generally run at the same time and does not require that any particular
corresponding step in each process be carried out at or near the same time; however, in a
preferred embodiment, after each cycle of the processes 500, 600 (the term "cycle" meaning,
e.g., a sequence resulting in a depth change recommendation even if the recommendation is
to retain the current depth) is completed, each process (e.g., process 500) preferably waits for
the current cycle of the other process (e.g., process 600) to complete before moving on to step
710. Once both processes 500, 600 have generated a depth recommendation, at step 710 the
system 300 preferably determines whether one process is recommending a depth change
while the other process is recommending a depth change; if so, at step 715 the system 300
preferably follows the recommendation requesting a depth change. If not, then at step 720
the system 300 preferably determines whether the moisture process 500 is recommending
increased depth while the temperature process 600 is requesting reduced depth; if not, then at
                                                 11

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
step 715 the system 300 preferably follows the recommendation requesting a depth change; if
so, then at step 725 the system 300 preferably adjusts the trench depth up and down by
increments relative to the current depth setting (e.g., by .175 inches deeper and shallower
than the current depth setting) in order to determine whether a threshold increase in moisture
or temperature is obtained at depths above and below the current depth setting; after cycling
up and down at step 725, the system 300 preferably returns to the current depth setting. At
step 730, the system 300 preferably determines whether temperature or moisture increases at
the increased or reduced depths sampled at step 725. If temperature does not increase by at
least a threshold (e.g., 2 degrees Fahrenheit) at decreased depth but moisture increases by at
least a threshold (e.g., 2%) at increased depth, then at step 732 the system 300 preferably
increases the depth by the increment recommended by the moisture process 500. If
temperature increases by at least a threshold (e.g., 2 degrees Fahrenheit) at decreased depth
but moisture does not increase by at least a threshold (e.g., 2%) at increased depth, then at
step 734 the system 300 preferably reduces the depth by the increment recommended by the
temperature process 600. In all other cases, at step 736 the system 300 preferably retains the
current depth setting.
[0050] Another process 800 for controlling depth based on soil temperature and soil moisture
is illustrated in FIG. 8. At step 805, the system preferably runs the process 500 and the
process 600 simultaneously. At step 810, after each cycle of the processes 500, 600, the
system 300 preferably waits until both processes have supplied a depth recommendation. At
step 815, the system 300 preferably sums the recommended depth adjustment increments
recommended by both processes 500, 600; it should be appreciated that if either of the
processes 500, 600 recommend retaining the current depth, then that process contributes zero
to the summed increment. At step 820, the system 300 preferably adjusts the depth setting by
the summed increment.
[0051] A modified process 800' for controlling depth based on soil temperature and soil
moisture is illustrated in FIG. 9. The modified process 800' is similar to the process 800, but
at step 812 multipliers are preferably applied to each of the incremental depth adjustments
recommended by the processes 500, 600. In some embodiments, the multipliers may be
based on the relative agronomic cost associated with lost moisture and/or temperature; for
example, assuming a greater agronomic cost is associated with lost moisture than with lost
temperature, the multipliers may be .9 for the temperature recommendation and 1.1 for the
                                                19

    WO 2014/153157                                                           PCT/US2014/029352
moisture recommendation. It should be appreciated that multipliers may be applied to the
input values rather than the resulting recommendations of processes 500, 600; for example, a
multiplier of .9 per degree Fahrenheit may be applied to the temperature measurement and a
multiplier of 1.1 per 1% moisture content may be applied to the moisture measurement.
[0052] A process 1100 for controlling depth based on soil data is illustrated in FIG. 11. At
step 1105, the system 300 preferably accesses soil data (e.g., a geo-referenced soil data map
such as a shape file associating soil data with geo-referenced positions); the monitor 50 may
obtain the soil data from the soil data server 345, although in some embodiments the soil data
may be stored in the memory of the monitor 50. At step 1110, the system 300 preferably
compares a current location of the planter 10 (e.g., as reported by the GPS receiver 52) to the
geo-referenced soil data in order to determine a soil characteristic (e.g., soil type) of the soil
at the current location. At step 1115, the system 300 preferably determines a desired depth
based on the retrieved soil data, e.g., using a lookup table relating desired depths to soil
characteristic ranges. In one illustrative example, the lookup table may include a set of soil
types, each associated with a desired depth; e.g., Ipava soil may be associated with a desired
depth of 1.75 inches while Sable soil may be associated with a desired depth of 1.8 inches. In
other embodiments, at step 1115 the system 300 uses a formula to calculate a desired depth
Dd based on the soil data, e.g., using the equation:
                                  Dd = 1.75 + .007 x (C - 10)
         Where:     C is the clay content of the soil, expressed as a percentage.
[0053] At step 1120 the system 300 preferably adjusts the trench depth to the desired depth.
[0054] A process 1200 for controlling depth based on soil data and soil temperature is
illustrated in FIG. 12. At step 1205, the system 300 preferably accesses soil data as described
above with respect to step 1105 of process 1100. At step 1210, the system 300 preferably
determines a soil characteristic by comparing the current location to the geo-referenced soil
data as described above with respect to step 1110 of process 1100. At step 1215, the system
300 preferably determines a temperature multiplier using a lookup table or equation relating
temperature multipliers to soil characteristic ranges; e.g., a multiplier of 1.1 may be
associated with Ipava soil while a multiplier of .9 may be associated with Sable soil. At step
1220, the system 300 preferably determines the current temperature from the temperature
sensor signal. At step 1225, the system 300 preferably applies the temperature multiplier to

   WO 2014/153157                                                           PCT/US2014/029352
the measured temperature. At step 1230, the system 300 preferably determines a
recommended depth adjustment using the modified (multiplier-applied) temperature, e.g.,
using the process 600 described herein. At step 1235, the system 300 preferably applies the
recommended depth adjustment. It should be appreciated that the process 1200 could be
modified in order to control depth based on soil type and other measured soil characteristics
such as soil moisture. In some embodiments, the monitor 50 consults a lookup table to
determine values of Mh and Ml for the soil type corresponding to the current position of the
row unit; e.g., the values of Mh, Ml may be 30%, 15% respectively for silt loam and 36%,
20% respectively for sandy clay loam.
[0055] A process 1300 for controlling depth based on weather data is illustrated in FIG. 13.
At step 1305, the system 300 preferably accesses weather data, e.g. from the weather data
server 340. The system 300 then determines a desired depth based on the weather data,
which may include, inter alia, predicted precipitation, predicted air temperature, past
precipitation, or past air temperature. In the illustrated example, at step 1310 the system 300
obtains the predicted air temperature and determines the number of growing degree days G
between the time of planting and the time of germination, e.g., using the equation below in
which preferred values are specified for corn:
                                       N
                                  G =     Tmax + Tmin    -  Tbase
                                      n=1
            Where:      N is the number of days between planting to germination, e.g. 5;
                        Tmax is the maximum predicted temperature in Fahrenheit during each
                             successive 24-hour period following the time of planting;
                        Tmin is the minimum predicted temperature in Fahrenheit during each
                             successive 24-hour period following the time of planting, or Tbase
                             if the minimum predicted temperature is less than Tbase; and
                        Tbase is the base temperature for the seed, e.g., 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
[0056] Once the number of predicted growing degree days is determined, at step 1315 the
system 300 preferably determines a desired depth based on the number of predicted growing
days. In some embodiments, the system 300 consults a lookup table stored in the memory of
the monitor 50; for example, a depth of 1.75 inches may be desired for growing degree days
greater than 30, a depth of 1.5 inches may be desired for growing degree days between 15
                                                 1A

    WO 2014/153157                                                         PCT/US2014/029352
and 30, and a depth of 1.25 inches may be desired for growing degree days between 0 and 15
degrees. It should be appreciated that a shallower depth is generally desired for lesser
growing degree day values. At step 1335, the system 300 preferably adjusts the trench depth
to the desired depth determined at step 1315.
[0057] A process 1400 for controlling depth based on weather data and soil temperature is
illustrated in FIG. 14. At step 1405, the system 300 preferably accesses weather data as
described above with respect to process 1300. At step 1410, the system 300 preferably
determines a number of growing degree days as described above with respect to process
1300. At step 1415, the system 300 preferably determines the current temperature based on
the signal received from the temperature sensor 360. At step 1420, the system 300 preferably
applies a multiplier to the measured temperature; the multiplier is preferably based on the
number of growing degree days calculated at step 1410. For example, a multiplier of 1 may
be applied for growing degree days greater than 15 and a multiplier of .8 may be applied for
growing degree days less than 15; it should be appreciated that resulting modified soil
temperature is preferably smaller for smaller growing degree day values. At step 1425, the
system 300 preferably determines a recommended depth adjustment based on the modified
(multiplier-applied) temperature, e.g., using the process 600 described herein. At step 1430,
the system 300 preferably adjusts the trench depth according to the adjustment determined at
step 1425.
[0058] A process 1500 for controlling depth based on data received from the base station 325
is illustrated in FIG. 15. At step 1505, the system 300 preferably receives temperature
measurements at multiple depths from the base station 325. At step 1510, the system 300
preferably determines an empirical relationship between depth and temperature, e.g., by
determining a linear or other equation that best fits the temperature measurements at the base
station 325. At step 1515, the system 300 preferably receives moisture measurements at
multiple depths from the base station 325. At step 1520, the system 300 preferably
determines an empirical relationship between depth and moisture, e.g., by determining a
linear or other equation that best fits the moisture measurements at the base station 325. At
step 1525, the system 300 preferably determines a desired depth based on the moisture and
depth measurements received from the base station 325. In some embodiments, the system
300 selects a depth at which the loss L resulting from a lack of moisture and temperature is
minimized, e.g., where the loss L is determined by the equation:

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
                                            L = Lm + Lt
             Where:     Lt = Tl - T for T < Tl, Lt = 0 for T > Tl;
                        Lm   =  15 - Ml for M < Ml, Lm =0 for M > Ml;
                        Ml is the minimum moisture level as described elsewhere herein, e.g.,
                            15%; and
                        TI is the minimum temperature described elsewhere herein, e.g., 50
                           degrees F.
[0059] The system 300 preferably selects a depth corresponding to the minimum L-value for
all depths between the maximum depth Dmax and minimum depth Dmin. If the minimum
value of L is within a threshold (e.g., 5%) of the maximum L-value, then the system 300
preferably selects a default depth (e.g., 1.75 inches) instead of the depth corresponding to the
minimum L-value. At step 1530, the system 300 preferably adjusts the trench depth to the
depth selected at step 1525.
[0060] A process 1600 for controlling depth based on soil and moisture data and weather data
is illustrated in FIG. 16. At step 1605, the system 300 preferably receives temperature
measurements at multiple depths from the base station 325 as described above with respect to
the process 1500. At step 1610, the system 300 preferably determines an empirical
relationship between temperature and depth as described above with respect to the process
1500. At step 1615, the system 300 preferably receives moisture measurements at multiple
depths from the base station 325 as described above with respect to the process 1500. At step
1620, the system 300 preferably determines an empirical relationship between moisture and
depth as described above with respect to the process 1500. At step 1625, the system 300
receives temperature data, preferably from the base station 325 and/or the weather data server
340. The temperature data may include past recorded air temperature (e.g., recorded local air
temperature during the previous 24 hours) as well as forecasted air temperature (e.g.,
forecasted local air temperature during the following 60 hours); the temperature data may
also include recorded cloud conditions and forecasted cloud conditions. At step 1630, the
system 300 preferably adjusts the temperature-depth relationship based on the temperature
data. For example, in some embodiments the system 300 may adjust the temperature-depth
relationship based on the local air temperature recorded during a period prior to planting and
the forecasted temperature during the germination period (e.g., 60 hours) after planting. In
one such embodiment, the system 300 modifies the temperature-depth relationship T(d) to a

    WO 2014/153157                                                          PCT/US2014/029352
modified temperature-depth relationship T'(d) using the equation:
                                                 H         f  A(h)dh
                               T'(d) = T(d) x       P x      A
                                                  Hf    f_     A(h)dh
            Where:      A(h) is air temperature as a function of time in hours h;
                        Hp is the number of hours prior to planting over which recorded air
                           temperature is used; and
                        Hf is the number of hours after planting over which forecasted air
                           temperature is used.
[0061] Continuing to refer to process 1600 of FIG. 16, at step 1635 the system 300 receives
precipitation data, preferably from the base station 325 and/or the weather data server 340.
The precipitation data may include past recorded rainfall (e.g., recorded local rainfall during
the previous 24 hours) as well as forecasted rainfall (e.g., forecasted local rainfall during the
following 60 hours). At step 1640, the system 300 preferably adjusts the moisture-depth
relationship based on the precipitation data. For example, in some embodiments the system
300 may adjust the moisture-depth relationship based on local rainfall recorded during a
period prior to planting and the forecasted rainfall during the germination period (e.g., 60
hours) after planting. In one such embodiment, the system 300 modifies the moisture-depth
relationship M(d) to a modified moisture-depth relationship M'(d) using the equation:
                               M'(d) = M(d) X         X        R(h)dh
                                                  Hf     f_    R(h)dh
            Where:      R(h) is rainfall as a function of time in hours h;
                        Hp is the number of hours prior to planting over which recorded
                           rainfall is used; and
                        Hf is the number of hours after planting over which forecasted rainfall
                           is used.
[0062] Continuing to refer to process 1600 of FIG. 16, at step 1645 the system 300 preferably
determines a desired depth based on the modified temperature-depth and modified moisture
depth relationships generated at steps 1630, 1640; in some embodiments, step 1645 is carried
out as described herein with respect to step 1525 of process 1500. At step 1650, the system
                                                 17

    WO 2014/153157                                                         PCT/US2014/029352
300 preferably adjusts the trench depth to the desired depth.
Display and User Interface
[0063]  As illustrated in FIG. 17, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a screen
1700 displaying spatial soil temperature data. The screen 1700 preferably displays the live
position of the planter 10 and each of the associated row units 200 (numbered 1 through 4 in
FIG. 17). In the embodiment of FIG. 17, temperature measurements are made at each row
unit 200. Each temperature measurement is preferably time-stamped and associated with a
GPS position; the screen 1700 preferably displays resulting temperature-location data points
1722, 1724, 1726 associated (e.g., by color or hatching) with legend ranges 1712, 1714, 1716,
which are preferably illustrated in a legend 1710. An interface 90 preferably enables the user
to navigate between map screens.
[0064]  As illustrated in FIG. 18, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a screen
1800 displaying spatial soil moisture data. The screen 1800 preferably displays the live
position of the planter 10 and each of the associated row units 200 (numbered 1 through 4 in
FIG. 18). In the embodiment of FIG. 18, moisture measurements are made at each row unit
200. Each moisture measurement is preferably time-stamped and associated with a GPS
position; the screen 1800 preferably displays resulting moisture-location data points 1822,
1824, 1826 associated with legend ranges 1812, 1814, 1816, which are preferably illustrated
in a legend 1810.
[0065]  As illustrated in FIG. 19, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a screen
1900 displaying spatial trench depth data. The screen 1900 preferably displays the live
position of the planter 10 and each of the associated row units 200 (numbered 1 through 4 in
FIG. 19). In the embodiment of FIG. 19, trench depth measurements (or records of
commanded trench depth) are made at each row unit 200. Each trench depth measurement is
preferably time-stamped and associated with a GPS position; the screen 1900 preferably
displays resulting depth-location data points 1922, 1924, 1926 associated with legend ranges
1912, 1914, 1916, which are preferably illustrated in a legend 1910.
[0066] In some embodiments, the screens 1700, 1800 and/or 1900 include a map overlay
comprising spatial data from prior operations and/or prior seasons. The map overlay may be

[0067] Turning to FIG. 20, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a germination
summary screen 2000. A window 2005 preferably displays the percentage of seeds S planted
at a desired moisture level, which the monitor 50 preferably calculates according to the
equation:
                                          S =  -M   x 100%
                                                St
            Where:      St is the total number of seeds planted during the current planting
                           operation (e.g., in the current field); and
                        Sm is the number of seeds planted within a threshold distance (e.g., 6
                           inches) of a GPS location associated with a moisture measurement
                           of at least a threshold value (e.g., 15%).
[0068] In embodiments of the system 300 having a moisture sensor 350 at each row, the
value of Sm is preferably determined on a row-by-row basis and then summed. In
embodiments having fewer moisture sensors 350 than row units 200, each moisture sensor is
associated with one or more row units and the value of Sm is determined on a row-by-row
basis with each row unit using the moisture measurements of its associated moisture sensor.
The monitor 50 also determines the value of S for each individual row and identifies the row
having the lowest value of S in window 2005.
[0069] The germination summary screen 2000 also preferably includes a window 2010
displaying the percentage of seeds R planted at a desired temperature, which the monitor 50
preferably calculates according to the equation:
                                          R = - x 100%

            Where:     Rt is the number of seeds planted within a threshold distance (e.g., 6
                           inches) of a GPS location associated with a temperature
                           measurement of at least a threshold value (e.g., 55 degrees

                             Fahrenheit).
[0070] In embodiments of the system 300 having a temperature sensor 360 at each row, the
value of Rm is preferably determined on a row-by-row basis and then summed. In
embodiments having fewer temperature sensors 360 than row units 200, each temperature
sensor is associated with one or more row units and the value of Rm is determined on a row
by-row basis with each row unit using the temperature measurements of its associated
temperature sensor. The monitor 50 also determines the value of R for each individual row
and identifies the row having the lowest value of R in window 2010.
[0071] The screen 2000 also preferably includes a window 2015 displaying an estimate of the
probability P of successful germination of seeds planted during the current planting operation
(e.g., in the current field), which the monitor 50 preferably calculates using the equation:
                                          P= Ret +Sm x 100%
                                                2 St
[0072] In embodiments of the system 300 having moisture sensors but no temperature
sensors, the monitor 50 preferably calculates the germination probability P using the
equation:
                                                Sm
                                           P =-       x 100%

[0073]    In embodiments of the system 300 having moisture sensors but no temperature
sensors, the monitor 50 preferably calculates the germination probability P using the
equation:
                                           P =   -   x 100%

[0074] Continuing to refer to FIG. 20, the screen 2000 preferably includes a window 2020
displaying the average of the current moisture measurements obtained from the moisture
sensors 350. The window 2020 preferably identifies the row unit or section (i.e., group of
row units associated with a single moisture sensor 350) from which the lowest moisture
measurement is obtained. The screen 2000 preferably includes a window 2025 displaying the
average of the current temperature measurements obtained from the temperature sensors 360.
The window 2025 preferably identifies the row unit or section (i.e., group of row units
                                                    '?n

   WO 2014/153157                                                         PCT/US2014/029352
associated with a single temperature sensor 360) from which the lowest temperature
measurement is obtained. The screen 2000 also preferably includes a window 2030
displaying the current average depth setting commanded to the depth adjustment actuators
380 (or in some embodiments, the current average actual depth measurement obtained from
depth sensors 385). The window 2030 also preferably identifies the row units having the
shallowest and deepest trench depths. The screen 2000 also preferably includes an interface
2040 enabling the user to navigate to row detail screens described later herein.
[0075] Continuing to refer to FIG. 20, the screen 2000 preferably includes a planting
recommendation window 2035 displaying a recommendation indicating whether planting is
recommended (e.g., "Keep Planting") or not recommended (e.g., "Stop Planting"). The
monitor 50 preferably determines which recommendation to display based on current
moisture and/or temperature measurements made by the system 300 or the average
measurements made during the current planting operation (e.g., in the current field). In some
embodiments the monitor recommends planting only if the loss L (calculated as described
above) is less than a threshold, e.g., 20. In embodiments in which the system 300 includes
moisture sensors 350 but no temperature sensors 360, the monitor 50 preferably recommends
planting only if the moisture measurement displayed in window 2020 is greater than a
threshold, e.g., 15%. In embodiments in which the system 300 includes temperature sensors
360 but no moisture sensors 350, the monitor 50 preferably recommends planting only if the
temperature measurement displayed in window 2025 is greater than a threshold, e.g., 55
degrees Fahrenheit.
[0076] It should be appreciated that the moisture and temperature values displayed in the
screen 2000 and used to calculate the germination potential value (window 2015) and
determine the planting recommendation (window 2035) may be adjusted based on weather
data as described earlier herein.
[0077] Turning to FIG. 21, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a row by row
summary screen 2100. The screen 2100 preferably includes a graph 2110 illustrating the
trench depth at each row unit, a graph 2130 illustrating the moisture measured at each row
unit, a graph 2120 illustrating the germination potential determined for each row unit, and a
graph 2140 illustrating the temperature measured at each row unit.

[0078] Turning to FIG. 22, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a row details
screen 2200 for each row unit 200. The row details screen preferably includes windows
2205, 2210, 2215, 2220, 2225, 2230 displaying individual row values used to calculate the
average values displayed in windows 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, respectively, of
the screen 2000.
[0079] Turning to FIG. 23, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a setup screen
2300 enabling the user to vary the parameters used in the depth control processes described
herein. The screen 2300 preferably includes a depth interface 2310 for setting the minimum
depth Dmin, the default depth Dd, and the maximum depth Dmax. The screen 2300
preferably includes a temperature interface 2320 for setting the high temperature Th and the
low temperature Tl. The screen 2300 preferably includes a moisture interface 2330 for
setting a high moisture Mh and a low moisture Ml. The screen 2300 preferably includes an
interface 2340 enabling the user to select which variables are used to control depth. The
monitor 50 is preferably configured to select a depth control process which uses the variables
selected by the user as in puts and does not require the variables not selected by the user. For
example, if the user selects only "Live Moisture", the system 300 preferably uses the process
500 to control trench depth, whereas if the user selects only "Live Moisture" and "Live
Temperature", the system 300 preferably uses one of the processes 700, 800, or 800' to
control trench depth.
[0080] Continuing to refer to FIG. 23, the screen 2300 preferably includes a depth control
interface 2350 enabling allowing the user to turn off all of the depth control processes (e.g.,
by selecting "Off") such that the system 300 leaves the trench depth at each row unit 200 at
the current setting (or in some embodiments, returns each row unit to the default depth Dd).
The screen 2300 also preferably includes a user approval interface 2360 enabling the user to
select whether the monitor 50 requests user approval before requesting. If the user selects
"On" in the interface 2360, then the monitor 50 preferably prompts the user to approve or
reject changes in depth requested by the depth control processes described herein (e.g., by a
window superimposed over the active screen).
[0081] Turning to FIG. 27, the monitor 50 is preferably configured to display a screen 2700
for manually setting trench depth and preferably for viewing moisture and temperature data.
The screen 2700 preferably displays a graph 2710 illustrating the relationship between depth
and moisture and between depth and temperature. The depth-temperature relationship
                                               99?

    WO 2014/153157                                                           PCT/US2014/029352
illustrated in the graph 2710 is preferably generated by averaging the temperature
measurements made by the system 300 at various depths. The depth-moisture relationship
illustrated in the graph 2720 is preferably generated by averaging the moisture measurements
made by the system 300 at various depths. It should be appreciated that the graph 2620
assists the user in selecting a depth at which the desired moisture and temperature are
available. The screen 2700 preferably displays a depth interface (e.g., a sliding interface as
illustrated) allowing the user to set a trench depth; the system 300 preferably adjusts the
trench depth at each row unit to the manually selected trench depth if a manual override
interface 2605 is set to "On".
[0082] The foregoing description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to
make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its
requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment of the apparatus, and the
general principles and features of the system and methods described herein will be readily
apparent to those of skill in the art. Thus, the present invention is not to be limited to the
embodiments of the apparatus, system and methods described above and illustrated in the
drawing figures, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the spirit and scope of
the appended claims.
