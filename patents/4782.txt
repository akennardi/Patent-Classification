REAL-TIME PREDICTION OF STEAM-POP EVENTS DURING ABLATION
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]          The present invention relates generally to invasive medical treatment, and
particularly to methods and systems for predicting steam pop events during ablation.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]          Minimally-invasive intracardiac ablation is the treatment of choice for
various types of arrhythmias. To perform such treatment, the physician typically inserts a
catheter through the vascular system into the heart, brings the distal end of the catheter into
contact with myocardial tissue in areas of abnormal electrical activity, and then energizes
one or more electrodes at or near the distal end in order to create tissue necrosis.
[0003]          A number of systems for intracardiac ablation therapy are commercially
available, such as the CARTOTM system offered by Biosense Webster Inc. (Diamond Bar,
California). CARTO tracks the position and operating parameters of the distal end of the
catheter and displays this information electronically on a three-dimensional (3D)
anatomical map of the heart. CARTO enables the system operator to electronically tag
locations that have been ablated on the map and thus to keep track of the progress of the
procedure.
[0004]          U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0287205, whose disclosure is
incorporated herein by reference, describes a system for controllably delivering ablation
energy to tissue. The system includes an ablation device operable to supply ablation energy
to body tissue causing bubbles to form in the tissue, an ultrasound transducer configured to
detect energy spontaneously emitted by collapsing or shrinking bubbles that are resonating
in the tissue, and a control element operably coupled to the ablation device and the
ultrasound transducer element, the control element being configured to adjust the ablation
energy supplied to the tissue in response to the energy detected by the ultrasound
transducer to prevent tissue popping caused by bubble expansion.

[0005]          U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011/0224664 and European Patent
Application Publication EP 2364664, whose disclosures are incorporated herein by
reference, describe a method for ablating tissue in an organ inside a body of a subject. The
method includes bringing a probe inside the body into a position in contact with the tissue
to be ablated, and measuring one or more local parameters at the position using the probe
prior to ablating the tissue. A map of the organ is displayed, showing, based on the one or
more local parameters, a predicted extent of ablation of the tissue to be achieved for a
given dosage of energy applied at the position using the probe. The given dosage of energy
is applied to ablate the tissue using the probe, and an actual extent of the ablation at the
position is measured using the probe subsequent to ablating the tissue. The measured actual
extent of the ablation is displayed on the map for comparison with the predicted extent.
[0006]          European Patent EP 2094150, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by
reference, describes a method for monitoring formation of steam pocket during ablation,
wherein a measured reflectance spectral intensity (MRSI) versus time is analyzed. The
method includes delivering light to tissue, and measuring the reflectance spectral intensity
of the tissue, wherein observation is made as to whether the MRSI initially increases in a
specified time period followed by a decrease at a specified rate in the MRSI. If there is no
decrease in the MRSI, then delivery of ablation energy to tissue continues. However, if
there is a decrease in the MRSI within a specified time and at a specified rate, then the
method infers the formation of a steam pocket and decreases or discontinues the delivery
of ablative energy to tissue.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0007]          An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for performing a
medical procedure, including coupling a probe to tissue in an organ of a patient. Ablation
energy is applied to the tissue using the probe. A model of an evolution of steam pressure
in the tissue, caused by the ablation energy, as a function of time, is estimated. Based on
the model, an occurrence time of a steam pop event caused by the steam pressure is
predicted, and the predicted occurrence time of the steam pop event is indicated to an
operator.

[0008]          In some embodiments, estimating the model includes estimating an
evolution of temperature in the tissue, caused by the ablation energy, as a function of time.
In other embodiments, estimating the model includes estimating a penetration depth of the
probe into the tissue, and calculating the model based on the penetration depth and the
ablation energy. In yet other embodiments, estimating the penetration depth includes
measuring multiple values of temperature and impedance of the tissue, and estimating the
penetration depth based on the measured values.
[0009]          In an embodiment, estimating the model includes estimating a function
curve of the tissue pressure as a function of time, and predicting the occurrence time of the
steam pop event includes identifying an intersection time between the function curve and a
predefined threshold, and deriving the occurrence time from the intersection time. In
another embodiment, indicating the predicted occurrence time includes indicating to the
operator a length of time remaining until the steam pop event. In yet another embodiment,
the method further includes modifying application of the ablation energy in response to the
predicted occurrence time of the steam pop event.
[0010]          In some embodiments, estimating the model includes identifying a hottest
region of the tissue in a vicinity of the probe, and assessing the evolution of the steam
pressure at the hottest region. In other embodiments, estimating the model includes
evaluating in real-time a finite-element heat transfer model of a vicinity of the probe.
[0011]          There is additionally provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the
present invention, apparatus for performing a medical procedure, including, an invasive
probe and a processor which is coupled to the probe. The probe is configured to be coupled
to tissue in an organ of a patient, and to apply ablation energy to the tissue. The processor
is configured to estimate a model of an evolution of steam pressure in the tissue, caused by
the ablation energy, as a function of time, to predict, based on the model, an occurrence
time of a steam pop event caused by the steam pressure, and to indicate the predicted
occurrence time of the steam pop event to an operator.
[0012]          There is also provided, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention, a computer software product, including a non-transitory computer-readable

medium in which program instructions are stored, which instructions, when read by a
processor that is coupled to an invasive probe for applying ablation energy to tissue in an
organ to which the probe is coupled, cause the processor to estimate a model of an
evolution of a steam pressure in the tissue, caused by the ablation energy, as a function of
time, to predict, based on the model, an occurrence time of a steam pop event caused by
the steam pressure, and to indicate the predicted occurrence time of the steam pop event to
an operator.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
OVERVIEW
[0019]          In some catheter-based treatment systems, such as the above-mentioned
CARTO system, a physician conducting an ablation procedure inserts the catheter via the
vascular system of the patient, to bring the distal tip of the catheter in contact with the
tissue to be ablated. The physician then applies RF energy to the tissue via the catheter to
create a lesion or necrosis in the tissue.
[0020]          Tissue overheating is an undesirable side effect of applying RF energy to
the tissue that may result in the formation of steam bubbles in the tissue. The hottest region
of the tissue in the vicinity of the catheter is referred to as a hot-spot region. Typically, the
hot-spot resides a few mm (e.g. about 1-2 mm) beneath the catheter tip. The tissue at the
hot-spot has the highest risk of suffering from overheating. As steam pressure inside the
bubbles evolves and builds up over time, reaching an excessive pressure level may cause
bubbles to explode or collapse, resulting in tissue rupture. Moreover, the crater shaped
damage formed in the myocardium disturbs blood flow and increases the risk of thrombus
creation due to flow perturbations. The phenomenon of an exploding or collapsing steam
bubble is referred to as a steam pop event.
[0021]          Embodiments of the present invention that are described herein provide
improved methods and systems for predicting the occurrence time of a steam pop event
during the ablation procedure. The occurrence time (e.g., the time remaining until the
expected steam pop event) is typically predicted in real time, so as to enable alerting the
physician and/or taking responsive measures to avoid steam pop.
[0022]          In some embodiments, tissue temperature and impedance measurements
acquired in the probe, together with the ablation current, are used for evaluating a real-time
model that predicts the hot-spot temperature as a function of time. In an example
embodiment, the depth of the probe tip inside the tissue is first estimated using impedance
and force measurements. The tip penetration depth is re-estimated until a match is found
between temperature and impedance values calculated by a finite element model, and

                                                 6
actual measurements. The estimated tip depth and the ablation current are used to estimate
the real-time model, so as to predict the evolution of steam pressure at the ablated tissue as
a function of time. The estimated model serves to predict the occurrence time of an
imminent steam pop event. In some embodiments, the estimated model comprises a
temperature and/or pressure curve function, and the predicted occurrence time is derived
from an intersection point of the model curve and a predefined temperature or pressure
threshold.
[0023]          The predicted occurrence time of the steam pop event is indicated to the
physician or operator who carries out the ablation procedure. In some embodiments, the
indication comprises, in addition to a numerical presentation of the predicted time, a
presentation of the model curve on a display screen. Alternatively or additionally, the
indication may comprise an audible indication such as a sound whose amplitude and/or
frequency increases as time approaches the predicted occurrence time.
[0024]          Using the indication of the expected imminent occurrence time of a steam
pop event, the physician may take various actions, in advance, to reduce the risk for actual
occurrence of such events. For example, the physician may reduce or even stop the
ablation current to reduce the amount of energy applied to the tissue. Alternatively or
additionally, the physician may reposition the probe tip to control the tip depth inside the
tissue. Further alternatively or additionally, in case the ablation is conducted using an
irrigated catheter, the physician may reduce the risk for steam pop events by controlling
the irrigation rate. In alternative embodiments, the responsive action is taken automatically.
[0025]          The finite element model and the real-time model are continuously updated
during the ablation procedure, in order to maintain updated and accurate models under
changing conditions created, for example, by heart beats and respiration operations of the
patient.
[0026]          Although the embodiments described below relate specifically to
performance of intracardiac ablation, using a catheter of suitable design, the principles of
the present invention may similarly be applied in other sorts of treatments, which may be

                                                7
applied to the heart or to other organs, using either catheters or other suitable types of
invasive probes.
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
[0027]          Fig. 1A is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a system 20 for intracardiac
ablation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System 20 may be
based, for example, on the above-mentioned CARTO system, with suitable additions to the
system software. System 20 comprises a probe, such as a catheter 24, and a control
console 34. In the embodiment described hereinbelow, catheter 24 is used in ablating sites
of arrhythmias in one or more chambers of a heart 26 of a patient 30. In some
embodiments, catheter 24 comprises an irrigated catheter. Alternatively, catheter 24 or
other suitable probes may be used, mutatis mutandis, for other therapeutic purposes in the
heart or in other body organs.
[0028]          An operator 22, such as a cardiologist, inserts catheter 24 through the
vascular system of patient 30 so that the distal end of the catheter enters a chamber of heart
26. Operator 22 advances the catheter so that an electrode 28 at the distal tip of the
catheter engages endocardial tissue at desired ablation sites. Catheter 24 is typically
connected by a suitable connector at its proximal end to console 34, and specifically to a
radio frequency (RF) generator 36, which generates RF energy for transmission via
catheter 24 to electrode 28. Operator 22 actuates RF generator 36 to ablate tissue at
suspected sites of arrhythmia in the heart. Electrical current applied to RF generator 36
controls the output power level generated.
[0029]          In this pictured embodiment, system 20 uses magnetic position sensing to
determine position coordinates of the distal end of catheter 24 inside heart 26. For this
purpose, a driver circuit 38 in console 34 drives field generators 32 to generate magnetic
fields within the body of patient 30. Typically, field generators 32 comprise coils, which
are placed below the patient's torso at fixed, known positions. These coils generate
magnetic fields in a predefined working volume that contains heart 26. A magnetic field
sensor (not shown) within the distal end of catheter 24 generates electrical signals in
response to these magnetic fields. A signal processor 40 processes these signals in order to

                                                8
determine the position coordinates of the distal end of catheter 24, typically including both
location and orientation coordinates. This method of position sensing is implemented in
the above-mentioned CARTO system and is well known in the art. Alternatively or
additionally, system 20 may use other methods of position sensing that are known in the
art, such as ultrasonic or electrical impedance-based methods.
[0030]          In addition, catheter 24 may comprise a force sensor (not shown) in its distal
end, for measuring the contact force between the catheter tip and a wall 29 of heart 26.
The SmartTouchTM catheter developed by Biosense Webster Inc. for the CARTO system
offers this sort of capability. A catheter of this sort is described, for example, in U.S.
Patent Application Publication 2011/0130648, whose disclosure is incorporated herein by
reference. The force measurement is useful, for example, in ensuring that electrode 28 is
in sufficiently firm contact with the heart wall to effectively transfer RF energy and ablate
the heart tissue. As another example, in response to a suitable indication, operator 22 may
reduce the catheter contact force in order to reduce the risk of overheating that may create
a steam pop event.
[0031]          Processor 40 in console 34 typically comprises a general-purpose computer
processor, with suitable front end and interface circuits for receiving signals from catheter
24 and for controlling and receiving inputs from the other components of console 34.
Processor 40 may be programmed in software to carry out the functions that are described
herein. The software may be downloaded to processor 40 in electronic form, over a
network, for example, or it may be provided, alternatively or additionally, on tangible, non
transitory media, such as optical, magnetic or electronic memory media. Further
alternatively or additionally, some or all of the functions of processor 40 may be carried
out by dedicated or programmable digital hardware components.
[0032]          Based on the signals received from catheter 24 and other components of
system 20, processor 40 drives a display 42 to present operator 22 with a three-dimensional
(3D) map 44 of heart 26. The map may indicate cardiac electrophysiological activity
measured by catheter 24, as well as providing visual feedback regarding the position of the
catheter in the patient's body and status information and guidance regarding the procedure
that is in progress. Other parameters that may be measured by catheter 24 and by other

                                               9
elements of system 20, delivered to processor 40, and shown on display 42 may include,
for example, contact force between the catheter and heart tissue, electrical impedance
between the ablation site and one or more points on the patient's skin, local temperature,
and RF power delivered through the catheter.
[0033]          Fig. 1B is a schematic pictorial illustration of a cross section view along line
A-A of Fig.lA, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 1B
depicts catheter 24 whose tip is in contact with wall 29 of heart 26 at the ablated site. The
catheter tip comprises an electrode 28 and sensors 27 for measuring the tissue interface
temperature and impedance. System 20 uses catheter 24 to measure temperature of a hot
spot 31, as well as temperature and impedance values at a wider measurement region 33
that includes the hot-spot. Region 33 of the tissue is additionally part of a larger region that
is referred to as a temperature domain as described further below. A catheter comprising
sensors and electrodes for measuring tissue temperature and impedance is described, for
example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2011/0224664 and in European Patent
Application Publication EP 2364664 cited above.
[0034]          Referring back to Fig. 1A, upon receiving measured/configured parameters,
Processor 40 estimates a real-time model of the hot-spot temperature and pressure
evolution in hot-spot 31 as a function of time. Based on the estimated model, processor 40
predicts an occurrence time of a steam pop event and presents a respective indication/alert
46 on display 42. Operator 22 may set configuration values, such as temperature or
pressure threshold values using user interface controls 48 and on-screen menus.
[0035]          Although Figs. 1A and lB show a particular system configuration and
application environment, the principles of the present invention may similarly be applied in
other therapeutic applications using not only catheters, but also probes of other types, both
in the heart and in other body organs and regions.
PREDICTING THE TIME OCCURRENCE OF A STEAM POP EVENT
[0036]          Fig. 2 is a graph showing calculated hot spot temperature and pressure
values based on experimental measurements of tissue interface temperature during

                                               10
ablation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The figure
summarizes ablation experiments on animal subjects, conducted in June, 2012, at the
Rambam medical center, Haifa, Israel. Fig. 2 depicts a horizontal time axis in units of
seconds, a left vertical temperature axis in units of Celsius degrees, and a right vertical
pressure axis in units of pounds per square inch (PSI). A horizontal threshold line 100
denotes both temperature and pressure thresholds of about 145 degrees Celsius and 60 PSI
respectively.
[0037]          In Fig. 2, each curve depicts the evolution of the hot-spot temperature over
time during a respective ablation procedure. Typically, at stable ablation conditions such as
catheter position and depth in tissue, contact force, RF power level, and irrigation rate, the
hot-spot temperature rises during the ablation process. Each curve in Fig. 2 represents
ablation that is performed at different conditions. For curves that never pass threshold 100,
the ablation conditions limit the temperature level under about 145 degrees Celsius.
Factors that may limit the temperature are, for example, low RF power and poor contact
force between the catheter tip and the tissue. For other curves, however, the ablation
conditions allow rapid temperature rise, up to a level higher than threshold 100.
[0038]          A circle mark attached to curves that pass threshold 100 denotes a steam
pop event. The experimental data demonstrates that the probability for the occurrence of a
steam pop event is very high when the hot-spot temperature rises above 145 degrees (and
correspondingly 60 PSI). On the other hand, when the temperature evolves to levels below
145 degrees Celsius a steam pop event is very rare and typically does not occur.
[0039]          Thus, by controlling the ablation hot-spot temperature/pressure to levels
below threshold 100, it is possible to significantly reduce the risk for the occurrence of
seam pop events and related medical complications. Moreover, the time at which the hot
spot temperature crosses threshold 100 is highly indicative of the occurrence time of steam
pop.
[0040]          The specific temperature and pressure values, e.g., the value of threshold
100, should be regarded as example values. In alternative embodiments, any other suitable
temperature and pressure values can be used. In particular, the numerical value of

                                                 11
threshold 100 may be different. As noted above, the experimental data shown in Fig. 2 was
measured on animal subjects. When applying the disclosed techniques to human patients,
the numerical values may change. The general phenomenon, i.e., a pressure/temperature
threshold that reliably distinguishes between very low probability of steam pop and very
high probability of steam pop, is expected to remain.
[0041]           Fig. 3 is a graph showing tissue temperature and pressure evolution during
ablation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the figure,
ABLATION #1 and ABLATION #2 denote first and second ablation procedures that are
performed under different conditions. Curves 200 and 204 and similarly curves 212 and
216 depict temperature and pressure evolution during the first and second ablation
procedures, respectively.
[0042]           As depicted, the conditions at the first ablation procedure allow faster
temperature and pressure rise at the tissue hot-spot with comparison to the second ablation
procedure. Faster curve rise may result, for example, if the RF power delivered to the
tissue during ABLATION #1 is higher, or if catheter 24 engages the tissue with firmer
contact resulting in dipper tip penetration into the tissue (and higher energy flow applied to
the tissue). Irrigation rate is another factor that may affect the temperature and pressure
rising rate.
[0043]           As known from thermodynamics theory, the Clausius-Clapeyron equations
define an exponential relationship between boiling vapor pressure and temperature as
given by an expression derived from the relationship: P=exp {A-B/T}, wherein P denotes
pressure, T denotes the hot-spot temperature, and A and B are constants that depend
mainly on thermal properties of the involved substances such as the heat of vaporization
property. Therefore, pressure points on curves 212 and 216 in Fig. 3 are related to
respective temperature points on curves 200 and 204 via the Clausius-Clapeyron equations.
[0044]            Horizontal lines 218 and 220 represent temperature and pressure threshold
levels. The thresholds divide the temperature and pressure levels at the hot-spot into two
zones such that for points above the threshold the probability of steam pop events is very

                                               12
high, whereas for points below the threshold the probability of steam pop events is
typically very low.
[0045]          Based on the experimental results described with reference to Fig. 2 above,
the temperature/pressure thresholds should be set to 145 degrees Celsius and 60 PSI
respectively. In alternative embodiments, however, any other suitable threshold levels may
be selected. As noted above, as the results in Fig. 2 are based on animal subjects, other
threshold levels may be more adequate for human patients. As another example, ablation to
different organs may result in different temperature/pressure evolution process and
therefore may require different threshold levels. Temperature and pressure thresholds may
be configured as constant values in the software run by processor 40, or may be manually
configured by operator 22 prior to starting the ablation procedure.
[0046]          TI and T2 in Fig. 3, denote time instances in which a temperature/pressure
curve crosses respective threshold 218 or 220. In the example of Fig. 3, T1<T2 since
curves 200 and 212 rise faster than respective curves 204 and 216. Thus, when the ablation
duration exceeds TI for ABLATION #1 or T2 for ABLATION #2, the risk for steam pop
occurrence increases significantly. Typical ablation time frame ranges between 20 to 90
seconds. By indicating TI or T2 to operator 22 as soon as the ablation starts, the operator
can take suitable actions, in advance, to reduce the risk of steam pop occurrences.
According to practical experience of the inventors, the disclosed models and techniques
enable to predict TI or T2 within the first 2-3 seconds of the ablation procedure.
[0047]          As noted above, hot-spot temperatures above threshold 218 are likely to
cause steam pop occurrence with high probability. The hot spot is often located several
mm below the surface, and therefore its temperature cannot be measured directly by the
temperature sensor(s) in the catheter. Instead, in some embodiments processor 40 estimates
the temperature of hot-spot 31 by evaluating (in real-time) a finite-element heat transfer
model of the catheter and tissue environment (i.e., the temperature domain including
region 33 in Fig. 1B). The boundary conditions for the model comprise the measured
temperatures (by one or more sensors 27 in the catheter), the estimated tip depth, and the
ablation current.

                                                 13
[0048]           Processor 40 may additionally incorporate the influence of irrigation by
setting a convection boundary condition on the internal tip surfaces of the probe, including
the temperature of the relatively cold saline (whose temperature is usually about 28
degrees Celsius). The convection coefficient may be pre-calculated using, for example, a
computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model.
[0049]           Since steam pop events are created by excessive pressure inside bubbles
formed in the tissue, and since there is a one-to-one relationship between pressure and
temperature (e.g., according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equations mentioned above), the
estimated hot-spot temperature can be used for reliably predicting a steam pop event.
[0050]           Therefore, in some embodiments, steam pop events can be predicted based
on pressure measurements, temperature measurements, or both. In the context of the
present patent application and in the claims, the phrase "estimating a model that predicts
evolution of pressure" may also refer to models that estimate the tissue temperature, and
predict steam pop from the estimated temperature without explicitly calculating the
estimated pressure.
[0051]           Fig. 4 is a flow chart that schematically illustrates a method for predicting
the time occurrence of a steam pop event, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention. The method begins with operator 22 inserting catheter 24 into the tissue to be
ablated at a probe positioning step 250. Operator 22 may use any suitable method to select
an ablation site within the tissue. For example, in heart ablation, operator 22 may select to
ablate sites of arrhythmias as known in the art. Following probe positioning, processor 40
estimates the initial penetration depth of the probe tip into the tissue, at an initial depth
estimation step 252. Processor 40 estimates the initial penetration depth using impedance
measurements, and possibly temperature and/or force measurements.
[0052]           Operator 22 then activates RF generator 36 at a current application step 254.
The RF power level generated by RF generator 36 is controlled by the current level applied
to the generator. Energy created by RF generator 36 is delivered via probe 24 to the tissue
at the site of ablation. Typically, as RF energy is applied to the tissue, probe 24 performs
temperature, impedance and force measurements that are delivered to processor 40.

                                              14
[0053]          Processor 40 uses the estimated tip depth, as well as temperature and
impedance measurements to create a finite element (FE) model at a FE model creation step
258. The FE model comprises calculated temperature and impedance values at multiple
sub-regions of a 3D region that is referred to as a temperature domain. The temperature
domain typically comprises a region of the tissue, e.g., region 33 and hot-spot 32 in Fig.
IB, the catheter tip and sensors, and a region in close vicinity of the tissue wherein liquids
such as blood and irrigation saline may be present. Note that sensors of the probe tip reside
in some of the sub-regions of FE model.
[0054]          Processor 40 compares the calculated temperature and impedance values of
the FE model to actual measurements of the probe sensors at a model comparison step 262.
In case there is no match at step 262, processor 40 re-estimates the tip penetration depth at
a re-estimation step 266 and loops back to step 258. The loop of re-estimation of the
penetration depth (step 266) and adjusting the FE model (step 258) continues until
processor 40 finds a match at step 262, and proceeds to create a real-time model of the
predicted hot-spot temperature and pressure evolution as a function of time at a real-time
model creation step 270. The model is based at least on the probe penetration depth (i.e.,
the "free parameter" of the model) estimated at step 252 and or 266, and on the ablation
current used to activate RF generator 36. The model typically comprises a predicted
evolution curve of the temperature and/or pressure at the hot-spot. Alternatively, the model
may comprise a table of temperature/pressure and time points. Further alternatively, the
model may comprise any other suitable form, such as a mathematical formula.
[0055]          Based on the model and on predefined temperature/pressure thresholds,
processor 40 predicts an expected time occurrence of a steam pop event at a time
prediction step 274. The predicted time may be derived from the intersection point between
the model curve and a respective temperature/pressure threshold.
[0056]          Processor 40 sends indication regarding the expected steam pop event to be
presented on display 42 at a display indication step 278. Typically, the indication
comprises audiovisual indications. For example, processor 40 can present the curves of the
real-time model as well as the predefined thresholds. Alternatively or additionally, the
indication may comprise a numerical presentation of the predicted time as calculated at

                                               15
step 274, or a length of time remaining until the steam pop event. Further alternatively or
additionally, the indication may comprise an audible alert, such as (but not limited to) an
alternate beep sound whose amplitude and/or frequency increases as time approaches the
expected time of steam pop event. In some embodiments, processor 40 may present
additional aiding information to operator 22. For example, processor 40 may continuously
display a heart map 44, probe position relative to the heart chamber and wall, the
penetration depth of the probe within the tissue, the amount of force the probe applies upon
the tissue, and instantaneous hot-spot temperature and/or pressure measurements.
[0057]          Operator 22 checks if ablation is concluded for the current site at a
completion check step 282. Operator 22 may use any suitable method to decide on ablation
conclusion. For example, operator 22 may decide to terminate the ablation if the amount of
energy (e.g., the product of the RF power and time duration) applied to the tissue exceeds a
predefined threshold. Alternatively or additionally, operator 22 may decide on ablation
termination by consulting any suitable information presented on display 42 during the
ablation process. Further alternatively or additionally, processor 40 may automatically
decide on ablation termination using, for example, methods that are described in U.S.
patent application 13/465,103, filed May 7, 2012, whose disclosure is incorporated herein
by reference. In case the ablation at step 282 is concluded, the method terminates at a
termination step 286. Otherwise, processor 40 loops back to step 258 to re-adjust the FE
model in case deviations to the model have occurred. Factors that may cause FE model
deviations include, for example, tissue-probe relative motion created by heart beats and
respiration operations of patient 30. Note that adjusting the FE model at step 258 may be
followed by respective updates to the real-time model at step 270, to the predicted
occurrence time of the steam pop event at step 274, and to the alerts presented at step 278.
[0058]          During the ablation procedure, operator 22 may take actions responsively to
the indications presented at step 278, or to any other indications presented on display 42, in
order to reduce the risk of a steam pop occurrence. For example, operator 22 may adjust
the current applied to RF generator 36 to control the energy dosage applied to the tissue.
As another example, if the real-time model of step 270 indicates a slow
temperature/pressure evolution, the operator may increase the current applied to RF
generator 36. On the other hand, if system 20 indicates an imminent steam pop event,

                                                  16
operator 20 may reduce or even completely shut down the current applied to RF generator
36.
[0059]           Alternatively or additionally, operator 22 may adjust the position or
penetration depth of catheter 24 into the tissue, or even temporarily remove the catheter
from being in contact with the tissue. The operator may apply increased force upon the
catheter to insert it deeply into the tissue if the prediction model indicates a slow rising
temperature/pressure curve. In case, however, the model indicates an imminent occurrence
of a steam pop event, operator 22 may partially or completely remove catheter 24 from the
tissue. Further alternatively or additionally, operator 22 may control irrigation rate, and/or
any other suitable means that may affect temperature/pressure evolution rate, responsively
to the model indication.
[0060]           It would be appreciated that the operator may respond with various actions
in parallel to reduce the risk for a stem pop event.
[0061]           In alternative embodiments, some of the actions that are manually taken by
operator 22 may be automated by processor 40. For example, processor 40 may
automatically control ablation current to RF generator 36 and/or irrigation rate. As another
example, in a system 20 that supports electro-mechanical maneuvering of the catheter,
processor 40 may automatically reposition catheter 24 within the tissue.

which is chosen purely for the sake of conceptual clarity. In alternative embodiments, any
other suitable configuration can also be used.
