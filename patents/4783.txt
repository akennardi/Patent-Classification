                                           ABSTRACT
           Methods and apparatus for the treatment of a body cavity or lumen are described
   where a heated fluid and/or gas may be introduced through a catheter and into treatment
 5 area within the body contained between one or more inflatable/expandable members. The
   catheter may also have optional pressure and temperature sensing elements which may
   allow for control of the pressure and temperature within the treatment zone and also
   prevent the pressure from exceeding a pressure of the inflatable/expandable members to
   thereby contain the treatment area between these inflatable/expandable members.
10 Optionally, a chilled, room temperature, or warmed fluid such as water may then be used
   to rapidly terminate the treatment session.

                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]          The present invention relates to medical devices. In particular, the present
invention relates to methods and apparatus for therapeutic devices capable of exposing
areas of the body to elevated or decreased temperatures, in a highly controlled manner.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]          In the last few decades, therapeutic intervention within a body cavity or
lumen has developed rapidly with respect to delivery of energy via radiofrequency
ablation. While successful in several arenas, radiofrequency ablation has several major
downsides, including incomplete ablation, frequent lack of visualization during catheter
insertion, potential for overlap during treatment (with some areas receiving twice as much
energy as other areas), charring of tissues and requirements for frequent debridement,
frequent requirements for additional doses of energy after debridement, and potential
perforation of the body cavity or lumen due to the rigidity of the RF electrodes.
[0004]          The current state of the art would benefit from minimally invasive devices
and methods which deliver thermal energy to a desired area or extract energy from a
desired area, in a consistent, controlled manner that does not char or inadvertently freeze
certain tissues or create excessive risk of unwanted organ or lumen damage.
                                               1

                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0005]          When bodily tissues are exposed to even slightly elevated temperatures
(e.g., 42 degrees C or greater), focal damage may occur. If the tissues are exposed to
temperatures greater than, e.g., 50 degrees C, for an extended period of time, tissue death
will occur. The energy delivered by RF can then be excessive while a more controlled
treatment can be achieved with heated fluids and/or vapors.
[0006]          Generally, devices for delivering controlled treatment may comprise a
source for a heated liquid and/or gas, e.g., hot water/steam, one or more pumps to deliver
said hot water/steam, a catheter having one or more lumens defined therethrough and also
having one or more ports to deliver or circulate the heated liquid and/or gas, e.g., hot
water and/or vapor, to a controlled site in a controlled manner. The catheter may also
have optional pressure and temperature sensing elements. The optional pressure and
temperature sensing elements may allow the operator to monitor and/or control the
pressure and temperature within the treatment zone and also prevent the pressure from
becoming too high. The treatment site may be delineated by inflatable or expandable
members which are pressurized or expanded to a target pressure to form a seal with the
body cavity/lumen. The heated liquid and/or gas may then be delivered to the area
contained by the inflatable/expandable members at a pressure that is less than that of the
inflatable/expandable members thereby effectively containing the treatment area between
these inflatable/expandable members. Optionally, a chilled, room temperature, or
warmed fluid such as water may then be used to rapidly terminate the treatment session.
[00071          The catheter having the inflatable/expandable members and optional
pressure or temperature-sensing elements may be fitted within the lumen of an endoscope
or other visualization device allowing the therapy to be delivered under direct
visualization. In addition to direct visualization, this advance allows the scope to function
as an insulator for the treatment catheter, thereby preventing unwanted exposure of body
cavities/lumens to the elevated temperatures found in the heated liquid and/or gas
coursing within the treatment catheter.
[0008]          Generally, the heated liquid and/or gas may be heated to a temperature of
between, e.g., 50 and 100 degrees Celsius. Exposure to these less elevated temperatures
may allow for more controlled tissue damage and may obviate issues typically associated
                                               2

with the higher energy forms of treatment. It is understood and known in the art that the
lower the temperature, the longer the dwell/treatment time needed. One treatment
modality may be to deliver the heated liquid and/or gas at a temperature of, e.g., about 70
degrees C for 5 minutes. Another modality may be to treat the tissue with the heated
liquid and/or gas at a temperature of, e.g., 90 degree C for 30 secs.
[0009]            Among other features, the system may also include 1) the ability to
thoroughly treat the treatment area due to the use of confining balloon(s) and/or use of an
umbrella-like seal and use of a pressurized heated liquid and/or gas as the energy delivery
medium, 2) the ability to treat relatively large areas in a very controlled manner due to the
adjustable relationship between the two treatment-area defining inflatable/expandable
components (e.g. balloon(s) and/or an umbrella-like seal), 3) the ability to form a liquid
and/or gas-tight seal between the balloon(s) (and/or an umbrella-like seal) due to the
catheter for the distal balloon traveling within the lumen of the proximal balloon catheter
(avoidance of leakage around the catheters that the balloons can seal about), 4) the
optional ability to monitor and control the pressure within the treatment area to ensure
that the treatment area is not exposed to excessive pressures and that the pressure in the
treatment area is prohibited from exceeding a pressure of the treatment area defining
balloons, 5) the ability to ablate to a controlled depth in a reliable manner due to the lower
energy and longer exposure times which allow the submucosa to cool itself with
incoming blood flow, 6) the optional ability to fit within a working channel of an
endoscope so that the device need not be inserted in a blind manner, 7) the ability to
combine thermal or cooling therapy with delivery of active agents (e.g., anesthetic for
pre-treatment of the target area or a chemotherapeutic for the treatment cancer or
precancerous lesions, etc.), 8) the ability to fill the treatment defining area with fluid (e.g.
cool, warm or room temperature fluid) capable of neutralizing the thermal or cooling
energy in the treatment area in order to prevent potential damage caused by balloon
rupture or seepage around the balloon and/or expandable member, 9) the ability to pre
chill (or pre-warm) the treatment area so that the submucosal tissues can be protected
against the elevated (or cooling) temperature to which the lumen or bodily organ is being
exposed, 10) the ability to adjust the treatment temperature time and/or temperature, 11)
the ability to have modular, automated or semi-automated components and controls for
handling the cooling, heating, inflations, deflations, infusions and/or extractions, 12) the
ability to treat through the working channel of an endoscope or alongside an endoscope,
13) the ability to treat through a variety of endoscopes, e.g. nasal, gastrointestinal,
                                                 3

esophageal, etc., 14) the ability to use off-the-shelf and/or disposable components to
handle the fluid and pressure controls, or to use an automated or semi-automated system.
[0010]          Additionally, the system may also incorporate features that may allow for
efficacious therapy. For example, the system may utilize a sub-zero degrees Celsius
temperature fluid lavage. This cold lavage may allow for much better control than
charring and heating of the tissue and instead may provide a consistent depth of ablation
in a manner that allows for rapid recovery and minimal post-operative pain (as opposed to
heating methods). In addition, by using lavage of a liquid rather than cryogenic sprays
(e.g., sprays which rely on the judgment of the user for determining time of spray
application or spray location, etc.), the potential for over-ablation may be avoided. Also,
the relatively colder cryogenic sprays have been found, in many cases, to result in damage
to the endoscope while the higher temperatures possible with the system described herein
(e.g., anywhere from -5 degrees Celsius to -90 degrees Celsius) is much less likely to
damage the delivery equipment.
[0011]          Secondly, the apparatus may utilize an umbrella-like element in the gastric
space to allow for ablation of tissue regions, such as the lower esophageal sphincter at the
gastroesophageal junction. This ablation is generally difficult to perform using balloon
based ablation technologies due to the expansion of the sphincter into the stomach. By
utilizing an expandable, umbrella-like structure to form a firm seal at this site while
allowing the ablation liquid and/or gas (heated or chilled) to contact the entire
gastroesophageal junction. In addition, a spring-loaded element or other external force
mechanism may be incorporated to provide for steady pressure and a firm seal against the
stomach lining.
[0012]          The apparatus may also be utilized with or without a balloon in body
lumens or cavities that can be otherwise sealed. For example, a hypothermic fluid lavage
of the uterus may be accomplished by introducing a subzero (Celsius) fluid into the uterus
via cannulation of the uterus with a tube or cannula. If the tube is of sufficient diameter,
backflow of the hypothermic lavage into the cervix and vagina may be prevented without
the need for a balloon to contain the fluid. Use of balloons may be avoided for this
particular type of application. In utilizing a hypothermic lavage, a fluid may be used that
remains fluid even at subzero temperatures. This fluid may then circulated in the lumen
(with or without a balloon) in order achieve ablation.
[0013]          In using a hypothermic liquid rather than a gas, a greater thermal load can
be repeatedly extracted from the tissue under controlled physiologic conditions using a
                                                4

liquid beyond the thermal load which may be extracted using a compressed gas. A liquid
lavage, on the other hand, may be controlled based on temperature and pressure to
provide a repeatable effect on the target organ. Compressed gas or other rapid cooling
mechanisms, though, may be utilized in combination with this therapy in order to chill a
solution to subzero temperatures after introduction into the body. In this variation, the
biocompatible liquid capable of retaining liquid characteristics in a subzero state, or "anti
freeze solution", may be infused into the lumen or cavity after which the cooling probe
may be introduced. Heat may be drawn from the anti-freeze solution until the desired
hypothermic ablation temperature has been achieved for the desired duration of time.
Fluid may or may not be circulated during this process via a pump or agitating element
within the catheter in order to improve distribution of the ablative fluid.
[0014]          In yet another variation, the treatment fluid may function to expand the
uterus for consistent ablation, function to distribute the cryoablative freezing more evenly
throughout the uterus, and potentially function to slow or prevent ice formation at the
surface of the lumen or body cavity. The apparatus may be used with, for example,
lipophilic, hydrophilic or amphipathic solutions with the latter two being having the
ability to remove any aqueous fluid from the surface of the target cavity or lumen which
may interfere with conduction of the heat from the target tissues into the cryoablative
fluid.
[0015]          Additionally and/or alternatively, the apparatus and methods described
herein may be used as an adjunct to other treatments, such as the Her Option® therapy
(American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN), by utilizing a lavage of the target cavity
or lumen such as the uterus with the aqueous anti-freeze solution either prior to or during
treatment in order to provide superior transmission of cryoablation with other existing
cryoprobes without creation of the insulating ice layer at the surface. Moreover, lavage of
the target lumen or cavity with a biocompatible antifreeze solution may be performed to
improve transmission of the cryoablative effect as an adjunct to any cryotherapy treatment
anywhere in the body where applicable. As described herein, the cryoablative fluid may
also be introduced and/or lavaged within the target lumen or body cavity within
a balloon which may be expanded to contact the walls of the lumen or body cavity. The
cryoablative treatment fluid may be actively lavaged in and out of the balloon and/or
deeply chilled by a cryoprobe within the balloon after introduction into the body cavity or
lumen. Moreover, the anti-freeze solution may also comprise various salts and/or other
biocompatible molecules capable of driving the freezing temperature of the solution
                                                5

below, e.g., -10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the fluid may be capable of resisting
freezing even at a temperature of, e.g., -90 degrees Celsius. A combination of salts,
alcohols, glycols and/or other molecules may be used to provide this resistance to
freezing in an aqueous solution.
[0016]            In yet another variation, a cryoprobe with, e.g., a protective cage and/or a
recirculator/fluid agitator, may be utilized to ensure that the hypothermic fluid is evenly
distributed. The cage may be configured into various forms so long as it exposes the fluid
to the surface of the cryoprobe while preventing direct contact of the cryoprobe with the
wall of the lumen or cavity to be ablated (such as a uterus). A recirculator may comprise,
e.g., a stirring element at the tip of the cryoprobe, an intermittent or continuous flow
system or other fluid movement mechanism.
[00171            In another variation, to facilitate the balloon expanding and conforming
readily against the tissue walls of the uterus, the balloon may be inflated with a gas or
liquid. Alternatively, the balloon may be filled partially or completely with a conductive
material. Once the elongate shaft has been introduced through the cervix and into the
uterus, the distal opening of the shaft may be positioned distal to the internal os and
balloon may be deployed either from within the shaft or from an external sheath. The
balloon may be deployed and allowed to unfurl or unwrap within the uterus. The cooling
probe may be introduced through the shaft and into the balloon interior (or introduced
after insertion of the conductive elements).
[00181            The conductive elements may be introduced into the balloon interior
through an annular opening within the distal end of the shaft until the balloon is at least
partially or completely filled with the elements. The conductive elements may generally
comprise any number of thermally conductive elements such as copper spheres or some
other inert metal such as gold. These conductive elements may be atraumatic in shape
and are small enough to fill the balloon interior and conform the balloon walls against the
uterine walls to ensure consistent contact with the tissue, e.g., about 20 ml in volume of
the elements. The conductive elements may also help to fill any air pockets which may
form particularly near the tapered portions of the balloon and insulate the tissue from the
ablative effects of the cryoablative fluid. For instance, the conductive elements may be
formed into spheres having a diameter of, e.g., 0.8 mm to 4 mm or larger. To ensure that
that conductive elements are fully and evenly dispersed throughout the balloon interior,
the elements may be introduced through the shaft via an ejector or push rod, auger,
compressed air, etc. In particular, the conductive elements may fill the tapered portions
                                                  6

of the balloon to ensure that the balloon is positioned proximate to and in contact with the
uterine comu to fully treat the interior of the uterus.
[0019]           With the conductive elements placed within the balloon, the cryoablative
fluid may be introduced within and through the balloon such that the conductive elements
facilitate the thermal transfer from the contacted uterine walls. Once the cryoablative
treatment has been completed, the conductive elements may be removed through the shaft
via a vacuum force or other mechanical or electromechanical mechanisms and the
balloon, once emptied, may also be withdrawn from the uterus.
[0020]           The cooling probe introduced into the interior of the balloon may comprise
a number of different configurations which facilitate the introduction of the cryoablative
fluid into the balloon. One such variation, the shaft may have one or more cooling
members which project from the distal end of the shaft at various angles. Another
variation of the cooling probe may have a rotating base and spray member positioned
upon the shaft. The spray member may have a surface which is meshed, latticed,
perforated, etc. such that the cryoablative fluid introduced through the shaft may enter the
rotating base and spray member where it may be evenly dispersed through the spray
member and into the interior of the balloon for treatment.
[0021]           The cooling probe positioned within the balloon may be variously
configured and may include further variations. The cooling probe assembly may
comprise an exhaust catheter having an atraumatic tip and an imaging instrument such as
a hysteroscope positioned within. One or more supporting members or inserts may be
positioned throughout the length of the lumen to provide structural support to the catheter
and to prevent its collapse and a probe support (e.g., flat wire, ribbon, etc.) may extend
through the catheter interior.
[0022]           The probe support may be supported within the lumen via the inserts such
that the probe support separates the lumen into a first channel and a second channel where
the cooling lumens may be positioned along the probe support within the second channel
while the first channel may remain clear for the optional insertion of a hysteroscope.
Because of the thickness of the probe support relative to its width, the probe support may
be flexed or curved in a single plane while remaining relatively stiff in the plane
transverse to the plane.
[00231           The probe may further include one or more cooling lumens which are
positioned along the probe support within the second channel. Because the cooling
lumens are located along the second channel, as separated by the probe support, one or
                                               7

more windows or openings may be defined along the length of the probe support to allow
for the passage of any cryoablative fluid to proliferate through the entire lumen defined
by the catheter. The number of cooling lumens may also be varied to number more than
three lumens terminating at different positions along the active portion.
[0024]           As the cryoablative fluid is introduced into and distributed throughout the
catheter lumen, the exhaust catheter may also define one or more openings to allow for
the cryoablative fluid to vent or exhaust from the catheter interior and into the interior of
the balloon.
[0025]           One example for a treatment cycle using a two cycle process may include
the introduction of the cryoablative fluid for a treatment time of two minutes where the
surrounding tissue is frozen. The fluid may be withdrawn from the balloon and the tissue
may be allowed to thaw over a period of five minutes. The cryoablative fluid may be
then reintroduced and the tissue frozen again for a period of two minutes and the fluid
may then be withdrawn again to allow the tissue to thaw for a period of five minutes. The
tissue may be visually inspected, e.g., via the hysteroscope, to check for ablation
coverage. If the tissue has been sufficiently ablated, the assembly may be removed from
the uterus, otherwise, the treatment cycle may be repeated as needed. In other
alternatives, a single cycle may be utilized or more than two cycles may be utilized, as
needed, to treat the tissue sufficiently. Furthermore, during the treatment cycle, a
minimum pressure of, e.g., 40 to 80 mm Hg, may be optionally maintained by the
cryogenic liquid or by a gas (e.g., air, carbon dioxide, etc.) to keep the balloon and uterus
open.
[00261           The balloon may be expanded within the uterus and particularly into the
uterine comu by an initial burst of gas or liquid. Other mechanisms may also be used to
facilitate the balloon expansion. One variation may utilize one or more supporting arms
extending from a support which may be deployed within the balloon. The supporting
arms may be variously configured although they are shown in this example in a Y
configuration. Yet another variation may include the supporting arms incorporated into
elongate channels or pockets defined along the balloon itself.
[00271           Aside from the balloon itself and the use of balloons for obstructing the os,
internal os, and/or external os, balloons or inflatable liners may also be used to insulate
the cryogenic fluid during delivery into the balloon to protect the surrounding tissue
structures which are not to be ablated, such as the cervix.
                                                8

[00281           In controlling the ablative treatments described above, the treatment
assembly may be integrated into a single cooling system contained entirely within the
handle assembly or it may be separated into components, as needed or desired. In either
case, the cooling system may generally comprise a microcontroller for monitoring and/or
controlling parameters such as cavity temperature, cavity pressure, exhaust pressure, etc.
[0029]           A coolant reservoir, e.g., nitrous oxide canister, may be fluidly coupled to
the handle and/or elongate shaft via a coolant valve which may be optionally controlled
by the microcontroller. The coolant reservoir may be in fluid communication with the
cooling probe assembly and with the interior of the balloon. Additionally, an exhaust
lumen in communication with the elongate probe and having a back pressure valve may
also include a pressure sensor where one or both of the back pressure sensor and/or valve
may also be in communication with the microcontroller.

                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[01381            Figure 1 shows a perspective view of one example of the treatment
assembly 10 positioned within a working channel 14 of an endoscope 12 (e.g., orally or
nasally insertable scope). In this example, the treatment device 16 itself may utilize a
first catheter 18 having an inflatable or expandable balloon member 22 and a second
catheter 20 that may slide freely with respect to the first catheter 18 and also having an
inflatable balloon member 24 at its distal end. The first catheter 18 as well as second
catheter 20 may have a liquid and/or gas tight seal 30 formed at the proximal end of the
catheters. The inflatable and/or expandable members 22, 24 (shown in this example as
inflated balloons) may be pressurized to effectively and safely occlude the lumen. The
balloons may be filled with chilled or room temperature fluid to prevent possible damage
caused by balloon rupture or seepage around the balloon. Pressure within the inflatable
or expandable balloon members may also be monitored to ensure that a tight seal has
been formed within the lumen or body cavity.
[01391            Additionally, the liquid may be introduced into the treatment area through
a liquid and/or gas port 28 and into the lumen of the catheter which terminates with the
proximal balloon 22 and leaves the catheter through perforations or holes 32 within the
second catheter 20 which terminates in the distal balloon 24, although this flow path may
easily be reversed if necessary. Alternatively, one or more ports can be designed into the
lumen between the distal 24 and proximal 22 balloons, such that the heated or cooling
fluid exits one or more ports 32 in the lumens near the distal balloon 24, and is then
                                                16

evacuated in a port or ports designed within the lumen of the first catheter 18 nearest the
proximal balloon 22. In this variation, the endoscope 12 may insulate the catheters
allowing the catheters to be much smaller than would be otherwise possible and allowing
it to fit within the working channel 14 of a standard endoscope 12. One or more pressure
sensors may be used to detect both inflation pressures of the balloons and/or the pressure
seen by the body cavity/lumen that is exposed to the treatment liquid/vapor. In the
manner, liquid/vapor flow may be controlled by the pressure sensing elements within the
body cavity/lumen to ensure that safe pressures are never exceeded. Manual controls may
be used for creation and/or maintenance of these pressures (e.g. syringes with stopcocks)
or automated and/or semi-automated systems can be used as well (e.g. pumps with PID
loops and pressure sensing interconnectivity. Although the liquid and/or gas for tissue
treatment may be heated or chilled prior to introduction into the treatment area in contact
with the tissue, the liquid and/or gas may alternatively be heated or chilled after
introduction into the treatment area and already in contact with the tissue.
[0140]            Figure 2 shows an example where the second catheter 20 and distal
balloon member 24 is slidable relative to the proximal balloon 22. This examples
illustrates the endoscope inserted through the nasal cavity and advanced through the
esophagus ES where the catheters 18, 20 may comprise single or multi-lumen catheters
having inflation lumens for the distal 24 and proximal 22 inflatable/expandable elements,
infusion port and extraction port. At least one of the catheters may be fitted with either a
pressure transducer 42 or a lumen to carry the pressure signal from the treatment area
back to the controller or dial gauge. Pressure sensing may be accomplished through a
small, air capsule proximal to the distal balloon 24, but within the treatment area. Both of
the balloons 22, 24 may be inflated along the esophagus ES in the proximity to the
gastroesophageal junction GJ proximal to the stomach ST to create a treatment space 40
which encompasses the tissue region to be treated.
[0141]            In an alternative embodiment, an extraction lumen may be omitted as a
preset dose of heated liquid and/or gas may be delivered, allowed to dwell and then either
extracted through the same lumen or rendered harmless with the infusion of cold fluid.
This treatment algorithm would provide an even simpler therapy and would rely on the
exclusion of a certain area and exposure of that area to a liquid or vapor with the desired
energy. Infusion of the liquid or vapor may be controlled to ensure that the treatment area
is not exposed to excessive temperatures.
                                               17

[01421          Figure 3 shows another example where the treatment assembly 10 may be
in communication with a controller 50, such as a logic controller. Controller 50 may
control certain parameters such as infusion pressure 54 of the fluid as well as fluid
temperature 56 and it may be coupled to the assembly by one or more cables 52. The
pressure in the treatment area, the elapsed time, the temperature of the fluid, and the
extraction rate may also be monitored and controlled.
[01431          Figure 4 shows a detail view of the treatment area 40 defined, in this case,
by two balloons 22, 24. The first catheter 18 may open into the lumen just after the
proximal balloon 22 and this catheter 18 may be inserted along with or prior to insertion
of the second catheter 20. The first catheter 18 internal diameter is greater than the outer
diameter of the second catheter allowing for liquid (and/or vapor) to be infused or
extracted around the outer diameter of the second catheter 20. The second catheter 20 a
first lumen for balloon inflation and a second lumen for evacuating the treatment region
40. With the balloons inflated into contact against the esophagus ES, the treatment area
40 may encompass the tissue region to be treated, e.g., a lesion 60 such as Barrett's
esophagus or esophageal cancer lesion and the distal end of the endoscope 12 may be
positioned into close proximity to proximal balloon 22 and the treating liquid and/or gas
66 may be infused through the annular lumen 70 defined through first catheter 18 and
between second catheter 20 such that the fluid 66 may enter through opening 62 into the
treatment region 40 while contained by the balloons. Once treatment has been completed,
the fluid may be evacuated 68 through one or more openings 64 located along the second
catheter 20 proximal to distal balloon 24 and proximally through the second catheter 20
through the evacuation lumen 72. As previously mentioned, a pressure sensor 42 (e.g.,
pressure measuring air capsule) may be positioned along either the first 18 and/or second
20 catheter for sensing the various parameters. Additionally, the treatment liquid and/or
gas may include any number of liquids, vapors, or other chemically active (e.g.,
chemotherapeutic) or inactive compounds for additional treatments to the tissue.
[0144]          In the event that the treatment is provided by a simple timed dwell, the
extraction 72 and infusion 70 lumens may not both be utilized. The pressure sensing
element 42 (solid-state, piezoelectric, or other method) may be located on either the first
or second catheters and the second catheter and may comprise a simple slidable balloon.
A pressure sensor for the treatment may be omitted so long as the pressure can be
controlled by other mechanisms, e.g., a check valve or a simple gravity fluid column. An
                                               18

active pressure measurement, though, may ensure that safe pressures are not being
exceeded.
[0145]           The second catheter 20 may fit easily within the first catheter 18 and may
be slid inside the first catheter 18 until its distal balloon 24 is distal to the first balloon 22.
The distal balloon 24 may then be inflated just beyond the distal portion of the treatment
area 40 and the endoscope 12 may be pulled back. The most proximal extent of the lesion
60 may then be identified and the proximal balloon 22 may be inflated proximal to this
area. Once the treatment area 40 has been enclosed (which may be verified by infusing
liquid 66 and/or vapor under visualization and observing the seal around the balloon,
balloons and/or expandable member) the lumen or body cavity may then be filled with the
treatment liquid and/or vapor to a safe pressure. The liquid and/or vapor may also contain
active agents (e.g. chemotherapeutic and/or anesthetic agents) and comprise more than
simply an inactive liquid and/or vapor. Options would be for the active agents to be
delivered prior to, during and/or post treatment of the heating (or cooling) liquid and/or
vapor.
[0146]           As the treatment assembly 16 does not contain the treatment liquid or
vapor within a balloon(s) or expandable member and allows it to freely flow over the
treatment area, the therapy may be applied consistently leaving no areas left untreated (as
is frequently seen with balloon infusion-based or RF therapies). Additionally, treatment
may be accomplished with a heated liquid (rather than a high energy electrode or
excessively hot vapor) or a more controlled treatment can be achieved through the use of
a relatively cooler liquid with a longer treatment time. In addition, the esophagus ES is a
fluid transport type organ (lumen) and may be more compatible to fluid based therapies
than with RF-based therapies. It is also believed that the safety margin of such treatments
may be better than with an RF-based therapy.
[01471           Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment of the device in which the first
catheter 18 and second catheter 20 of the treatment assembly 16 may be inserted
alongside an endoscope 12 which may be used to provide for visualization. Due to the
small size of the catheters, this embodiment is feasible.
[01481           Figures 6A to 6C illustrate an example for a placement procedure for the
assembly for the treatment of a body lumen such as the esophagus ES. The catheters may
be inserted simultaneously or separately through the working channel of the endoscope
12. In one example, the larger first catheter 18 may be inserted first followed by insertion
of the second catheter 20 within the lumen of the first catheter 18. Once both single or
                                                  19

multi-lumen balloon catheters have been inserted and after the endoscope 12 has been
advanced through the esophagus ES and into proximity to the tissue treatment region, the
distal balloon 24 may be advanced to define the distal end of the treatment area and
inflated (e.g., with chilled, room or body temperature fluid) while under visualization
through the endoscope 12, as shown in Figure 6A. The endoscope 12 may then be pulled
back until the proximal end of the desired treatment area has been identified and the
proximal balloon 22 may be slid over the shaft of the second catheter 20 and inflated
(e.g., with chilled, room or body temperature fluid) at a site just proximal to the most
proximal portion of the lesion, as shown in Figure 6B.
[0149]           With the treatment area 40 now enclosed by these balloons, an optional
pressure capsule 42 (e.g., solid state, piezoeletric or other pressure sensing method) may
be inflated and the treatment may proceed, as shown in Figure 6C. The treatment
session then exposes the lumen or body cavity to fluid pressurized to a positive pressure
in the range of, e.g., 5-100 cmH20 (although this pressure may be maintained at a level
below
an inflation pressure of the inflation balloons) at temperatures between, e.g., 50 and 100
degrees Celsius, for a period of, e.g., 1 second to 10 minutes. Additionally and/or
alternatively, the treatment area 40 may be lavaged for a period of time with an anesthetic
(e.g., lidocaine or bupivicaine) to reduce pain with the procedure prior to the application
of thermal energy or other active compounds. Accordingly, ablation may be
accomplished at a consistent depth of, e.g., about 0.5 mm, throughout the esophagus ES.
[0150]           Figures 7A to 7C illustrate another example for treatment of an enclosed
body cavity (shown here as a bladder BL). In this example, a single balloon may be used
to effect infusion and extraction of the treatment fluid. Pressure may be monitored to
ensure that the therapy is safe and a relatively lower temperature fluid may be used (e.g.,
42-100 C) so that the entire cavity may see a controlled, uniform thermal load. The order
or catheter placement may vary as may the sequence for balloon inflation or exposure to
active or inactive liquid or vapors in this or any embodiment of the device. As shown in
Figure 7A, an endoscope (or cystoscope) 12 may be inserted into the target organ BL then
fluid catheter 20 may be advanced into the lumen. With the endoscope 12 inserted and
occlusion balloon inflated 24 (e.g., with unheated fluid) to seal the organ, a pressure
sensor 42 may also be optionally inflated to measure pressure, as shown in Figure 7B.
Optionally, an anesthetic or pre-treatment medication may be delivered into the bladder
BL, if so desired. Then, a high or low temperature fluid 80 may be circulated within the
                                               20

bladder BL under pressure adequate to safely distend the organ to ensure complete
treatment, as shown in Figure 7C.
[0151]           Figures 8A to 8C illustrate another example for treatment where the use a
fluid lavage to prepare the treatment area (here shown as the bladder BL) may be
accomplished prior to application of thermal (or cooling) energy and/or active
compounds. As previously described, the endoscope 12 and catheter 20 may be
introduced into the bladder BL and subsequently sealed with the occlusion balloon 24, as
shown in Figures 8A and 8B. Preparation of the treatment area may involve use of an
anesthetic to decrease pain during therapy or the use of an arterial constrictor to reduce
blood flow to the organ or lumen. Alternatively, other pre-treatment fluids 82 may
include, e.g., anesthetic, vascular constrictor, chilled fluid, active component antidote, etc.
The pre-treatment fluid 82 may be evacuated (or left within the bladder BL) and the
lavage with the treatment fluid 80 may be introduced into the bladder BL for treatment, as
shown in Figure 8C.
[0152]           Alternatively, the pre-treatment fluid 82 may also be chilled (or heated) to
cool (or warm) the lumen or organ prior to treatment so that the thermal (or cooling)
energy may be applied to the internal surface of the lumen or body cavity with minimal
transmission or conduction of the elevated (or cooling) temperatures to the submucosal
tissues (or tissues lining the body organ or lumen). Utilizing the pre-treatment of the area
may avoid damage to the underlying tissues to thereby avoid many of the complications
of therapy. For example, strictures and/or stenosis (or tightening) of the tissue can be
avoided by controlling the depth of penetration which may be controlled by pre-treating
the area with a chilled fluid so that the submucosa can absorb significant amounts of heat
without reaching damaging temperatures.
[0153]           The depth of penetration may also be controlled through the use of a lower
temperature fluid for thermal ablation so that the submucosa can cool itself with its robust
vascular circulation (which is less robust in the mucosa and epithelium). In the event that
an active compound is used, as well, an antidote to this compound may be delivered to the
patient (either systemically or as a local pre-treatment) so that the underlying tissues and
submucosa are not damaged. One example of this is the use of powerful antioxidants
(systemically or locally) prior to lavage of the esophagus with, e.g., methotrexate. The
methotrexate may have a powerful effect on the tissues to which it is directly exposed in
the lumen or body cavity, but the anti-oxidants may prevent deeper penetration of the
methotrexate. The neutralizing compound may also be placed within the balloon or in the
                                               21

lumen of surrounding lumens or body cavities to prevent exposure of these areas in the
event of balloon rupture.
[0154]           Figure 9 shows another example where the distal occlusion member may
be configured into an umbrella-like element 90 which may be expanded in the stomach
ST and placed over a tissue region which is typically difficult to occlude by a balloon.
For instance, such a shape may allow for ablation of the lower esophageal sphincter LES
at the gastroesophageal junction (or other sphincter region if used elsewhere). The
expandable, umbrella-like structure 90 may form a firm seal at this site while allowing the
ablation fluid (hot or cold) to contact the entire gastroesophageal junction. Once
expanded, the umbrella-like element 90 maybe held firmly against the stomach ST by
traction on the endoscope 12 or by a tensioning element on the catheter and balloon itself.
[0155]           In addition, this element 90 may optionally incorporate a biased or spring
loaded element or other external force mechanism to provide steady pressure and a firm
seal against the stomach lining. Alternative structures may also incorporate a more
complex, nitinol cage (or other rigid material) connected by a thin, water-tight film. For
example, nitinol may be used to decrease the overall profile of the obstruction element
and increase its strength and durability.
[01561           Figure 10 shows another example which utilizes an endoscopic balloon
sheath utilized as a distal occluder allowing for exposure and treatment of the distal
gastroesophageal junction. In this embodiment, the second catheter 20 may have a distal
occlusion balloon 100 which may be passed through the working channel of the
endoscope 12 or through a channel incorporated into the balloon sheath itself (outside of
the actual endoscope). Once expanded into an enlarged shape, the balloon 100 may be
retracted to fit entirely over the lower esophageal junction LES to form the distal seal by
traction on the endoscope 12 or by a tensioning element on the catheter and balloon itself.
This gastric occlusion balloon may allow for exposure of the gastroesophageal junction
while preventing fluid flow into the stomach ST. The balloon 22 may be configured to be
saddle-shaped, circular, wedge-shaped, etc. It may also be self-expanding and non
inflatable.
[01571           Additionally, the proximal balloon 22 may be configured to be part of
sheath that is placed over the tip of the endoscope 12 or it may be formed directly upon
the endoscope tip itself. An inflation lumen may run inside the endoscope 12 or it may
run alongside the endoscope 12 in a sheath or catheter. The balloon sheath may also
incorporate a temperature sensor, pressure sensor, etc. Moreover, the proximal occlusion
                                               22

balloon 22 may optionally incorporate a temperature or pressure sensing element for the
therapy and it may be positioned either through the working channel(s) of the endoscope
 12 or alongside the endoscope 12 within the endoscopic balloon sheath.
 [0158]         In yet another embodiment, in order to reduce the risks associated with
fluid flow and lavage, a fluid or gel may be infused into the esophagus between the
balloons then heated or frozen in situ in order to provide the desired ablative effect
without circulating any fluid or gel. In one example of this configuration, a gel may be
infused into the esophagus and pressurized to a safe level (e.g., 30-100 mmHg) which
may be then rapidly chilled using, for example, a compressed gas and/or a Peltier
junction-type cooling element. The gel may freeze at a temperature below that of water
and allow for rapid transmission of the ablative temperature to the tissues being treated.
This gel may also be a liquid with a freezing point below that of water in which case the
treatment zone may be lavaged with this fluid prior to treatment to remove free water and
prevent crystal formation during therapy. Once the therapy has been completed, the gel
or liquid may be removed or left in the esophagus to be passed into the stomach. In the
event that a Peltier cooling or heating element is used, the polarity may be reversed once
therapy is complete in order to reverse the temperature and terminate the ablation session.
 [0159]         The distance from the lower end of the distal most portion of the catheter
can be on the order of about 150mm. The distance between the proximal and distal
balloons are adjustable by the operator but can be adjusted, e.g., from as small as 0mm to
as large as 25cm. The treatment zone may have a range of, e.g., 3 to 15cm.
 [0160]         In yet an additional embodiment, an energy generator (e.g., a RF electrode
or hot wire or other energy source) may be advanced into the treatment area in a
protective sheath (to prevent direct contact with body tissues) and energy may be applied
to the treatment fluid to heat it to the desired temperature. Once the fluid is adequately
heated and enough time has passed to achieve a controlled ablation, the fluid may then be
evacuated or neutralized with the influx of colder fluid. This embodiment would allow
for a very low-profile design and would not require any fluid heating element outside of
the body.
 [01611         In another variation, the cavity or lumen may be exposed to the hot water at
a temperature of less than, e.g., 100 degrees Celsius, but greater than, e.g., 42 degrees
Celsius, to allow for easier control of the treatment due a longer treatment period.   Ranges
for optimal hyperthermic treatment include temperatures between, e.g., 42 and 100 C and
exposure periods ranging from, e.g., 15 seconds to 15 minutes. In this embodiment,
                                                23

treatment may be effected with an active (e.g., Methotrexate) or inactive fluid at a
temperature of, e.g., 90 degrees C, for a period of, e.g., 5-60 seconds, depending on the
depth of penetration desired.
[0162]           Figure 11 shows another example of an endoscopic balloon sheath which
may be used to provide proximal occlusion of the treatment area 40 and may house one or
more of the temperature and pressure sensors. This variation may incorporate a
stirring/agitating or recirculation mechanism 110 incorporated into the device which may
actuated within the treatment area 40 once the treatment fluid has been introduced to
allow for even cooling/heating. The distal occlusion balloon 100 may be inflated within
the stomach ST and pulled proximally with controlled traction against the gastric portion
of the lower esophageal sphincter LES, as previously described.
[0163]           In this example, a chilled liquid lavage (or vapor infusion) may then be
initiated and the tissue ablated via freezing. A pre-treatment lavage, e.g., a hypertonic,
hyperosmotic saline solution, may be introduced with above freezing temperatures
followed by a sub-zero temperature lavage to ablate the tissues within the treatment area
40. The hypertonic, hyperosmotic fluid may achieve temperatures down to, e.g., -40
degrees C, without creating ice crystals in the treatment area 40 due to the pre-treatment
lavage removing any free water. The treatment fluid following the pre-treatment lavage
may have temperatures of, e.g., -2 degrees C to -40 degrees C, for ablation or more
particularly a temperature range of, e.g., -5 degrees C to -20 degrees C. This temperature
range may allow for freezing and crystal formation in the exposed tissues without
damaging the underlying submucosa (which is protected by the circulation of body
temperature blood that prevents freezing). This temperature range can also be easily
achieved with hypersalination of aqueous fluid using sodium chloride and may inhibit any
undesired damage to tissues with brief contact. Also, the use of a heavily salinated or
other sub-zero solution lavage may provide optimal sealing of the occluding balloons in
that any sub-zero temperatures outside of the pre-lavaged treatment zone may form an
impaction of ice crystals and prevent any further fluid flow outside of the treatment zone.
This hypersalinated water solution is but one freezing solution, though, and any aqueous
or non-aqueous liquid or vapor that can be infused and extracted at this temperature could
be used. Alternatively, cryoablative fluid can simply comprise nitrous oxide (N 2 0) or be
formed by cooling ethanol or another aqueous or lipophilic fluid with subzero cooling
temps with compressed gas or dry ice. In another alternative, compressed C02 or dry ice
                                               24

may be introduced into the fluid (e.g., ethanol, butylenes glycol, propylene glycol, etc) to
cool it to, e.g., -50 degrees C or below.
[0164]            Despite the potential for toxicity, ethanol may be used for a liquid lavage
since ethanol resists freezing down to -118 C and is relatively biocompatible although
ethanol is dose dependent for toxicity. A liquid lavage with about 75% to 99.9% ethanol
concentrations may be utilized to good effect and have been demonstrated to show that a
freeze layer develops very rapidly which also inhibits further ethanol absorption. For
instance, a concentration of 95% ethanol may be introduced at a temperature of about,
e.g., -80 to -50 degrees C, for a treatment time of about, e.g., 5 minutes, utilizing 0.25 to
0.5 liters of the cryogenic fluid. An ethanol copper composition may also be very useful
since ethanol resists freezing whereas aqueous fluids will freeze and expand thereby
moving the metal particle out of direct contact with the tissue.
[0165]            In the event that nitrous oxide is used as the cryogenic fluid, the nitrous
may be introduced through a nozzle or spray at a pressure of, e.g., 600-800 psi, at a
temperature of about -88 degrees C. Such a temperature and pressure may be utilized for
a treatment time of about, e.g., 3 minutes.
[0166]            The use of a subzero solution within this range may also allow for fine
control of the treatment depth as tissue damage would not begin to occur until a
temperature differential of about 37 degrees C is achieved (assuming a body temperature
of 37 C), but once this threshold is reached tissue damage occurs rapidly due to ice
crystal formation. In contrast, tissue damage is on a continuous spectrum with
hyperthermia and damage may begin to occur at a temperature differential of, e.g., 5
degrees C. Thus, the ability of the vasculature to protect the underlying tissues from
damage is greatly reduced due to the small difference between the temperature of
protective blood versus the temperature of the ablating fluid. With hypothermic lavage,
the protective blood may differ by, e.g., 37 degrees C, in temperature and may thus allow
for control of ablation depth based on the temperature of the fluid lavage and the time of
exposure.
[01671            Figure 12 illustrates another variation where a conforming balloon 111
having an adjustable size in diameter as well as in length may be positioned along or near
the distal end of the catheter 18. The conforming balloon 111 may be advanced within
the esophagus (shown here in the esophagus but applicable to any cavity) in a collapsed
state. Once the balloon 111 has been desirably positioned along the length of the
esophagus ES to be treated, the catheter 18 may optionally utilize a vacuum which may
                                                25

be drawn along the entire length of the balloon 111 through perforations or openings in
the balloon 111 to serve as a safeguard to prevent migration of ablation liquid, gas, and/or
conductive material in the event of balloon rupture. The vacuum may also be utilized to
remove air, fluids or particulate between the outer wall of the balloon 111 and the tissue
to improve contact and thermal transfer from the hyperthemic or cryogenic fluid and to
the tissue. Additionally and/or alternatively, a distal vacuum may be drawn through a
distal port 117 distal to the balloon 111 either alone or in conjunction with a proximal
vacuum port 115 proximal to the balloon 115.
[01681          With the catheter 18 and balloon 111 desirably positioned for treatment, an
insulating sheath 113 may be advanced over the catheter 18 and over the length of the
balloon 111 to vary an inflation length of the balloon 111 emerging from the insulating
sheath 113. The variable length of the inflated balloon 111 may be adjusted to allow for
treatment of any varying lengths of the esophagus ES during a single ablation treatment.
Such a design may prevent dangerous ablation overlap zones of ablated tissue.
[01691          The balloon 111 itself may be comprised of a compliant or non-compliant
material but in either case be capable of directly contacting the tissues to be ablated.
The balloon 111 may accordingly be filled with a hyperthemic or cryogenic material
and/or may use liquid, gas, and/or conductive solids, as described herein.
[01701          Although illustrated esophageal therapy, this therapy could be used in any
body cavity/lumen for therapeutic purposes including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal
therapy, stomal tightening (e.g., post bariatric surgery), urogynecologic uses (treatment of
cervical pre-cancers or cancers, endometrial lining treatment, stress incontinence
therapy), prostate therapy, intravascular therapy (e.g., varicose veins) or treatment of any
other body cavity/lumen. In the event that an entire body cavity is being treated (e.g., the
entire uterus) a single balloon system may suffice to exclude the entire cavity. The fluid
cycling or dwell may then be accomplished with use of a pressure-controlled exposure of
the cavity or lumen.
[01711          Figures 13A and 13B show another example of how the system may be
introduced into, e.g., a uterus UT, through the cervix for treatment via the lavage catheter
20. In this example, the catheter 20 may have a diameter of about, e.g., 8 mm, or in other
examples, a diameter of about, e.g., less than 6 mm. Infusion of the lavage fluid may
fully distend or partially distend the uterine walls. Optionally, catheter 20 may
incorporate a tip 120 to perform one or more functions including, e.g., an expandable
cage or scaffold to prevent direct exposure of a cryoprobe to the tissue walls of the uterus
                                               26

UT, an agitator or recirculator to ensure even distribution of cryoablation effect, etc. As
previously described, the system may be used with lavage or with infusion then cryoprobe
chilling of fluid. In an alternate embodiment, infusion of an antifreeze fluid and insertion
of the cryprobe may be done separately with chilling of the anti-freeze done after the
cryoprobe insertion.
[0172]           In this and other examples, the therapy may be guided by time/temperature
tracking or visualization (e.g., hysteroscope, endoscope, ultrasound, etc.). Pressure may
be regulated by a pressure sensor in line with the infusion or extraction lumen or a
dedicated pressure lumen in a multi-lumen catheter. Additionally, pressure may also be
regulated by limiting infusion pressure (e.g., height of infusion bag, maximum pressure of
infusion pump, etc.). Any organ, body cavity or lumen may be treated using the
described lavage and/or infusion/cryoprobe technique described here for the uterus.
[0173]           Figures 14A and 14B illustrate another variation of a treatment system
which utilizes a thermally conductive array of fibers, cage, or lattice 130 which may be
deployed within the uterus UT. In this variation, the endoscope 12 may be advanced
through the cervix and at least partially into the uterus UT where the array of fibers or
lattice 130 may be deployed from the endoscope 12 distal end where the array 130 may
be positioned in a compressed state for delivery, as shown in Figure 14A. The array 130
may be advanced into the uterus UT where it may then be expanded into a deployed
configuration 130', as shown in Figure 14B. The individual cryogenic probes of the
expanded array 130' may be in fanned out relative to the distal end of the endoscope 12 in
various directions to come into direct contact or close proximity to the tissue to be treated.
[0174]           Following deployment, the deployed array 130' may be cooled rapidly to
transmit the heat within the uterine walls to the array 130' to provide a consistent
cryoablative effect throughout the body cavity or lumen. The members of the array 130'
may be cooled either via conductive cooling or by an infusion of a cooling fluid (as
described herein) through the members of the array 130'. Similar to the conductive fluid,
the cooled array 130' may provide for the consistent ablation of the entire lumen with a
single application of the array 130'. The individual members of the array 130'
[01751           Additionally and/or alternatively, the array 130' may be used in
conjunction with a fluid infusion and/or lavage in order to optimize therapy. One or more
sizes and shapes of the array 130' may be available depending on the size and shape of
the cavity to be treated. Moreover, the array 130' may be formed from any material so
                                               27

long as it has a thermal conductivity greater than, e.g., 2 W/m-K, such as a metal with a
relatively high thermal conductivity.
[01761          Figure 15 shows another variation of a device which may utilize cryogenic
lavage treatment within the uterus UT. In this example, the distal end of the endoscope
12 may be advanced through the cervix CV and into the uterus UT where a cryoprobe
140 may be deployed, as shown. One or more inflatable balloons 144 may be expanded,
e.g., within the external os, or a balloon 142 along the outer surface of the endoscope 12
may be inflated within the length of the os itself. Alternatively, a single balloon (e.g.,
having an hourglass or dumbbell shape) may be inflated to block both the external os and
the length of the os itself. With the uterus UT obstructed, the cryogenic treatment or
lavage may be performed within the uterine lumen.
[01771          Another variation is illustrated in Figure 16 which shows endoscope 12
advanced through the cervix CV with the distal end 156 positioned within the uterine
lumen. An optional balloon 152 located near the endoscope distal end may be inflated
within the uterus UT and then pulled proximally against the internal os with a fixed
amount of tension to obstruct the opening. Additionally and/or alternatively, a proximal
balloon 154 positioned along the endoscope 12 proximally of where the cervix CV is
located may also inflated to further provide for obstruction of the entire os. Then external
cervical engagement portion, e.g., proximal balloon 154, may be fixed in place relative
portion of the endoscope 12 spanning the cervical os to provide consistent tension. The
proximal balloon 154 may also have a spring-type function to provide for consistent
tension regardless of tissue relaxation and accommodation.
[0178]          With the uterus UT obstructed, the endoscope 12 may then be used to
provide for the cryogenic treatment or lavage. Optionally, the endoscope 12 may also
incorporate one or more vacuum ports along the length of the shaft to seal and provide a
safeguard against fluid flow out of the uterus UT.
[01791          Optionally, the uterine cornu may be temporarily obstructed to block the
openings of one or both Fallopian tubes prior to the cryogenic treatment. The occlusive
element(s) 158A, 158B may comprise, e.g., balloons, inserts, energy-based ablation to
contract the aperture, hydrophilic or hydrophobic gel-based solutions, or any other
modality that is capable of reversibly or irreversibly sealing the Fallopian tube. The
optional Fallopian tube occlusion may be temporary or permanent (if sterility is desired).
[0180]          Once the cryogenic procedure has been completed, the occlusive elements
158A, 158B may be removed or allowed to passively erode. Alternatively, they may be
                                               28

left occluded for those desiring sterility. Occluding the uterine cornu prior to a lavage
may allow for greater fluid pressure and fluid flow within the uterus UT.
[0181]           Figures 17A and 17B illustrate another variation of a low-pressure
conforming balloon. In this variation, a conforming balloon 160 may be deployed from
the distal end 156 of the endoscope 12 and then inflated with the cryogenic liquid/gas (as
described herein) while in uterus UT. The balloon 160 may be formed to resist rupture at
low and high temperatures and may be further configured to conform well to the anatomy
of the uterus UT. For example, the balloon 160 when inflated may have a shape which
approximates the lumen in which it is inflated and/or come in various sizes to
accommodate different patient anatomies. In the present example, the expanded balloon
160' may be formed to taper and have two portions rounded portions for expanding into
intimate contact at the uterine comu UC, as shown, without painful deformation or
distention of the uterus UT at a pressure, e.g., less than 150 mmHg.
[0182]           Moreover, the expanded balloon 160' may have a wall which is relatively
thin (e.g., 0.040 in. or less) to facilitate thermal conduction through the balloon. The
balloon 160 may also be sufficiently thin such that folding of the balloon 160 on itself
does not create a significant thermal barrier allowing for an even ablation in the event that
a non-compliant balloon is used. For treatment, the expanded balloon 160' may be filled
with the cryogenic liquid, gas or a thermally conductive compound (as described above)
to subject the contacted tissue to either cryogenic and/or hyperthermic injury (e.g., steam,
plasma, microwave, RF, hot water, etc). Additionally and/or alternatively, the balloon
160' may also be used to transmit photodynamic therapy light to the uterus UT or
esophagus ES. This modality may be used to achieve ablation of any body cavity or
lumen.
[01831           Additionally, one or more vacuum ports may be used anywhere along the
length of the shaft to seal and provide a safeguard against fluid flow out of the uterus UT
in the event of balloon rupture. Additionally, one or more inflatable os balloon 160 may
also be used to block the internal or external os, as also described above.
[0184]           In another variation, to facilitate the balloon expanding and conforming
readily against the tissue walls of the uterus UT, the balloon may be inflated with a gas or
liquid. Alternatively, as shown in Figures 18A to 18D, the balloon may be filled partially
or completely with a conductive material. As shown in Figure 18A, once the elongate
shaft 170 has been introduced through the cervix CV and into the uterus UT, the distal
opening 172 of the shaft 170 may be positioned distal to the internal os and balloon 174
                                                 29

may be deployed either from within the shaft 170 or from an external sheath (described
below in further detail). The balloon may be deployed and allowed to unfurl or unwrap
within the uterus UT, as shown in Figure 18B. The cooling probe 178 may be introduced
through the shaft 172 and into the balloon interior (or introduced after insertion of the
conductive elements).
[01851           Because the balloon 174 is used to contact the tissue and thermally
conduct the heat through the balloon, the balloon material may be comprised of various
materials such as polyurethane, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyether ether
ketone (PEEK), low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), or any number of other conformable polymers.
Moreover, the balloon material may have a thickness which remains flexible and strong
yet sufficiently thermally conductive, e.g., about 0.0005 to 0.015 in. Such a thickness
may allow for the balloon to remain supple enough to conform desirably to the underlying
tissue anatomy and may also provide sufficient clarity for visualizing through the material
with, e.g., a hysteroscope.
[01861           The conductive elements 182 may be introduced into the balloon interior
through an annular opening 180 within the distal end 172 of the shaft, as shown in Figure
18C, until the balloon 174 is at least partially or completely filled with the elements 182.
The conductive elements 182 may generally comprise any number of thermally
conductive elements such as copper spheres or some other inert metal such as gold.
These conductive elements 182 may be atraumatic in shape and are small enough to fill
the balloon interior and conform the balloon walls against the uterine walls UW to ensure
consistent contact with the tissue, e.g., about 20 ml in volume of the elements 182. The
conductive elements 182 may also help to fill any air pockets which may form
particularly near the tapered portions 176 of the balloon and insulate the tissue from the
ablative effects of the cryoablative fluid. For instance, the conductive elements 182 may
be formed into spheres having a diameter of, e.g., 0.8 mm to 4 mm or larger. To ensure
that conductive elements 182 are fully and evenly dispersed throughout the balloon
interior, the elements 182 may be introduced through the shaft 170 via an ejector or push
rod, auger, compressed air, etc. In particular, the conductive elements 182 may fill the
tapered portions 176 of the balloon 174 to ensure that the balloon is positioned proximate
to and in contact with the uterine cornu UC to fully treat the interior of the uterus UT, as
shown in Figure 18D.
                                               30

[01871          With the conductive elements 182 placed within the balloon 174, the
cryoablative fluid may be introduced within and through the balloon 174 such that the
conductive elements 182 facilitate the thermal transfer from the contacted uterine walls
UW. Once the cryoablative treatment has been completed, the conductive elements 182
may be removed through the shaft 170 via a vacuum force or other mechanical or
electromechanical mechanisms and the balloon 174, once emptied, may also be
withdrawn from the uterus UT.
[01881          The cooling probe 178 introduced into the interior of the balloon 174 may
comprise a number of different configurations which facilitate the introduction of the
cryoablative fluid into the balloon 174. One such variation, similar to the variation shown
above in Figure 14B, is illustrated in the detail view of Figure 19. In this variation, the
shaft 178 may have one or more cooling members 190A, 190B, 190C, 190D which
project from the distal end of the shaft 178 at various angles. Although illustrated with
four cooling members extending from the shaft 178, any number of cooling members may
be used at a variety of different angles and lengths as desired. Moreover, the cooling
members may be fabricated from a number of materials, e.g., polyimide, Nitinol, etc.,
which are sufficiently strong and temperature resistant for the relatively low temperature
of the fluid. Each of the cooling members 190A, 190B, 190C, 190D in this example may
each have an occluded tip 192 and at least one opening 194 defined along the side of the
cooling member. The cryoablative fluid may be flowed through the shaft 178 and into
each cooling member where the fluid may then be sprayed or ejected through the
respective openings 194 for distribution throughout the interior of the balloon for cooling
the contacted uterine tissue.
[01891          Another variation of the cooling probe is illustrated in the detail view of
Figure 20 which shows elongate shaft 178 having a rotating base 200 and spray member
202 positioned upon shaft 178. The spray member 202 may have a surface which is
meshed, latticed, perforated, etc. such that the cryoablative fluid introduced through the
shaft 178 may enter the rotating base 200 and spray member 202 where it may be evenly
dispersed through the spray member 202 and into the interior of the balloon 174 for
treatment. The pressure of the fluid may rotate the base 200 about its longitudinal axis, as
shown, to further facilitate the distribution of the cryoablative fluid within the balloon
174.
[0190]          The cooling probe 178 as well as the balloon assembly may be variously
configured, for instance, in an integrated treatment assembly 210 as shown in the side
                                               31

view of Figure 21A. In this variation, the assembly 210 may integrated the elongate shaft
170 having the balloon 174 extending therefrom with the cooling probe 178 positioned
translatably within the shaft 170 and balloon 174. A separate translatable sheath 212 may
be positioned over the elongate shaft 170 and both the elongate shaft 170 and sheath 212
may be attached to a handle assembly 214. The handle assembly 214 may further
comprise an actuator 216 for controlling a translation of the sheath 212 for balloon 174
delivery and deployment. The sheath 212 may be configured to have a diameter of, e.g.,
5.5 mm or less, to prevent the need for dilating the cervix.
[0191]           With the sheath 212 positioned over the elongate shaft 170 and balloon
174, the assembly 210 may be advanced through the cervix and into the uterus UT where
the sheath 212 may be retracted via the handle assembly 214 to deploy the balloon 174, as
shown in Figure 21B. As described above, once the balloon 174 is initially deployed
from the sheath 212, it may be expanded by an initial burst of a gas, e.g., air, carbon
dioxide, etc., or by the cryogenic fluid. In particular, the tapered portions of the balloon
174 may be expanded to ensure contact with the uterine cornu. The handle assembly 214
may also be used to actuate and control a longitudinal position of the cooling probe 178
relative to the elongate shaft 170 and balloon 174 as indicated by the arrows.
[0192]           In another variation of the treatment assembly, Figure 21 C shows a
perspective view of a cryoablation assembly having a handle assembly 211 which may
integrate the electronics and pump assembly 215 within the handle itself. An exhaust
tube 213 may also be seen attached to the handle assembly 211 for evacuating exhausted
or excess cryoablative fluid or gas from the liner 174. Any of the cryogenic fluids or
gases described herein may be utilized, e.g., compressed liquid-to-gas phase change of a
compressed gas such as nitrous oxide (N 2 0), carbon dioxide (C0 2 ), Argon, etc. The
cooling probe 178 may be seen extending from sheath 212 while surrounded or enclosed
by the balloon or liner 174. Hence, the handle assembly 211 with coupled cooling probe
178 and liner 174 may provide for a single device which may provide for pre-treatment
puff-up or inflation of the liner 174, active cryoablation treatment, and/or post-treatment
thaw cycles.
[0193]           The handle assembly 211 may also optionally incorporate a display for
providing any number of indicators and/or alerts to the user. For instance, an LCD
display may be provided on the handle assembly 211 (or to a separate control unit
connected to the handle assembly 211) where the display counts down the treatment time
in seconds as the ablation is occurring. The display may also be used to provide
                                                32

measured pressure or temperature readings as well as any number of other indicators,
symbols, or text, etc., for alerts, instructions, or other indications. Moreover, the display
may be configured to have multiple color-coded outputs, e.g., green, yellow, and red.
When the assembly is working through the ideal use case, the LED may be displayed as a
solid green color. When the device requires user input (e.g. when paused and needing the
user to press the button to re-start treatment) the LED may flash or display yellow.
Additionally, when the device has faulted and treatment is stopped, the LED may flash or
display a solid red color.
[0194]           Figure 21D shows the handle assembly 211 in a perspective exploded view
to illustrate some of the components which may be integrated within the handle 211. As
shown, the liner 174 and sheath 212 may be coupled to a sheath bearing assembly 219
and slider base block assembly 221 for controlling the amount of exposed treatment
length along the cooling probe 178 (and as described in further detail below). An
actuatable sheath control 223 may be attached to the slider base block assembly 221 for
manually controlling the treatment length of the cooling probe 178 as well. Along with
the electronics and pump assembly 215 (which may optionally incorporate a
programmable processor or controller in electrical communication with any of the
mechanisms within the handle 211), an exhaust valve 217 (e.g., actuated via a solenoid)
may be coupled to the exhaust line 213 for controlling not only the outflow of the
exhausted cryoablation fluid or gas but also for creating or increasing a backpressure
during treatment, as described in further detail below.
[0195]           In one example of how the handle assembly 211 may provide for
treatment, Figures 21E to 21G illustrate schematic side views of how the components
may be integrated and utilized with one another. As described herein, once the sheath
212 and/or liner 174 has been advanced and initially introduced into the uterus, the liner
174 may be expanded or inflated in a pre-treatment puff up to expand the liner 174 into
contact against the uterine tissue surfaces in preparation for a cryoablation treatment. As
illustrated in the side view of Figure 21E, a pump 225 integrated within the handle
assembly 211 may be actuated and a valve 229 (e.g., actuatable or passive) fluidly
coupled to the pump 225 may be opened (as indicated schematically by an "0" over both
the pump 225 and valve 229) such that ambient air may be drawn in through, e.g., an air
filter 227 integrated along the handle 211, and passed through an air line 231 within the
handle and to an exhaust block 233. The exhaust block 233 and air line 231 may be
fluidly coupled to the tubular exhaust channel which extends from the handle 211 which
                                                 33

is further attached to the cooling probe 178. As the air is introduced into the interior of
the liner 174 (indicated by the arrows), the liner 174 may be expanded into contact
against the surrounding uterine tissue surface.
[0196]           A cryogenic fluid line 235 also extending into and integrated within the
handle assembly211 may be fluidly coupled to an actuatable valve 237, e.g., actuated via
a solenoid, which may be manually closed or automatically closed (as indicated
schematically by an "X" over the valve 237) by a controller to prevent the introduction of
the cryoablative fluid or gas into the liner 174 during the pre-treatment liner expansion.
An infusion line 239 may be fluidly coupled to the valve 237 and may also be coupled
along the length of the sheath 212 and probe 178, as described in further detail below.
The exhaust valve 217 coupled to the exhaust line 213 may also be closed (as indicated
schematically by an "X" over the valve 217) manually or automatically by the controller
to prevent the escape of the air from the exhaust block 233.
[01971           During this initial liner expansion, the liner 174 may be expanded in a
gradual and controlled manner to minimize any pain which may be experienced by the
patient in opening the uterine cavity. Hence, the liner 174 may be expanded gradually by
metering in small amounts of air. Optionally, the pump 225 may be programmed and
controlled by a processor or microcontroller to expand the liner 174 according to an
algorithm (e.g., e.g. ramp-up pressure quickly to 10 mm Hg and then slow-down the
ramp-up as the pressure increases to 85 mm Hg) which may be stopped or paused by the
user. Moreover, the liner 174 may be expanded to a volume which is just sufficient to
take up space within the uterine cavity. After the initial increase in pressure, the pressure
within the liner 174 may be optionally increased in bursts or pulses. Moreover,
visualization (e.g., via a hysteroscope or abdominal ultrasound) may be optionally used
during the controlled gradual expansion to determine when the uterine cavity is fully open
and requires no further pressurization. In yet another variation, the liner 174 may be
cyclically inflated and deflated to fully expand the liner. The inflations and deflations
may be partial or full depending upon the desired expansion.
[0198]           In yet another alternative variation, the system could also use an amount of
air pumped into the liner 174 as a mechanism for detecting whether the device is in a
false passage of the body rather than the uterine cavity to be treated. The system could
use the amount of time that the pump 225 is on to track how much air has been pushed
into the liner 174. If the pump 225 fails to reach certain pressure levels within a
predetermined period of time, then the controller may indicate that the device is
                                                34

positioned within a false passage. There could also be a limit to the amount of air
allowed to be pushed into the liner 174 as a way to detect whether the probe 178 has been
pushed, e.g., out into the peritoneal cavity. If too much air is pushed into the liner 174
(e.g., the volume of air tracked by the controller exceeds a predetermined level) before
reaching certain pressures, then the controller may indicate the presence of a leak or that
the liner 174 is not fully constrained by the uterine cavity. The liner 174 may also
incorporate a release feature which is configured to rupture if the liner 174 is not
constrained such that if the system attempts to pump up the liner 174 to treatment
pressure (e.g., 85 mmHg), the release feature will rupture before reaching that pressure.
[0199]          Once the liner 174 has been expanded sufficiently into contact against
the uterine tissue surface, the cryoablation treatment may be initiated. As shown in the
side view of Figure 21F, the air pump 225 may be turned off and the valve 229 may be
closed (as indicated schematically by an "X" over the pump 225 and valve 229) to
prevent any further infusion of air into the liner 174. With the cryogenic fluid or gas
pressurized within the line 235, valve 237 may be opened (as indicated schematically by
an "0" over the valve 237) to allow for the flow of the cryogenic fluid or gas to flow
through the infusion line 239 coupled to the valve 237. Infusion line 239 may be routed
through or along the sheath 212 and along the probe 178 where it may introduce the
cryogenic fluid or gas within the interior of liner 174 for infusion against the liner 174
contacted against the surrounding tissue surface.
[0200]          During treatment or afterwards, the exhaust valve 217 may also be opened
(as indicated schematically by an "0" over the valve 217) to allow for the discharged
fluid or gas to exit or be drawn from the liner interior and proximally through the cooling
probe 178, such as through the distal tip opening. The fluid or gas may exit from the liner
174 due to a pressure differential between the liner interior and the exhaust exit and/or the
fluid or gas may be actively drawn out from the liner interior, as described in further
detail herein. The spent fluid or gas may then be withdrawn proximally through the probe
178 and through the lumen surrounded by the sheath 212, exhaust block 233, and the
exhaust tube 213 where the spent fluid or gas may be vented. With the treatment fluid or
gas thus introduced through infusion line 239 within the liner 174 and then withdrawn,
the cryogenic treatment may be applied uninterrupted.
[0201]          Once a treatment has been completed, the tissue of the uterine cavity may
be permitted to thaw. During this process, the cryogenic fluid delivery is halted through
the infusion line 239 by closing the valve 237 (as indicated schematically by an "X" over
                                               35

the valve 237) while continuing to exhaust for any remaining cryogenic fluid or gas
remaining within the liner 174 through probe 178, through the lumen surrounded by
sheath 212, and exhaust line 213, as shown in Figure 21G. Optionally, the pump 225 and
valve 229 may be cycled on and off and the exhaust valve 217 may also be cycled on and
off to push ambient air into the liner 174 to facilitate the thawing of the liner 174 to the
uterine cavity. Optionally, warmed air or fluid (e.g., saline) may also be pumped into the
liner 174 to further facilitate thawing of the tissue region.
[0202]           As the spent cryogenic fluid or gas is removed from the liner 174, a drip
prevention system may be optionally incorporated into the handle. For instance, a passive
system incorporating a vented trap may be integrated into the handle which allows
exhaust gas to escape but captures any vented liquid. The exhaust line 213 may be
elongated to allow for any vented liquid to evaporate or the exhaust line 213 may be
convoluted to increase the surface area of the exhaust gas tube to promote evaporation.
[0203]           Alternatively, an active system may be integrated into the handle or
coupled to the handle 211 where a heat sink may be connected to a temperature sensor
and electrical circuit which is controlled by a processor or microcontroller. The heat sink
may promote heat transfer and causes any liquid exhaust to evaporate. When the
temperature of the heat sink reaches the boiling temperature of, e.g., nitrous oxide
(around -89 C), the handle may be configured to slow or stop the delivery of the
cryogenic fluid or gas to the uterine cavity.
[0204]           The pre-treatment infusion of air as well as the methods for treatment and
thawing may be utilized with any of the liner, probe, or apparatus variations described
herein. Moreover, the pre-treatment, treatment, or post-treatment procedures may be
utilized altogether in a single procedure or different aspects of such procedures may be
used in varying combinations depending upon the desired results.
[0205]           Additionally and/or optionally, the handle 211 may incorporate an
orientation sensor to facilitate maintaining the handle 211 in a desirable orientation for
treatment. One variation may incorporate a ball having a specific weight covering the
exhaust line 213 such that when the handle 211 is held in the desirable upright
orientation, the treatment may proceed uninterrupted. However, if the handle 211 moved
out of its desired orientation, the ball may be configured to roll out of position and trigger
a visual and/or auditory alarm to alert the user. In another variation, an electronic
gyroscopic sensor may be used to maintain the handle 211 in the desired orientation for
treatment.
                                               36

[02061          Figure 22A shows an example of one variation of a design of a system
which may be used to deploy the balloon 174 into the uterus UT after properly setting the
depth of the uterine cavity (or some other anatomical measurement). The elongate shaft
170 may have the balloon 174 attached along or near the distal end of the shaft 170 via a
clamp or O-ring 171 placed along the outside of the shaft 170. One or more indicators
173 along the outer surface of the cannula may correspond to clinical measurements of
the uterine length which may be measured by the clinician prior to a cryoablative
procedure. With the measured uterine cavity known, the balloon 174 may be adjustably
clamped along the length of the shaft 170 at any one of the indicators 173 which may
correspond to the measured cavity length. With the balloon 174 suitably clamped in
place, it may be pushed into the shaft lumen, as shown in Figure 22B, using a pusher or
some other instrument for delivery into the uterus UT. The elongate shaft 170 and
balloon 174 may then be introduced into the uterus UT where the balloon 174 may be
deployed from the shaft 170 and having a suitable length which may correspond to the
particular anatomy of the patient.
[02071          The cooling probe positioned within the balloon 174 may be variously
configured, as described above, and may include further variations. As illustrated in the
perspective and side views of Figures 23A and 23B, respectively, the cooling probe
assembly 220 in this variation may comprise an exhaust catheter 222 which may define a
lumen 224 therethrough. While the diameter of the exhaust catheter 222 may be varied,
its diameter may range anywhere from, e.g., 4.5 to 4.75 mm. The exhaust catheter 222
may be formed from various materials, such as extruded polyurethane, which are
sufficiently flexible and able to withstand the lowered treatment temperatures. The distal
end of the catheter 222 may have an atraumatic tip 226 which may be clear and/or which
may also define a viewing window or opening through which an imaging instrument such
as a hysteroscope 246 may be positioned. One or more supporting members or inserts
228, e.g., made from a polymer such as polysulfone, may be positioned throughout the
length of the lumen 224 to provide structural support to the catheter 222 and to prevent its
collapse. The inserts 228 have a relatively short length and define a channel therethrough
through which a probe support 230 (e.g., flat wire, ribbon, etc.) may extend. The probe
support 230 shown in this variation may comprise a flat wire defining one or more
notches 232 along either side which may lock with one or more of the inserts 228 via
insert supports 240 to stabilize the probe support 230.
                                              37

[02081           The probe support 230 itself may be fabricated from a material such as
stainless steel and may have a thickness of, e.g., 0.008 in. The probe support 230 may be
supported within the lumen 224 via the inserts 228 such that the probe support 230
separates the lumen 224 into a first channel 242 and a second channel 244 where the
cooling lumens 236 may be positioned along the probe support 230 within the second
channel 244 while the first channel 242 may remain clear for the optional insertion of a
hysteroscope 246. In the event that a hysteroscope 246 is inserted within first channel
242, the hysteroscope 246 may be advanced selectively along the catheter lumen 224 for
visualizing the surrounding tissue or the hysteroscope 246 may be advanced through the
length of the catheter 222 until it is positioned within a scope receiving channel 238
defined within the catheter tip 226.
[0209]           Because of the thickness of the probe support 230 relative to its width, the
probe support 230 may be flexed or curved in a single plane, e.g., in the plane defined by
the direction of flexion 254 shown in Figure 23B, while remaining relatively stiff in the
plane transverse to the plane defined by the direction of flexion 254. This may allow for
the probe 220 to be advanced into and through the patient's cervix CV and into the uterus
UT while conforming to any anatomical features by bending along the direction of
flexion 254 (e.g., up to 90 degrees or more) but may further allow the probe 220 to
maintain some degree to rigidity and strength in the transverse plane. Additionally and/or
alternatively, the catheter 222 may be actively steered along the direction of flexion 254,
e.g., via one or more pullwires, to allow for positioning or repositioning of the catheter
222 within the balloon 174 to facilitate fluid distribution and/or visualization.
[0210]           The probe 220 may further include one or more cooling lumens 236 which
are positioned along the probe support 230 within the second channel 244. In this
example, at least two cooling lumens are used where a first cooling lumen may extend
through the probe 220 and terminate at a first cooling lumen termination 248 near the
distal tip 226 and a second cooling lumen may also extend through the probe 220 adjacent
to the first cooling lumen and terminate at a second cooling lumen termination 250 at a
location proximal to the first termination 248. The termination points may be varied
along the length of the probe 220 depending upon the desired length of the active cooling
portion 252 of the probe 220, which may extend from the distal tip 226 to a length
ranging anywhere from, e.g., 2 to 14 cm, along the probe length.
[0211]           The cooling lumens 236A, 236B may be fabricated from any number of
materials suitable to withstand the low temperature fluids, e.g., Nitinol, polyimide, etc.
                                               38

Moreover, the internal diameter of the cooling lumens may be made to range anywhere
from, e.g., 0.010 to 0.018 in. In certain variations, the cooling lumens may have an outer
diameter of, e.g., 0.020 in., and an internal diameter ranging from, e.g., 0.016 to 0.018 in.,
with a wall thickness ranging from, e.g., 0.002 to 0.004 in.
[0212]           Because the cooling lumens 236 are located along the second channel
244, as separated by the probe support 230, one or more windows or openings 234 may
be defined along the length of the probe support 230 to allow for the passage of any
cryoablative fluid to pass through the openings 234 and to then directly exit the catheter
222 through the openings 260 defined along the catheter 222 body (as described below)
and into the balloon interior. Alternatively, the cryoablative fluid may instead proliferate
through the entire lumen 224 defined by the catheter 222 before exiting the catheter 222
body. These openings 234 may be cut-outs through the probe support 230 and may
number anywhere from zero openings to six or more, as shown, and they may be
configured in any number of sizes and shapes. Moreover, these openings 234 may be
distributed in any spacing arrangement or they may be uniformly spaced, e.g., 0.320 in.,
depending upon the desired cooling arrangement.
[0213]           The number of cooling lumens 236 may also be varied to number more
than three lumens terminating at different positions along the active portion 252.
Additionally, the activation of the cooling lumens for spraying or introducing the
cryoablative fluid may be accomplished simultaneously or sequentially from each of the
different cooling lumens depending upon the desired ablation characteristics. While the
cooling lumens may simply define a distal opening for passing the fluid, they may be
configured to define several openings along their lengths to further distribute the
introduction of the cryoablative fluid. The openings 260 along the catheter body 222 for
venting the cryoablative fluid into the balloon 174 are omitted from Figure 23A only for
clarity purposes but are shown in further detail in the following Figure 24.
[0214]           As the cryoablative fluid is initially introduced into the catheter lumen
242, the exhaust catheter 222 may also define one or more openings to allow for the
cryoablative fluid to vent or exhaust from the catheter interior and into the interior of the
balloon 174. As shown in the perspective view of Figure 24, one or more openings 260
are illustrated to show one example for how the openings 260 may be defined over the
body of catheter 222. The openings 260 may be positioned along a single side of the
catheter 222 or they may be positioned in an alternating transverse pattern, as shown, to
further distribute the cooling fluid throughout the balloon interior. In either case, the
                                               39

positioning of the openings 260 may be varied depending upon the desired cryoablation
characteristics.
[0215]           A cross-sectional end view of the cooling probe assembly 220 is shown in
Figure 25A illustrating the relative positioning of supporting insert 228 attached to the
probe support 230 within the catheter 222. The two cooling lumens 236A, 236B are
illustrated adjacently positioned along the probe support 230 although they may be
positioned elsewhere within the catheter 222 and may also number one lumen or greater
than two lumens. Moreover, an optional hysteroscope 246 is also illustrated positioned
within the catheter 222 along the probe support 230. An end view of the distal tip 226 is
also illustrated in Figure 25B showing one variation where the distal tip 226 may define a
viewing window 270 through which the hysteroscope 246 may be advanced for
visualizing within the balloon 174 and uterus UT. In other variations, the viewing
window 270 may be omitted and the distal tip 226 may be transparent for allowing
visualization directly through the tip 226 by the hysteroscope 246.
[0216]           With such an arrangement of the cooling probe assembly 220 positioned
within the balloon 174 (as illustrated above in Figure 21B), the assembly 210 may be
used to treat the surrounding uterine tissue in close conformance against the balloon 174
exterior surface. Introduction of the cryoablative fluid, e.g., nitrous oxide, through the
cooling probe 220 may allow for the ablation of the surrounding tissue to a depth of, e.g.,
4 to 8 mm.
[02171           One example for a treatment cycle using a two cycle process may include
the introduction of the cryoablative fluid for a treatment time of two minutes where the
surrounding tissue is frozen. The fluid may be withdrawn from the balloon 174 and the
tissue may be allowed to thaw over a period of five minutes. The cryoablative fluid may
be then reintroduced and the tissue frozen again for a period of two minutes and the fluid
may then be withdrawn again to allow the tissue to thaw for a period of five minutes. The
tissue may be visually inspected, e.g., via the hysteroscope 246, to check for ablation
coverage. If the tissue has been sufficiently ablated, the assembly 210 may be removed
from the uterus UT, otherwise, the treatment cycle may be repeated as needed. In other
alternatives, a single cycle may be utilized or more than two cycles may be utilized, as
needed, to treat the tissue sufficiently. Furthermore, during the treatment cycle, a
minimum pressure of, e.g., 40 to 80 mm Hg, may be optionally maintained by the
cryogenic liquid or by a gas (e.g., air, carbon dioxide, etc.) to keep the balloon 174 and
uterus UT open.
                                               40

[02181           In yet another alternative, aside from having a catheter 222 made as an
extruded lumen, the catheter may be formed into tubing 201 such as a hypotube
fabricated from a material such as, e.g., stainless steel, nitinol, etc. A tubing 201 formed
from a metal may provide additional strength to the catheter and may remove the need for
any inserts to maintain a patent lumen. To increase the flexibility of the tubing 201, one
or more slots 203 may be formed or cut along the body of the tubing 201, as shown in the
example of Figure 26A, which illustrates a perspective view of tubing 201 having one or
more slots 203 cut transversely relative to the tubing 201. Aside from increased
flexibility, the slots 203 may be aligned to provide for preferential bending or curvature
along predetermined planes by the tubing while inhibiting the bending or curvature along
other planes, e.g., planes transverse to the bending plane, similar to the preferential
bending or curvature provided by the probe support 230.
[0219]           The ends of the slots 203 may be formed to provide a separation 205
between the ends of the slots 203. Figure 26B shows another variation where each of the
transverse slots 203 may have a strain relief feature 207 formed at the distal ends of each
slot 203 such that bending of the tubing 201 over the slotted region may occur with
reduced stress imparted to the slots 203 and tubing 201. An additional feature may
include optional tabs 209 which may be formed along the body of the tubing 201 to
extend internally for holding a cooling lumen within the lumen of the tubing 201.
[0220]           Another variation is shown in Figure 26C which shows transverse slots
203 formed along the body of the tubing 201 where the slots 203 may be formed in an
alternating pattern with respect to one another. Figure 26D shows yet another variation
where angled slots 211 may be formed relative to tubing 201. Figure 26E shows
another variation having one or more serpentine slots 213 for preventing pinching
where a distal end of each slot 213 may have a transverse slot 215 formed. Figure 26F
shows another variation where one or more slots 217 having a transverse and
longitudinal pattern may be formed along tubing 201.
[0221]           Figure 26G shows another variation where a transverse slot 219 may have
a longitudinal slot 221 formed at its distal end. Figure 26H shows yet another variation
where one or more tapered slots 223 may be formed along tubing 201. Figure 261 shows
another variation where a transverse slot 219 may have a longitudinal slot 221 formed
where each of the longitudinal slots 221 may be aligned longitudinally along the body of
tubing 201. Figure 26J shows another variation where transverse slots 219 may have
longitudinal slots 223 aligned adjacent to one another and having rounded ends. Figure
                                                41

26K shows another variation where either a curved serpentine slot 225 or an angled slot
227 may be formed along the tubing 201. Alternatively, both curved serpentine slot 225
and angled slot 227 may both be formed. Another variation shows tubing 201 having a
plurality of slots 229 formed into a lattice structure over the body of tubing 201.
[0222]           Aside from utilizing a continuous body of tubing 201 for the length of
the cooling probe, discrete tubing reinforcing ring 231 may instead be formed from
tubing 201. Figure 27A shows an example where a plurality of reinforcing rings 231
may be separated into discrete ring elements and attached to one another in a linear
manner with one or more longitudinal beam members 233 which may be attached to
each reinforcing ring 231 at an attachment point 235, e.g., weld, adhesive, etc. One or
more of the reinforcing rings 231 may be formed to have, e.g., a bent-in tab 237, for
supporting beam 233 rather than utilizing a weld, adhesive, etc., as shown in the detail
perspective view of Figure 27B. The assembly of the reinforcing ring 231 and beams
233 may be covered with a membrane or other covering to form a uniform structure.
[0223]           An example of a covering which may be used is shown in the end view
of Figure 28A which shows a portion of tubing 201 or reinforcing ring 231 and cooling
lumens 236 positioned on either side of tubing 201 or reinforcing ring 231. A heat
shrink 241 material may be placed over the probe assembly while maintaining clearance
for openings 239 to allow for delivery of the cryoablative fluid.
[0224]           Another variation is shown in the cross-sectional end view of Figure
28B which shows the tubing 201 and respective cooling lumens 236 positioned within
an insert 243 which define insert openings 245 for introducing the cryoablative fluid.
Yet another variation is shown in the perspective view of Figure 29 which may
incorporate a wound spring 247 which may be tightly wound or packed to provide
flexibility and to further provide a lumen 249 for the exhaust. One or more inserts 243
may be positioned longitudinally along the length of the spring 247 and the cooling
lumens 236 may be routed through the spring 247 and coupled to each insert 243.
[0225]           Another variation is shown in the partial cross-sectional side view of
Figure 30A which illustrates how one or more inserts 243 may each define a step 251 for
securement to the spring 247. The entire assembly may then be covered by a covering
253, e.g., flexible extrusion. Each of the inserts 243 may remain uncovered by either the
spring 247 or covering 253 to ensure that the cryoablative fluid has an unhindered
pathway to the balloon interior. Figure 30B shows another variation where each of the
inserts 243 may define a respective receiving channel 257 on either side of the insert 243
                                               42

for securement to the spring 247. An example of a cooling lumen 236 is shown attached
to each of the inserts 243 via an attachment 255, e.g., weld, adhesive, etc.
[0226]          Aside from increasing the flexibility of the tubing or cooling probe, the
cooling lumen may be configured to increase its flexibility as well. An example is shown
in Figure 31 which shows a portion of a cooling lumen wall 261 having a plurality of
pivoted attachments 263. Such an arrangement may allow for each segment of the
cooling lumen wall 261 to pivot such that the cooling lumen cumulatively provides
sufficient flexibility to bend and curve as the cooling probe assembly is advanced and
positioned within the uterus. Such a cooling lumen may be incorporated into any of the
probe variations described herein.
[02271          Another example of a cooling probe assembly is illustrated in the
perspective view of Figure 32 which shows discrete embedded insert 265 and one or more
cooling lumens 236 attached to each respective insert 265 covered with a covering 267.
In this example, the covering 267 may be implemented without any additional features or
structures. Figure 33 shows yet another example where individual inserts 265 may be
aligned and coupled with one or more beams 233, as previously described. An additional
sliding joint 269 may be attached or integrated along each insert 265 to provide support to
one or more cooling lumens 236 which may be translatably positioned through each
aligned sliding joint 269.
[0228]          Yet another variation is illustrated in the side view of Figure 34 which
shows a wound spring element 271 having one or more cooling lumens 236 aligned
longitudinally along the spring element 271. The one or more cooling lumens 236 may
be attached to the spring element 271 via connectors 273 which may be aligned relative
to one another to receive and secure the cooling lumens 236. A covering may be
optionally secured over the spring assembly.
[0229]          Figure 35 shows another variation where spring element 271 may
incorporate one or more respective inserts 243. In this variation, the spring element 271
has the one or more cooling lumens 236 coupled to the spring element 271 itself. Figure
36 shows yet another variation where the spring element 271 and the one or more cooling
lumens 236 (which may be coupled directly to the spring element 271), may have an
optional secondary lumen 275 passing through the spring element 271 and optionally
attached to the spring itself. The second lumen 275 may be sized for receiving an
instrument such as a hysteroscope 246. The second lumen 275 may provide a redundant
liquid or gas pathway should the primary lumen become partially or fully obstructed. The
                                               43

redundant pathway may exist between the optional instrument, e.g.hysteroscope, and
primary lumen or within the full second lumen 275.
[0230]          The secondary lumen 275 may be shown in various cross-sections in the
end views of Figure 37. A first variation is illustrated shown secondary lumen 275
having a circular cross-sectional area with a hysteroscope 246 passed through a center of
the lumen 275. A second variation is illustrated where the hysteroscope 246 may be
passed along a side of the lumen 275 and a third variation is illustrated showing a
secondary lumen 275A having an elliptical cross-sectional area.
[0231]          Another variation for a cooling probe assembly is shown in the perspective
views of Figures 38A to 38C. In this variation, the catheter body 222 is omitted for
clarity purposes only but a main delivery line 280 is shown extending through the catheter
with at least two side delivery lines 282, 284 positioned near the surface of the catheter
body, as shown in Figure 38A. The main delivery line 280 may be in fluid
communication with the side delivery lines 282, 284 via a junction 288, shown in Figure
38B, near or within the distal tip 226. As the cryoablative fluid is introduced into the
main delivery line 280, the fluid in the side delivery lines 282, 284 may be vented through
one or more openings 286 defined therealong for venting through and into the catheter
and balloon interior. An optional mandrel 290, as shown in Figure 38C, may be slidingly
fitted within each of the side delivery lines 282, 284 and actuated automatically along
with the retraction of the sheath 212 or by the user to slide along the interior of one or
both side delivery lines 282, 284 to selectively obstruct the openings 286 and thereby
control the amount of cryoablative fluid delivered. As shown, one or more obstructed
openings 292 may be blocked by the mandrel 290 by selectively sliding the mandrel 290
accordingly. In other variations, rather than using mandrels inserted within the delivery
lines 282, 284, a sheath or mandrel placed over the delivery lines 282, 284 may be used
instead to achieve the same results.
[0232]          As described above, the retraction of the mandrel 290 may be optionally
actuated to follow along with the retraction of the sheath 212. Accordingly, the retraction
of the mandrel 290 may occur simultaneously with the retraction of the sheath 212 but the
retraction may optionally occur at different rates as the amount of cryoablative fluid
delivered may be related to the length of the uterine cavity to be treated. For instance, a
sheath retraction of, e.g., 7 cm, may result in 10 unobstructed openings 286 whereas a
sheath retraction of, e.g., 4 cm, may result in, e.g., 6 unobstructed openings 286.
                                               44

[02331           Another variation of the cooling probe assembly is illustrated in the detail
cross-sectional side view of Figure 39. In this variation, a single main delivery line 280
may pass through and into communication with distal tip 226. Rather than having the
side delivery lines 282, 284 coupled directly to the main delivery line 280, each
respective line may be coupled to a common chamber 301 defined within the distal tip
226. Such an assembly may be used with alternative variations of the exhaust lumen 303
as shown in one example in the cross-sectional end view of Figure 40A. In this example,
the exhaust lumen 303may be formed to have an indented cross-sectional area to
accommodate the side delivery lines 282, 284. Alternatively, the exhaust lumen 303 may
be shaped to have an elliptical cross-sectional area instead, as shown in Figure 40B.
[0234]           In yet another alternative, the cooling lumens may be formed to have a
single introduction or infusion line 305 and a single delivery line 307 where the delivery
line 307 may be in fluid communication directly with the introduction or infusion line 305
through the distal tip 226, as shown in the cross-sectional side view of Figure 41. The
infusion line 305 and delivery line 307 may be formed as separate lines or they may
formed as a single continuous line where the infusion line 305 enters distal tip 226 and is
curved to redirect the ablative fluid proximally through the delivery line 307. In this
variation, as in the previous variations, a translatable mandrel 290 may be slidably
positioned within the delivery line 307 or optionally along an outer surface of the delivery
line 307 to selectively obstruct the openings 286 defined along the line 307. In other
variations, one or more openings may also be optionally aligned along the infusion line
305 in addition to the openings 286 along delivery line 307. Moreover, the mandrel 290
may be actuated to slide (either at the same or different rate) along with the retraction of
the sheath. Figure 42 illustrates an example where the cooling probe assembly may be
introduced into the interior of balloon 174 when deployed within the uterus UT.
Alternatively, the balloon 174 may be attached directly along an outer surface of the
cooling probe assembly itself. The expanded length of balloon 174 may be fixed along
the outer surface of the cooling probe assembly proximal to the distal tip or it may be
optionally adjustable via the positioning of the outer sheath. As shown, the introduction
line 305 may introduce the cryoablative fluid along the cooling probe assembly where it
may then be flowed proximally along the delivery line 307 for introduction into the
interior of the balloon 174. As the cryoablative fluid is introduced, a slotted tube 311
having one or more directional slots 313 may be used to optionally direct the flow of the
cryoablative fluid into the balloon interior.
                                                45

[02351           Figures 43A and 43B illustrate additional variations for selectively
controlling the configuration of the hole directions along the side delivery lines to
optionally control appropriate ablation depths and tapering, as needed or desired. In the
variation of Figure 43A, the adjacent side delivery lines 282, 284 from the distal tip 226
may be configured such that openings 300 are configured in an up/down configuration,
openings 302 are configured in an down/up configuration, openings 304 are configured in
an left/right configuration, openings 306 are configured in an up/down configuration, and
openings 308 are configured in an down/up configuration. The hole directions of
up/down/left/right are relative to the figures shown and are presented for illustrative
purposes.
[0236]           Likewise, the variation shown in Figure 43B illustrates how the adjacent
side delivery lines 282, 284 may be configured such that openings 310 are configured in
an up/down configuration, openings 312 are configured in an left/right configuration,
openings 314 are configured in an down/up configuration, openings 316 are configured in
an left/right configuration, and openings 318 are configured in an up/down configuration.
These variations are illustrated as exemplary variations and other variations of hole
directions may be accomplished as desired.
[02371           Aside from the positioning of the fluid openings, the catheter body 222
itself may optionally incorporate a skived viewing window 320, as shown in the side view
of Figure 44, to facilitate visualization of the surrounding balloon 174 and tissue by the
hysteroscope 246 which may be advanced into proximity to the window 320 or entirely
through as desired.
[0238]           As previously described, the balloon 174 may be expanded within the
uterus UT and particularly into the uterine comu UC by an initial burst of gas or liquid.
Other mechanisms may also be used to facilitate the balloon expansion. One variation is
shown in Figure 45 which illustrates a balloon 174 having one or more supporting arms
330A, 330B extending from a support 334 which may be deployed within the balloon
174. The supporting arms 330A, 330B may be variously configured although they are
shown in this example in a Y-configuration. Each of the distal ends of the arms may
extend from a linear configuration into the expanded Y-configuration, e.g., via a biasing
mechanism 332, which may bias the arms to extend once the sheath 212 is retracted. The
distal ends of the arms 330A, 330B may extend into the tapered corners of the balloon
174 to facilitate the balloon 174 expansion into the uterine comu UC and may also help to
center the balloon 174 within the uterus UT.
                                               46

[02391           Figure 46 shows a partial cross-sectional side view of another variation of
an expansion mechanism contained within the balloon 174 where one or more supporting
arms 342A, 342B may be mechanically actuated to extend, e.g., via a biasing mechanism,
push/pull wires, etc. Moreover, the arms 342A, 342B may be integrated into the design
of the cooling probe 340 as an integrated assembly.
[0240]           Figure 47 shows a partial cross-sectional side view of another variation
where the supporting arms 350A, 350B may also integrate one or more openings 352 for
the infusion of the cryoablative fluid. In this example the arms 350A, 350B may be
integrated with the cooling probe 340 or separated. In either case, the inclusion of the
openings 352 may facilitate the distribution of the fluid into the balloon 174 interior.
[0241]           Figure 48 shows yet another variation where the supporting arms 360A,
360B may be incorporated into elongate channels or pockets 362A, 362B defined along
the balloon 174 itself. In this and other variations shown, the supporting arm members
may optionally integrate the one or more openings for cryoablative fluid delivery and
may also be integrated into elongate channels as practicable.
[0242]           Figures 49A and 49B show cross-sectional side views of yet another
variation of a cooling probe which utilizes a single infusion line in combination with a
translatable delivery line. To accommodate various sizes and shapes of uterine cavities,
the cooling probe may have a sliding adjustment that may be set, e.g., according to the
measured length of the patient's uterine cavity. The adjustment may move along the
sheath along the exhaust tube as well as the delivery line within the infusion line. The
sheath may constrain the liner 174 and also control its deployment within the cavity.
[0243]           In this variation, an infusion line 239 (as described above) may pass from
the handle assembly and along or within the sheath and into the interior of liner 174. The
infusion line 239 may be aligned along the probe 178 such that the infusion line 239 is
parallel with a longitudinal axis of the probe 178 and extends towards the distal tip 367 of
the probe 178. Moreover, the infusion line 239 may be positioned along the probe 178
such that the line 239 remains exposed to the comers of the liner 174 which extend
towards the cornua. With the infusion line 239 positioned accordingly, the length of the
line 239 within the liner 174 may have multiple openings formed along its length which
act as delivery ports for the infused cryogenic fluid or gas. A separate translating delivery
line 365, e.g., formed of a Nitinol tube defining an infusion lumen therethrough, may be
slidably positioned through the length of the infusion line 239 such that the delivery line
                                                47

365 may be moved (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 49A) relative to the infusion line
239 which remains stationary relative to the probe 178.
[0244]          The openings along the length of the infusion line 239 may be positioned
such that the openings are exposed to the sides of the interior of the liner 174, e.g., cross
drilled. As the cryogenic fluid or gas is introduced through the delivery line 365, the
infused cryogenic fluid or gas 369 may pass through the infusion line 239 and then out
through the openings defined along the infusion line 239. By adjusting the translational
position of the delivery line 365, the delivery line 365 may also cover a selected number
of the openings resulting in a number of open delivery ports 361 as well as closed
delivery ports 363 which are obstructed by the delivery line 365 position relative to the
infusion line 239, as shown in the top view of Figure 49B.
[0245]          By translating the delivery line 365 accordingly, the number of open
delivery ports 361 and closed delivery ports 363 may be adjusted depending on the
desired treatment length and further ensures that only desired regions of the uterine tissue
are exposed to the infused cryogenic fluid or gas 369. Once the number of open delivery
ports 361 has been suitably selected, the infused cryogenic fluid or gas 369 may bypass
the closed delivery ports 363 obstructed by the delivery line 365 and the fluid or gas may
then be forced out through the open delivery ports 361 in a transverse direction as
indicated by the infusion spray direction 371. The terminal end of the infusion line 239
may be obstructed to prevent the distal release of the infused fluid or gas 369 from its
distal end. Although in other variations, the terminal end of the infusion line 239 may be
left unobstructed and opened.
[02461          Figures 50A and 50B show top and perspective views of the expanded
liner 174 with four pairs of the open delivery ports 361 exposed in apposed direction.
Because the infused fluid or gas 369 may be injected into the liner 174, e.g., as a liquid,
under relatively high pressure, the injected cryogenic liquid may be sprayed through the
open delivery ports 361 in a transverse or perpendicular direction relative to the cooling
probe 178. The laterally infused cryogenic fluid 371 may spray against the interior of the
liner 174 (which is contacted against the surrounding tissue surface) such that the
cryogenic liquid 371 coats the interior walls of the liner 174 due to turbulent flow causing
heavy mixing. As the cryogenic liquid 371 coats the liner surface, the sprayed liquid 371
may absorb heat from the tissue walls causing rapid cooling of the tissue while also
evaporating the liquid cryogen to a gas form that flows out through the cooling probe 178.
This rapid cooling and evaporation of the cryogenic liquid 371 facilitates the creation of a
                                               48

fast and deep ablation over the tissue. During treatment, the temperature within the cavity
typically drops, e.g., -89' C, within 6-7 seconds after the procedure has started. While the
interior walls of the liner 174 are first coated with the cryogenic liquid 371, the cryogenic
liquid 371 may no longer change phase as the procedure progresses.
[02471           While four pairs of the open delivery ports 361 are shown, the number
of exposed openings may be adjusted to fewer than four pairs or more than four pairs
depending on the positioning of the delivery line 365 and also the number of openings
defined along the infusion line 239 as well as the spacing between the openings.
Moreover, the positioning of the openings may also be adjusted such that the sprayed
liquid 371 may spray in alternative directions rather than laterally as shown. Additionally
and/or alternatively, additional openings may be defined along other regions of the
infusion line 239. For instance, one or more openings 361', e.g., one to three holes or
more, may be added along the length of the infusion line 239 such that the openings
directly face the portion of the liner 174 placed against the anterior portion of the
contacted tissue, as shown in the perspective view of Figure 50C.
[0248]           Prior to or during treatment, the positioning of the cooling probe 178
within the interior of the liner 174 and the uterus may be determined through various
mechanisms. Visualization may be optionally provided by use of hysteroscopy,
endoscopy, fluoroscopy, or ultrasound or other more invasive modalities. However, other
variations for determining the cooling probe 178 position may include use of a transmitter
381, e.g., light, ultrasound, etc., which may be placed on the distal tip 367 of the probe
178, as shown in the perspective view of Figure 5 1A.
[0249]           In the event that a light 381 such as an LED light is placed upon the distal
tip 367, the user may simply visually monitor the patient for the transmission of the light
through the tissue and skin of the patient to determine whether the tip 367 is properly
positioned within the uterus or the peritoneal cavity depending on where the light is
emitted directly through the body. In another variation, a sensor or receiver 383 may be
placed upon the distal tip 367 adjacent to the transmitter 381. As the transmitter 381
emits a light or ultrasound signal 385, the signal 385 may reflect off the surrounding
tissue surface (and through the liner 174). Depending on the wavelength of the reflected
signals collected by the receiver 383, a processor or microcontroller can be used to
determine the general color of the tissue in front of the end of the probe as the inner wall
of the uterus, intestine, and bladder should all have distinct color signatures.
                                                49

[02501           In yet another variation, one or more transmitters 387, e.g., light,
ultrasound, etc., may be placed along the probe 178 along opposite surfaces to facilitate
determining the amount of cavity expansion, e.g., during initial pre-treatment liner
expansion. The transmitted signals 391 may be emitted as discrete pulses of light which
are returned as reflected signals 393 to corresponding sensors or receivers 389 which are
adjacent to the transmitters 387. By measuring the time it takes for the reflected signals
393 to return to the sensors or receivers 389, the processor or microcontroller can
determine the amount of cavity expansion which has occurred. The transmitters and/or
sensors/receivers may be incorporated in any of the variations of the devices and methods
described herein.
[0251]           Once a cryoablation treatment procedure has been completed and the
interior of the liner is vented, the device may be removed from the patient body. To
facilitate the removal of the liner 174 from the treated tissue surface, negative pressure
may be applied to the interior of the liner 174 to quickly remove the discharged cryogenic
fluid or gas as well as to help pull the liner 174 away from the tissue surface. Removing
the liner 174 from the tissue surface may be relatively easy when the removal force is
normal to the tissue surface. Hence, use of negative pressure or a suction force at the end
of an ablation procedure may facilitate the removal or peeling of the liner 174 from the
uterine tissue surface.
[0252]           The pump which is used to introduce air initially into the liner interior
may be used to also remove the discharged cryogenic fluid or gas particularly if the
pump (such as pump 225 shown above in Figure 21 G) is configured as a reversible
pump, e.g., connected to H-bridge circuitry which may allow for the polarity of the
voltage on the pump to be reversed which will allow for the reversal of the flow direction
of the pump.
Another variation may utilize a separate pump which is configured to draw a suction
force upon the liner interior separate from the pump used to introduce air into the liner.
[0253]           Yet another variation may utilize a non-reversible pump 395 which is
fluidly coupled to a 5-port, 2 position, 4-way valve 405 which allows for the pressured
pump output 397 to be connected to the exhaust/liner 407 through output line 401 and
through liner line 415 within valve 405. A first switch 409 within the valve 405 may be
switched to fluidly couple the output line 401 with the liner line 415. The negative
pressure pump input 399 may be opened to the ambient air 419 through ambient line 417
within the valve 405 for initially expanding the liner 174, as shown in the schematic
                                                50

illustration of Figure 52A. The ambient air 419 may be fluidly coupled to the input line
403 via second switch 411 within the valve 405.
[0254]           When the ablation procedure has been completed and the liner 407 to be
vented and collapsed, the valve 405 may be switched such that first switch 409 fluidly
couples output line 401 to ambient line 413 and second switch 411 switches to fluidly
couple the liner 407 to liner line 415 and input line 403, as shown in the schematic
illustration of Figure 52B. The fluid and/or gas within the liner 407 may be drawn out by
the negative pressure created within input line 403 which may then force the discharged
fluid or gas through output line 401, through ambient line 413 within valve 405, and out
as exhausted fluid or gas 421. Thus, a single directional pump 395 may be used for both
inflation and deflation with the valve 405.
[0255]           Yet another variation is shown in the schematic diagrams of Figures 53A
to 53C which also illustrates the use of a non-reversible pump 395 for both inflation and
deflation. In this variation, the pump output line 401 may incorporate a first 3-way valve
425 and the pump input line 403 may incorporate a second 3-way valve 427. The first
and/or second valves 425, 427 may comprise, e.g., 3-way solenoid valves, which may
remain unpowered with both valves 425, 427 connecting the pump 395 to the ambient
environment through respective ambient lines 429, 431, as shown in Figure 53A. The
configuration shown may keep any fluid or gas within the liner 407 from being pumped
or leaked to the environment.
[0256]           If the liner 407 is to be evacuated, the first valve 425 may be actuated or
energized such that the pump output line 401 is fluidly connected to the ambient line 429
and the second valve 427 may be actuated or energized to fluidly couple the liner 407
with the pump input line 403, as shown in Figure 53B. With the pump 395 actuated, the
input line 403 may draw a negative pressure to suction out the fluid or gas within liner
407 while the pump output pushes air or the suctioned fluid or gas out through ambient
line 429.
[02571           If the liner is to be initially expanded and/or the cryogenic fluid or gas is to
be to introduced into the liner 407 for treatment, the first valve 425 may be actuated or
energized to fluidly couple the output line 401 from the pump 395 to the liner 407 while
the second valve 427 may be actuated or energized to fluidly couple the pump input line
403 with the ambient line 431, as shown in Figure 53C. Moreover, the actuation of the
first and second valves 425, 427 may be coordinated such that simultaneous or individual
actuation of the valves is controlled by a processor. Alternatively, one or both valves
                                                  51

425, 427 may be controlled manually by the user. As above, this valve configuration may
be used with any of the different liner, probe, handle assembly, or treatment methods
described herein.
[0258]          Turning now to the liner itself, the liner may be formed to have, e.g., a
nominal 0.0012 in. thick flexible membrane such as pellethane. The liner 174 may be
optionally formed as a composite from one or more sheets of material, e.g., two sheets of
membrane which are RF welded. When laid out in a flattened shape, the liner 174 may
shaped in a manner, as shown in the top view of Figure 54A, which allows the liner 174
to inflate or expand into a contoured shape which conforms closely to a uterine cavity, as
shown in the perspective view of Figure 54B. Figure 54A shows one example of a
flattened liner 174 which gently tapers from the opening to a curved shape forming a first
curved portion 435A and a second curved portion 435B opposite to the first curved
portion 435A. The liner 174 may hence taper gently from a first width W1, e.g., about
2.4 in., down to a second width W2, e.g., about 0.3 in., over a length Li of, e.g., about 3.5
in. The neck may form a length L2, e.g., about 0.9 in.
[0259]          The region between each of the first and second curved portions 435A,
435B may also be curved to have a radius R1 of, e.g., about 3.5 in., while curved portions
435A, 435B may also be curved to each have a radius R2 of, e.g., about 0.3 in. The
portion of the liner proximal to the portions 435A, 435B may also have a radius R3, e.g.,
about 1.1 in., and an oppositely radiused portion of radius R4, e.g., about 8.0 in. The
region between the liner 174 and neck may further have a radius R5, e.g., about 0.2 in.
[0260]          The liner 174 itself may be formed to have a uniform thickness over the
entire liner. Alternatively, different portions of the liner 174 may also be formed to have
differing thicknesses depending upon the desired degree of treatment along differing
portions of the liner 174. For instance, the liner 174 may have varying regions of
thickness T1, T2, T3 along proximal portions of the liner relative to distal portions of the
liner.
[0261]          Moreover, to facilitate smooth retraction of the sheath and consistent
deployment, the liner 174 may be pleated to fold and collapse in a consistent manner, as
shown in the perspective view of Figure 54C. The liner 174 may be pleated, e.g., using a
fixture during manufacturing.
[0262]          As previously described, the probe 178 may be advanced into and through
the patient's cervix CV and into the uterus UT while conforming to any anatomical
features by bending along an anterior direction of flexion 445 or posterior direction of
                                               52

flexion 447 (e.g., up to 90 degrees or more) but may further allow the probe 178 to
maintain some degree to rigidity and strength in the transverse plane. The probe 178 may
accordingly have a plurality of cut patterns 441, e.g., laser-cut, along the anterior and
posterior surfaces of the probe 178, as shown in the side and top views of Figures 55A
and 55B. These cut patterns 441 may be cut partially through the probe 178 along
opposing surfaces, e.g., in an alternating manner, and may further define portions of
removed material 443 along the ends of each cut pattern 441. In addition to the cut
patterns 441, one or more H-slots 449 may also be cut periodically along, e.g., the
anterior surface of the probe 178 to allow for anchoring locations for the infusion line
239.
[0263]           An example is illustrated in the perspective view of Figure 55C which
shows a probe 178 having multiple probe sections 453A, 453B, 453C, 453D (e.g., four
sections in this variation) separated by H-slots 449. One or more anchors 451 (e.g.,
collars, clips, etc.) may couple the infusion line 239 to the probe 178 along its anterior
surface via the anchors 451 secured to the H-slots 449, as shown.
[0264]           Aside from the liner or balloon itself and the use of balloons for
obstructing the os, internal os, and/or external os, as described above, balloons or
inflatable liners may also be used to insulate the cryogenic fluid during delivery into the
balloon to protect the surrounding tissue structures which are not to be ablated, such as
the cervix CV. One variation is illustrated in the perspective assembly view of Figure
56A which shows a cervical protection assembly having an inner sheath 461 (e.g., PTFE
or other polymer) which may be inserted within an outer sheath 465 (e.g., double walled
stainless steel). The inner sheath 461 may have an inner sheath hub 463 at its proximal
end which may securely contact an outer sheath hub 467 also located at its proximal end.
With the inner sheath 461 inserted entirely within outer sheath 465, the inner sheath 461
may prevent the liner 174 from inflating into contact against the outer double walled
sheath 465.
[0265]           As shown in the cross-sectional perspective view of Figure 56B, the
double walled outer sheath 465 may have an inner tubular member 471 and a surrounding
outer tubular member 469 (e.g., stainless steel, polymer, etc.) forming an insulating
annular gap or spacing 473 (e.g., 0.0115 in. spacing). In the event that the tubular
members 469, 471 are made of a polymer, the tubular members may be made with a wall
thickness of, e.g. 0.00025 to 0.003. The distal end of the outer sheath 465 may have
distal tip 475 to maintain the spacing between the tubular members of the outer sheath
                                               53

465. With the annular gap or spacing 473 and the presence of the inner sheath 461, the
sheath assembly may provide thermal insulation for the cervical region by insulating the
surrounding tissue from the cryogenic fluid or gas passed through the infusion line 239
and from the cryogenic fluid or gas withdrawn through the inner sheath 461 from the liner
174.
[02661           While the annular gap or spacing 473 may have air within the spacing
function as an insulator, the spacing may alternatively be evacuated of air to provide for a
vacuum insulator. In another alternative, active flow of warmed or ambient temperature
fluid (air or gas) may be included between the inner and outer tubular members 469, 471
or insulative materials may instead be placed within the gap or spacing (e.g., inflatable
balloons, spiral wound balloons, cotton, wool, synthetic fibers, Neoprene, etc.). In yet
another alternative, additional tubular members may be incorporated to create multiple
annular gaps.
[02671           Additionally and/or optionally, the temperature of the sheath 212 may also
be monitored so that the temperature may be provided in a feedback loop to a processor
or microcontroller for ensuring the surrounding tissue (e.g., cervix) is maintained at a safe
level. Accordingly, one or more temperature sensors T, e.g., thermocouples, may be
placed along the sheath 212, as shown in Figure 56C, and in communication with the
processor or microcontroller. The processor or microcontroller may accordingly be
programmed with a feedback loop which could start, pause, or stop the delivery of the
cryogenic fluid or gas based upon the temperature (e.g. -89.5 'C for nitrous oxide) of the
sheath 212.
[0268]           In actuating and controlling the translation of the sheath 212 and probe
178, the handle assembly 211 may further incorporate a sheath bearing tube 477 coupled
to the sheath 212 assembly. Figure 57 illustrates one variation where the sheath bearing
tube 477 slidingly pass through a sheath bearing assembly 219 and then attached to a
slider base block assembly 221 which is positioned within the handle assembly 211. The
actuatable sheath control 223 may be attached to the slider base block assembly 221 for
advancing and retracting the slider base block assembly 221 to control the positioning of
the sheath 212 to ensure that the sheath 212 covers the cervical region during a treatment
procedure.
[0269]           Figure 58 shows a detail perspective view of the connection between the
sheath bearing tube 477 and slider base block assembly 221. One or two linear rails 479
may be aligned adjacent to the sheath bearing tube 477 within handle 211 to serve as
                                               54

bearing surfaces for the slider base block assembly 221. Additionally, a receiving
channel 481 may be defined along the anterior surface of the sheath bearing tube 477 to
function as an access channel for the infusion line 239 into or along the sheath assembly.
Accordingly, as the slider base block assembly 221 is translated linearly along the rails
479, the sheath bearing tube 477 and infusion line 239 may be advanced distally and/or
proximally relative to the probe 178 to control the relative positioning of the sheath 212.
[02701           As illustrated in the perspective views of Figures 59A and 59B, when the
slider base block assembly 221 is advanced distally relative to the handle assembly 211,
the sheath 212 may be translated distally such that a nominal exposed length D1 of the
probe 178 may be seen. (The liner 174 is not shown for clarity only.) As the slider base
block assembly 221 is advanced proximally, the sheath 212 may be accordingly retracted
to expose the probe 178 further, as indicated by the exposed length D2. The full travel of
the sheath and slider base block assembly 221 may range anywhere from, e.g., 1 cm to 8
cm or more, as measured from the distal end of sheath 212 to the distal end of the tip of
probe 178. The positioning of the slider 221 and sheath 212 may be maintained via any
number of locking or positioning mechanisms to ensure that the ablation length is
maintained during a treatment procedure. Hence, the locking of the slider 221 and sheath
212 may be accomplished by locking mechanisms, e.g., friction fitting, detention features
such as notches along the length of the slider travel, grabbing mechanism such as a brake
between the slider and handle, actuating features, etc.
[02711           By measuring the pressure decay within the liner 174 during treatment, the
rate at which the cryogenic liquid is being converted to a gaseous state may be
determined since the lower the cavity pressure the less cryogenic fluid is being converted
from liquid to gas. One or more optional pressure sensing lines 485 may be incorporated
along the probe 178, as shown in the perspective view of Figure 60. (A secondary line
may be provided for redundant measurement of the pressure.) The pressure sensing line
485 may have a pressure sensor 487 positioned along a cutout window 489 defined along
the probe 178 for monitoring the pressure internal to the liner 174 during treatment. The
cutout window 489 may be provided to prevent the ends of the pressure lines 485 from
contacting the interior of the liner 174. The pressure lines 485 may be routed along the
full length of the sheath 212 and the proximal ends of the lines 485 may be attached to
connectors which connect to the pressure sensors via short silicone tube sections.
[0272]           Additionally, the pressure sensing lines 485 and sensors 487 may also be
used as safety feature for the system. The lines 485 and sensors 487 can trigger the
                                                55

actuatable valve 237 which is fluidly coupled to the cryogenic line 235 (shown above in
Figure 21E) to close and stop the flow of the cryogenic fluid or gas in the event of
pressures detected in the uterine cavity which are higher than expected.
[02731           Figure 61 shows a partial cross-sectional of another variation where an
inflatable balloon 370 may be located along the outside distal surface of sheath 212 for
contacting against and directly insulating the cervix CV. The liner or balloon 370 may be
filled with a gas or liquid such as air, water, carbon dioxide, etc. to act as an insulator to
prevent contact between the delivered cryoablative fluid passing through the shaft 170
and the surrounding cervical tissue. The balloon 370 may be inflated prior to or during an
ablation treatment and then deflated once the treatment has been completed to facilitate
removal of the device. The size of the balloon 370 may be optionally varied, e.g., by the
sheath placement location.
[0274]           Figure 62 shows a cross-sectional side view of another variation of an
inflatable liner or balloon 380 located along the inside distal surface of sheath 212. In
this variation, the balloon 380 may inflate to insulate the cryoablative fluid from the
cervical tissue. Figure 63 shows another variation where expandable foam390 may be
deployed via the outer sheath 212 for insulating against the cervix CV. Figure 64 shows
yet another variation where a heating element 400 may be located along the inner or outer
surface of the elongate shaft 170 for heating the surrounding cervical tissue as the
cryoablative fluid is delivered during treatment. Figure 65 shows yet another variation
where a ring balloon 410 may be inflated along either the sheath 212 or shaft 170 to either
insulate the surrounding cervical tissue or to ensure secure placement of the shaft 170
and/or balloon 174 during treatment.
[02751           Figure 66 shows a cross-sectional side view of yet another variation of a
sheath 411 which may be formed from, e.g., urethane having a thin wall of about 0.001
in., which may be doubled over and sealed such that the sheath 411 contains a volume of
liquid or gas 413 such as saline, air, etc. The cooling probe assembly having the tubing
201 and balloon 174 in its collapsed state may also be seen. The sheath distal end 415
may optionally incorporate a deformable member such as an elastic or expandable ring
417 contained circumferentially within the distal end 415, as shown in the side view of
Figure 67A. Alternatively, a biased circular member such as a ring 419 comprised of a
circularly-formed spring may be contained circumferentially within the distal end 415, as
shown in Figure 67B. With the sheath 411 positioned with its distal end 415 distal to the
tubing 201, the ring 417 may configure into a ring having a first diameter which at least
                                                56

partially covers the distal opening of the sheath 411. However, when the tubing 201 is
advanced from the sheath 411, the ring 417 may stretch or deform into a second larger
diameter as it conforms to the outer surface of the tubing 201. The enlarged ring 417 may
accordingly form a stop or detent for preventing the proximal over-withdrawal of the
sheath 411 relative to the cervix CV as well as facilitating the positioning of the sheath
411 over the cervix CV to provide insulation during a procedure. As the outer sheath 411
and enlarged ring 417 is positioned proximally along the tubing 201 to secure a position
of the ring 417 against cervical tissue, the sheath retraction may accordingly adjust an
expanded length of the balloon 174 within the uterus UT.
[0276]          Moreover, since the positioning of the sheath 411 may also actuate and
adjust a position of a mandrel 290 within the one or more lines 307 to selectively
obstruct or open a selected number of openings 286 (as illustrated in Figure 41), the
single withdrawal and positioning of the outer sheath 411 may not only provide an
adjustable securement of the device relative to the cervical tissue, but it may also
correspondinglyadjust the balloon expanded length and further control the active length
of the delivery line 307 via the mandrel 290 positioning. The sheath retraction and
securement may be utilized not only in this variation, but in any of the variations shown
and described herein, as practicable.
[02771          Figure 68 shows another variation of a cervical protection balloon 421
may have a length, e.g., 4 to 8 cm, that may also be positioned along the outside surface
of the sheath 212 (as shown) or along the inside surface for placement against the cervical
tissue. Figure 69 shows a cross-sectional side view of yet another variation of a dual
sheath assembly having an inner sheath 423 and an outer sheath 425 which are
longitudinally translatable relative to one another. An annular balloon 427 may be
attached to the distal ends of both the inner sheath 423 and outer sheath 425 such that the
balloon 427 size and configuration may be altered by the relative movement and
positioning of the sheaths 423,425. Figures 70A and 70B show detail cross-sectional side
views of an example of an arrangement for several seals 429 which may be positioned
between each respective sheath 423, 425. Corresponding o-ring seals 431 may be
incorporated into the seals 429 to provide for fluid-tight sealing. Also, a fluid line 433
may be passed through one or more seals 429, as shown, to provide for inflation and
deflation of the balloon 174 or annular balloon 427.
[0278]          Another variation is shown in the cross-sectional side view of Figure 71
which shows another dual sheath design where the annular balloon may be comprised of a
                                               57

confined balloon 441 having an expandable balloon portion 443. The balloon, e.g.,
urethane, may be contained between each respective sheath 423, 425 while a doubled
over portion may be positioned to extend from between the distal ends of the sheaths 423,
425. As inflation fluid is introduced into the balloon, the portion of the balloon
constrained between the sheaths 423, 425 may remain collapsed but the unconstrained
expandable balloon portion 443 may expand into an annular shape as shown.
[02791           Figure 72 shows yet another variation where the sheath 445 may be
formed to have a reinforcement member 447, e.g., wire, braid, mesh, etc., integrated
along its body to provide for added strength and space between the sheath 445 and
adjacent tissue. Any of the balloon embodiments described herein may be incorporated
with the sheath 445 as shown.
[0280]           Figure 73 shows another variation of a sheath having an annular balloon
449 positioned along the distal end of the inner sheath 423 while constrained by the distal
end of the outer sheath 425. The balloon 449 may be sized according to the relative
positioning between the inner and outer sheaths.
[0281]           Figures 74A and 74B show partial cross-sectional side views of yet
another example of an outer sheath 451 slidably positioned over tubing 201 where the
distal end of outer sheath 451 may incorporate an integrated expandable ring 453, e.g.,
elastomeric, foam, etc. As previously described in a similar embodiment, the expandable
ring 453 may have a first diameter which closes upon the distal end of tubing 201 when
the outer sheath 451 is advanced distal to the tubing 201. As the outer sheath 451 is
retracted relative to tubing 201, the ring 453 may expand to a larger second diameter as it
conforms to the outer surface of the tubing 201. The enlarged profile of the outer sheath
451 may thus function as a stop relative to the cervical tissue during a procedure.
[0282]           Figure 75 shows a similar variation where the expandable ring 453 may
incorporate one or more lubricious surfaces 455 to facilitate the retraction of outer sheath
451, e.g., by peeling the outer layer relative to the inner layer, and the conformance of the
ring 453 relative to the tubing 201. Figure 76 shows a side view of yet another variation
where the outer sheath 451 may instead incorporate a discrete ring section 461 having the
expandable ring 453 positioned relative to the tubing 201. Figure 77 shows yet another
variation where the distal end of the tubing 201 may define a tapered distal end 463 to
facilitate the expansion of the expandable ring 453 when outer sheath 451 is retracted.
[0283]           In yet another variation of the outer sheath, Figure 78 shows an
embodiment where the outer sheath 465 may have a radially expandable portion 467
                                                58

formed near or at a distal end of the outer sheath 465. Prior to or during a procedure to
secure a position of the outer sheath 465 relative to the cervical tissue, the expandable
portion 467 may be utilized rather than an inflatable balloon. The expandable portion 467
may generally comprise one or more lengths of the outer sheath 465 being reconfigurable
along a pivotable or bendable portion such that as the distal end of the outer sheath 465 is
retracted relative to the remainder of the sheath 465, the one or more lengths may pivot
and reconfigure into its radial configuration.
[0284]           A linkage 475 (such as wire, rod, string, ribbon, etc.) may be coupled to
the distal end of the outer sheath 465 at a first stop 469, as shown in the partial cross
sectional side view of Figure 79A. A second stop 471 may be positioned proximally of
the first stop 469 which limits the proximal withdrawal of the linkage 475 by a
predetermined distance. When the linkage 475 engages the first stop 469 and retracts the
sheath distal end to radially extend the expandable portion 467, the further retraction of
linkage 475 may be stopped by the second stop 471. The outer sheath 465 may define the
lumen through which the cooling probe assembly may be advanced without interference
from the retraction assembly. Another variation is illustrated in Figure 79B which shows
a similar mechanism but where the second stop 471 may be replaced by a biasing element
473, e.g., spring, positioned proximally of the first stop 469.
[0285]           Yet another variation is shown in the side views of Figures 80A and 80B
which illustrate a representation of an exemplary overcenter linkage mechanism 481
which may be incorporated with the retraction mechanism. A linkage 483 and
corresponding biasing element 485, e.g., spring, may be coupled to the linkage member
475 attached to the stop 469. As the linkage 475 is retracted to reconfigure the
expandable portion 467, the overcenter mechanism 481 may also be retracted and
actuated to engage a position of the linkage 475 such that the retraction of the expandable
portion 467 may be selectively maintained. The overcenter mechanism 481 may be
selectively disengaged to release and reconfigure the expandable portion 467.
[0286]           Figure 81 shows a side view of yet another variation where the outer
sheath 491 may incorporate one or more distal cam members 493A, 493B. With the outer
sheath 491 positioned distally of the tubing 201, the cam members 493A, 493B may be
configured into a first collapsed configuration. As the outer sheath 491 is retracted
relative to tubing 201, the cam members 493A, 493B may pivot along outer sheath 491
when urged by the outer surface of the tubing 201 and reconfigure into an expanded
                                               59

configuration as indicated. The reconfigured expanded cam members 493A, 493B may
then be used as a stop for the outer sheath 491 relative to the cervical tissue.
[02871           An example of the reconfigured cam members 493A, 493B used as a stop
is illustrated in the exemplary cross-sectional side view of Figure 82. As indicated, as the
outer sheath 491 is retracted and the cam members 493A, 493B reconfigure, the outer
sheath 491 may be further retracted until secured against the cervix CV. Figure 83 shows
another example where the outer sheath 501 having the distal tip cam members 503A,
503B may be configured to have a tapered distal end 505 to allow for the further pivoting
of the cam members 503A, 503B during sheath retraction.
[02881           Figure 84 shows an exemplary illustration of how the outer sheath 465
may be deployed first and secured into position with, e.g., the expandable portion
467, placed into contact against the cervix CV. The cooling probe assembly and
collapsed balloon 174 may then be inserted through the outer sheath 465 at a later
time and advanced into the uterus UT for treatment. In this and any of the other
variations
described herein, as practicable, the outer sheath may be deployed independently of the
cooling probe if so desired.
[02891           Figure 85 shows yet another variation where the outer sheath may be
configured as a corrugated outer sheath 511 to provide a structure which is strong yet
flexible. Figures 86 and 87 show additional variations where the outer sheath 513 may
comprise an annular balloon 517 located along inner surface of sheath 513. The sheath
distal end may define one or more longitudinal slots 515 for selective expansion of the
balloon 517. Alternatively, the annular balloon 519 may be located along outer surface of
sheath 513, as also previously described.
[0290]           Figures 88A to 88D show yet another variation where the sheath 521 may
incorporate an integrated feature to provide further insulation between the cryoablative
fluid and the surrounding cervical tissue by creating or forming insulative pockets of air.
The variation shown in the cross-sectional end view of Figure 88A shows a sheath 521
defining a plurality of raised and curved surfaces 523 along the inner surface of the sheath
521. Figure 88B shows another variation where a plurality of raised and curved surfaces
525 may be formed along the outer surface of the sheath 521. Yet another example is
shown in Figure 88C which shows a sheath 521 formed to have both internal and external
raised surfaces 527 while the variation of Figure 88D shows a variation where the internal
sheath surface may have a plurality of raised projections or fingers extending inwardly.
                                              60

[02911           In controlling the ablative treatments described above, the treatment
assembly may be integrated into a single cooling system 420, as shown in the exemplary
schematic illustration of Figure 89. The cooling system 420 may be contained entirely
within the handle assembly 214 as described above or it may be separated into
components, as needed or desired. In either case, the cooling system 420 may generally
comprise a microcontroller 422 for monitoring and/or controlling parameters such as
cavity temperature, cavity pressure, exhaust pressure, etc. A display 424, e.g., a digital
display which may be located along handle assembly 214, may be in communication with
the microcontroller 422 for displaying parameters such as cavity pressure, cavity
temperature, treatment time, etc. Any errors may also be shown on the display 424 as
well. A separate indicator 426, e.g., visual or auditory alarm, may also be in
communication with the microcontroller 422 for alerting the user to prompts, errors, etc.
through as any number of indicators, symbols, or text, etc., for alerts, as well as for
instructions, or other indications.
[0292]           A coolant reservoir 428, e.g., nitrous oxide canister in this example, may
be fluidly coupled to the handle 214 and/or elongate shaft 170 via a coolant valve 430
which may be optionally controlled by the microcontroller 422. The coolant reservoir
428 may be in fluid communication with the cooling probe assembly 220 and with the
interior of the balloon 174. One or more pressure sensors 432 may be in communication
with a pressure lumen 434 contained within the cooling probe assembly 220 or elongate
shaft 170 and one or more temperature sensors 436 in communication with a
thermocouple/thermistor wire 438 also contained within the cooling probe assembly 220
or elongate shaft 170 may be incorporated. The one or more pressure sensors 432 and/or
temperature sensors 436 may be in communication with the microcontroller 422 as well.
Moreover, the pressure sensors 432 may optionally comprise a sensor positioned within
the balloon 174 where the sensor is designed for low temperature measurement. Such a
pressure sensor may incorporate a closed or open column of liquid (e.g., ethanol, etc.) or
gas (e.g., air, carbon dioxide, etc.) which extends through the cooling probe assembly.
[0293]           The cryoablative fluid contained within the coolant reservoir 428, such as
nitrous oxide, may be pumped (or allowed to flow if reservoir 428 is under pressure) via,
e.g., a motor-driven valve such as coolant valve 430, to control nitrous oxide inflow rate.
The valve 430 may also be used to maintain a desired amount of back pressure to separate
the walls of the uterus. For instance, a relatively low back pressure of, e.g., 40 to 60 mm
Hg, may be used. Alternatively, a simple but precise exhaust flow restriction might be all
                                                61

that is needed, e.g., such as a fixed, non-adjustable valve. In yet another alternative,
vacuum pressure may be used to control the rate at which the exhaust gas is pulled
through, e.g., a nitrous oxide deactivation filter.
[0294]          The rate at which the cryoablative fluid, such as the nitrous oxide, is
delivered may be controlled by the temperature measured within the balloon 174 and/or
uterine cavity. The target temperature range may range, e.g., between -65 and -80
degrees C. By limiting the temperature measured within the balloon 174 to a value which
is lower than the boiling point of nitrous oxide, about -88.5 degrees C, the chance of
liquid nitrous oxide build-up in the balloon 174 may be greatly reduced to prevent any
excessive intrauterine pressures if the exhaust tube is blocked.
[0295]          In the event that excessive pressure is measured within the balloon 174 or
the pressure differential between two sensors is too large, the system may be programmed
to automatically stop the flow of the cryoablative fluid. A separate shut-off valve may be
used in-place of the coolant valve 430. Furthermore, if electrical power is interrupted to
the system, the separate shut-off valve may automatically be actuated. In addition, the
indicator 426 may signal to the user that excessive pressures were reached and the system
shut-down.
[02961          The inside diameter of the delivery line may also be sized to deliver
cryoablative fluid up to but not exceeding, e.g., a maximum anticipated rate for a large,
well-perfuse uterus. By limiting the rate of cryoablative fluid infusion and sizing the
exhaust tube appropriately, the system may be able to evacuate the expanded gas even in
the event of a catastrophic failure of the delivery line.
[02971          Additionally, an exhaust lumen 440 in communication with the elongate
probe 170 and having a back pressure valve 444 may also include a pressure sensor 442
where one or both of the back pressure sensor 442 and/or valve 444 may also be in
communication with the microcontroller 422. While the microcontroller 422 may be used
to control the pressure of the introduced cryoablative fluid, the pressure of the
cryoablative fluid within the balloon 174 interior may also be controlled automatically by
the microcontroller 422 adjusting the back pressure valve 444 or by manually adjusting
the back pressure valve 444. In the event that the microcontroller 422 is used to control
the back pressure via valve 444, the microcontroller 422 may be configured or otherwise
programmed to adjust the valve 444 based on feedback from other sensors, such as the
measured parameters from the one or more pressure sensors 432 and/or temperature
                                               62

sensors 436 to create a closed feedback loop system. A vacuum may also be optionally
incorporated into the closed feedback loop.
[0298]           The exhaust lumen 440 may be fluidly connected, e.g., to a reservoir 446
for collecting or deactivating the exhausted cryoablative fluid. The reservoir 446 may
optionally incorporate a filter into the handle 214 or become integrated into a reusable
console. Alternatively, the exhausted cryoablative fluid may be simply collected in a
reservoir 446 or exhausted into atmosphere.
[0299]           Generally, redundant pressure lines and sensors, such as pressure lumen
434, that terminate in the balloon 174 may correspond to sensors located in the handle
214 to make comparison measurements. The pressure lines may be filled with a fluid
such as ethanol to prevent freezing during a procedure. Alternatively, a gas such as air
may be used in the pressure lines but may utilize temperature compensation.
[0300]           As at least one thermocouple may be located within the balloon 174 and
used to measure temperature during the procedure, additional thermocouples may be
optionally included at other locations internal or external to the balloon 174 to provide for
additional temperature measurements. For example, a thermocouple may be optionally
located on the distal portion of the sheath 212 to monitor temperature within the cervix
Cv.
[0301]           After completion of the procedure, all unused cryoablative fluid still
contained in the reservoir 428 or within the system may be automatically or manually
vented, e.g., to the deactivation filter or collection reservoir 446.
[0302]           The system 420 may optionally further incorporate an emergency shut-off
system which may be actuated in the event that electrical power is lost, if a user manually
activates the shut-off system, or in the event that the microcontroller 422 detects a high
pressure within the system 420. One example of the emergency shut-off system may
incorporate an emergency shut-off valve which may include valve 430 or which may
alternatively incorporate another valve separate from valve 430. Moreover, in detecting
the pressure within the system 420, a redundant pressure sensor may also be utilized
along with the one or more pressure sensors 432 either at the same location or at a
different location along the system 420.
[0303]           In any of the examples described herein, the system may employ a
thermally conductive fluid having a thermal conductivity greater than that of saline. This
thermal conductivity may help to ensure that the fluid within the body cavity or lumen is
at the same temperature throughout even without agitation or lavage. Such a fluid may be
                                                63

used with the fluid lavage and/or the fluid infusion followed by application of a
cryoprobe. The improved thermal conductivity may be achieved via a variety of different
options including, but not limited to, choice of a thermally conductive fluid or gel,
addition of thermally conductive compounds to the fluid or gel (e.g., metals or metal ions,
etc.) and/or agitation of the fluid within the cavity to help achieve equilibration of the
temperature. Additionally, the fluid may be infused as a fluid or gel until a set pressure is
achieved. The cryoprobe may then be introduced into the body cavity/lumen and heat
may be withdrawn from the fluid/gel. Prior to or in concert with the achievement of a
cryotherapeutic (ablative or non-ablative) temperature, the fluid or may form a gel or
solid. This may be utilized such that fluid or gel within the cavity may be trapped within
the target lumen or body cavity with its change in viscosity or state thereby preventing
leakage of the fluid or gel and unwanted exposure of adjacent tissues to the
cryotherapeutic effect. Due to the higher thermal conductivity or the gelled or frozen
fluid or gel, the continued removal of heat from the gelled or frozen mass may be rapidly
and uniformly distributed throughout the body cavity or lumen. The solution may also be
partially frozen or gelled and then agitated or recirculated to ensure even greater
distribution of the cryotherapeutic effect. Moreover, the fluid may also be formulated to
have a freezing temperature at the desired ablation temperature such that the fluid remains
at the desired ablation temperature for a significant amount of time while the fluid
changed from a liquid to a solid or vice versa.
[0304]           Furthermore, the fluid or gel may be made thermally conductive by the
addition of a biocompatible metal or metallic ion. Any metal or conductive material may
be used for this purpose, e.g., silver, gold, platinum, titanium, stainless steel, or other
metals which are biocompatible. Alternatively the thermally conductive fluid may be
used to transmit the thermal energy to tissues in order to provide thermal ablation as
opposed to the extraction of energy with cryoablation. In either embodiment, with
sufficient thermal conductivity the fluid may act as an extension of the ablative energy
source and provide a custom ablation tip for the application of or removal of energy from
any body tissues, body cavities, or body lumens. Another benefit is consistency of
treatment since cryoablation may require use of ultrasound in the setting of uterine
ablation. Any of the devices herein may allow for the use of temperature tracking or
simple timed treatment in order to automate the ablation (with or without ultrasound
monitoring). For example, application of -80 C for 3 minutes has been shown to provide
the correct depth of ablation for many uterine cavities. The devices herein may allow for
                                                64

the tracking of temperature such that once a desired temperature is reached (e.g., -60 C) a
timer may be triggered which automatically discontinues therapy and warms the cavity
based on time alone. This may be used in the setting of a fixed volume infusion (e.g., 10
to 15 cc of thermally conductive fluid/gel for all patients) or in the setting of infusion of a
fluid/gel to a set pressure (with variable volumes). This timed ablation may also be used
in concert with any of the device herein to allow for elimination of the burdensome
requirement for ultrasound tracking of the cryogenically treated regions.
[03051           Alternatively, this thermally conducting fluid (which may optionally
include solid particles of metal) may be infused into a balloon which conforms to the
uterus, esophagus or other body cavity or lumen at relatively low pressures (e.g., less than
150 mmHg), as also described above. The thermally conducting material may
alternatively be comprised entirely of a solid (e.g., copper spheres or a copper chain)
within the conforming balloon wherein the thermally conductive solid and/or fluid may
be reversibly delivered into the conforming balloon under low pressure after which a
cryoprobe, cryogenic liquid and/or cryogenic gas may be delivered into the balloon and
activated to ablate the entirety of the uterus UT at once. The cryogen source may also be
positioned within the balloon to obtain maximum cryoablation within the body of uterus
with less ablative effect proximally and in the cornua. Vaseline, oils or other thermally
resistive materials may also be used in conjunction with this or other modalities in order
to protect certain areas of the uterus, cervix and vagina.
[03061           In creating the optimal thermally conductive fluid and/or gel, any
conductive material may be added to the fluid or gel including, e.g., gold, silver,
platinum, steel, iron, titanium, copper or any other conductive metal, ion, or molecule. If
a metal is used as a dopant to increase the thermal conductivity, the added metal may take
any shape or form including spheres, rods, powder, nanofibers, nanotubes, nanospheres,
thin filaments or any other shape that may be suspended in a solution or gel. The fluid or
gel may itself also be thermally conductive and may be infused and then removed or may
be left in the cavity and allowed to flow naturally from the uterus as with normal
menstruation. The thermally conductive polymer may also be biocompatible, as well, but
this may not be necessary if the fluid/gel is extracted immediately following the
procedure.
[03071           Despite the potential for toxicity, ethanol may be well suited for a liquid
lavage in that it resists freezing down to -110 C and is, other than dose dependent toxicity,
biocompatible. Solutions of 75% to 99.9% ethanol concentrations may be used to good
                                               65

effect and have been demonstrated to show that a freeze layer develops very rapidly
inhibiting further ethanol absorption. An ethanol copper composition may also be used
since ethanol resists freezing whereas aqueous fluids freeze and expand thereby moving
the metal particle out of direct contact with the tissue.
[0308] In another variation for creating back pressure within the system, Figures 90A and
90B show a device for closing the exhaust flow path to facilitate a liner integrity check and
to also increase the pressure within the uterine cavity. As the liner is initially expanded
(e.g., up to 100 mmHg of pressure), the transition between initial expansion and treatment
should desirably occur with a minimal change in cavity pressure. Hence, the pressure
within the liner and system during the first 30 seconds of treatment is ideally
maintained 85 +/- 15 mmHg. The variation shown in Figure 90A illustrates an end cap
450 which may be used to cover or obstruct the exhaust line 213 to facilitate the increase in
back pressure during the initial expansion. The end cap 450 may contact the exhaust tube
contact 452 over the exhaust line 213 such that the end cap 450 and exhaust tube
contact 452 are electrically coupled to form a circuit via conductive lines 454.
[03091          Once sufficient back pressure has been created in the system and
cryoablation treatment is ready to begin, the end cap 450 may be removed from the
exhaust tube contact 452 (manually or automatically) breaking the electrical connection, as
shown in Figure 90B. The processor or microcontroller in the system may detect the
electrical break and automatically initiate infusion of the cryoablative fluid or gas to begin
the treatment. Moreover, because the exhaust line 213 is now unobstructed, the discharged
fluid or gas may also be vented or removed from the system through exhaust line 213.
[03101          In other variations for maintaining exhaust back pressure within the
system, the pump (with or without a filter) may be used to increase the pressure.
Alternatively, a compressed gas (e.g., coupled via a bladder, tank, etc.) may be infused into
the liner and system to increase the pressure. In either case, any of these methods may be
used in various combinations with any of the system or device variations described herein.
[03111          Alternative mechanisms may also be used for maintaining a sufficient back
pressure within the system and the liner. Another variation is shown in the schematic side
view of Figure 91A of flapper valve 460 such as an electromechanical flapper valve which
may be incorporated within the handle assembly 211 (e.g., positioned between the pump
and the liner) for fluidly coupling to the liner and exhaust. Figure 91 illustratively
                                               66

shows flapper valve 460 having a chamber 462 with a translating piston 464 within the
chamber 462. The pump 468 may be fluidly coupled via pump line 470 to the first
section 480 of the chamber 462 (e.g., at a top of the chamber 462) and exhaust and/or
liner channel 472 may also be similarly fluidly coupled to the first section 480 of chamber
462. The exhaust and/or liner channel 472 may also incorporate a unidirectional valve
474 within the channel 472 such that fluid or gas may pass through channel 472 and past
unidirectional valve 474 but is prevented from flowing back into first chamber 480.
[0312]           The exhaust and/or liner channel 476 may be fluidly coupled to the second
section 482 of chamber 462 (e.g., at the bottom of the chamber 462) in proximity to
ambient line 478. A sealing gasket 466 having a first sealing ring 466A which encircles
the periphery of the chamber 462 and a second sealing ring 466B which encircles the
entry to the exhaust and/or liner channel 476 may also be incorporated in the second
chamber 482, as shown in the top view of Figure 91B.
[0313]           The flapper valve 460 may remain closed by the system (e.g., motor, linear
actuator, magnetic, electromagnetically, etc.) but opened by the system as the ablation
treatment begins. The flapper valve may be actuated, e.g., by a separate button or
actuator, positioned upon the handle assembly 211.
[0314]           When actuated, the pump 468 may be turned on and the piston 464 may
remain positioned at the bottom of the chamber 462 upon the sealing gasket 466, as
shown in the side view of Figure 91C. The piston 464 may form a moderate seal while
sitting upon the gasket 466 but as the pressure in the chamber 462 is increased, the
sealing between the piston 464 and gasket 466 may be increased accordingly. The gasket
466 itself may form different regions of relatively low pressure in the area between the
first sealing ring 466A and the second sealing ring 466B (e.g., at atmospheric pressure)
and high pressure in the area surrounded by the second sealing ring 466B (e.g., at the
same pressure as within the liner/exhaust) during the initial pump up phase.
[0315]           After the liner has been pumped up to its pre-determined pressure level to
properly distend the cavity and deploy the liner (e.g., 85 mmHg), the pump 468 may be
reversed to remove the pressure from the chamber 462. The one-way or uni-directional
valve 474 may prevent the vacuum from pulling on the liner as would the seal at the
bottom of the chamber 462 formed by the piston 464.
[0316]           When P2 is lowered, the force of P1 upon the bottom of the piston 464
may cause it to lift within the chamber 462, as shown in Figure 91D. This piston
movement will cause P1 to drop as the seal at the bottom breaks and as P1 begins to drop,
                                              67

the vacuum may shut off and the treatment may be initiated. The flow of the cryogenic
fluid or gas through the chamber 462 may cause the piston 464 to move to the top of the
chamber 462 which may allow for the free flow of nitrous to the environment, as shown
in Figure 91E.
[03171          Figures 92A and 92B show an alternative flapper valve 490 which may
function similarly except for the pump/vacuum line 470 may be positioned along a side
wall of the chamber 462. With the vacuum/pump line 470 so positioned, the line 470
may remain below the piston 464 while the cryogenic fluid or gas flows through the
chamber 462, as shown in Figure 92B. If the back pressure in the system is too high, the
pump or a vacuum pump 468 may be actuated to provide a slightly negative pressure or
suction that may lower the back pressure on the system.
[0318]          As previously described, the system may be programmed to enable a
number of different processes. The processor or microcontroller may be accordingly
programmed with a number of different algorithms depending on the functional mode to
be performed. Figure 93 illustrates how the different algorithms 500 may be programmed
into the processor or microcontroller and how they may functionally interact with one
another. Once the device is initially powered on, the system may enter a Start-Up Mode
502 where the system performs a self-check of the sensors and the overall system. Some
of the checks may include, e.g., ensuring pressure sensors have a detected initial reading
of between 0 and 10 mmHg which do not deviate from one another by more than 5
mmHg; detecting a battery voltage reading of greater than 7.5 V; and/or detecting any
memory feature which may be used to record various readings and parameters as well as
load any number of additional features into the system.
[0319]          Once the Start-Up Mode 502 has been initiated and/or completed, the user
may, e.g., actuate the system to enter a Liner Puff Mode 504. In Liner Puff Mode 504,
the system may slowly add ambient filtered air into the liner until target treatment
pressure is reached, as described above. The pump may be turned on until the pressure
has increased by, e.g., 5 mmHg, and may then be shutoff for, e.g., 2 seconds. The pump
may cycle on and off until the system measures, e.g., 85 mmHg. Typically, the full ramp
up may take, e.g., 15-20 seconds. When 85 mmHg is reached, the device may then enter
Liner Check Mode 506. In this mode, the system may detect for leaks in the system. The
system may waits for, e.g., 5 seconds, after Liner Puff Mode 504 is complete and then
detect whether the pressure is still above, e.g., 40 mmHg or more. If the system is
holding pressure, the device may then enter Treat Mode 508.
                                               68

[03201           During Treat Mode 508, the system may deliver the cryogenic fluid or gas
to the liner while looking for pressure faults. An example of a pressure fault may include
a detected pressure value greater than, e.g., 150 mmHg. The treatment may be stopped
automatically and user restart may be halted at least temporarily by the system. Another
example of a pressure fault may include when a detected pressure deviates from other
pressure readings by, e.g., 20 mmHg or greater for 3 consecutive seconds. Again,
treatment may be stopped automatically and user restart may be halted at least
temporarily by the system. Once a predetermined time period has elapsed, e.g., 2 minutes
and 30 seconds, the device may enter Thaw Mode 510.
[0321]           In Thaw Mode 510, the system may push puffs of ambient filtered air
into the liner to warm it up for removal from the patient. The pump may push air into
the cavity while the exhaust solenoid is closed until, e.g., 10 mmHg pressure in the
cavity is measured. The pump may be then turned off and the exhaust solenoid opened
for, e.g., 2 seconds to allow the air to escape the cavity. The pump/open cycle may be
repeated for,
e.g., 2 minutes. Additionally and/or optionally, a vacuum may also be used in Thaw
Mode 510, e.g., to facilitate peeling of the liner 174 from the frozen uterine walls and to
expedite the removal of the device.
[0322]           Once Thaw Mode 510 has been completed, the system may then enter
Disposal Mode 512 where the liner and system may be evacuated of any cryogenic fluid
or gas. In the event that any of the different modes detects a failure, e.g., if the Startup
Mode 502 fails, too many puff attempts are detected during the Liner Puff Mode 504, a
leak is detected during the Liner Check Mode 506, or a pressure fault is detected by the
system during the Treat Mode 508, then the system may automatically default into
entering the Disposal Mode 512.
[0323]           In the event that the user pauses the system anytime during the Liner
Puff Mode 504 or the Liner Check Mode 506, the system may enter into the Pause Mode
514 where the system releases pressure and waits indefinitely for the user to re-initiate
the puff up sequence by initiating the system again. In the event that the user pauses the
system anytime during the Treat Mode 508, the user may have a predetermined period of
time, e.g., 15 seconds, to re-start treatment or the system may stop entirely. The time
limit may be imposed so that the frozen tissue does not thaw significantly which could
affect the ultimate depth of ablation. When treatment is re-started, the treatment time
resumes from where it was paused.
                                               69

[03241           Additionally and/or optionally, the processor or microcontroller may also
be programmed to monitor the overall system. Hence, the system may be programmed to
transmit a signal on a regular basis, e.g., every second, to a monitoring system. If the
monitoring system fails to receive the signal, the entire system may be shut down such
that the valves automatically close, the exhaust valve opens, and the pumps shut down.
[0325]           Additional features may also be incorporated for safety. For instance, in
order to prevent high pressure from developing within the uterus due to the accumulation
of the cryogenic fluid or gas, safety features may be integrated into the system. Examples
of some of the safety features may include: redundant, kink-resistant pressure lines and
sensors to monitor intrauterine cavity pressure; flow rate-limited delivery line to
minimize the amount of cryogenic fluid or gas introduced into the cavity in the event of a
catastrophic failure; pressure relief valve in the exhaust flow path which opens if the
primary path is obstructed; flexible yet crush-resistant, laser-cut, stainless steel exhaust
tube within the liner; fail-safe solenoid valve on the cryogenic fluid or gas inflow path
which closes in the event of a power failure or other control system failure; and/or
software watchdog to safely shutdown the device in the event of a software malfunction.
[03261           Moreover, in order to prevent cryogenic fluid or gas in the exhaust from
coming into contact with the physician or patient, additional safety provisions may also
be implemented. Examples of some of these safety provisions may include: heat sink in
the exhaust pathway to promote the conversion of cryogenic fluid or gas from liquid to
gaseous states; and/or convoluted tube at the end of the exhaust path to further promote
cryogenic fluid conversion from liquid to gaseous states and also prevent cryogenic fluid
or gas from contacting the physician or patient.
[03271           As described herein, various visualization modalities may be utilized with
any of the system variations described. For instance, hysteroscopic visualization may be
accomplished by utilizing scope having, e.g., a 2.9 mm outer diameter and 39 cm length.
Such a scope may be introduced through, e.g., the handle assembly 211, through a seal
that interfaces with the scope and allows for the inflation of the liner with the scope in
place if a more broad view of the cavity is desired. The scope may be removed before
treatment is initiated.
[03281           Additionally and/or alternatively, ultrasound visualization may also be
utilized to aid the user in the placement of the device within the cavity. During treatment,
the cryogenic fluid or gas is visible under ultrasound as is the ice front.
                                               70

[03291           While the treatment assembly may be comprised of a completely
disposable handheld device which is provided sterile to the user, the cryogenic fluid or
gas, e.g., liquid N 2 0, may be contained in a canister which is integrated into the device.
Alternatively, the assembly may be tethered to a reusable liquid N 2 0 tank. Electronic
components may be relocated from the handheld device to a reusable console which
could also contain the liquid N 2 0 tank. In another alternative, a simple disposable
element of the system may attach to a reusable handle tethered to a liquid N 2 0 tank. The
reusable handle could be re-sterilizable and may contain the majority of the components
normally contained within the disposable handle. The disposable element could consist
of the flexible probe, liner, pressure-sensing lumens and the N 2 0 delivery line.
[03301           While the system is described above for the cryoablative treatment of the
uterine cavity, the system may also be used for other applications. For instance, the
system may be utilized for shrinking or killing uterine fibroids where the probe may be
inserted and the liner inflated with gas, as previously described, and a visualization
element (ultrasound or hysteroscopy) may be used to position a freezing element up
against the fibroid and freezing may be initiated. The freezing element may be positioned
against the endometrial wall or may be inserted into the fibroid itself. The time of the
freeze may be determined based upon the size of the fibroid with longer freezes for larger
fibroids.
[03311           In addition to the initial positioning, the freeze may also be tracked using
ultrasound, hysteroscopy or other visualization tools and stopped once a sufficient
freeze has been achieved. The cryogen may be infused into a small balloon or liner
inflated within the larger, gas-filled liner which may extract energy across both liners
from the fibroid. The cryogen transmitting lumen can also be flexibly directed to the
surface of the
fibroid under visualization and the cryogen transmission balloon can be sized to best fit
the endometrial surface of the fibroid and the freeze can be initiated and tracked under
visualization. The small cryogen transmission balloon may also be replaced with a metal
or other thermally conductive tip in which the cryogen undergoes a phase change and/or
extracts energy. The gas-filled liner will allow for good visualization of the uterus and
the freezing probe. In alternative variations, hyperthermal or other destructive energy
may also be transmitted across the liner in order to destroy the fibroid with the liner
simply acting as a source of controlled visualization without the introduction of saline or
other distention media.
                                                 71

 [03321          In yet another application, the system may be used to treat conditions such
as Barrett's Esophagus. The probe may be inserted under endoscopic visualization and
the liner sized to the length of the esophagus to be treated. The liner may then be inflated
and visualization may be repeated across the liner to ensure optimal distention and
contact with tissues to be treated. The cryogen delivery probe may then deliver a liquid
cryogen or, preferably, a cold gas to the interior of the liner to treat the tissues adjacent to
the liner. If needed or desired, the liner may then be deflated, repositioned and cryogen
may be reinfused one or more times. This may be particularly the case for a relatively
smaller esophagus in which the oversized liner may have more extreme folds which could
prevent energy transmission. Repositioning and redeployment of the liner may allow for
these folds to occur in different areas and will allow for a more consistent ablation. The
use of cold gas may also allow for a more consistent, light ablation, as well, due to the
smaller gradient in temperature and lack of the powerful phase change. Benefits of this
design include the ability to prevent overlapping circumferential ablations which have
been found to cause strictures and stenosis. Additional benefit can be found from the
consistent treatment of all or part of the esophagus, including the gastroesophageal
junction.
 [03331          In yet another application, the system may be used to treat conditions such
as treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by shrinking the prostrate. The prostate
tissue is sensitive to cryotherapy as evidenced by the efficacy of cryogenic freezing of the
prostate for oncology. In this variation of the device, the liner may be placed in the
urethra in the region of the prostate and cryogen may be infused (liquid or gas) into the
liner. The energy may be transmitted across the wall of the liner and the urethra into the
prostate causing apoptosis and death of the prostatic cells that are generating the
symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The urethra may be temporarily stented open
to allow for epithelialization without stricture formation either before or after the therapy.
The stent could be configured to degrade over time, pass on its own and provide
symptomatic relief and protection from urine during the healing period (i.e., be an
occlusive barrier).
 [0334]          Due to the ease of visualization of the freeze, this therapy may also be
conducted under direct visualization to ensure optimal freezing. This freeze may be
stopped and/or restarted by the user, but may optimally be a programmed time or time at
temperature. The therapy may also be performed without visualization in which case the
freeze probe may be inserted with a location indicator (i.e., a balloon that is inflated in the
                                               72

bladder and drawn back to the urethral outlet) and therapy initiated once the correct
position has been obtained.
