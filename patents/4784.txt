                                       ARRANGEMENT
Cross-reference
[01]    The entire contents of Australian patent applications No. <removed-apn> and No.
<removed-apn> are incorporated herein by reference.
Technical Field
[02]    The present invention relates to a switchboard and in particular, although not
exclusively, this invention relates to a circuit arrangement for a switchboard and a
switchboard with the circuit arrangement.       The circuit arrangement allows convenient and
safe connection of a further switchboard to the switchboard without affecting other
switchboards.
Background
[03]    At a construction or renovation site,. electrical tools (for example, an electric drill) are
used to perform a construction or renovation task. Electricity energy that powers the electric
tools is supplied through a switchboard, which is normally installed at the site temporarily.
Multiple switchboards installed at different levels or a same level of a building can be
connected together to power a number of electrical tools distributed over a large area. The
electric tools include for example, drills, cutting machines, welding equipment and similar
electrical equipment.
[04]    Figure 1 illustrates an existing circuit arrangement 100 of a switchboard. The
switchboard normally includes an enclosure (not shown) to enclose the circuit arrangement
100. The switchboard may also include a stand (not shown) that supports the enclosure.
[05]    When in use, terminal blocks (i.e., active links) 114 of the circuit arrangement 100 are
connected to active wires 102 of a power supply (not shown). The power supply can be a
previous switchboard that supplies electricity to the switchboard or a general power switch at
the construction site. Further, a terminal block (i.e., earth link) 118 of the circuit arrangement
100 is connected to an earth wire 106 of the power supply, and a terminal block (i.e., neutral
link) 116 of the circuit arrangement 100 is connected to a neutral wire 104 of the power
supply. This way, this switchboard is able to carry electric potentials (i.e., voltages),

                                                2
particularly, on the terminal blocks 114 and active wires 101 of the circuit arrangement 100.
Additionally, the circuit arrangement 100 also includes main switches 120 that can switch on
and off electricity supply to sockets 124, and circuit protection devices 122 (such as Residual
Current Devices (RCD), Circuit Breaker (CB), and Residual Current Circuit Breakers with
Overcurrent Protection (RCBO)) connected between the main switches 120 and the sockets
124 of various ratings, such as I0A or 15A or 32A, etc.
[06]    It is common that a further switchboard (not shown) needs to be connected to the
switchboard as the construction work progresses, for example, a new level is to be built or
one more switchboard is needed to cover a larger area on the same level, that is, the
switchboard is effectively used as a power supply for the further switchboard. Therefore,
active wires 108 need to be connected between the terminal blocks (i.e., active links) 144 of
the circuit arrangement 100 and the active links of the further switchboard. Further, a neutral
wire 110 needs to be connected between the terminal block (i.e., neutral link) 116 of the
circuit arrangement 100 and the neutral link of the further switchboard, and an earth wire 112
needs to be connected between the terminal block (i.e., earth link) 118 of the circuit
arrangement 100 and the earth link of the switchboard. However, as required by safety
requirements, the terminal blocks or the active links 114 of the circuit arrangement 100 are
not allowed to carry power when the further switchboard is being connected to the
switchboard. Therefore, the general power switch of the construction site has to be switched
off in order for a worker to safely connect the further switchboard to the switchboard. As a
result, all the switchboards at the construction site will lose power, which is safe but causes
inconvenience as all the electric tools at the construction site have to stop working. This
causes additional costs due to downtime of the all the switchboards and the electric tools.
[07]    Accordingly, there is a need for an improved circuit arrangement of a switchboard and
a switchboard with the improved circuit arrangement that do not suffer from above
mentioned deficiencies.

"comprise", "comprises" and "comprising" will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
stated step or element or group of steps or elements but not the exclusion of any other step or

Summary
[011]    There is provided a circuit arrangement of a switchboard for connecting a power
supply including an active wire, a neutral wire and an earth wire to a socket including an
active pin, a neutral pin and an earth pin. The circuit arrangement comprises:
         a first switch having a first contact terminal and a first associated contact terminal, the
first contact terminal of the first switch being configured to electrically connect to the active
wire of the power supply in use;
         a first terminal block electrically connected to the first associated contact terminal of
the first switch;
         a second switch having a second contact terminal and a second associated contact
terminal, the second contact terminal of the second switch being configured to electrically
connect to the first terminal block, and the second associated contact terminal of the second
switch being electrically connected to the active pin of the socket;
         a second tenninal block configured to electrically connect to the neutral wire of the
power supply in use and to the neutral pin of the socket; and
         a third terminal block configured to electrically connect to the earth wire of the power
supply in use and to the earth pin of the socket.
[012]    It is an advantage of the present invention that, the first switch is installed between the
active wire of the power supply and the first terminal block, which allows the switchboard
(particularly, the first terminal block) to be isolated from the power supply if the first switch
is switched off. This way, when connecting a further switchboard to the switchboard, the
general switch at the construction site does not need to be switched off. Instead, only the first
switch of the switchboard is switched off to disconnect electricity supply to the first terminal

                                                  4
block in order to meet safety requirements. On the other hand, as the general switch is not
switched off, other switchboards are not affected. This is highly desirable from safety point
of view as well as for preventing any downtime of the other switchboards.

mechanism configured to connect to a third conductive wire that is connected to the first
contact terminal of the first switch of a further switchboard.

Description of Embodiments
[057]   Figure 2A illustrates a circuit arrangement 200 of a switchboard for a power supply
having a single phase in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The power
supply includes an active wire 202, a neutral wire 216 and an earth wire 220. For illustration
purpose, only the active wire 202, the neutral wire 216 and the earth wire 220 of the power
supply are shown in Figure 2A, and other parts of the power supply are not shown in Figure
2A. As described above, the power supply may be a previous switchboard or a general switch

                                                  I1
at a construction site. The circuit arrangement 200 is used to connect the power supply to a
socket 234 of the circuit arrangement 200. The socket 234 may be rated at different currents,
for example, 10A, 15A, 32A or even lower or higher, depending upon the application of the
socket 234, such as current rating of an electrical tool that needs to be operated. The socket
234 includes an active pin 236 for electrically connecting with the active wire 202, a neutral
pin 238 for electrically connecting with the neutral wire 216 and an earth pin 240 for
electrically connecting with the earth wire 220.
[058]    The circuit arrangement 200 includes a first switch 204 having a first pair of contact
terminals 206, 208. The contact terminal 208 is associated with the contact terminal 206 in
the sense that the contact terminal 208 is able to be electrically connected to or disconnected
from the contact terminal 206.        That is, if the first switch 204 is switch on, the contact
terminal 208 is electrically connected to the contact terminal 206, while if the first switch 204
is switched off, the contact tenninal 208 is electrically disconnected from the contact terminal
206. The first switch 204 is also referred to as isolator switch hereinafter, also known as a
disconnector or a disconnect switch in electrical engineering. The isolator switches are used
to disconnect or isolate a part of a circuit arrangement for service and maintenance purposes.
The isolator switches may be manually or automatically operated. The first contact terminal
206 of the isolator switch 204 is configured to electrically connect to the active wire 202 of
the power supply in use. Generally, for making connections with a switch, such as the isolator
switch 204 and other switches used in the present invention, screws and/or spring loaded
retainers may be used to tightly hold the wires or conductors at contact terminals of the
switch. Additionally, a pair of male and female plugs may also be used for making quicker
connections, wherein one of the male or the female plug is provided at a contact terminal of a
switch and the other one is provided at an end of the wire. Further a first terminal block 210
(i.e., active link) is electrically connected to the first associated contact terminal 208 of the
isolator switch 204, for example, via a first conductive wire 209. In that manner, the supply
of power to the first terminal block 210 via the active wire 202 can be disconnected by
switching off the isolator switch 204.
[059]    The circuit arrangement 200 includes a second switch 226. The second switch 226 is
also referred to as main switch hereinafter. The main switch 226 controls the supply of power
to the socket 234 without affecting the first terminal block 210. That is, if the socket 234
needs to be checked by a worker or it is necessary to have the supply of power to the socket

                                                 12
234 disconnected, the worker can switch off the main switch 226, while the supply of power
to the first terminal block 210 is not affected. The main switch 226 includes a second contact
terminal 228 and a second associated contact terminal 230. The second contact terminal 228
of the main switch 226 is configured to electrically connect to the first terminal block 210, for
example, via a second conductive wire 221, and the second associated contact terminal 230 of
the main switch 226 is electrically connected to the active pin 236 of the socket 234. Further,
the circuit arrangement 200 includes a second terminal block 214 (i.e., neutral link). The
second terminal block 214 electrically connects to the neutral wire 216 of the power supply in
use. The second tenninal block 214 also electrically connects to the neutral pin 238 of the
socket 234. The circuit arrangement 200 further includes a third terminal block 222 (i.e.,
earth link). The third terminal block 222 electrically connects to the earth wire 220 of the
power supply in use and also to the earth pin 240 of the socket 234.
[0601   A terminal block in the present disclosure refers to a block of conductive material, for
example, metal, which is used to make electrical connections between multiple conductive
wires or electrical devices in a circuit. Figure 2B illustrates an example of the first terminal
block 210 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
[061]   As shown in Fig. 2B, the first terminal block 210 includes a first connection
mechanism 2102. The first connection mechanism 2102 is connected to the first conductive
wire 209 that is connected to the first associated contact terminal 208 of the isolator switch
204. As a result, the first terminal block 210 is electrically connected to the associated contact
terminal 208 of the isolator switch 204. The first terminal block 210 also includes a second
connection mechanism 2103. The second connection mechanism 2103 is connected to the
second conductive wire 221. As shown in Figure 2A, the second conductive wire 221 is
connected to the second contact terminal 228 of the main switch 226. Therefore, the first
terminal block 210 is electrically connected to the main switch 226. The first tenninal block
210 further includes a third connection mechanism 2104. When connecting a further
switchboard to the switchboard, the third connection mechanism 2104 is connected to a third
conductive wire 212, which is the active wire of the further switchboard. The third
conductive wire 212 is connected to the first contact terminal of the first switch of the further
switchboard (not shown).
[062]   Figure 2C is a perspective view of the first terminal block 210. As shown in Figure
2C, each of the connection mechanisms 2102, 2103 and 2104 includes a pair of screws. The

                                                13
pair of screws secure the respective conductive wire in a hole formed in the first terminal
block 210. The connection mechanisms 2102, 2103 are arranged in a way that makes it
convenient to connect the respective wire. Particularly, the connection mechanisms 2102,
2103 are arranged at the top of the first terminal block 210, while the connection mechanism
2104 is arranged at the bottom of the first terminal block 210.
[0631 As shown in Figure 2A, the further active wire 212 for the further switchboard
extends from the first terminal block 210. Similarly, a further neutral wire 218 for the further
switchboard extends from the second terminal block 214 and a further earth wire 224 for the
further switchboard extends from the third terminal block 222. As the isolator switch 204 is
installed between the first terminal block 210 and the active wire 202, the first tenninal block
210 can be isolated from the active wire 202 by switching off the isolator switch 204. This
way, the supply of power to all other switchboards need not to be interrupted while
connecting the further switchboard to the switchboard. This is highly desirable from safety
point of view as well as for preventing any downtime of the other switchboards.
10641 It is also desirable to ensure that there is enough protection provided in the circuit
arrangement 200 of the switchboard to protect against conditions such as leakage currents
and overcurrents due to short circuit, spikes and surges. Therefore, the circuit arrangement
200 includes a circuit protection device 232 between the second associated contact terminal
230 of the main switch 226 and the active pin 236 of the socket 234. The circuit protection
device 232 electrically connects the second associated contact terminal 230 of the main
switch 226 to the active pin 236 of the socket 234. In various embodiments the circuit
protection device 232 includes a Residual Circuit Breaker with Overcurrent Protection
(RCBO). Also, the second terminal block 214 is electrically connected to the neutral pin 238
of the socket 234 via the RCBO. The earth pin 240 of the socket 234 may be directly
electrically connected with the third terminal block 222.
[065]   A skilled addressee would appreciate that the RCBO combines functions of a
Residual Current Device (RCD) and a Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) in one device. The
RCD part allows it to counter supply imbalances due to current leakage, such as when a
person is experiencing an electrical shock. The MCB part protects during overcurrent
situations, such as during spikes or surges in the circuit arrangement. In various jurisdictions,
the RCBO is also known as a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI). Also, a commonly
known device in various jurisdictions, called an Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) is also

                                                 14
envisaged to be within the scope of the present invention. In various other embodiments, a
standalone RCD may be used as the circuit protection device 232.
1066] In use, before the further switchboard is connected to the switchboard, particularly,
the circuit arrangement 200, the electrical connection between the active wire 202 and the
first terminal block (i.e., active link) 210 is disconnected by switching off the first switch
204. This isolates the first terminal block 210 from the power supply. Therefore, a worker is
able to safely connect the third conductive wire 212 between the first terminal block 210 and
the first contact terminal of the first switch of the further switchboard. Similarly, the further
neutral wire 218 is connected to a second terminal block (i.e., neutral link) of the further
switchboard and the further earth wire 224 is connected to a third terminal block (i.e., earth
link) of the further switchboard. After making the above mentioned connections, the
electrical connection between the first terminal block 210 and the active wire 202 is restored
by switching the isolator switch 204 on. This way, the further switchboard is powered by the
switchboard without affecting the other switchboards as the general switch at the construction
site does not needed to be switched off.
[067]    It will be appreciated by a skilled addressee that the implementation of the present
invention is not limited to the power supply with the single phase only. The circuit
arrangement 200 may be modified for a poly-phase power supply and an exemplary
implementation of the invention for a power supply with three phases is discussed below.
[068]    Figure 3A illustrates a circuit arrangement 300 of a switchboard for a power supply
having three phases. The circuit arrangement 300 has a three phase five-pin socket 324 (also
referred to as 'the socket 324'). A typical current rating of the three phase five-pin socket 324
is 32A. The power supply includes a first active wire 301a, a second active wire 301b, a third
active wire 301c, a neutral wire 313 and an earth wire 315. The circuit arrangement 300
connects the power supply to the socket 324 having a first active pin 326, a second active pin
328, a third active pin 330, a neutral pin 332 and an earth pin 334. In this scenario, instead of
one, three isolator switches, i.e., a first switch 302, a second switch 304 and a third switch
306 are included in the circuit arrange 300 corresponding to the first active wire 301a, the
second active wire 301b and the third active wire 301c respectively. The first switch 302, the
second switch 304 and the third switch 306 are also referred to as first isolator switch 302,
second isolator switch 304 and third isolator switch 306, respectively.

                                               15
[0691   Figure 3B illustrates the arrangement of three isolator switches 302, 304, 306
connected to active wires 301a, 301b, 301c, in Figure 3A. The first isolator switch 302
includes a first contact terminal 3022 and a first associated contact tenninal 3024. The first
contact terminal 3022 is associated with the first associated contact terminal 3024 in the sense
that the first contact terminal 3022 is able to be electrically connected to or disconnected
from the first associated contact terminal 3024. That is, if the first isolator switch 302 is
switch on, the first contact terminal 3022 is electrically connected to the first associated
contact terminal 3024, while if the first isolator switch 302 is switched off, the first contact
terminal 3022 is electrically disconnected from the first associated contact terminal 3024. The
second isolator switch 304 includes a second contact terminal 3042 and a second associated
contact tenninal 3044. The third isolator switch 306 includes a third contact tenninal 3062
and a third associated contact terminal 3064. The first contact terminal 3022 of the first
switch 302 is configured to electrically connect to the first active wire 301a of the power
supply in use. The second contact terminal 3042 of the second switch 304 is configured to
electrically connect to the second active wire 301b of the power supply in use. The third
contact terminal 3062 of the third switch 306 is configured to electrically connect to the third
active wire 301c of the power supply in use.
[070]   Further, the circuit arrangement 300 includes a first terminal block 308., a second
terminal block 310 and a third terminal block 312. The first terminal block 308 is electrically
connected to the first associated contact terminal 3024 of the first isolator switch 302. The
second terminal block 310 is electrically connected to the second associated contact terminal
3044 of the second isolator switch 304. Also, the third terminal block 312 is electrically
connected to the third associated contact terminal 3064 of the third isolator switch 306.
Further, as shown in Figure 3A, the circuit arrangement 300 comprises a fourth switch 318, a
fifth switch 320 and a sixth switch 322, also referred to as first main switch 3 18, second main
switch 320, third main switch 322, to electrically connect with the terminal blocks 308, 310
312, respectively. The main switches 3 18, 320, 322 control the supply of power to the socket
324 without affecting the terminal blocks 308, 310, 312. That is, if the socket 324 needs to be
checked by a worker or it is necessary to have the supply of power to the socket 234
disconnected, the worker can switch off the main switches 318, 320 322, while the supply of
power to the terminal blocks 308, 310, 312 is not affected.

                                                16
[0711    Figure 3C illustrates the arrangement of the fourth switch 318, the fifth switch 320,
and the sixth switch 322 connected to the terminal blocks 308, 310, 312 in Figure 3A. The
fourth switch 318 has a fourth contact terminal 3182 and a fourth associated contact terminal
3 184. The fourth contact terminal 3182 of the fourth switch 318 is configured to electrically
connect to the first terminal block 308, and the fourth associated contact terminal 3184 of the
fourth switch 318 is electrically connected to the first active pin 326 of the socket 324. The
fifth switch 320 has a fifth contact terminal 3202 and a fifth associated contact terminal 3204.
The fifth contact terminal 3202 of the fifth switch 320 is configured to electrically connect to
the second terminal block 310, and the fifth associated contact terminal 3204 of the fifth
switch 320 is electrically connected to the second active pin 328 of the socket 324. The sixth
switch 322 has a sixth contact terminal 3222 and a sixth associated contact terminal 3224.
The sixth contact terminal 3222 of the sixth switch 322 is configured to electrically connect
to the third terminal block 312, and the sixth associated contact terminal 3224 of the sixth
switch 322 is electrically connected to the third active pin 330 of the socket 324.
[0721    Terminal blocks 314 and 316 have also been included in the circuit arrangement 300
to electrically connect with the neutral wire 313 and the earth wire 315. The fourth terminal
block 314 (also referred to as neutral link 314) is configured to electrically connect to the
neutral wire 313 of the power supply and to the neutral pin 332 of the socket 324. The fifth
terminal block 316 (also referred to as earth link 316) is configured to electrically connect to
the earth wire 315 of the power supply and to the earth pin 334 of the socket 324.
1073]    In the circuit arrangement 300, the first isolator switch 302 is installed between the
first terminal block 308 and the first active wire 301a, the second isolator switch 304 is
installed between the second terminal block 310 and the second active wire 301b, and the
third isolator switch 306 is installed between the third terminal block 3 12 and the third active
wire 301c. This allows the terminal blocks 308, 310, 312 to be isolated from active wires
301a, 301b, 301c if the isolator switches 302, 304, 306 are switched off. When connecting a
further switchboard to the switchboard in order to use the switchboard as a power supply for
the further switchboard, the worker switches off the isolator switchers 302, 304, 306 to
disconnect the supply of electricity to the terminal blocks 308, 310, 312 without interrupting
other switchboards. Then the worker connects active wires 308a, 3 Ia, 3 12a of the further
switchboard to the terminal blocks 308, 310, 312, respectively. The worker also connects a
neutral wire 31 4a of the further switchboard to the neutral link 314, and an earth wire 316a of

                                                17
the further switchboard to the earth link 316.          This way, the operation of all other
switchboards need not to be interrupted while connecting the further switchboard to the
switchboard. Such a circuit arrangement 300 enables the worker to safely connect the further
switchboard to the switchboard without affecting other switchboards. This is highly desirable
from safety point of view as well as for preventing downtime of the other switchboards.
[0741    The circuit arrangement 300 for the power supply with three phases also needs
installation of safety devices for compliance with safety regulations. Therefore, additional
safety devices are provided in the circuit arrangement 300.
[075]    The circuit arrangement 300 further includes a first circuit protection device 336
between the fourth associated contact tenninal 3184 of the fourth switch 318 and the first
active pin 326 of the socket 324. In that manner, the first circuit protection device 336
electrically connects the fourth associated contact terminal 3184 to the first active pin 326 of
the socket 324. In one embodiment of the invention, the first circuit protection device 336
includes a first circuit breaker (CB) and a first residual current device (RCD). Similarly, a
second circuit protection device 338 is provided between the fifth associated contact terminal
3204 of the fifth switch 320 and the second active pin 328 of the socket 324. In that manner,
the second circuit protection device 338 electrically connects the fifth associated contact
terminal 3204 to the second active pin 328 of the socket 324. In one embodiment of the
invention, the second circuit protection device 338 includes a second circuit breaker (CB) and
a second residual current device (RCD). Also, a third circuit protection device 340 is
provided between the sixth associated contact terminal 3224 of the sixth switch 322 and the
third active pin 330 of the socket 324. In that manner, the third circuit protection device 340
electrically connects the sixth associated contact terminal 3224 to the third active pin 330 of
the socket 324. In one embodiment of the invention, the third circuit protection device 340
includes a third circuit breaker (CB) and a third residual current device (RCD).
[076] Normally, in a power supply with multiple phases (for example: three phases), a
neutral conductor carries current proportional to the active conductors. Only, in cases where
the three phases are balanced, the neutral conductor may carry very little current. In either
case, it is intended that the neutral conductor should not be carrying any residual currents.
This is essential for safety of the personnel operating the switchboard as well as for longevity
of the circuit arrangement. Therefore, a fourth RCD 342 is provided between the fourth
terminal block (i.e., neutral link) 314 and the neutral pin 332 of the socket 324. In that

                                                18
manner, the fourth RCD 342 electrically connects the fourth terminal block 314 to the neutral
pin of the socket 324.
[0771    Figure 4 illustrates a circuit arrangement 400 of the switchboard for a power supply
having three phases in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The
discussion regarding Figure 4 is quite similar to discussion of Figures 3A to 3C. However,
the five pin three phase socket 324 is replaced with three groups of single phase sockets, i.e. a
first socket group 344, a second socket group 346 and a third socket group 348. As shown in
Figure 4, the first socket group 344 includes four single phase sockets, the second socket
group 346 includes four single phase sockets, and the third socket group 348 includes one
single phase socket. The first circuit protection device 336 electrically connects the fourth
associated contact terminal 3184 to active pins of the first socket group 344, the second
circuit protection device 338 electrically connects the fifth associated contact terminal 3204
to active pins of the second socket group 346 and the third circuit protection device 340
electrically connects the sixth associated contact terminal 3224 to an active pin of the third
socket group 348. Also, the first circuit protection device 336 electrically connects the fourth
terminal block (i.e., the neutral link) 314 to neutral pins of the first socket group 344, the
second circuit protection device 338 electrically connects the fourth terminal block 314 to
neutral pins of the second socket group 346 and the third circuit protection device 340
electrically connects the fourth terminal block 314 to a neutral pin of the third group 348.
[078]    Figure 5 illustrates a circuit arrangement 500 of the switchboard for a power supply
having three phases in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Figure
5 is a combination of Figure 3A and Figure 4. Figure 5 includes the five pin three phase
socket 324 and the first socket group 344., the second socket group 346 and the third socket
group 348 of single phase sockets. The circuit arrangement 500 includes a number of circuit
protection devices for making electrical connections.
[0791    Figure 6A illustrates a switchboard 600 with a circuit arrangement in accordance
with the present invention. The circuit arrangement can be any of the circuit arrangements
described above. As an example, the circuit arrangement 500 shown in Figure 5 is used in the
switchboard 600. The wires connecting the electronic devices of the circuit arrangement 500
are not shown for a clear view. As shown in Figure 6A, the switchboard 600 includes an
enclosure 601 to carry or house the electronic devices of the circuit arrangement 500.

                                                 19
[0801    The enclosure 601 comprises a back panel 602. The back panel 602 is typically a thin
plate. The back panel 602 may include a plurality of holes 615 in order to fix the enclosure
601 to a wall or a stand (not shown in Figure 6A) that supports the enclosure 601. The back
panel 602 includes a first side edge 604, a second side edge 606, a third side edge 608 and a
fourth side edge 610 that define a periphery of the back panel 602. The enclosure 601 further
includes a plurality of side panels extending from the edges of the back panel 602
respectively to define a wall. For example., the enclosure 601 further includes a first side
panel 6042, a second side panel 6062, a third side panel 6082 and a fourth side panel 6102.
As shown in Figure 6A, the first side panel 6042 extends from the first side edge 604 of the
back panel 602. The second side panel 6062 extends from the second side edge 606 of the
back panel 602. The third side panel 6082 extends from the third side edge 608 of the back
panel 602. Also, the fourth side panel 6102 extends from the fourth side edge 610 of the back
panel 602. Thus, the side panels 6042, 6062, 6082 and 6102 form a wall extending from the
edges of the back panel 602.
[081]    Moreover, the first side panel 6042 is located opposite to the second side panel 6062
and the third side panel 6082 is located opposite to the fourth side panel 6102. As shown in
Figure 6A, the fourth side panel 6102 and the third panel 6082 are adjacent to the first side
panel 6042 and the second side panel 6062. Also, the extension of the fourth side panel 6102
from the fourth side edge 610 forms a front edge 612. Thus, the fourth side panel 6102
extends from the fourth side edge 610 at one end and forms the front edge 612 parallel to the
fourth side edge 610 at another end.
[082]    In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the enclosure 601 further
comprises an engagement member 614. The engagement member 614 includes a first part
6142 and a second part 6144. The first part 6142 is configured to pivot relative to the second
part 6144 and/or vice versa. Also, the second part 6144 is further configured to slide relative
to the first part 6142 along a direction of the front edge 612 of the fourth side panel 6102. The
second part 6144 slides along the direction of the front edge 612 of the fourth side panel 6102
to allow engagement with and disengagement from the first part 6142 along the direction of
the front edge 612 of the fourth side panel 6102.
[0831    Returning to Figure 6A, the enclosure 601 further comprises a front panel 616. The
front panel 616 works as a cover of the enclosure 601 that enables or disables access to the
electronic devices installed in the enclosure 601. In accordance with an embodiment of the

                                                20
present invention, the first part 6142 of the engagement member 614 is securely fixed to the
fourth side panel 6102 and the front panel 616 is securely fixed to the second part 6144 of the
engagement member 614. The first part 6142 and the second part 6144 are securely fixed to
the fourth side panel 6102 and the front panel 616 respectively by for example welding,
structural adhesive and rivets. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that other
joining means such as fastening and hot pressing may also be used.
 [0841  At least some electronic devices (for example, the isolator switches 302, 304, 306, the
terminal blocks 308, 310, 312, etc.) of the circuit arrangement 500 are fixed to the back panel
602 mechanically inside the enclosure 601, while the five-pin three phase socket 324 is
secured to the second side panel 6062 for easy access. As the front panel 616 is joined with
the fourth side panel 6102 using the engagement member 614, the engagement member 614
allows the front panel 616 to pivot relative to the fourth side panel 6102. Thus, due to the
pivoting of the front panel 616, the front panel 616 takes two positions, an open position and
a closed position. At the open position, the electronic devices installed inside the enclosure
601 are accessible for use and conducting activities such as inspection and maintenance,
whereas in the closed position, the front panel 616 covers the enclosure 601 and no access to
the electronic devices inside the enclosure 601 is available.
 10851  Figure 6B illustrates an example of the engagement member 614 in accordance with
an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 6B, the first part 6142 of the
engagement member 614 includes a first tab 6143 and an elongate hollow member 6146.
Although the first tab 6143 and the elongate hollow member 6146 are shown in Figure 6B to
be formed integrally, the first tab 6142 and the elongate hollow member 6146 can be separate
parts that are mechanically connected together. The second part 6144 of the engagement
member 614 includes a second tab 6145 and an elongate pin 6148. Similarly, although the
second tab 6145 and the elongate pin 6148 are shown in Figure 6B to be formed integrally,
the second tab 6145 and the elongate pin 6148 can be separate parts that are mechanically
connected together. Also, the elongate hollow member 6146 of the first part 6142 is
configured to slidely and pivotably receive the elongate pin 6148 of the second part 6144.
Particularly, the elongate pin 6148 of the second part 6144 is able to slide into the elongate
hollow member 6146 of the first part 6142 to engage the first part 6142 with second part
6144. The elongate pin 6148 is also able to slide out of the elongate hollow member 6146 to
disengage the first part 6142 from the second part 6144. Further, due to the round outer

                                                21
surface of the elongate pin 6148 and the round inner surface of the elongate hollow member
6146, the elongate pin 6148 is able to pivot within the elongate hollow member 6146.
1086] Figure 6C illustrates another example of the engagement member 614 in accordance
with another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 6C, the first part 6142
of the engagement member 614 includes the elongate pin 6148 and the second part 6144 of
the engagement member 614 includes the elongate hollow member 6146. Further, the hollow
member 6146 of the second part 6144 is configured to slidely and pivotably receive the
elongate pin 6148 of the first part 6142, as described with reference to Figure 6B.
[087]    Figure 6D illustrates an example of the enclosure 601 for carrying the circuit
arrangement in accordance with the present invention. The enclosure 601 further comprises a
movement limiter 622. The movement limiter 622 is detachably connected to the fourth side
panel 6102. When the movement limiter 622 is connected to the fourth side panel 6102, the
movement limiter 622 limits the sliding of the second part 6144 of the engagement member
614 relative to the first part 6142 of the engagement member 614 in order to disable the
disengagement of the second part 6144 from the first part 6142. On the other hand, if the
movement limiter 622 is removed from fourth side panel 6102 by for example a worker using
a screwdriver, the second part 6144 (particularly, the elongate pin 6148) of the engagement
member 614 can be slid out of the first part 6142 (particularly, the elongate hollow member
6146) of the engagement member 614. This way, the front panel 616 that is fixed to the
second part 6144 of the engagement member 614 can be removed from the enclosure 601
even if the front panel 616 is in the closed position. Therefore, if the switchboard with the
enclosure 601 is sandwiched between two other switchboards, which makes it hard if not
impossible to place the front panel 616 at the open position, the front panel 616 can be
removed in order for the worker to access the electronic devices installed in the enclosure
601. In one embodiment of the present invention, the movement limiter 622 is a bolt which
is inserted into a hole 624 provided on the fourth side panel 6102. In one embodiment of the
present invention, the hole 624 includes a thread to fasten the bolt into the hole 624. The bolt
can be screwed into the hole 624 of the fourth side panel 6102 with a portion of the bolt
projecting from the fourth side panel 6102. This portion of the bolt limits the sliding of the
second part 6144 of the engagement member 614 relative to the first part 6142 of the
engagement member 614.       On the other hand, if the bolt is removed from the hole 624 by a
screwdriver, the second part 6144 (particularly, the elongate pin 6148) of the engagement

                                                22
member 614 can be slid out of the first part 6142 (particularly, the elongate hollow member
6146) of the engagement member 614. This allows the removal of the front panel 616 from
the enclosure 601.
1088] In the example shown in Figure 6A, the fourth side panel 6102 is the horizontal top
panel when in use, and thus the front panel 616 horizontally slides along the direction of the
front edge 612 of the fourth side panel 6102. Therefore, the movement limiter 622 that is
detachably connected to the fourth side panel 6102 limits the horizontal sliding of the front
panel 616. In another embodiment, the fourth side panel 6102 is a vertical side panel when in
use, and the front panel 616 vertically slides along the direction of the front edge 612 of the
fourth side panel 6102, Therefore, the movement limiter 622 that is detachably connected to
the fourth side panel 6102 limits the vertical sliding of the front panel 616.
1089] Additionally, the hole 624 is located on the fourth side panel 6102 at a position where
if the bolt is screwed into the fourth side panel 6102 by a worker using a screwdriver, the bolt
disables the disengagement of the second part 6144 of the engagement member 614 from the
first part 6142 of the engagement member 614. That is, the hole 622 is located near the
engagement member 614 such that the bolt limits the sliding movement of the first part 6142
with respect to the second part 6144 of the engagement member 614. Thus, the bolt is
provided to prevent the detachment of the two parts that are first part 6142 and second part
6144 of the engagement member 614. As the engagement member 614 is connected between
the front panel 616 and the fourth side panel 6102, thus the bolt limits the sliding movement
of the front panel 616 with respect to the fourth side panel 6102 and thus prevents the
removal of the front panel 116 from the enclosure 100. If the bolt is removed from the fourth
side panel 6102 by for example a worker using a screwdriver, the front panel 616 can be
removed from the enclosure 601 by sliding the front panel 616 along the direction of the front
edge 612 of the fourth side panel 6102 even if the front panel 616 is in the closed position.
[090]   Further, the enclosure 601 further includes a support base 626. The support base 626
is secured to the back panel 602, particularly on the inner surface of the back panel 602, as
shown in Figure 6B. Moreover, the support base 626 includes a first section 6262 of a first
height and a second section 6264 of a second height. As exemplarily shown in Figure 6D, the
height of the first section 6262 is greater than the height of the second section 6264. Also, the
difference in height of the first section 6262 and the second section 6264 is provided to allow
electronic devices of different heights to be installed on it. As the electronic devices, such as

                                               23
switches, sockets, and circuit breakers, are available in different sizes, the different heights of
sections of the support base 626 allow the electronic devices to be substantially flush with
each other in height. For example, a socket with a less height is installed on the higher first
section 6262, and a circuit breaker with a greater height is installed on the lower section
6264. This enables the enclosure 601 to accommodate the electrical devices in a neat manner
to facilitate access to and inspection and maintenance of the electronic devices.
[0911    The enclosure 601 further includes an opening 628. The opening 628 may be provided
on at least one of the first side panel 6042 and the second side panel 6062. Further, the
opening 628 is sized to fit the three-phase socket 324 as shown in Figure 6A.
10921    Figure 7 illustrates a switchboard 700 with a circuit arrangement in accordance with
the present disclosure. The difference between the switchboard 700 and the switchboard 600
is that the switchboard 700 includes a stand 701. The stand 701 is detachably fixed to the
enclosure 601 to support the enclosure 601, for example, via one or bolts extending through
the hole(s) 615 on the back panel 602 of the enclosure 601.
[0931     The stand 701 includes a first support arm 702 and a second support arm 704 to
securely and detachably connect to the enclosure 601 via for example, one or bolts extending
through the hole(s) 615 on the back panel 602 of the enclosure 601 and the holes on the first
support arm 702 and the second support arm 704. Further, the first support arm 702 has a
first end 7022 and a second end 7024, and the second support arm 704 has a first end 7042
and a second end 7044. As shown in Figure 7, each of the first support arm 702 and the
second support arm 704 is bent at an angle to increase the distance between the second end
7024 of the first support arm 702 and the second end 7044 of the second support arm 704 in
order to enhance stability of the switchboard 700.
1094] Further, the stand 701 further comprises a first beam 706 and a second beam 708. The
first beam 706 detachably connects the first end 7022 of the first support arm 702 and the
first end 7042 of the second support arm 704. The second beam 708 detachably connects the
first support arm 702 and the second support arm 704. As shown in Figure 7, the second
beam 708 is positioned in the middle segments of the first support arm 702 and the second
support arm 704.
[095] Additionally, the stand 701 includes a first support foot 710 and a second support foot
712. The first support foot 710 detachably connects to the second end 7024 of the first

                                                 24
support arm 702 and the second support foot 712 detachably connects to the second end 7044
of the second support arm 704. The first support foot 710 and the second support foot 712 are
configured to keep the first support ann 702 and the second support arm 704 in an upright
positon when in use.
1096]    Figure 8 illustrates a perspective view of the first support ann 702 and second support
arm 704 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The first support arm 702
includes a first angle iron structure and the second support arm 704 includes a second angle
iron structure. Each of the first angle iron structure and second angle iron structure has an L
shaped cross-section with two legs (i.e., a first leg 805 and a second leg 810 of the first angle
iron structure and a first leg 806 and a second 811 of the second angle iron structure). In
accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the two legs of each of the first angle iron
structure and second angle iron structure may be equal or unequal in length and the angle
between two legs is about 90 degrees. Further, in the preferred embodiment of the invention,
each of the first leg 805, 806 and the second leg 810, 811 has a length of 30 mm and a
thickness between 3.5mm and 5mm. It is noted that the first support arm 702 is also referred
to as the first angle iron structure 702 and the second support arm 704 is also referred to as
the second angle iron structure 704 in the present disclosure.
10971    Further, the first angle iron structure 702 includes a first pair of switchboard
installation holes 815 on the first leg 805 of the first angle iron structure 702 to which the
enclosure 601 is secured when in use and the second angle iron structure 704 includes a
second pair of switchboard installation holes 820 on the first leg 806 of the second angle iron
structure 704 to which the enclosure 601 is secured when in use. Further, the first angle iron
structure 702 and the second angle iron structure 704 may be securely connected to the
enclosure 601 via bolts through the first pair of switchboard installation holes 815 of the first
angle iron structure 702 and the second pair of switchboard installation holes 820 of the
second angle iron structure 704.
[0981    In accordance with embodiment of the invention, the first angle iron structure 702
includes a first end connection hole 825 on the first leg 805 of the first angle iron structure
702 at the first end 7022 of the first angle iron structure 702. Similarly, the second angle iron
structure 704 includes a second end connection hole 830 on the first leg 806 of the second
angle iron structure 804 at the first end 7042 of the second angle iron structure 704. Also, the
first angle iron structure 702 includes a first middle connection hole 835 on the first leg 805

                                                 25
of the first angle iron structure 702 between the first end 7022 and the second end 7024 of the
first angle iron structure 102. Similarly, the second angle iron structure 704 includes a second
middle connection hole 840 on the first leg 806 of the second angle iron structure 704
between the first end 7042 and the second end 7044 of the second angle iron structure 704.
1099] In accordance with embodiment of the invention, the first angle iron structure 702
further includes a third end connection hole 845 on the second leg 810 of the first angle iron
structure 702 at the first end 7022 of the first angle iron structure 702 and a first pair of
holding members 850. Similarly, the second angle iron structure 704 further includes a fourth
end connection hole 855 on the second leg 811 of the second angle iron structure 704 at the
first end 7042 of the second angle iron structure 704 and a second pair of holding members
860 (not visible in Figure 8, but visible in Figure 10). Further, the second pair of holding
member 860 is similar to the first pair of holding member 850, but provided on the second leg
811 of the second angle iron structure 704.
[0100] Figure 9 illustrates a partial perspective view of the stand 701 in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 9, the stand 701 comprises a cable holding
assembly 900 to hold a cable, for example, a cable of an electrical tool such as an electrical
drill used at the construction site. One end of the cable is connected to the electrical tool, and
another end of the cable has a plug, which is plugged into the switchboard for power supply.
The cable holding assembly 900 comprises a first support bar 905 and a first cable holding
means 910. The first support bar 905 is an elongated structure and the first cable holding
means 910 extends from the first support bar 905 to hold a cable. Particularly, the first cable
holding means 910 is a U-shaped bar such that the cable can be held in the U-shaped bar.
The first cable holding means 910 is able to hold the cable in the air such that the cable does
not disturb the worker working near the construction site, for example, causing the worker to
fall over. Further, a V-shaped and/or W-shaped or any other shapes of the first holding
means 910 can also be used to hold the cable in the air. In accordance with an embodiment
of the invention, the material of the cable holding assembly 900 has non-conducting
properties. In another embodiment, a non-conducting paint and/or coating may be applied to
the cable holding assembly 900, particularly, the first cable holding means 910.
[0101] The stand 701 further includes a first connection means 915 configured to adjustably
connect the first support bar 905 of the cable holding assembly 900 to the first support arm
702, namely, the first angle iron structure 702. Particularly, the first connection means 915

                                                 26
allows adjusting the height of the cable holding assembly 900, i.e. the distance from the top
of the cable holding assembly 900 to the ground. As a result, the cable holding assembly 900
may be raised to a desired height such that the cable does not disturb the worker working at
the construction site. The first support bar 905 of the cable holding assembly 900 includes a
third angle iron structure. The third angle iron structure has an L-shaped cross-section with a
first leg and a second leg. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the two legs
may be equal or unequal in length and the angle between two legs is about 90 degrees. Each
of the first leg and the second leg of the third angle iron structure has a length of 20 mm and a
thickness of 3 mm. The first support bar 905 is also referred to as the third angle iron
structure 905. The third angle iron structure 905 is adapted to be mounted onto the first angle
iron structure 702 using the first pair of holding members 950 and the first connection means
915.
[0102]    Further, the first pair of holding members 950 and the two legs (the first leg 805 and
the second leg 810) of the first angle iron structure 702 are configured to be able to surround
the third angle iron structure 905 of the cable holding assembly 900 when the third angle iron
structure 905 is positioned between the first pair of holding members 950 and the two legs
(the first leg 805 and the second leg 810) of the first angle iron structure 702. For example,
when assembling the stand 701, the third angle iron structure 905 is slid along the first angle
iron structure 702 such that the third angle iron structure 905 is held between the first pair of
holding members 950 and the two legs (the first leg 805 and the second leg 810) of the first
angle iron structure 702. The position to which the third angle iron structure 905 is slid along
the first angle iron structure 702 can be changed in order to adjust the height of the cable
holding assembly 900, i.e., the distance from the top of the cable holding assembly 900 to the
ground. In an embodiment, to connect the third angle iron structure 905 of the cable holding
assembly 900 to the first angle iron structure 702, the first connection means 915 of the cable
holding assembly 900 is a first location bolt. The first location bolt is configured to engage
with the third end connection hole 845 via the threads on the first location bolt and the third
end connection hole 845. As the first location bolt is rotated in a direction manually or by a
torque wrench, the first location bolt extends through the third connection hole 845 and
firmly presses the third angle iron structure 905 of the cable holding assembly 900 against the
first pair of holding members 950 of the first angle iron structure 702. As a result, the first
location bolt connects the third angle iron structure 905 to the first angle iron structure 702 at
a certain height. If the height of the cable holding assembly 900 needs to be changed, the first

                                                  27
connection means 915 (particularly, the first location bolt) is rotated in an opposite direction
in order to detach the third angle iron structure 905 from the first angle iron structure 702.
Then the third angle iron structure 905 is moved along the first angle iron structure 702 to a
different position, resulting in an adjusted height of the cable holding assembly 900, and can
be connected to the first angle iron structure 702 by the first location bolt at the adjusted
height. This way, the first location bolt is able to adjustably connect the third angle iron
structure 905 of the cable holding assembly 900 to the first angle iron structure 702. In
accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the first connection means 915 is an eye
bolt. Further, other types of bolts may also be used such as, but not limited to, triangular head
handle bolts, circular head bolts, pigtail bolts, T-bolts etc.
[0103] Figure 10 illustrates a partial perspective view of the stand 701 in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 10, the stand 701 further comprises a lamp
installation assembly 1001. The lamp installation assembly 1001 includes a second support
bar 1005 and a lamp installation means 1010. The lamp installation assembly 1001 is
generally an elongated structure and capable of holding a lamp (not shown in Figure 10),
which allows fixing a lighting lamp to illuminate the area around the stand 701.
[0104] As shown in Figure 10, the lamp installation means 1010 extends from the second
support bar 1005 such that lamp can be mounted on the lamp installation means 1010. The
second support bar 1005 of the lamp installation assembly 1001 includes a fourth angle iron
structure. The fourth angle iron structure has an L shaped cross-section with a first leg and a
second leg. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the two legs may be equal
or unequal in length and the angle between two legs is about 90 degrees. Each of the first leg
and the second leg of the fourth angle iron structure has a length of 20 mm and a thickness of
3 mm. The second support bar 1005 is also referred to as the fourth angle structure 1005.
[0105] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the lamp installation means 1010
is a straight bar with at least one hole such that the lamp can be installed on the straight bar
via at least one bolt through the at least one hole. However, the stand 701 further includes a
second connection means 1015 configured to adjustably connect the second support bar 1005
to the second support arm 704, namely, the second angle iron structure 704.
[0106] As shown in Figure 10 the second angle iron structure 704 includes the second pair of
holding members 860. The second pair of holding member 860 and the two legs of the

                                                28
second angle iron structure 704 surround the fourth angle iron structure 1005 of the lamp
installation assembly 1001. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 10, the second connection
means 1015 of the stand 701 is a second location bolt. Similar to the first location bolt, the
second location bolt is configured to engage with the fourth end connection hole 855 via the
threads on the second location bolt and the fourth end connection hole 855. As the second
location bolt is rotated manually or by a torque wrench, the second location bolt extends
through the fourth end connection hole 855 and firmly presses the fourth angle iron structure
1005 of the lamp installation assembly 1001 against the second pair of holding members 860
of the second angle iron structure 704. This way, similar to the first location bolt and the first
pair of holding members 950, the second location bolt adjustably connects the fourth angle
iron structure 1005 of the lamp installation assembly 1001 to the second angle iron structure
704. The second location bolt is an eye bolts. Further, other types of bolts may also be use
such as, but not limited to, triangular head handle bolt, circular head bolts, pigtail bolts, T
bolt etc.
[01071 Figure 11 illustrates a partial perspective view of the stand 701 in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention. As shown in Figure 11, the first beam 706 includes a first pair
of connection holes 1110, 1120, such that the first beam 706 detachably connects to the first
end 7022 of the first angle iron structure 702 and the first end 7042 of the second angle iron
structure 704 via a first connection bolt 1105 and a second connection bolt 1115. The first
connection bolt 1105 extends through the first end connection hole 825 of first angle iron
structure 702 and one (i.e., the connection hole 1110) of the first pair of connection holes of
the first beam 706. The second connection bolt 1115 extends through the second end
connection hole 830 of the second angle iron structure 704 and another one (i.e., the
connection hole 1120) of the first pair of connection holes of the first beam 706. The first
connection bolt 1105 and the second connection bolt 115 are hexagonal head bolts with
washers. Moreover, the hexagonal head bolt includes a nut to fasten the first beam 706 with
the stand 701. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the first connection bolt
1105 and second connection bolt 1115 is one of, but not limited to, T-bolts, hex-socket bolts
and elevator bolts. Further, any other types of fastening means can also be used to detachably
connect the first beam 706 to the first angle iron structure 702 and the second angle iron
structure 704.

                                                 29
[0108] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the second beam 708 further
includes a cable winding means 1125. The cable winding means 1125 extends from a first
position 1130 on the second beam 708 and ends at a second position 1135 on the second
beam 708. As described above, the cable is held by the cable holding means 910 (particularly,
the U-shaped bar) of the cable holding assembly 900 in the air and extends down to the cable
winding means 1125.         The cable can be wound around the cable winding means 1125
between the first position 1130 and the second position 1135. Therefore, the cable will not
become tangled and the plug on the other end of the cable can be easily accessed and plugged
into the socket of the switchboard. Moreover, the cable winding means 1125 of the second
beam 708 is covered by an electrical insulation material. This is to avoid an electric shock if
there is an electric current flowing through the cable winding means 1125 due to a worn or
torn cable, thus providing a safety feature to the stand 701.
[0109] Further, the second beam 708 includes a second pair of connection holes 1140, 1141,
such that the second beam 708 detachably connects the first angle iron structure 702 and the
second angle iron structure 704 via a third connection bolt 1145 and a fourth connection bolt
1150. The third connection bolt 1145 extends through the first middle connection hole 835 of
the first angle iron structure 702 and one (i.e., the connection hole 1140) of the second pair of
connection holes of the second beam 708. The fourth connection bolt 1150 extends through
the second middle connection hole 840 of the second angle iron structure 704 and another
one (i.e., the connection hole 1141) of the second pair of connection holes of the second
beam 708.
[0110] Coming back to Figure 7. As shown in Figure 7, the first support foot 710 includes a
fifth angle iron structure and the second support foot 712 includes a sixth angle iron structure.
Further, each of the fifth angle iron structure and the sixth angle iron structure has an L
shaped cross-section with two legs. The two legs may be equal or unequal in length and the
angle between two legs is about 90 degrees. Each of the two legs has a length of 40 mm and a
thickness between 3mm and 5mm.
[0111] As described above, angle iron structures are used to make the stand 701. However, in
other embodiments of the invention, other metallic structure such as rods, bars, channels may
also be used.

                                                30
[0112] As described above, since the connections between the parts of the stand 701 are
detachable, when the stand 701 is used, a user only needs to assemble these parts to form the
stand 701 as shown in the figures. If the stand 701 is not in use, the stand 701 can be
disassembled into the parts, this allows the parts of the stand 701 to be stored and transported
separately. Further, the selected specifications of the angle iron structures provide the stand
701 with sufficient strength to perform their respective functions and also make the stand 701
lightweight.
[0113] The terms and descriptions used herein are set forth by way of illustration only and
are not meant as limitations. Examples and limitations disclosed herein are intended to be not
