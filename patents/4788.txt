                                       FIELD OF INVENTION
[0002] The described invention relates to colorectal cancer, the APC tumor suppressor gene,
truncated APC gene products produced by mutation of the gene, and therapeutic agents
targeting colon cancer cell lines and other human cancer cell lines with truncated APC gene
products.
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and third
leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, with an estimated 141,000 cases
of colon and rectal cancer diagnosed in 2011. Thus, 1 in 19 Americans will be diagnosed with
CRC in their lifetime for an overall risk of 5.4%. Fortunately, surgical excision of early,
noninvasive adenomas is essentially curative.             However, there are few effective treatment
options for patients suffering from advanced forms of CRC, and the prognosis is often poor.
                                                     1

 Despite a prolonged latency phase, too few lesions are identified at a stage where they can be
 surgically excised (See Phelps et al. Cell Cycle, 2009; 8:16, 2549-2556).
 100041 Mutations in the human APC tumor suppressor gene are linked to Familial
 Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), an inherited cancer-prone condition in which numerous polyps
 are formed in the epithelium of the large intestine (See Kinzler et al., Science, 1991; 253:661
 665; Kinzler and Vogelstein, Cell, 1996; 87:159-170; Half et al., Orphanet Journal of Rare
 Diseases, 2009; 4:22).     The development of CRC is initiated by the aberrant outgrowth of
 adenomatous polyps from the colonic epithelium that ultimately evolve into aggressive
 carcinomas (See Kinzler and Vogelstein, Cell, 1996; 87: 159-170).        About 85% of sporadic
 colorectal cancers have been reported to harbor APC truncating mutations (See Kinzler and
 Vogelstein, Cell, 1996; 87:159-170). The growth of the polyps is associated in most cases with
 alterations of both alleles of the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene. A first mutational
 hit occurs roughly in the middle of the open reading frame, generating a truncated APC
 molecule lacking the C-terminal half. Such truncation mutations are located in the so-called
mutation cluster region (MCR) (See Schneikert et al., Human Molecular Genetics, 2006; 16:
 199-209). The second mutational hit involves either deletion of the second allele or a mutation
that leads to the synthesis of a truncated product, almost never occurring after the MCR (See
Schneikert et al., Human Molecular Genetics, 2006; 16: 199-209).         Thus, colon cancer cells
express at least a truncated APC molecule whose length is defined by the position of the MCR
and, occasionally, an additional but shorter fragment.
[00051 CRC treatment is primarily reliant upon chemotherapeutic agents that act with minimal
specificity for the underlying genetic basis of disease. These chemotherapeutic agents
frequently disrupt the function of normal cells while disrupting cancer cells due to shared
                                                2

  reliance on the chemical target. Better, more precise therapeutic agents are needed to improve
  treatment of patients diagnosed with CRC.
Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) Gene
   [0006] APC, which does not act as a classical tumor suppressor, influences Wnt signaling
  thereby regulating gene transcription.        Wnts are a family of secreted cysteine-rich
  glycoproteins that have been implicated in the regulation of stem cell maintenance,
  proliferation, and differentiation during embryonic development. Canonical Wnt signaling
  increases the stability of cytoplasmic P-catenin by receptor-mediated inactivation of GSK-3
  kinase activity and promotes    p-catenin translocation into the nucleus. The canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway also functions as a stem cell mitogen via the stabilization of intracellular  p
  catenin and activation of the  p-catenin/TCF/LEF    transcription complex, resulting in activated
  expression of cell cycle regulatory genes, such as Myc, cyclin DI, EPhrinB (EPhB) and Msx1,
  which promote cell proliferation (See Cayuso and Marti, Journal of Neurobiology, 2005;
  64:376-387).
  [0007] APC is the negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Without this negative regulation, the
  Wnt pathway is more active and is important in cancer (See Polakis, Current Opinion in
  Genetics & Development, 2007; 17: 45-51). Studies comparing tumor cells with mutations in
 both APC alleles to correlate levels of Wnt signaling and severity of disease in both humans
 and mice have aided in establishing a model in which gene dosage effects generate a defined
 window of enhanced Wnt signaling, leading to polyp formation in the intestine. Combinations
 of 'milder' APC mutations, associated with weaker enhancement of Wnt signaling, give rise to
 tumors in extra-intestinal tissues. According to this model, the nature of the germline mutation
                                                3

  in APC determines the type of somatic mutation that occurs in the second allele. (See Minde et
  al. Molecular Cancer, 2011; 10:101).
APC Protein
  [0008] The APC gene product is a 312 kDa protein consisting of multiple domains, which bind
  to various proteins, including beta-catenin, axin, C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), APC
  stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Asefs), Ras GTPase-activating-like protein
  (IQGAP1), end binding-i (EBI) and microtubules. Studies using mutant mice and cultured
  cells demonstrated that APC suppresses canonical Wnt signaling, which is essential for
 tumorigenesis, development and homeostasis of a variety of cell types, including epithelial and
  lymphoid cells. Further studies have suggested that the APC protein functions in several other
  fundamental cellular processes. These cellular processes include cell adhesion and migration,
 organization of actin and microtubule networks, spindle formation and chromosome
  segregation. Deregulation of these processes caused by mutations in APC is implicated in the
 initiation and expansion of colon cancer (See Aoki and Taketo, Journal of Cell Science, 2007;
  120:3327-3335).
  [0009] The APC protein functions as a signaling hub or scaffold, in that it physically interacts
 with a number of proteins relevant to carcinogenesis. Loss of APC influences cell adhesion,
 cell migration, the cytoskeleton, and chromosome segregation (See Aoki and Taketo, Journal
 of Cell Science, 2007; 120:3327-3335).
 [0010] Most investigators believe that APC mutations cause a loss of function change in colon
 cancer. Missense mutations yield point mutations in APC, while truncation mutations cause
 the loss of large portions of the APC protein, including defined regulatory domains. A
 significant number of APC missense mutations have been reported in tumors originating from
                                               4

 various tissues, and have been linked to worse disease outcome in invasive urothelial
 carcinomas (See Kastritis et al., International Journal of Cancer, 2009; 124:103-108),
 suggesting the functional relevance of point mutated APC protein in the development of extra
 intestinal tumors. The molecular basis by which these mutations interfere with the function of
 APC remains unresolved.
 [0011] APC mutation resulting in a change of function can influence chromosome instability in
 at least three manners: by diminishing kinetochore-microtubule interaction, by the loss of
mitotic checkpoint function and by generating polyploid cells.      For example, studies have
 shown that APC bound to microtubules increased microtubule stability in vivo and in vitro,
 suggesting a role of APC in microtubule stability (See Zumbrunn et al., Current Biology, 2001;
 11:44-49). Truncated APC led to chromosomal instability in mouse embryonic stem cells (See
Fodde et al., Nature Cell Biology, 2001; 3:433-438), interfered with microtubule plus-end
attachments, and caused a dramatic increase in mitotic abnormalities (See Green and Kaplan,
Journal of Cell Biology, 2003; 163:949-961). Studies have shown that cancer cells with APC
mutations have a diminished capacity to correct            erroneous kinetochore-microtubule
attachments, which account for the wide-spread occurrence of chromosome instability in
tumors (See Bakhoum et al., Current Biology, 2009; 19:1937-1942). In addition, abrogation of
the spindle checkpoint function was reported with APC loss of function. Knockdown of APC
with siRNA indicated that loss of APC causes loss of mitotic spindle checkpoint function by
reducing the association between the kinetochore and checkpoint proteins Bub1 and BubRI.
Thus, loss of APC reduces apoptosis and induces polyploidy (See Kaplan et al., Nature Cell
Biology, 2001; 3:429-432; Dikovskaya et al., Journal of Cell Biology, 2007; 176:183-195;
Rusan and Peifer, Journal of Cell Biology, 2008; 181:719-726). Polyploidy is a major source
                                               5

 for aneuploidy since it can lead to multipolar mitosis (See Shi and King, Nature, 2005;
 437:1038-1042).
 [0012] While loss of function due to APC may be partially correct, there are reports showing
 that a large fraction of colon cancer patients have at least one APC gene product that is
truncated, and that this has a gain of function. Thus truncated APC proteins may play an active
role in colon cancer initiation and progression as opposed to being recessive; for example,
truncated APC, but not full-length APC may activate Asef and promote cell migration.
 [0013] Although defects in APC occur in a high fraction of colon cancer cases, there are
currently no therapeutics targeting vulnerabilities resulting from these defects. The described
invention provides small molecule inhibitor compounds that selectively target truncated APC
in immortalized Human Colonic Epithelial Cells (HCECs) for treating colon cancer.
                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0014] According to one aspect, the described invention provides a series of small molecule

[0016] According to another aspect, the described invention provides a method of treating
colorectal cancer in a subject whose colonic epithelial cells express at least one truncated APC
protein, comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
therapeutic amount of at least one small molecule anti-cancer compound of any one of claims I
through 19 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the therapeutic amount is
effective to inhibit tumor growth, inhibit tumor proliferation, induce cell death, or a
combination thereof.
[0017] According to another aspect, the described invention provides an immortalized human
colonic epithelial cell (HCEC) comprising a full length, wild type APC gene, wherein the cell
comprises at least one of the following: an ectopically expressed vector containing Kirsten rat
sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Krasv12 ), a small hairpin RNA against tumor protein p53
                                                7

  (shp53), and a small hairpin RNA against APC (shAPC). According to one embodiment, the
  APC gene contains a somatic mutation at codon 1450. According to another embodiment, the
  APC gene contains a somatic mutation at codon 1309. According to another embodiment, the
  cell expresses a LacZ protein.     According to another embodiment, the cell expresses the
 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Krasv1    2
                                                         ) and the small hairpin RNA against APC
 (shAPC).     According to another embodiment, the cell is transduced with retroviral cyclin
 dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) and a catalytic component of human telomerase (hTERT).
                        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 [0018] Fig. 1 is a diagram of a colonic crypt. The colonic crypts are composed of an epithelial
 layer of cells that include stem cells undergoing mitosis, columnar absorptive cells, mucin
 producing goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells. Cells differentiate and migrate to the luminal
 surface of the crypt where they are extruded into the lumen of the intestine by programmed cell
 death. It is believed that APC participates in all of these processes directly or indirectly by
modulating transcription profiles within the intestinal epithelial cells (See Goss et al., Journal
of Clinical Oncology, 2000; 18:1967-1979).        APC influences Wnt signaling through beta
catenin/TCF. Full-length APC influences cell cycle control by arresting cells at Gl/S through
the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway and localizing to mitotic spindles and centrosomes during the
M phase.      APC influences cell migration by stabilizing microtubules and activating cell
division control protein 42 (cdc42). Lastly, full-length APC influences cellular differentiation
and apoptosis.
[0019] Fig. 2 illustrates possible genes involved in progression from normal colonic
epithelium to colon cancer.     APC mutation is believed to be a frequent and early event in
colorectal cancer, since APC mutations are detected in more than 80% of colorectal
                                                                                          tumors,
                                               8

 and over 90% of APC mutations generate premature stop codons resulting in truncated gene
 products.
 [00201 Fig. 3 shows the structure of full-length and truncated APC. Truncated APC lacks the
 binding domains for beta-catenin and microtubules but retains the binding domains for Asef,
 thus leading to activation of proliferation, induction of chromosomal instability and stimulation
 of cell migration. (See Fodde et al., Nat Rev Cancer, 1:55-67) Mutations A1309 and A1450
 are most highly represented.
 [0021] Fig. 4 illustrates that immortalized human colonic epithelial cells (HCECs) are normal
 diploid and can differentiate.       (A)    Small self-organizing multicellular structures show
 evidence of polarized villin and general nuclear staining.           (B) Small self-organizing
 multicellular structures (day 11) show evidence of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and general
 nuclear staining. (C) Small self-organizing multicellular structures (day 11) show evidence of
mucin [MUC]2, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and general nuclear staining.             (D) shows that
hTERT CDK4 immortalized human colonic epithelial cells differentiated similarly to primary
mouse intestinal cells. The hTERT CDK cells are 100% LGR-5 positive.                LGR-5 is an
accepted biomarker of colonic stem cells. (See Roig et al. Gastro, 2010; 138:1012-1021).
 [0022] Fig. 5 shows that APC truncations confer tumorigenic properties. The isogenic Human
Colonic Epithelial Cells (HCECs) used were: HCECs immortalized with cyclin-dependent
kinase 4 (CDK4) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) (1CT); HCECs with the
genetic alterations CDK4, hTERT, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KrasvI2 ),
small hairpin RNA against APC (shAPC), (1CTRA); HCECs with the genetic alterations
CDK4, hTERT, Kras v12 , small hairpin RNA against tumor protein p53 (shp53), shAPC
(ICTRPA); 1CTRPA expressing LacZ (1CTRPA LacZ); 1CTRPA having a somatic mutation
                                                 9

 at codon 1450 (1CTRPA 1450); and 1CTRPA having a somatic mutation at codon 1309
 (1CTRPA 1309). While a 90% loss of APC function does not increase tumorgenic properties,
 the isogenic cell line derivative containing a truncated APC does show the hallmarks of
 transformation. This indicates that truncated APC provides a gain of function representing an
 increase in cancer progression and may explain why a large fraction of patients with CRC
 retain a truncated APC protein.
 [00231 Fig. 6 is a flow chart showing steps in the identification of TASIN-1 (Truncated APC
 Selective Inhibitor) through high-throughput screening.
 [0024] Fig. 7 shows that TASIN-l is selectively toxic to Colorectal Cancer (CRC) lines with
 APC truncation. (b) Validation of ectopic expression of APC truncation, knockdown of WT

 curve of TASIN-1 in HCT1 16 and DLD1 cells. The table (e) lists the IC5 0 value for both cell

TASIN-1 inhibits DLD1 cells expressing truncated APC from surviving and forming colonies
but has little or no affect on HCT1 16 cells (f) Representative photographs and quantification of

 [0026] Fig. 9 illustrates that the knockdown of truncated APC desensitizes DLD1 cells to
 TASIN-1, providing evidence that APC is the target of TASIN-1.

 express either Beta-galactoside transacetylase (LacA) or the APC truncation mutant A1309.

of the cell lines with WT APC and cell lines with truncated APC.                 Student's t-test,
****P<0.0001. The status of APC in each cell line is based on published data (Chandra, S.H.,

    [0029] Fig. 12 illustrates responses of colorectal cancer cell lines with varying APC status to
   TASIN-1. Human colon epithelial cell lines expressing truncated APC
                                                                             HT-29, DLD 1, SW620,
   SW480, HCT15, Lovo and Caco-2, and cells expressing wild type APC, HCT 16, HCT1 16
   p53-/-, HCEC, C26Ci, HBEC and BJ, were treated with TASIN-1 and the surviving cell
   fraction was assessed. Note that HCT1 16, HCT1 16 p53-/-, HCEC and C26Ci are colonic cell
   lines, whereas HBEC and BJ cell lines are bronchial epithelial cell lines and foreskin
  fibroblasts, respectively. In both 2ptM and 5pM TASIN-1 conditions, all cell lines expressing
  truncated APC demonstrated sensitivity to TASIN-1, whereas cell lines expressing wild type
  APC did not demonstrate sensitivity to TASIN-1. This suggests that normal cells containing
  wild type levels of APC should be unaffected by TASIN-1.
  [00301 Fig. 13 shows that sustained treatment with low dose TASIN-1 suppressed anchorage
 independent growth in DLD1 cells.
  [00311 Fig. 14 shows that TASIN-1 induces apoptosis in DLD1 cells.             After 72 hours of
 incubation of HCT116 or DLD1 cells with DMSO, 2.5pM TASIN-1 or BARD, levels
                                                                                                  of
 cleaved PARP were analyzed by western blot.           DMSO served as the negative control, not
influencing the amount of cleaved PARP in the cell lines. However, BARD served
                                                                                            as the
positive control, facilitating the increase of cleaved PARP in HCT 16 and DLD 1 cell
                                                                                             lines.
DLD1 cells treated with TASIN-1 exhibited an increase in cleaved PARP, while under
                                                                                                the
same conditions HCT116 cells did not.          HCT116 expresses wild type APC, while DLD1
expresses truncated APC. Additionally, caspase activity was increased in DLD1 cells treated

 results of which are judged to be desirable and beneficial. A therapeutic effect may include,
 directly or indirectly, the arrest, reduction, or elimination of a disease manifestation.        A
 therapeutic effect may also include, directly or indirectly, the arrest reduction or elimination of
 the progression of a disease manifestation.
 [0078] As used herein, the term "topical" refers to administration of a composition at, or
 immediately beneath, the point of application.       The phrase "topically applying" describes
 application onto one or more surfaces(s) including epithelial surfaces.          Although topical
 administration, in contrast to transdermal administration, generally provides a local rather than
 a systemic effect, the terms "topical administration" and "transdermal administration" as used
herein, unless otherwise stated or implied, are used interchangeably.
 [0079]   As used herein, the term "mutation" refers to a change of the DNA sequence within a
gene or chromosome of an organism resulting in the creation of a new character or trait not
found in the parental type, or the process by which such a change occurs in a chromosome,
either through an alteration in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA coding for a gene or
through a change in the physical arrangement of a chromosome.                Three mechanisms of
mutation include substitution (exchange of one base pair for another), addition (the insertion of
one or more bases into a sequence), and deletion (loss of one or more base pairs).
[00801 The terms "mutants" and "variants" are used interchangeably herein to refer to
nucleotide sequences with substantial identity to a reference nucleotide sequence.              The
differences in the sequences may by the result of changes, either naturally or by design, in
sequence or structure. Natural changes may arise during the course of normal replication or
duplication in nature of the particular nucleic acid sequence.         Designed changes may be
                                               21

and it thus can be a thioether (e.g., -- S-optionally substituted alkyl), a thioester (--S--C(O)
optionally substituted alkyl) or a disulfide (e.g., --S--S-optionally substituted alkyl). The term
"N-linked moiety" means a moiety that is bonded through a nitrogen atom. Thus, when an R
                                                 35

 group is an N-linked moiety, the R group is bonded through nitrogen and one or more of these

 [01911          As used herein, the term "optionally" means that the subsequently described
 event(s) may or may not occur, and includes both event(s) which occur and events that do not
 occur.
 [0192]          Compounds of structural formula I and formulas Ia-f may contain one or more
asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers,
diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. The present invention is meant to
comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of structural formula I and formulas Ia
f.
 [0193]          Compounds of structural formula I and formulas Ia-f may be separated into their
individual diastereoisomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent,
for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof, or via chiral chromatography using
an optically active stationary phase. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray
crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if
necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.
[0194]          Alternatively, any stereoisomer of a compound of the general structural formula
I and formulas Ia-f may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting
materials or reagents of known absolute configuration.
[0195]          If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the
individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known
in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure
compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual
diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The
coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base.
                                               39

 The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of
 the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly
 by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known
 inthe art.
 [0196]           Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and
 unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.
 [0197]           Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers, which have
 different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts.
 For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as
 well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention.
 [0198]           In the compounds of generic Formula I and formulas Ia-f, the atoms may exhibit
 their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a
particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number
different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present
invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of generic
Formula I and formulas Ia-g. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include
protium (lH) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in
nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing
in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a
standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within
generic Formula I and formulas Ia-f can be prepared without undue experimentation by
conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to
                                               40

   those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched
   reagents and/or intermediates.
    [0199]         It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of
   structural formula I and formulas Ia-f are meant to also include the pharmaceutically
   acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as
   precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other
   synthetic manipulations.

 [0209] As used herein, the term "glident" refers to material that prevents caking and improves
the flow characteristics of granulations, so that flow is smooth and uniform. Exemplary
glidents include silicon dioxide and talc. The amount of glident in the composition can range
from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the total composition, preferably from about 0.5 to
about 2% by weight.
[0210] As used herein, the term "lubricant" refers to a substance added to the dosage form to

  oleate, polyethylene glycols and d'l-leucine. Lubricants are usually added at the very last step
  before compression, since they must be present on the surfaces of the granules and in between
  them and the parts of the tablet press. The amount of lubricant in the composition can range
  from about 0.2 to about 5% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.5 to about
  2%, more preferably from about 0.3 to about 1.5% by weight.
  [0211] As used herein, the term "oral gel" refers to the active ingredients dispersed or
  solubilized in a hydrophillic semi-solid matrix.
  [0212] As used herein, the term "tablet" refers to a compressed or molded solid dosage form
 containing the active ingredients with suitable diluents. The tablet can be prepared by
 compression of mixtures or granulations obtained by wet granulation, dry granulation or by
 compaction.
 [0213] As used herein, the term "therapeutic amount" refers to the amount of a small molecule
 anti-cancer compound necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. Combined
 with the teachings provided herein, by choosing among the various active compounds and
 weighing factors such as potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, severity of
 adverse side-effects and preferred mode of administration, an effective prophylactic or
therapeutic treatment regimen may be planned which does not cause substantial toxicity and
yet is effective to treat the particular subject. The effective amount for any particular
application may vary depending on such factors as the disease or condition being treated, the
particular describedcompound, the size of the subject, or the severity of the disease or
condition. One of ordinary skill in the art may determine empirically the therapeutically
effective amount of a particular describedcompound and/or other therapeutic agent without
necessitating undue experimentation. It is generally preferred that a maximum
                                                                                  dose be used,
                                               44

 that is, the highest safe dose according to some medical judgment. The terms "dose" and
 "dosage" are used interchangeably herein.
 [02141 For any compound described herein the therapeutically effective amount can be initially
 determined from preliminary in vitro studies and/or animal models. A therapeutically effective
 dose can also be determined from human data for compounds of general structure I and
 structures Ia-f. The applied dose can be adjusted based on the relative bioavailability and
potency of the administered compound. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy based
 on the methods described above and other methods as are well-known in the art is within the
 capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.

further include one or more additional compatible active ingredients. "Compatible" as used
herein means that the components of such a composition are capable of being combined with
each other in a manner such that there is no interaction that would substantially reduce the
efficacy of the composition under ordinary use conditions.         As used herein, the phrase
"additional active ingredient" refers to an agent, other than the anti-cancer compounds of the
described composition, that exerts a pharmacological, or any other beneficial activity.
Nonlimiting examples of such additional therapeutic agents include, without limitation, 5
fluorouracil,   leucovorin, oxaliplatin capecitabine,    leucovorin, irinotecan,   capecitabine,
oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, or a combination thereof.

Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
  10217] The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier" as used herein refers to one or more
  compatible solid or liquid filler, diluents or encapsulating substances which are exemplary for
  administration to a human or other vertebrate animal. The term "carrier" as used herein refers
  to an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is
  combined to facilitate the application.     According to some embodiments, the carrier can be
  inert, or it can possess pharmaceutical benefits.
  [0218] The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being
  commingled in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the
  desired pharmaceutical efficiency.
  [02191 The carrier can be liquid or solid and is selected with the planned manner of
  administration in mind to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with
  an active and the other components of a given composition.
Administration
  [02201 For use in therapy, a therapeutic amount of a small molecule anti-cancer compound
 may be administered to a subject by any mode. Administering the pharmaceutical composition

needle" as used herein, refers to any needle adapted for delivery of fluid (i.e., capable of flow)
 compositions of the present invention into a selected anatomical structure.              Injectable
preparations, such as sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions, may be formulated
according to the known art using exemplary dispersing or wetting agents and suspending
agents.
 [0222] The compositions of the present invention may be in the form of a sterile injectable
aqueous solution or oleaginous suspension.              A solution generally is considered as a
homogeneous mixture of two or more substances; it is frequently, though not necessarily, a
liquid.   In a solution, the molecules of the solute (or dissolved substance) are uniformly
distributed among those of the solvent. A suspension is a dispersion in which a finely-divided
species is combined with another species, with the former being so finely divided and mixed
that it doesn't rapidly settle out.   The term "dispersion", as used herein, refers to a two-phase
system, in which one phase is distributed as particles or droplets in the second, or continuous
phase. In these systems, the dispersed phase frequently is referred to as the discontinuous or
internal phase, and the continuous phase is called the external phase or dispersion medium.
For example, in coarse dispersions, the particle size is 0.5 mm. In colloidal dispersions, size of
the dispersed particle is in the range of approximately 1 nn to 0.5 mm. Molecular dispersion is
a dispersion, in which the dispersed phase consists of individual molecules; if the molecules
are less than colloidal size, the result is a true solution.
[02231 The compositions of the described invention also may be in the form of an emulsion.
An emulsion is a two-phase system prepared by combining two immiscible liquid carriers, one
                                                   47

 of which is disbursed uniformly throughout the other and consists of globules that have
 diameters equal to or greater than those of the largest colloidal particles. The globule size is
 critical and must be such that the system achieves maximum stability. Usually, separation of
 the two phases will not occur unless a third substance, an emulsifying agent, is incorporated.
Thus, a basic emulsion contains at least three components, the two immiscible liquid carriers
 and the emulsifying agent, as well as the active ingredient. Most emulsions incorporate an
aqueous phase into a non-aqueous phase (or vice versa). However, it is possible to prepare
emulsions that are basically non-aqueous, for example, anionic and cationic surfactants of the
non-aqueous immiscible system glycerin and olive oil. Thus, the compositions of the invention
may be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for
example, olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example a liquid paraffin, or a mixture
thereof. Exemplary emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example, gum
acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and
esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan
monooleate, and condensation products of the partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example,
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.
[0224] According to some embodiments, the composition may be formulated for parenteral
administration by by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be
presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added
preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in
oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing
and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include
aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions
                                              48

 of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions.
 Exemplary lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic
 fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes.     Aqueous injection
 suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as
 sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran.    Optionally, the suspension also may
 contain exemplary stabilizers or agents, which increase the solubility of the compounds to
 allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.          Alternatively, the active
 compounds may be in powder form for constitution with an exemplary vehicle, e.g., sterile
pyrogen-free water, before use.
 [0225] The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise exemplary solid or gel phase
 carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to,
 calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin,
 and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.
 [0226] Exemplary liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example,
microencapsulated, and if appropriate, with one or more excipients, encochleated, coated onto
microscopic gold particles, contained in liposomes, pellets for implantation into the tissue, or
dried onto an object to be rubbed into the tissue. Such pharmaceutical compositions also may
be in the form of granules, beads, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules,
suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or preparations with protracted
release of active compounds, in whose preparation excipients and additives and/or auxiliaries
such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, lubricants, or solubilizers are
customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions are exemplary for use
                                              49

in a variety of drug delivery systems.     For a brief review of methods for drug delivery, see
Langer 1990 Science 249, 1527-1533, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 [02271 Depending upon the structure, at least one small molecule anti-cancer compound of the
described invention, and optionally at least one additional active agent, may be administered
per se (neat) or, depending upon the structure of the inhibitor, in the form of a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt.       The inhibitors of the described invention may form
pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic or inorganic acids, or organic or inorganic
bases. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non
pharmaceutically acceptable salts conveniently may be used to prepare pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the
following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic,
salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic,
naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts may be prepared as alkaline
metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid
group.
[0228] By "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is meant those salts which are, within the scope
of sound medical judgment, exemplary for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower
animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate
with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well-known in the
art. For example, P. H. Stahl, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in
"Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use" (Wiley VCH, Zurich,
Switzerland: 2002).
                                                50

 [0229] The salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the
 compounds described within the described invention or separately by reacting a free base
 function with a exemplary organic acid. Representative acid addition salts include, but are not
 limited to, acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate,
butyrate,    camphorate,     camphorsufonate,        digluconate,   glycerophosphate,    hemisulfate,
heptanoate,     hexanoate,     fumarate,     hydrochloride,       hydrobromide,     hydroiodide,   2
hydroxyethansulfonate(isethionate),       lactate,    maleate,    methanesulfonate,   nicotinate,  2
naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, pirate,
pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p
toluenesulfonate and undecanoate.          Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be
quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl
chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl
sulfates; long chain halides, such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and
iodides; arylalkyl halides, such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and others. Water or oil
soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained.           Examples of acids which may be
employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids
as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic
acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid. Basic addition salts may be
prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of compounds described within the
invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with an exemplary base such as the
hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with
ammonia or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine.             Pharmaceutically acceptable
salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such
                                                  51

 as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and
 nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium,
 tetraethylammonium,       methylamine,       dimethylamine,     trimethylamine,    triethylamine,
 diethylamine, ethylamine and the like. Other representative organic amines useful for the
 formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
 piperidine, piperazine and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be also obtained
 using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic
 compound such as an amine with an exemplary acid affording a physiologically acceptable
 anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for
 example calcium or magnesium) salts of carboxylic acids may also be made.
 [0230] The formulations may be presented conveniently in unit dosage form and may be
 prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the
 step of bringing into association a composition, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate
 thereof ("active compound") with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory agents.
 In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association
 the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if
necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.
 [0231] The pharmaceutical agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, salt, solvate or
prodrug thereof may be mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired action,
or with materials that supplement the desired action.         Solutions or suspensions used for
parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, intrathecal, or topical application may include, but are
not limited to, for example, the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for
injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other
                                                52

  synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants
  such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic
  acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity
  such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The parenteral preparation may be enclosed in ampoules,
  disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.                 Administered
  intravenously, particular carriers are physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
  [0232] Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically
  acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions and
  sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of
  exemplary aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include
                                                                                             water,
  ethanol, polyols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the like), exemplary
 mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl
 oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as
 lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the
 use of surfactants.
 [02331 These compositions also may contain adjuvants including preservative agents, wetting
 agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms
may be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It also may be desirable to include isotonic
agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride and the like.            Prolonged absorption of the
injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the use of agents delaying
                                                                                        absorption,
for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
                                                 53

 102341 Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents, as,
 for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters,
 microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth, and
 mixtures thereof.
 [0235] The therapeutic agent(s), including the composition(s) of the described invention may
 be provided in particles. The term "particles" as used herein refers to nano or microparticles
 (or in some instances larger) that may contain in whole or in part the composition or the other
 therapeutic agent(s) as described herein. The particles may contain the therapeutic agent(s) in
 a core surrounded by a coating. The therapeutic agent(s) also may be dispersed throughout the
particles. The therapeutic agent(s) also may be adsorbed into the particles. The particles may
be of any order release kinetics, including zero order release, first order release, second order
release, delayed release, sustained release, immediate release, etc., and any combination
thereof.    The particle may include, in addition to the therapeutic agent(s), any of those
materials routinely used in the art of pharmacy and medicine, including, but not limited to,
erodible, nonerodible, biodegradable, or nonbiodegradable material or combinations thereof.
The particles may be microcapsules that contain the composition in a solution or in a semi
solid state. The particles may be of virtually any shape.
[0236] Both non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymeric materials may be used in the
manufacture of particles for delivering the therapeutic agent(s). Such polymers may be natural
or synthetic polymers. The polymer is selected based on the period of time over which release
is desired. For example, bioadhesive polymers include bioerodible hydrogels as described by
Sawhney et al in Macromolecules (1993) 26, 581-587, the teachings of which are incorporated
herein by reference.        These include      polyhyaluronic   acids,  casein,  gelatin,  glutin,
                                               54

polyanhydrides, polyacrylic acid, alginate, chitosan, poly(methyl methacrylates), poly(ethyl
methacrylates), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate),
poly(isodecyl    methacrylate),     poly(lauryl    methacrylate),  poly(phenyl    methacrylate),
poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and poly(octadecyl
acrylate).
[0237] The therapeutic agent(s) may be contained in controlled release systems. In order to
prolong the effect of a drug, it often is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from
subcutaneous, intrathecal, or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of
a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of
absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend
upon crystal size and crystalline form. The term "controlled release" is intended to refer to any
drug-containing formulation in which the manner and profile of drug release from the
formulation are controlled.      This refers to immediate as well as non-immediate release
formulations, with non-immediate release formulations including, but not limited to, sustained
release and delayed release formulations.     The term "sustained release" (also referred to as
"extended release") is used herein in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation that
provides for gradual release of a drug over an extended period of time, and that can result in
substantially constant blood levels of a drug over an extended time period. Alternatively,
delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or
suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.       The term "delayed release" is used herein in its
conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation in which there is a time delay between
administration of the formulation and the release of the drug there from. "Delayed release"
                                                55

 may or may not involve gradual release of drug over an extended period of time, and thus may
 or may not be "sustained release."
 [02381 According to some embodiments, use of a long-term sustained release implant may be
 desirable for treatment of chronic conditions. The term "long-term" release, as used herein,
means that the implant is constructed and arranged to deliver therapeutic levels of the active
ingredient for at least 7 days, and preferably about 30 to about 60 days. Long-term sustained
release implants are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include some of the
release systems described above.
 [0239] Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of a described
inhibitor in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide.        Depending upon the
ratio of inhibitor to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug
release may be controlled. Such long acting formulations may be formulated with appropriate
polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion
exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.
Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides).
Depot injectable formulations also are prepared by entrapping the inhibitor of the described
invention in liposomes or microemulsions, which are compatible with body tissues.
[0240] The injectable formulations may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a
bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
compositions that may be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable
medium just prior to use. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or
oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents.        The sterile injectable preparation also
                                              56

may be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic, parenterally
acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.          Among the acceptable
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic
sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils conventionally are employed or as a
solvent or suspending medium.         For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed
including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used
in the preparation of injectables.
[02411 Formulations for parenteral (including but not limited to, subcutaneous, intradermal,
intramuscular, intravenous, intrathecal and intraarticular) administration include aqueous and
non-aqueous sterile injection solutions that may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats
and solutes, which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and
aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may include suspending agents and
thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers,
for example sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized)
condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline, water-for
injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may
be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.
[0242] Exemplary buffering agents include: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w/v); citric acid and a
salt (1-3% w/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2%
w/v).     Exemplary     preservatives  include    benzalkonium      chloride  (0.003-0.03%    w/v);
chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w/v) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% w/v).
[0243] For oral administration in the form of tablets or capsules, the active drug component
may be combined with any oral non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier, such as
                                               57

   lactose, starch, sucrose, cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate,
                                                                                     calcium sulfate,
   talc, mannitol, ethyl alcohol (liquid forms) and the like. Moreover, when desired
                                                                                           or needed,
   uitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents also may be incorporated
   in the mixture. Powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent of
   the described composition. Exemplary binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars, corn
   sweeteners,     natural    and    synthetic   gums    such    as   acacia,    sodium      alginate,
  carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol and waxes. Among the lubricants there may be
  mentioned for use in these dosage forms, boric acid, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium
  chloride, and the like. Disintegrants include starch, methylcellulose, guar gum and the like.
  Sweetening and flavoring agents and preservatives may also be included where appropriate.
  [0244] The compositions of the invention also may be formulated as syrups and elixirs.
  Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example, glycerol, propylene
 glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations also may contain a demulcent,
                                                                                     a preservative,
 and flavoring and coloring agents. Demulcents are protective agents employed primarily
                                                                                                   to
 alleviate irritation, particularly mucous membranes or abraded tissues. A number of chemical
 substances possess demulcent properties. These substances include
                                                                         the alginates, mucilages,
 gums, dextrins, starches, certain sugars, and polymeric polyhydric glycols.         Others include
acacia, agar, benzoin, carbomer, gelatin, glycerin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl
cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, propylene glycol, sodium
                                                                              alginate, tragacanth,
hydrogels and the like.
[0245] For buccal administration, the compositions of the present invention may take the
                                                                                               form
of tablets or lozenges formulated in a conventional manner for this route.
[0246] Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.
                                                 58

 [0247] Liquid form preparations also may include solutions for intranasal administration.
 [0248] The compositions of the present invention may be in the form of a dispersible dry
 powder for delivery by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or through the
 nose). Dry powder compositions may be prepared by processes known in the art, such as
 lyophilization and jet milling, as disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO
 91/16038 and as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,921,527, the disclosures of which are
 incorporated by reference.     The composition of the present invention is placed within an
 exemplary dosage receptacle in an amount sufficient to provide a subject with a unit dosage
 treatment. The dosage receptacle is one that fits within an exemplary inhalation device to allow
 for the aerosolization of the dry powder composition by dispersion into a gas stream to form an
 aerosol and then capturing the aerosol so produced in a chamber having a mouthpiece attached
 for subsequent inhalation by a subject in need of treatment. Such a dosage receptacle includes
 any container enclosing the composition known in the art such as gelatin or plastic capsules
with a removable portion that allows a stream of gas (e.g., air) to be directed into the container
to disperse the dry powder composition. Such containers are exemplified by those shown in
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,227,522; U.S. Pat. No. 4,192,309; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,105,027. Exemplary
containers also include those used in conjunction with Glaxo's Ventolin@ Rotohaler brand
powder inhaler or Fison's Spinhaler@ brand powder inhaler. Another exemplary unit-dose
container which provides a superior moisture barrier is formed from an aluminum foil plastic
laminate. The pharmaceutical-based powder is filled by weight or by volume into the
depression in the formable foil and hermetically sealed with a covering foil-plastic laminate.
Such a container for use with a powder inhalation device is described in U.S. Pat. No.
                                               59

 4,778,054 and is used with Glaxo's Diskhaler@ (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,627,432; 4,811,731; and
 5,035,237). Each of these references is incorporated herein by reference.
 [0249] The compositions of the present invention may be in the form of suppositories for rectal
 administration of the composition. "Rectal" or "rectally" as used herein refers to introduction
 into the body through the rectum where absorption occurs through the walls of the rectum.
 These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with an exemplary nonirritating
 excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at ordinary
temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and
release the drug. When formulated as a suppository the compositions of the invention may be
formulated with traditional binders and carriers, such as triglycerides.
 [0250] The term "topical" refers to administration of an inventive composition at, or
immediately beneath, the point of application. The phrase "topically applying" describes
application onto one or more surfaces(s) including epithelial surfaces.         Although topical
administration, in contrast to transdermal administration, generally provides a local rather than
a systemic effect, as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied, the terms topical
administration and transdermal administration are used interchangeably.       For the purpose of
this application, topical applications shall include mouthwashes and gargles.
[02511 Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as
transdermal patches or iontophoresis devices which are prepared according to techniques and
procedures well known in the art.        The terms "transdermal delivery system", transdermal
patch" or "patch" refer to an adhesive system placed on the skin to deliver a time released dose
of a drug(s) by passage from the dosage form through the skin to be available for distribution
via the systemic circulation.     Transdermal patches are a well-accepted technology used to
                                                 60

 deliver a wide variety of pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, scopolamine for
 motion sickness, nitroglycerin for treatment of angina pectoris, clonidine for hypertension,
 estradiol for post-menopausal indications, and nicotine for smoking cessation.

Example 1
 [02581 Immortalized human colonic epithelial cell (HCEC) lines have been generated using
 exogenously introduced telomerase and cdk4 (Fearon, E.R. & Vogelstein, B. A genetic model

    for colorectal tumorigenesis. Cell 61, 759-767 (1990).).       These cells are non-transformed,
   karyotypically diploid and have multipotent characteristics. When placed in matrigel@ in the
   absence of a mesenchymal feeder layer, individual cells divide and form self-organizing, crypt
   like structures with a subset of cells exhibiting markers associated with mature epithelium.
Colonic Tissues
   [0259] This study was approved by the institutional review board at the Dallas VA Medical
   center. Colon biopsies (20-30 samples, -0.5 cm 3 ) from tissue not involved with endoscopically
   visible adenomas were obtained from patients undergoing routine screening colonoscopy after
   obtaining informed consent.
Growth Media and Tissue Culture Substrate
   [0260] Cells were grown on basal DMEM, MEM or RPMI media (Gibco®, Hyclone,
                                                                                             Logan,
  UT) supplemented with EGF (25 ng/mL) (Peprotech, Inc, Rocky Hill, NJ), hydrocortisone (1
  pg/mL), insulin (10 pg/mL), transferrin (2 pg/mL), sodium selenite (5 nanomolar) (all from
  Sigma, St Louis, MO), 2% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone), and gentamicin sulfate (50 pg/ml)
  (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA). Cells were cultured in primaria flasks (BD
 Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and grown in 2%-5% oxygen and 7% carbon dioxide. HCT 116, BJ
 human skin fibroblasts, Hela cells, and immortalized human colonic fibroblast
                                                                                      cells (C26Ci,
 population doubling 150) were maintained in DMEM, MEM or RPMI
                                                                                  media (Gibco@,
 Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone). C26Ci cells were
 treated with 10 pg/mL mitomycin c (Sigma) for 2 hours and used as feeder layers from the
point of initial crypt attachment until the first passage.
 [0261] For cleaved PARP detection and caspase 3 activity assay, cells were treated with 2.5uM
of TASlN-1 for 72 hours in the presence or absence of 12.5uM of SP600125 (Millipore) or
                                                  63

  5uM of doxorubicin (Sigma) alone for 6 hours as positive controls. For mitotic
  synchronization, cells were synchronized at the G2/M boundary by treatment with the selective
  cdk1 small-molecule inhibitor, RO-3306 (9uM) for 18 hours (Kim, Hyun S. et al. Systematic
  Identification of Molecular Subtype-Selective Vulnerabilities in Non-Small-Cell Lung cancer.
  Cell 155, 552-566 (2013).
Plasmids
  [0262] CDK4, hTERT, pSRZ-shTP53 and pBABE-hyg-KRASV12 were described in Vassilev,
  L.T. and is hereby incorporated by reference (Vassilev, L.T. Cell cycle synchronization at the
  G2/M phase border by reversible inhibition of CDKl. Cell cycle 5, 2555-2556 (2006)).
Cell Isolation and Immortalization
  [02631 Colonic biopsies were immersed in cold DMEM, MEM or RPMI media (Gibco@,
  Hyclone, Logan, UT), brought to the laboratory within 40-60 minutes after colonoscopy,
  copiously washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing antibiotic/antimycotic solution
  (Gemini Bio-Products), and cut into multiple small pieces (-     mm in size). After enzymatic
  digestion with collagenase 150 u/mL (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and dispase
 40 pg/ml (Roche, Germany), crypts were resuspended in DMEM, MEM or RPMI media
  (Gibco@, Hyclone, Logan, UT) with growth supplements including 2% serum, and plated in
 primaria culture dishes seeded 48 hours previously with 50% confluent colonic fibroblast
 feeder layers. During the first 10 days after attachment, cells were fed every 3 days, reducing
 the serum by 1%each change until 0% to prevent growth of unwanted cells such as fibroblasts.
 Once small nests of expanding epithelial cells were easily observed, cells were transduced with
 retroviral CDK4 and hTERT as described previously. When numerous cuboidal-appearing cell
                                                64

  nests were observed (3-4 weeks after initial crypt seeding), cells were reseeded on primaria
  flasks. Feeder layers were not needed or used for routine tissue culture after the first passage.
APC Knockdown Experiments
  [0264] HCECs isolated from normal colonic biopsies were immortalized by successive
  infections of CDK4 and hTERT followed by selection with respective antibiotics-G418 (250
  ptg/mL) and blastocidin (2.5 pg/mL). shRNAs against p53 were introduced with retroviruses
  and p53 knockdown efficiency was verified by Western analysis. Human colon cancer cell
  lines (HCT 16, DLD-1, RKO) and virus-producing cell lines (293FT, Phoenix A) were
  cultured in basal medium supplemented with 10% serum. The identity of all cell lines was
 verified by DNA fingerprinting. 1 ptg of shRNA together with 1 jg of helper plasmids (0.4 Ig
 pMD2G and 0.6 pg psPAX2) were transfected into 293FT cells with Polyjet reagent
 (SignaGen). Viral supernatants were collected 48 hours after transfection and cleared through a
 0.45-Im filter. Cells were infected with viral supernatants containing 4 [tg/mL polybrene
 (Sigma) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 1. Successfully infected cells
 were selected with lug/mL puromycin for 3 days. as described in: Eskiocak U, Kim SB, Ly P,

Western Blot Analysis
 [02651 After electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE, separated proteins were transported
 onto a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane (Pierce, Rockford, USA). The membrane was incubated
 with primary antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Millipore, Cell
                                               65

  Santa Cruz, etc.), voltage-dependent anion-selectivve channel protein -1 (VDAC) (Cell
  Signaling Technology, Abcam, Santa Cruz, etc.), phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling), JNK (Cell
  Signaling), or actin (Abcam, Santa Cruz, Cell Signaling, etc.) overnight at 4'C. After washing,
 the membrane was incubated with each corresponding secondary antibody before being
 visualized by chemiluminescence. Mouse monoclonal GAPDH (Promab, USA, 1:1000) was
 used as the primary antibody for control.
Caspase 3/7 Activity
  [02661 Cells were treated with vehicle control or 2.5uM of TASin-1 for 72 hours and subjected
 to Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay in 96-well plates (Promega). Specifically, 96-well places containing
 cells were removed from an incubator and equilibrated to room temperature. A reconstituted
 Caspase-Glo Reagent was also equilibrated to room temperature. A volume of Caspase-Glo
 reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium was added to each well. The mixture was
 gently mixed using a plate shaker at 300-500 rpm for 30 seconds and then incubated at room
 temperature for 30 minutes to 3 hours. The plate was inserted into the Veritas to begin the
 assay. The RLU values were measured by the VeritasT . (Promega; A Veritas Microplate
 Luminometer Method for Prometa's caspase-Glo TM 3/7 assay).
Immunocytochemistry
 [0267] Cells were fixed using 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5%
 Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and incubated with blocking solution (10% goat serum and 3%
 BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 60 min.            Cells were then incubated with
 primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for an hour. The following antibodies are used:
 anti-HURP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-a-tubulin (Cell Signaling), anti-active p-catenin
                                               66

  (EMD Millipore).     After incubation using secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa-568 or
  Alexa-488 (Invitrogen), slides were mounted with Mowiol 4-88(Calbiochem) solution
  (Eskiocak, U. et al. Functional parsing of driver mutations in the colorectal cancer genome
  reveals numerous suppressors of anchorage-independent growth. Cancer Res 71, 4359-4365
  (2011)). Cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope, Axiovert 200M (Carl Zeiss).
  Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Metaphase plate
  width, spindle width and cell width was determined using the line measurement tool in ImageJ
  software.
SuperTopFlash Assay
  [02681 DLD1 cells were transiently transfected with DNA constructs encoding firefly
  luciferase (FL) and Gaussia luciferase (GL) proteins driven by a CMV promoter, incubated
  with DMSO or TASIN-1 for 18h and then analyzed for GL and FL activities, respectively, 24 h
  later. (Longin, A., Souchier, C., Ffrench, M. & Bryon, P.A. Comparison of anti-fading agents

In vivo pharmacokinetic analysis
  [02701 Female CD-1 mice were injected IP with 10 mg/kg TASIN-1,                0.2 mL/mouse
  formulated as 5% DMSO, 5% cremophor EL, and 90% D5 W pH 7.4. Whole blood was
  harvested. Plasma was processed from whole blood by centrifugation of the ACD treated blood
  for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm in a standard centrifuge. Large intestines with contents were
  harvested and large intestine contents were removed for further analysis. All harvested tissues
                                                69

  were weighted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Large intestinal contents (LIC) homogenate
  was prepared by mincing the intestinal contents and homogenizing in a 4-fold volume of PBS.
  100 microliters LIC was mixed with 200 microliters of acetonitrile containing 0.15% formic
  acid and 37.5 ng/mL IS (IS final conc. = 25 ng/ml).       The samples were vortexed for 15
  seconds, incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes and spun 2x 13,200 rpm in a standard
  microcentrifuge. The supernatant was then analyzed by LC/MS/MS.        Non-treated mice were
 used to collect tissue for blank homogenates in order to make standards and QCs.
Tissue Staining
Hematoxylin & Eosin Staining Protocol For Parrafm Sections
  [0271] Prior to staining, slides were baked for at least twenty minutes at a minimum
 temperature of 70*C to inhibit detachment of sections during the staining procedure. Sections
 were stained in Weigert's Hematoxylin, working solution, for 6 minutes, and drained. Slides
 were dehydrated in 70% Acid-Ethanol, pH 2.5, using two changes, three quick dips each.
  Slides were dehydrated in 70% Acid-DI, pH 2.5, using two changes, three quick dips each. The
 slides were washed in running tap water for 15 minutes and excess water was drained from the
 slides, and then stained in working Eosin-Phloxine solution for 2 minutes and drained. The
 slides were dehydrated in 95% ethanol, using two changes, at 30 seconds each, completely
 dehydrated in 100% ethanol, using three changes, three quick dips each, and cleared in
 Histoclear (National Diagnosics; AGTC Bioproducts, etc.), using two changes, at one minute
 each. Fresh Histoclear was used and the slides were coverslipped with mounting medium.
Hematoxylin & Eosin Staining Protocol for Frozen Tissue Sections
 [0272] The sections were mounted on slides and air dried to remove moisture, stained with
 filtered 0.1% Mayers Hematoxylin (Sigma; MHS-16) for 10 minutes, and rinsed in cool
                                               70

  running ddH20 for 5 minutes. The slides were dipped in 0.5% Eosin (1.5g dissolved in 300mL
  of 95% EtOH) 12 times, and then in distilled H2 0 until the eosin no longer streaked, dipped in
  50% EtOH 10 times, then dipped in 70% EtOH 10 times, equilibrated in 95% EtOH for 30
  seconds, equilibrated in 100% EtOH for 1 minute, dipped in xylene several times and then
 were cleaned off with a kimwipe and mounted with a coverslip using Cytoseal XYL (Stephens
  Scientific; cat#8312-4).
Standard Immunohistochemistry Staining Method: Avidin Biotin Complex (ABC) Method
  [0273] Slides containing deparaffinized or frozen sections were rinsed in PBS-Tween 20 for
 2x2 min. Sections were incubated in normal serum of the same species as the secondary
 antibody.     Sections were incubated in primary antibody, anti-caspase 3 (Millipore No.
 AB3623; Sigma-Aldrich No. C8487; etc.), at 1:100 in IHC-TekTM Antibody Diluent (Cat#
 IW-1000 or IW-1001) or anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell signaling) for 1 hour at room
 temperature or overnight, and rinsed in PBS-Tween 20 for 3x2 min.            The sections were
 incubated in peroxidase blocking solution for 10 minutes at room temperature, rinsed in PBS
 Tween 20 for 3x2 min, and then incubated in Biotinylated secondary antibody in PBS for 30
 minutes at room temperature. The sections were rinsed in PBS-Tween 20 for 3x2 min, and
 then incubated in ABC-Peroxidase Solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. The sections
 were rinsed in PBS-Tween 20 for 3x2 min, and then incubated in peroxidase substrate solution.
 The sections were rinsed in PBS-Tween 20 for 3x2 min, counterstained with counterstain
 solution, rinsed in running tap water for 2-5 minutes, dehydrated through 95% ethanol for 1
 minute, 100% ethanol for 2x3min, cleared in xylene for 2x5min and coverslipped with
 mounting medium. Negative control slides were processed in the absence of the primary
 antibody. (Ren, Y. et al. Small molecule Wnt inhibitors enhance the efficiency of BMP-4

Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay
   [0274] DLD1 or HCT1 16 cells were plated in double-layer agar cultures in 35-mm dishes. The
  alpha modification of Eagle's minimal essential medium (Flow Laboratories, Invitrogen,
  Sigma-Aldrich, etc.) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Invitrogen, etc.)
  was used for all cultures. Growth factors and/or conditioned media were incorporated in the
  underlay at a maximum of 13.2% of the total culture volume of 1.5 mL per dish. Cultures were
  gassed with a 5% 02-10% C0 2 -85% N 2 mixture and incubated for 10 to 14 days. Only colonies
  containing 50 or more cells were scored.
Invasion assays
  [0275] 105 cells were serum-starved overnight, suspended in basal medium and plated onto
  8.0-pim pore Matrigel@ transwell (BD Biosciences).       Five hundred microliters of medium
  containing 2% serum and growth supplements was added to the bottom well. Non-migratory
  cells were scraped off 24 hours later, and migratory cells were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2
  phenylindole (DAPI).      Experiments were performed in triplicate transwells for biological
  triplicates and quantified by averaging the number of stained cells per 4x field of view
  counting five fields per chamber.

  [0276] HCT116, DLD1, 1CTRPA and 1CTRPA A1309 cells were exposed to small molecule
  anti-cancer analogs PDSA-010, PDSA-011, PDSA-013 or PDSA-014 and analyzed by flow
  cytometry using a Beckman Coulter (Hialeah, FL) EPICS XL Flow Cytometer.
Cytochrome C Releasing Apoptosis Assay
  [0277] The terms "apoptosis" or "programmed cell death" refer to a highly regulated and
  active process that contributes to biologic homeostasis comprised of a series of biochemical
  events that lead to a variety of morphological changes, including blebbing, changes to the cell
  membrane, such as loss of membrane asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, nuclear
  fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation, without
  damaging the organism.
  [0278] Apoptotic cell death is induced by many different factors and involves numerous
  signaling pathways, some dependent on caspase proteases (a class of cysteine proteases) and
  others that are caspase independent. It can be triggered by many different cellular stimuli,
  including cell surface receptors, mitochondrial response to stress, and cytotoxic T cells,
 resulting in activation of apoptotic signaling pathways.
  [0279] The caspases involved in apoptosis convey the apoptotic signal in a proteolytic
 cascade, with caspases cleaving and activating other caspases that then degrade other cellular
 targets that lead to cell death. The caspases at the upper end of the cascade include caspase-8
 and caspase-9. Caspase-8 is the initial caspase involved in response to receptors with a death
 domain (DD) like Fas.
  [0280] Receptors in the TNF receptor family are associated with the induction of apoptosis, as
 well as inflammatory signaling. The Fas receptor (CD95) mediates apoptotic signaling by Fas
 ligand expressed on the surface of other cells. The Fas-FasL interaction plays an important role
                                                 73

in the immune system and lack of this system leads to autoimmunity, indicating that Fas
mediated apoptosis removes self-reactive lymphocytes. Fas signaling also is involved in
immune surveillance to remove transformed cells and virus infected cells. Binding of Fas to
oligimerized FasL on another cell activates apoptotic signaling through a cytoplasmic domain
termed the death domain (DD) that interacts with signaling adaptors including FAF, FADD
and DAX to activate the caspase proteolytic cascade. Caspase-8 and caspase-10 first are
activated to then cleave and activate downstream caspases and a variety of cellular substrates
that lead to cell death.
 [0281] Mitochondria participate in apoptotic signaling pathways through the release of
mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c, a key protein in electron transport, is
released from mitochondria in response to apoptotic signals, and activates Apaf-1, a protease
released from mitochondria. Activated Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the rest of the caspase
pathway. Smac/DIABLO is released from mitochondria and inhibits LAP proteins that
normally interact with caspase-9 to inhibit apoptosis. Apoptosis regulation by Bcl-2 family
proteins occurs as family members form complexes that enter the mitochondrial membrane,
regulating the release of cytochrome c and other proteins. TNF family receptors that cause
apoptosis directly activate the caspase cascade, but can also activate Bid, a Bcl-2 family
member, which activates mitochondria-mediated        apoptosis. Bax, another Bcl-2 family
member, is activated by this pathway to localize to the mitochondrial membrane and increase
its permeability, releasing cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
prevent pore formation, blocking apoptosis. Like cytochrome c, AIF (apoptosis-inducing
factor) is a protein found in mitochondria that is released from mitochondria by apoptotic
stimuli. While cytochrome C is linked to caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling, AIF release
                                            74

 stimulates caspase-independent apoptosis, moving into the nucleus where it binds DNA. DNA
binding by AIF stimulates chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, perhaps through
recruitment of nucleases.
 [02821 The mitochondrial stress pathway begins with the release of cytochrome c from
mitochondria, which then interacts with Apaf-1, causing self-cleavage and activation of
 caspase-9. Caspase-3, -6 and-7 are downstream caspases that are activated by the upstream
proteases and act themselves to cleave cellular targets.
 102831 Granzyme B and perforin proteins released by cytotoxic T cells induce apoptosis in
target cells, forming transmembrane pores, and triggering apoptosis, perhaps through cleavage
of caspases, although caspase-independent mechanisms of Granzyme B mediated apoptosis
have been suggested.
 [0284] Fragmentation of the nuclear genome by multiple nucleases activated by apoptotic
signaling pathways to create a nucleosomal ladder is a cellular response characteristic of
apoptosis. One nuclease involved in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), a caspase
activated DNAse (CAD). DFF/CAD is activated through cleavage of its associated inhibitor
ICAD by caspases proteases during apoptosis. DFF/CAD interacts with chromatin components
such as topoisomerase II and histone HI to condense chromatin structure and perhaps recruit
CAD to chromatin. Another apoptosis activated protease is endonuclease G (EndoG). EndoG is
encoded in the nuclear genome but is localized to mitochondria in normal cells. EndoG may
play a role in the replication of the mitochondrial genome, as well as in apoptosis. Apoptotic
signaling causes the release of EndoG from mitochondria. The EndoG and DFF/CAD
pathways are independent since the EndoG pathway still occurs in cells lacking DFF.
                                              75

 [02851 Hypoxia, as well as hypoxia followed by reoxygenation can trigger cytochrome c
 release and apoptosis.      Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3)         a serine-threonine kinase
 ubiquitously expressed in most cell types, appears to mediate or potentiate apoptosis due to
many stimuli that activate the mitochondrial cell death pathway. Loberg, RD, et al., J. Biol.
 Chem. 277 (44): 41667-673 (2002). It has been demonstrated to induce caspase 3 activation
 and to activate the proapoptotic tumor suppressor gene p53.    It also has been suggested that
 GSK-3 promotes activation and translocation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bax,
which, upon agregation and mitochondrial localization, induces cytochrome c release. Akt is a
critical regulator of GSK-3, and phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3 may mediate some
of the antiapoptotic effects of Akt.
 [02861 Apoptosis was induced in cells as follows.        Cells were collected (5 x 107 ) by
centrifugation at 600 x g for 5 minutes at 4*C, washed with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, centrifuged
at 600 x g for 5 minutes at 4*C and the supernatant was removed. Cells were resuspended with
 1.0 ml of 1X Cytosol Extraction Buffer Mix containing DTT and Protease Inhibitors and
incubated on ice for 10 minutes. The cells were homogenized in an ice-cold Dounce tissue
grinder on ice.     The homogenate was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and
centrifuged at 700 x g for 10 minutes at 4'C. Supernatant was collected into a fresh 1.5-ml
tube, and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4'C. Supernatant was collected as a
Cytosolic Fraction.    The pellet was resuspended in 0.1-mL Mitochondrial Extraction Buffer
Mix containing DTT and protease inhibitors, and vertexed for 10 seconds and saved as the
Mitochondrial Fraction. 10 pg each of the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions isolated from
uninduced and induced cells were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoresed.              A
standard Western blot procedure was performed and the blot was probed with cytochrome c

Animal Experiments
  [02891 Subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografts were established in 5- to 6-week-old female nude mice
  (NCI) by inoculation of 2x10 6 CRC cells into both dorsal flanks of each mouse. When the
  tumors grew to 2 to 3 mm in diameter, the mice were injected i.p. with TASIN-1 at a dose of
  40mg/kg (dissolved in 0.2mL solvent containing 10% DMSO, 10% cremophor) or solvent
  alone twice daily until the tumors grew to 15 mm in diameter in the control group. Tumor
  volumes were measured using calipers and calculated using formula 1 x w2 x 0.5, where I and
  w represented the length and width of the tumor, respectively.     The colorectal transgenic
  cancer mouse model, CDX2P-NLS Cre;APC"! (CPC;Apc) mouse, was used (Kaplan, K.B.

  et al. A role for the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli protein in chromosome segregation. Nature
  cell biology 3, 429-432 (2001). Male CPC,Apc mice ~ 110 days old were injected i.p. with
  either solvent or 20mg/kg/injection of TASIN-1 twice a week for 90 days.        Weights were
 measured every 15 days over the treatment period.
  [0290] In summary, female nude mice (NCI) with established xenografts were injected i.p.
 with TASIN-1 at a dose of 40mg/kg (dissolved in 0.2mL solvent containing 10% DMSO, 10%
 cremophor) or solvent alone twice daily. For the CPC; Apc mice experiments, mice were
 injected i.p. with either solvent or 20mg/kg/injection of TASIN-1 twice a week for 90 days.
Tumor Development in Mice
  [0291] Mice were injected with HCT1 16 cells, DLD1 or HT-29 cells on day 0 and on day 8,
 and then treated with either vehicle or compound at a dose of 10-40mg/kg, twice daily. Tumor
 growth was assessed by excising and physically measuring the size of the tumor.         Tumor
 growth rate was assessed by analyzing tumor size after the following time points after
 inoculation with HCT 116 cells, DLD1 or HT-29: 12, 15, 19, 22 and 24 days.
 [0292] Analogs were tested for tumor inhibition in mice.        DLD1 or HCT116 cells were
 injected into mice to grow tumors. At day 6, when the tumor volume is approximately 50mm 3,
 mice were either inoculated with a control or PDSA-014.        PDSA-014 was administered by
 intraperitoneal injections to mice twice daily at 10mg/kg. Tumors were removed on days 9,
 12, 15, 18 and 21. Tumors were measured to determine tumor growth.
Mitotic Index
 [0293] For determination of the mitotic index, DLD1 cells were methanol fixed 24 h after
 treatment with TASIN-1 at a concentration of 2.5tL or 10 tL or Pitstop2 (abcam, ab120687)
 at a concentration of 10 L0 L, DNA was visualized by Hoechst 33342 staining, and cells were
                                                79

 imaged on a microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss) using a LD 40x/NA 0.75/Ph2 Plan
 Neofluor objective. Mitotic cells were identified in the UV channel by their condensed DNA
 content.
 [0294] HCECs with TP53, APC knockdown, KRASV12 mutation (1CTRPA) together with

 developed (see Eskiocak U, Kim SB, Ly P, Roig Al, Biglione S, Komurov K, Cornelius C,

PMID: 22753261, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.) This APC mutation is
strongly selected for in colon cancers and has been shown to be more resistant to caspase
cleavage than other truncated forms of APC. APC-truncated HCEC cell line 1CTRPA A1309
exhibits an increase in growth rate, enhancement of soft agar growth and invasion through
matrigel@ compared to matched parental HCECs (1CTRPA). However, knockdown of wt
APC alone (1CTRPA) did not cause HCECs to gain oncogenic properties (data unpublished).
10295] These observations lent support to the idea that APC truncations may cause cells to
gain oncogenic properties,      such as, for example, excessive or misregulated cellular
proliferation.

 [0297] Isogenic cell lines were used to carry out a cell-based high-throughput screen designed
to identify small molecules and/or natural product fractions from within the University of
Texas Southwestern (UTSW) compound file that can selectively inhibit cell growth of APC
truncated HCECs (Figure 6). This compound library encompasses                                ~200,000 synthetic
compounds that represent a large chemical space from several commercial vendors, including
 1200 marketed drugs from the Prestwick Chemical Library®, and 600 compounds that went to
pre-clinical tests from the NIH library. The isogenic cell lines used in the screen are listed in
Table 1.
[02981 A primary screen was performed in ICTRPA A1309. For the screen, cells were seeded
as a monolayer at a density of 400 cells/well in 384 well plates [in Colonic Epithelial Cell
Medium (CoEpiCM (ScienCell                Research        Laboratories;       Innoprot,    etc.)]   which are
commercially available (Invitrogen; BioRad; Corning etc.). Twenty four hours later candidate
compounds were added at a concentration of 2.5pM per well and cells were incubated for 4
days at physiologic oxygen conditions (~3-5% 02). A luminescence-based Celltiter-Glo@
assay was performed to measure cell viability, using ATP levels as the readout.                       In brief,
                                                        81

 opaque-walled multiwell plates with mammalian cells in culture medium (25pl per well, 384
 well plates) were prepared. Control wells containing medium without cells were prepared to
 obtain a value for background luminescence.     Test compounds were added to experimental
 wells, and incubated according to culture protocol. The plate and its contents were incubated
 at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. An ATP standard curve was generated
 immediately prior to adding the CellTiter-Glo@ Reagent.         A volume of CellTiter-Glo@
Reagent equal to the volume of cell culture medium present in each well (25pl of reagent to
25 pl of medium containing cells for a 384-well plate) was added. The contents were mixed for
2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis. The plate was allowed to incubate at room
temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize the luminescent signal and luminescence recorded. (e.g.
GloMax @, Lumistar, SPECTROstar, PHERAstar FS).              The primary screen yielded 6704
positive hits (based on a z- score of <-3, which means that the z-score of -3 was 3 standard
deviations below the mean).
[0299] Compounds that inhibited >40% of the proliferation of normal human epithelial cells
were excluded based on the screening facility database and previous experience. The remaining
5381 compounds were re-screened against 1CTRPA A1309 (to validate the primary screen
results) and 1CTRPA (to exclude those compounds that are not specific to APC truncations).
To eliminate the possible general toxicity properties of these compounds, the compounds were
also counter screened against normal diploid HCECs (1 CT). This counter screen identified 126
compounds that inhibit cell growth of CTRPA A1309 >50% more than that of 1CTRPA
andI CT. An additional screen of these selectively toxic compounds was carried out against the
same panel of HCECs at a 1:3 fold dilution series of concentrations, ranging from 2.5um to
30nm. This secondary counter screen yielded 14 candidate compounds that showed selective
                                              82

    inhibition of 1CTRPA A1309 cells at concentrations of 30nm or 90nm but without noticeable
    impact on 1CTRPA or 1CT cells. The overall screening strategy is shown in the flow chart
    (Figure 6).
    [03001 These 14 compounds then were obtained commercially and their IC 50 determined by
   performing dose response studies with half log dilution series at 12 concentration points in two
    authentic CRC lines: HCT 116 (wt APC) and DLD1 (truncated APC). Anti-cancer compounds
   A and B showed selective toxicity towards DLD 1 with IC 50 63nm and 131 nm, respectively, as
   shown in Figure 7. These two compounds served as initial lead compounds for analog
   development and for additional studies.
Exemplary compounds resulting from these substitutions are shown in Table A.
I.           General information
    [03011 'H and "C NMR spectra were obtained using either Varian Inova-400 MHz or 500
   MHz spectrometer. Abbrevations for signal couplings are as follows: s, singlet; br, broad; d,
   doublet; t, triplet, q, quartet and m, multiplet. Melting point of solid samples was performed
   using Fisher-Johns Melting Point Apparatus. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was
   performed on precoated plates purchased from E. Merck (TLC silica 60 PF254, 25 Glass plates
   20 x 20 cm). The chromatograms were visualized under UV light or by staining with iodide or
   KMnO4. Flash chromatography was performed either on the basis of the description of Still et
   al (Still, W. C. et al. J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 2923-2925 ) using E. Merck silica gel 60 (230
   400 mesh) or on an Isco Combiflash system using Redisep@Rf Flash column with the size
   ranging from 4 grams to 80 grams. All air sensitive reactions were carried out under argon
   environment. Unless otherwise noted, all common reagents and solvents purchased from

   [0302] A mixture of amine (1.0 mmol), sulfonyl chloride (1.1 mmol), N,N-diisopropyl
   ethylamine (1.5 mmol), and CH 2 Cl 2 (5 mL) was stirred at room temperature overnight. The
   reaction solution was then poured into saturated NaHCO 3 solution (20 ml) and extracted by
   CH 2 Cl 2 (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and
   concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified either through flash
   chromatography on silica gel with a MeOH : CH 2 Cl 2 (or MeOH : EtOAc) mixture as eluent or
  by recrystallization from a mixture of CH 2 C12 and hexane to provide the sulfonamides.

 reaction time ranged from 20 h to 89 h. The reaction was then quenched by dropwsie adding
 saturated NaHCO3 solution at 0 oC and the generated bi-phase solution was extracted by

Example 2. In Vitro APC Inhibition Assay
  [0432]           The small molecule anti-cancer compounds were evaluated for the ability to
 inhibit the activity of APC in an in vitro assay. Table A shows the IC 50 measured for each
 exemplified compound.
 [0433] Reagents        required    for    the    assay    are:    (3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5
 diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Thiazolyl blue; RPI corp., cat# M92050); RPMI-1640 or
 Medium of Choice (i.e. DMEM) without phenol red; 1M Hepes; 100mM NaPyruvate; 1000X
 Gentamicin (50mg/ml); 10OX Penicillin/Streptomycin/Fungizone; IX PBS; Triton X-100; IN
 HCl and Isopropanol. To make the MTT solution (10x), MTT powder was dissolved into
 complete RPMI (or DMEM solution) to a final concentration of 5mg/mL and was sterilized by
 filtration with a 0.2ptm filter. The MTT solubilization solution contained 10% Triton X-100,
 0.1N and 80% isopropanol. MTT solution was diluted to IX with complete medium at 12 mL
 per plate. The culture dishes (96 wells) were removed from the incubator and the media was
                                                  152

discarded. The plates were washed three times with 1x PBS. 100pl of IX MTT solution was
added to each well and the plates were incubated in a tissue culture incubator for 2-4 hours,
depending on the cell line. The cells were removed from the incubator and the MTT solution
was discarded. 200 pl of 1X MTT solubilization solution was added to each well using a
multi-channel pipetor and the cells were placed on an orbital shaker for 10 minutes. The
results were read on a microtiter plate reader (absorbance = 570nm, reference = 700 nm) and
data was exported.
[0434] Percent inhibition was determined relative to control reactions without inhibitor, and
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 5 0) values were determined using a standard four
parameter fit to the inhibition data. The term "IC 50 " as used herein refers to a quantitative
measure of the effectiveness of a compound in inhibiting biological or biochemical function
that indicates the amount that is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of
a process) by 50%.

Example 3. Truncated APC Selective Inhibitor -1 (TASIN-1) kills CRC lines with APC
truncations while sparing normal human colonic epithelial cells (HCECs) and other cancer
cells with wild type (WT) APC, interferes with proper mitotic spindle formation, and
induces JNK-dependent apoptotic cell death in APC truncated cells.
   [0435] Dose response analysis in two authentic CRC cell lines: HCT 116 (WT APC) and DLD1
   (truncated APC), led to identification of the lead compound TASIN-1 (truncated APC selective
  inhibitor) (Figure 7 (d)). This compound exhibited potent and selective toxicity towards DLD1
  cells (IC50 = 63 nM) but not towards HCT116 cells (IC 50 >10 pLM) (Figure 7(e)). Sustained
  treatment of TASIN-1 inhibited soft agar growth in DLD1 but not in HCT1 16 cells (Figure 7
  (f), 11)
  [0436] To validate APC truncation dependency, two independent stable knockdown DLD1 cell
  lines expressing shRNAs were generated against truncated APC. Knockdown of truncated
  APC expression desensitized DLD1 cells to TASIN-1 with a protein reduction of >90%
  (Figures 8, 9), supporting that APC or a protein(s) in a relevant APC-dependent pathway is the
  target of TASIN-1. Similar effects were observed in HT29 cells depleted of truncated APC
  protein (Figure 9a). In addition, ectopic expression of truncated APC partially sensitizes
  HCT1 16 and HCT1 16 p5 3 null cells to TASIN-1 (Figure 9).
                                                  165

[0437] TASIN-1 was tested in a panel of CRC cell lines with varied APC status. Despite the
highly heterogeneous genetic backgrounds, the results showed a consistent correlation between
TASIN-1 sensitivity and APC status (Figures 9, 10). TASIN-1 did not affect the viability of
HCECs, human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and BJ fibroblast cells which are derived
from normal tissues as well as other cancer cell types with WT APC. However, DU4475, a
breast cancer cell line expressing truncated APC 15 was sensitive to TASIN-1,            again
supporting APC truncation dependency (Figure 9', Data Table 1).

  [0438] TASIN-1 caused poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARPI) cleavage, cytochrome c
 release from mitochondria, and induced caspase 3/7 activity in DLD1 cells but not in HCT1 16
 cells (Figures 12, 12' (a-c), 13), indicative of induction of apoptosis. Additionally, TASIN-1
 treatment led to activation of JNK after 48 hours in DLD1 cells but not in HCT1 16 cells and
 this activation persisted for 72 hours (Figure 12'(d)). Co-treatment with the JNK inhibitor
 SP600125 (Millipore) attenuated TASIN-l's effects and efficiently inhibited JNK activation
 and abolished cleavage of PARPI as well as caspase 3/7 activation (Figure 12' (e-g)).
 Collectively, these data demonstrate that TASIN-1 induces JNK-dependent apoptotic cell death
 in DLD1 cells.
Example 4. In vivo antitumor activity of TASIN-1 in a xenograft mouse model.
 [0439] The in vivo antitumor activity of TASIN- 1 was examined in a xenograft mouse model.
 Nude mice with established DLD1 tumors were injected intraperitoneally with either solvent
 (control) or 40 mg/kg of TASIN-1 twice daily for 18 days. TASIN-1 treatment reduced the size
 of tumor xenografts (Figures 17, 17') and reduced tumor growth rates (Figure 17' (b))
 compared with control mice. No overt toxicity and no statistically significant differences were
 observed in the body weights of mice between control group and TASIN-1 treated group
 (Figure 20 (a)). Similar antitumor activity was observed in HT29 xenografts, which also
 harbors truncated APC and demonstrated a similar sensitivity as DLD1 in vitro (Figure 17'(c)).
                                               167

  However, TASIN-1 did not inhibit tumor growth in HCT 16 (WT APC) xenografts (Figure
  19), demonstrating that TASIN- 1 maintains selectivity in vivo. Immunohistochemistry analysis
  of excised tumors showed that TASIN- 1 induced a significant increase in the apoptotic marker,
  cleaved caspase 3 in TASIN-1 treated DLD1 tumors compared with control tumors (Figure 20
  (b)). Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by detection of cleaved PARP1 in tumor lysates
  from control and TASIN-     treated DLD1 xenografts (Figure 20 (c)).
Example 5. Anti-tumor effects of TASIN-1 in CPC;Apc mice
  [0440] Considering that TASIN-1 has a long retention time in mouse large intestine tissue
  (Figure 19'), the antitumor effects in CPC;Apc mice, a genetically engineered mouse model that
 mainly develops colorectal tumors, were further tested. These mice carry a CDX2P-NLS Cre
 recombinase transgene and a loxP-targeted Apc allele that deletes exon 14, leading to a frame
  shift at codon 580 and a truncated APC protein (Hinoi, T. et al. Mouse model of colonic
 adenoma-carcinoma progression based on somatic Apc inactivation. Cancer Res 67, 9721-9730
 (2007)). Mice -110       days old were injected intraperitoneally with either solvent or 20
 mg/kg/injection of TASIN-1 twice a week for 90 days. Weights were measured every 15 days
 over the treatment period. These studies were performed according to the guidelines of the UT
 Southwestern Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
 [0441] TASIN-1 treatment resulted in significant reduction in tumor formation in the colon of
 CPCApc mice (Figures 17', 19'). Benign tumors (polyps) that developed in TASIN-1 treated
 CPC;Apc mice were much smaller compared to the control group (Fig. 3f). Additionally,
 TASIN- 1 treated mice with less tumor burden gained weight to a level similar to WT mice over
 the 90 days' treatment (Figure 17'). Finally, TASIN-1 treated mice showed suppressed
 expression of a panel of inflammatory response genes (Figure 19') and reduced staining for
                                              168

Ki67 and cyclin Dl, accompanied by increased staining for cleaved caspase 3 in colon tumor
sections. Taken together, these in vivo experiments show that TASIN-1 efficiently attenuates
tumorigenesis in both human xenografts and genetically engineered CRC mouse models
without noticeable toxicity.
