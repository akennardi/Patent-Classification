electricianXchange Patent Filing - Description
electricianXchange is a business to business (B2B) electrician exchange service between electrical
contractors (who generally hire electricians) using a digital platform. It is towards bringing about
better electrician labour utilisation rates and in doing so result in an improvement in the profit of the
electrical contractors while ensuring the electricians remain fully employed instead of being made
redundant during leaner periods.
If an employer has hired electricians and finds those electricians are without work for a period of time,
then these electricians can be exchanged with other electrical contractors who have a need for them,
for a fee, eliminating recruiters, labour hire companies and any intermediaries.
In all of this exchange taking place, the electricians as staff, continue to get paid their regular salary,
as they had been before, with the employer finding a way to get some recovery for their overhead
while they are in the office with no work.
The fee paid is based on standardised labour rates for electricians based on their industry grades, the
amount of time the electricians are needed for and a discount factor which is based on demand and
supply for electricians at that point of time.
The amount at which the electricians are bid is done at arm's length between the parties, so the
electrical contractor needing the staff not having any knowledge who the electrical contractor
providing the staff is, until they have negotiated on various parameters with a service fee being
charged by electricianXchange to the electrical contractors for bringing the parties together.
This innovation eliminates all intermediaries such as recruitment companies and labour hire
companies in bringing electrical contractors with staffing needs together.
