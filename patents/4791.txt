                                 TECHNICAL FIELD
 [0002]     The subject disclosure relates to a system and method for venting,
 priming and modifying a flow rate of a fluid from a container. More particularly, the
 present disclosure relates to a container assembly having an expandable nipple
 and a one-way vent valve disposed therein to modify the flow rate of a fluid
 withdrawn from the container assembly.
                                   BACKGROUND
 [0003]     Various types of valving mechanisms are known to vent air from within a
 bottle and to prevent the creation of an excess vacuum. Those typically known,
 include numerous component parts and are large, inconvenient and clumsy to
 assemble and disassemble. These large valving mechanisms may be integrated
 into the cap, via the spout and/or an air vent disposed near the cap.
                                            1

[0004]      Despite the ineffectiveness of these conventional valve mechanisms, a
need exists for an efficient spill proof container assembly and method capable of
simultaneously priming before and during use, while enabling a caregiver to
efficiently moderating the flow of fluid through the nipple of a container.

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0027]       Particular embodiments of the present invention will now be described in
greater detail with reference to the figures.
[0028]       FIG. 1 illustrates an exploded view of an exemplary container system
100. The container system 100 includes a container 10 having an expandable
nipple 20 attached at a first end 12 by a collar 30. A one-way fluid flow valve 40 is
disposed at a second end 14 of the container 10.
[0029]       FIG. 2 depicts an exploded perspective view of the container system
100. The container 10 includes a fastening means 16 adjacent to the first end 12.
Although shown as a threaded fastener 16, 36 connection, it is to be understood
that various fastening mechanisms may be employed for connecting the collar 30
to the first end 12 of the container 10.
[0030]       The collar 30 includes a lower open end 34 connected adjacent to the
first open end 12 of the container 10. A mating threaded fastener 36 is fastened to
the threaded fastener 16 on the container 10. An aperture 32 is provided in an
upper open end of the collar 30 adapted to receive a flange 22 of the expandable
nipple 20.
[0031]       The expandable nipple 20 includes an orifice 21 through which a fluid
may flow. The expandable nipple 20 includes the flange 22 disposed at a lower
end 24. An upper side 26 of the flange 22 is adapted to seat against a lower
surface 38 of the collar 30. The lower side 28 of the flange 22 is adapted to seat
against an upper surface 18 of the container 10. In a closed position, the flange 22
                                            4

is constructed of a resilient sealing material adapted to provide a leak proof seal
between the container 10, collar 30 and the expandable nipple 20.
[0032]     Referring to FIGS. 18-23, the expandable nipple 20 may be an accordion
style nipple having at least one pleat or fold 23 with an interstitial space 25
disposed in the neck of the expandable nipple 20. The expandable nipple 20
provides various functions. First, the expandable nipple 20 is capable of increasing
the volumetric area within the expandable container system 100 as will be
described in more detail below. The expandable nipple 20 may be made of an
elastic resilient material that is biased so that the pleats 23 and interstitial spaces
25 rest in an unextended configuration, such as shown in FIG. 3.
[0033]     Second, the expandable nipple 20 is elastically adapted to be flexibly
stretched outward (as shown in FIG. 4) from the collar 30 and bend sideways at
360 degrees around an axial direction of the nipple extension. The axis (A) being
substantially aligned with the length of the container system 100 as shown in FIGS.
3-4. The benefit of being able to extend and bend the expandable nipple 20 is
realized when a nursing infant and/or animal that is sucking from the end of the
expandable nipple 20 randomly tilts their head out of alignment with the axis (A) of
the expandable nipple. As a result of the flexible movement by the end of the
expandable nipple 20, the suckling latched onto the nipple will remain intact with
the end of the nipple 20 as the tip of the nipple 20 is flexibly bent out of the axial
alignment with the head of the nursing infant and/or animal.
[0034]     This unique push and pull accordion style nipple 20 allows the infant to
more readily self control the flow of milk (or other fluid) by sucking and or applying
pressure (similar to breastfeeding) of the nipple 20. The flexibility of the nipple 20
helps the infant maintain a latch, even when the infant's head moves substantially
                                            5

out of alignment with the end of the container 10. Without the use of an
expandable nipple 20, nursing infants and/or animal would likely detach from the
nipple when a conventional un-expandable nipple was utilized.
[0035]      As shown in FIGS. 21-23, the expandable nipple 20 may be constructed
to include a wider base nearest the collar 30 and a narrower top portion furthest
away from the collar connection. The advantage of this configuration is to
maximize the volume within the nipple 20 and the container 10 during use. The
wider base in the expandable nipple 20 provides for extra volume. As shown in
FIG. 21, the pleat closest to the collar 30 may be constructed as a tapered pleat
23a. Attached to the container 10 by the collar 30, the tapered pleat 23a is
adapted to sit flush with the top edge of the collar 30 thereby enhancing the secure
connection between the nipple 20 and the collar 30.
[0036]      Referring back to FIGS. 2-4, the vent valve 40 includes a resilient
member 42 and a cap 44. A first passage 43 is provided in the resilient member 42
to allow the flow of a first fluid (F1), such as atmospheric air. A second passage 45
is provided in the cap 44 to also allow the flow of the first fluid (Fl) into and across
the resilient member 42. The first passage 43 and the second passage 45
cooperate to efficiently allow the passage of a predetermined amount of the first
fluid (Fl) through the valve 40.
[0037]      The size, shape, orientation of the valve, the resilient member and a
variety other features are constructed to modulate the fluid flow rate of the first fluid
(Fl) across the valve 40. In a closed position, the resilient member 42 is
constructed of an elastic resilient sealing material adapted to provide a leak proof
seal between the container 10 and the cap 44. The cap 44 may be a rigid cap or
                                             6

the like capable of securing the resilient member 42 to the lower end of the
container 10.
[0038]      FIGS. 3 and 4 demonstrate an exemplary operation of the expandable
container system 100. FIG. 3 shows the expandable container system 100 having
a first volume (VOL1). As shown, the expandable container system 100 in FIG. 3
is in a position in which the internal pressure in the expandable container system
100 is in a steady state condition with the outer atmospheric pressure surrounding
the expandable container system 100. As such, the first fluid (F1) (atmospheric air)
outside of the container system 100 does not pass through the valve 40 disposed
in the lower end of the expandable container system 100.
[0039]      FIG. 4 shows the expandable container system 100 having a greater
second volume (VOL2) than the first volume (VOI1) shown in FIG. 3. The
expandable container system 100 is in a position in which the internal pressure
within the expandable container system 100 has been reduced and has created a
vacuum relative to the atmospheric pressure surrounding the expandable container
system 100. As a result, the first fluid F1 (atmospheric air) is drawn in and passes
through the valve 40 disposed in the lower end of the expandable container system
100 in an attempt to reestablish an equilibrium between the internal pressure and
the atmospheric pressure surrounding the expandable container system 100. This
condition can be caused when the expandable nipple 20 is pulled extended
creating a vacuum within the container system 100 thereby drawing in the first fluid
(Fl) from outside of the valve 40.
[0040]      In doing so, the volume (VOL2) of the expandable container system 100
increases from volume (VOL1) a predetermined amount greater than that shown in
FIG. 3. That is, the expandable nipple 20 shown in FIG. 4 is expanded by a
                                           7

predetermined distance H2 beyond H1 (as shown in FIGS. 3-4) as the pleats 23 in
the accordion neck portion of the expandable nipple 20 are extended. As a result,
volume (VOL2) shown in FIG. 4 is increased by the interstitial gap portions 25 and
the extension of the pleats 23 thereby creating a larger volume (VOL2) than the
volume (VOL1) shown in FIG. 3. Likewise, the internal pressure in the expandable
container system 100 shown in FIG. 4 is initially decreased such that the internal
pressure in the container system 100 is less than the internal pressure of the
expandable container system 100 shown in FIG. 3.
[0041]       As mentioned previously, the expandable nipple 20 is made of a resilient
material that is biased to rest in an unextended position such as shown in FIG. 3.
Therefore, once a grip on the neck of the expandable nipple 20, by a user's hand
or the like, has been released from an initial position shown in FIG. 4, a
counteracting compression force (Fc) is produced by the extension in the pleats 23
and the interstitial gaps 25 in the elastic resilient material of the expandable nipple
20. That is, the counteracting force (Fc) produces a force biased to return the
expandable nipple 20 from the stretched position shown in FIG. 4 to the
compressed steady position shown in FIG. 3. The counteracting compression
force (Fc) causes the expandable nipple 20 to compress the pleats 25 and
interstitial gaps 25 back toward the steady state position shown in FIG. 3. As such,
the counteracting compression force (Fc) compresses the enlarged volume (VOL2)
within the expandable container system 100 so that a liquid disposed within the
expandable container system 100 is biased to pour through the orifice passage 21
in the end of the expandable nipple 20.
[0042]       This priming action produced in the expandable container system 100 is
a coordinated effort between both, the expandable nipple 20 and the one-way
                                            8

valve 40 working simultaneously to initially build up an initial pressure in the
expandable container system 100. Upon release of the extended expandable
nipple 20, the counteracting compression force (Fc) is created that further
increases the internal pressure in the enlarged volume (VOL2) so that the liquid
within the expandable container system 100 is biased to pour out through the
nipple passage orifice 21.
[0043]     The construction of the expandable nipple and the vent valve may take
various changes and/or modifications without departing from the broad inventive
concepts of the subject disclosure.
[0044]     FIGS. 5 and 6 show exploded views of a first vent valve 40a
configuration for the expandable container system 100. The vent valve 40a
includes a resilient member 42a and a cap 44a. At least one passage 43 is
provided in the resilient member 42a to allow the flow of the first fluid (Fl). A
second passage 45 is provided in the cap 44a to also allow the flow of the first fluid
(F1). The first passage 43 and the second passage 45 cooperate to efficiently
allow the passage of a predetermined amount of the first fluid (Fl) through the
valve 40a and into the container 10.
[0045]     In a closed position, the resilient member 42a may be constructed in a
circular recessed configuration and made of a resilient sealing material adapted to
provide a leak proof seal between the container 10 and the cap 44a. The resilient
member 42a is disposed between the cap 44a and the lower end 14 of the
container 10. The cap 44a is threadedly fastened into a mating inwardly threaded
portion 39a recessed in the lower end 14 of the container 10.
[0046]     FIGS. 7, 8 and 9 show exploded views of a second vent valve 40b
configuration for the expandable container system 100. The vent valve 40b
                                            9

includes a resilient member 42b, a cap 44b and a retainer 46. At least one
passage 43 is provided in the resilient member 42b to allow the flow of a fluid. A
second passage 45 is provided in the cap 44b to also allow the flow of the first fluid
(F1). A third passage 47 is provided in the retainer 46 to also allow the flow of the
first fluid (F1). The first passage 43, second passage 45 and third passage 47
cooperate to efficiently allow the passage of a predetermined amount of the fluid
through the valve 40b.
[00471        In a closed position, the resilient member 42b is constructed in a flat
circular configuration and made of a resilient sealing material adapted to provide a
leak proof seal between the container 10, the retainer 46, and the cap 44b. The
resilient member 42b is disposed between the cap 44b and the retainer 46 in the
lower end 14 of the container 10. The retainer 46 may be snap locked onto the cap
44b via a detent fastener means 46b as shown in FIG. 8, or other mechanism for
fastening the retainer 46 to the cap 44b. The cap 44b is threadedly fastened onto
a mating outwardly threaded portion 39b disposed on an outer portion of the lower
end 14 of the container 10.
[0048]        In use, the second passages 45 are accessible from outside of the
container 10. As constructed, the various vent holes in the passage 45 can be
accessed and covered by a caregiver's finger unlike conventionally valving
mechanism before which could not perform this feature as described in the subject
disclosure. That is, according to this subject disclosure, the caregiver can
selectively block and unblock all of the vent passages 45with a single finger.
[0049]       FIGS. 10 and 11 show exploded views of a third vent valve 40c
configuration for the expandable container system 100. The vent valve 40c
includes a resilient member 42c and a cap 44c. At least one passage 43 is
                                               10

provided in the resilient member 42c to allow the flow of a first fluid (F1). A second
passage 45 is provided in the cap 44c to also allow the flow of the first fluid (Fl).
The first passage 43 and the second passage 45 cooperate to efficiently allow the
passage of a predetermined amount of the first fluid (F1) through the valve 40c.
[0050]     In a closed position, the resilient member 42c is constructed in a duck bill
configuration and made of a resilient sealing material adapted to provide a leak
proof seal between the container 10 and the cap 44c. The resilient member 42c is
disposed between the cap 44c the lower end 14 of the container 10. The cap 44c
may be threadedly fastened onto a mating outwardly threaded portion 39c
disposed on an outer portion of the lower end 14 of the container 10.
[0051]     FIGS. 12 and 13 show exploded views of a fourth vent valve 40d
configuration for the expandable container system 100. This vent valve 40d
construction may be co-molded. The vent valve 40d includes a resilient member
42d and cap 44d. At least one passage 45 is provided in the co-molded vent valve
40d to allow the flow of a first fluid (F1). The passage 45 efficiently allows the
passage of a predetermined amount of the first fluid (Fl) through the co-molded
vent valve 40d.
[0052]     In a closed position, the co-molded vent valve 40d may be constructed
with a duck bill configuration and partially made of a resilient sealing material
adapted to provide a leak proof seal between the container 10 and the co-molded
vent valve 40d. The co-molded vent valve 40d is disposed in a recess 39d
disposed in the lower end 14 of the container 10. The co-molded vent valve 40d is
secured into the recess 39d utilizing a pair of locking protrusions 50a.
[0053]     The co-molded vent valve 40d includes a flange 50c and a cut-out
portion 50b mating with the shape of the locking protrusions 50a in the recess 39d
                                             11

in the end of the container 10. In use, the co-molded vent valve 40d is aligned
inside of the recess 39d, and the cut-out portion 50b on the flange 50c is aligned
with the mating shape of the locking protrusions 50a. The upper surface of the
flange 50c is depressed below the lower surface of the locking protrusions 50a and
twisted by the knob 50d so that the cut-out portion 50b and the locking protrusions
50a are no longer aligned and the cap 44d is prevented from being withdrawn.
That is, the flange 50c is then locked within the recess 39d disposed in the end 14
of the container 10 by the upper surface of the flange 50c bearing against the lower
surface of the locking protrusions 50a.
[0054]      FIGS. 14 and 15 show exploded views of a fifth vent valve 40e
configuration for the expandable container system 100. The vent valve 40e
includes a resilient member 42e and cap 44e. At least one passage 43 is provided
in the resilient member 42e to allow the flow of a first fluid (F1). A second passage
45 is provided in the cap 44e to also moderate and allow the flow of the first fluid
(F1). The first passage 43 and the second passage 45 cooperate to efficiently allow
the passage of a predetermined amount of the first fluid (F1) through the vent valve
40e.
[0055]       In a closed position, the resilient member 42e is constructed in a duck bill
configuration and made of a resilient sealing material adapted to provide a leak
proof seal between the container 10 and the cap 44e. The resilient member 42e is
disposed between the cap 44e the lower end 14 of the container 10. The cap 44e
is disposed in a recess 39e provided in the lower end 14 of the container 10. The
vent valve 40e is secured into the recess 39d utilizing a pair of locking protrusions
50a.
                                              12

[0056]     The vent valve 40e includes a flange 50c and a cut-out portion 50b
mating with the shape of the locking protrusions 50a. In use, the vent valve 40e
and the resilient member 42e are aligned inside of the recess 39d, and the cut-out
portion 50b on the flange 50c is aligned with the mating shape of the locking
protrusions 50a. The upper surface of the flange 50c is depressed below the lower
surface of the locking protrusions 50a and twisted by the knob 50d so that the cut
out portion 50b and the locking protrusions 50a are no longer aligned and
prevented from being withdrawn. The flange 50c is then locked in the recess 39e
disposed in the end 14 of the container 10 by the upper surface of the flange 50c
bearing against the lower surface of the locking protrusions 50a.
[0057]     FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate an exemplary sixth one-way vent valve 40f
configuration for the expandable container system 100 utilizing the resilient
member 40f without a cap. As shown, the resilient member 40f is a one-way valve
provided in a side wall of the container 10. The vent valve 40f is a resilient
member 64 having an outward flange 62 disposed outside of the container 10, and
an inward flange 64 disposed inside of the container 10. The vent valve 40f
includes a passage 45 in the one-way vent valve 40f to efficiently moderate the
flow of the fluid into the container 10.
[0058]     The size, shape, orientation of the one way vent valve 40f may take a
variety of different shapes in order to efficiently modulate the fluid flow rate across
the vent valve 40f. The vent valve 40f is constructed of a resilient sealing material
adapted to provide a leak proof seal between the container 10 and the outside
atmosphere. The vent valve 40f may be co-molded into the side wall of the
container 10. Although shown as protruding outside of the wall of the container 10,
                                           13

the vent valve 40f may be recessed in a variety of different ways as described and
shown with respect to the various embodiments provided herein.
[0059]       It is to be understood that the size, shape, orientation of the valve, its
component parts, valve passages and various other features may be modified in
accordance with the subject disclosure to efficiently modulate the fluid flow rate
through the valves and its various components parts.
[0060]      As briefly described above, FIGS. 18, 19 and 20 depict various views for
another exemplary expandable nipple 20a configuration for the container system.
The expandable nipple 20a includes various nubs 27 disposed in the interstitial
gaps 25 between the various pleats 23. The nubs 27 act to restrict the direction in
which the expandable nipple 20a is permitted to bend. If the expandable nipple
20a is bent toward a nub 27, the nub 27 will reduce the amount of bend or
compression that the pleat 23 can make in that particular direction. However, if the
expandable nipple 20a is bent in a direction where no, or a limited number of nubs
27 are provided then the expandable nipple 20a will be permitted to bend further in
that particular direction with fewer nubs 27. The nubs 27 can be positioned in any
predetermined arrangement to direct or limit the amount of movement is a
particular direction.
[0061]      Various materials may be used according to this disclosure including, but
not limited to: polypropylene, a thermoplastic elastomer, a high density
polyethylene, polycarbonate, urethane rubber, silicone and/or any other suitable
material may be used.
[0062]    It is to be understood that the resilient member 42 is removable and
adapted to allow a first fluid (F1) (such as air) to vent into the container 10 when a
vacuum is generated within the container 10. Furthermore, the resilient member
                                             14

42 in the container system 100 is constructed to permit a user to manually modify
the rate of a first fluid (F1) which directly affects the flow of the second fluid (F2) (as
shown in FIGS. 24 and 27-28 and discussed later) coming out of the container 10.
That is, the fluid flowing out of the expandable container system 100 can be
controlled by selectively covering the first passage 43 of an inlet opening in the
resilient member 42.
[0063]    Although the expandable container system 100 is illustrated for use as a
baby bottle, it is to be understood that the container system and valve 40 may be
used for a variety of different containers and applications, such as for example:
house-wares: such as condiments, cleaning solutions, cooking ingredients;
hardware: such as lubricants, stain removers, pesticides, lawn care; commercial
applications: such as condiments in restaurants or the like, and/or any other
contained product suitable for use with the expandable container system 100.
[0064]    FIG. 24 demonstrates a caregiver 2 feeding an infant 4 with the
expandable container system 100, such as in a baby bottle as shown integrated
with an exemplary removable one-way resilient member 42. By selectively
manipulating the opening passage 43 of the resilient member 42, the one-way
resilient member 42 can control the flow of the first fluid (F1), which affects the fluid
flow of the second fluid (F2, such as formula in an infant bottle) out of the
expandable container system 100.
[0065]    FIGS. 25-26 show another exemplary configuration for the expandable
container system 100. The expandable container system 100 includes a cover 70,
an expandable nipple 20, a collar 30, a container 10 and a resilient member 42.
For exemplary purposes, the resilient member 42f is provided. According to this
embodiment, a retaining cap is not provided and the leak proof seal and flow of the
                                             15

first fluid (F1) through the first passage 43 in the resilient member 42f and into the
bottle 10 is controlled by the configuration of the resilient member 42f.
[0066]     As shown in operation in FIGS. 27-29, the one-way removable resilient
member 42f disposed in the lower end 24 of the container 10 may be manually
manipulated by a finger of a caregiver 2 by covering and uncovering the inlet first
passage 43 in order to regulate the flow rate of the first fluid (F1) into, and across
the resilient member 42f. By manually manipulating the passage 43 in the one-way
resilient member 42f, the flow of the second fluid (F2) out of the orifice in the nipple
20 can be controlled. That is, by controlling the flow of the first fluid (Fl, such as
air) into the container 10, the caregiver is able to reduce the amount of air intake
and reduce the aeration in the container 10 by allowing air to come in from the
bottom of the container 10. Likewise, by manipulating the increase or decrease of
the flow rate of a first fluid (F1) into the resilient member 42f, the flow rate of a
second fluid (F2) out of the container 10 and into the infant's mouth can be
conveniently increased or decreased.
[0067]     The first passage 43 in the resilient member 42f may be selectively closed
off as shown in FIGS. 28-29 at an inlet end 43a of the resilient member 42f to slow
down the flow of the first fluid (Fl) flowing across the resilient member 42f and into
the container 10. Alternatively, the inlet end 43a of the resilient member 42f may
be selectively manipulated to modify the rate of flow of the first fluid (F1) into the
container 10, which in turn controls the rate of flow of the second fluid (F2) out of
the container 10 and into the mouth of the infant.
[0068]     As shown, the expandable container system 100 is embodied as an infant
bottle having a narrowed neck 10 a portion closer to the lower end of the container
10. The benefit of providing the narrowed neck 1Oa portion enables a caregiver to
                                              16

more securely and comfortably hold the container 10 from the lower end of the
container 10 while allowing the caregiver's finger to lie close and conveniently
adjacent to the inlet passage 43 of the resilient member 42f. As such, the
caregiver is able to conveniently control the opening and closing of the passage 43
in the expandable container system 100.
[0069]    It is also to be understood that resilient member 42 may be used in a
container without the use of an expandable outlet device (such as the expandable
nipple 20 described in this subject disclosure). In such a system, a non-extendable
nipple may be used and the user may still selectively control the flow rate of a
second fluid (F2) coming out of the container 10 by selectively covering and
uncovering the passage of the resilient member. Likewise, the nipple can be
replaced by some other type of dispenser or dispensing element for a different
product capable of integrating the one-way valve which can be manually
manipulated by a user selectively covering and uncovering the inlet 43 passage of
the resilient member 42 disposed in the lower end, or other wall of the container
10.
[0070]    It is to be understood that the valving mechanism may be disposed at
various locations on the bottle container. For example, the valve may be located in
the collar, on a dispensing element, in the container near the top of the container,
the side or at the bottom of the container. According to this subject disclosure, the
inlet may be manipulated at any location by the hand of a user, and more
particularly by a finger of a user.
[0071]    Referring back to FIG. 27, the expandable infant bottle includes an
expandable nipple 20 fastened to the container 10 by a collar 30. The expandable
nipple 20 includes an outlet 21 from which the second fluid (F2) held in the
                                            17

container 10 will flow as the infant sucks from the expandable nipple 20. As shown
in this embodiment, the resilient member 42f is provided in the lower end 24 of the
container 10 and easily accessible by the finger of the caregiver 2.
[0072]    FIGS. 28-29 illustrate various operations of the resilient member 42f. In
FIGS. 27-28, the first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f is shown unblocked
and open. In this position, the resilient member 42f operates as an air vent to
permit a predetermined amount of a first fluid (Fl, such as air) to enter into the
container 10 through the first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f under a
vacuum as the second fluid (F2) from within the container 20 is drawn out from an
opposite end in the container 10. Entry of the atmospheric air drawn into the first
passage 43 of the resilient member 42f occurs when a vacuum is built up inside of
the container 10. The vacuum draws air from the surrounding atmosphere
disposed outside of the container 10. In the case where the container 10 is a baby
bottle (such as shown in FIG. 27), being able to automatically regulate the vacuum
built up in the container 10 across the first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f
has various advantages to nursing an infant as mentioned previously.
[0073]    As shown in FIG. 29, the first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f is
accessible by a caregiver 2 from outside of the container 10. In use, a tip of a
finger of the caregiver 2 can be placed over the inlet passage 43a of the resilient
member 42f in order to close off the flow of first fluid (F1) into the resilient member
42f.
[0074]    In this closed position, the finger of the caregiver 2 blocks off the first
passage 43 of the resilient member 42f so that the first fluid (F1, i.e. atmospheric
air) may not enter through the first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f and into
the container 10. In this way, the user may manipulate the flow of the second fluid
                                            18

(F2) out of the orifice 21 in the nipple 20 by selectively blocking the first passage 43
of the resilient member 42f. By blocking the first passage 43 of the resilient
member 42f, as the second fluid (F2) is drawn through the orifice 21 outlet in the
nipple 20, a vacuum is created in the container 10 as a result of the displacement
of the second fluid (F2) in the container 20 since the atmospheric air is not allowed
to enter through the first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f and into the
container 10 to restore the displacement of the second fluid (F2) escaping from the
container 10.
As the vacuum increases in the container 10, the continuous drawing of the fluid
from inside of the container 10 becomes more difficult to suck out of the orifice 21
in the nipple 20 because of the build-up of the negative pressure vacuum inside of
the container 10.
[0075]   The caregiver 2 can selectively manipulate the flow of the second fluid
(F2) coming out of the container 10 by intermittently blocking and unblocking the
first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f with her finger as shown in FIGS. 28
29. Manual manipulation of the flow of second fluid (F2) dispensed from the
container 10 is controlled by throttling the flow of first fluid (F1) into the passage 43
of the resilient member 42f, such as by intermittently blocking and unblocking the
first passage 43 of the resilient member 42f with their finger.
[0076]      FIGS. 30-33 show various views of the resilient member 42f
configuration for the expandable container system 100. As shown in cross section
in FIG. 32, the resilient member 42f includes a passage 43 having a first inlet
passage 43a and an outlet passage 43b. The outlet passage 43b is configured in
a duck bill configuration having two lips 43c butting up adjacent to each other at
one end that open and close in response to a pressure differential inside and
                                           19

outside of the container system 100 to allow the fluid to pass through into the
container 10.
[0077]     As shown, the resilient member 42f includes a narrow neck portion 43d
bordered by an upper shoulder portion 43e defining a lower end of the lips and a
lower shoulder portion 43f that extends into a larger flange that fits within a recess
39d in the lower end of the container 10, as shown in FIGS. 28-29. The recess 39d
is adapted to receive the resilient member 42f. Secured within the recess 39d, the
resilient member 42f provides a leak proof seal preventing the leakage of fluid
inside and outside of the container 10. Various configurations for the resilient
member 42 are possible.
[0078]      FIGS. 34-35 illustrate yet another resilient member 42g configuration for
use in the expandable container system 100. As shown in cross section in FIG. 35,
the resilient member 42g includes a passage 43 including a first inlet passage 43a
and an outlet passage 43b. The outlet passage 43b is configured in a duck bill
configuration also having a pair of lips 43c that open and close in response to a
pressure differential inside and outside of the container system 100 as mentioned
previously.
[0079]     As shown, the resilient member 42g includes a flared narrow neck
portion 43h bordered by an upper shoulder portion 43e defining a lower end of the
lips and a lower shoulder portion 43f that extends into a larger flange that fits within
a recess 39d in the lower end of the container 10. The recess 39d is adapted to
receive the resilient member 42g. Secured within the recess 39d, the resilient
member 42g provides a leak proof seal preventing the leakage of fluid inside and
outside of the container 10.
                                          20

[0080]     FIGS. 36-37 and 25-26 show the container system 100 including a cover
70. The cover 70 is adapted to be releasably secured over the container 10. More
specifically, the cover 70 is secured to the container system 100 to cover and
protect the expandable nipple 20 from contamination.
[0081]     The cover 70 may be attached to the container 10 in a variety of ways.
For example, and as shown in FIG. 38-40, the cover 70 may be secured by a
friction fit to the container 10 over the collar 30 such that an internal diameter of the
lower end 76 of the cover 70 is slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the collar
30. When the cover 70 is placed over the collar 30 and pressed thereon, a friction
fit is formed between the two components. It is to be understood, that the cover 70
may be attached to various other components of the container 10.
[0082]     As shown in FIGS. 25-26 and 36-37, the cover 70 includes a fastener 72
provided to attach the cover 70 of the container system 100 to an object via an
attachment mechanism 74. The fastener 72 shown is constructed as a looped
attachment member including an opening 72a to allow the fastener 72 to be
opened or accessed and secured to the object. The fastener 72 may include
various contours within the looped fastener, such as the slight recess 72b in the
looped portion of the fastener 72 adapted to securely align the cover 70 onto a peg
or the like, such as on a peg in a retail store. The fastener 72 integrated with the
cover 70 may take a variety of different forms, including but not limited to, a hook, a
belt loop, a strap and buckle, Velcro © attachment, a zipper and/or any other type
of suitable fastener in accordance with the subject disclosure.
[0083]     FIGS. 36-40 illustrate an enlarged view of the releasable cover 70 and an
exemplary attachment mechanism 74 having complimentary parts disposed on the
cover 70 and on the collar 30 respectively. In more detail, the cover 70 includes a
                                            21

closed end 75 and an open end 76. A first portion of the complimentary
attachment mechanism 74 may include a projecting ledge 77 jutting inward from
the inner surface of the cover 70. The projecting ledge 77 is disposed adjacent to
the open end 76 of the cover 70.
[0084]   A second portion of the complimentary attachment mechanism 74
disposed on the collar 30. The second portion of the complimentary attachment
mechanism 74 may include a slight recess 78 in the collar 30 adapted to matingly
receive the projecting ledge 77 in a secure manner.
[0085]   When the cover 70 is attached to the collar 30 as shown in FIGS. 26 and
38, the projecting ledge 77 is aligned with and secured to the recess 78. The
connection made between the projecting ledge 77 and the recess 78 is strong
enough to overcome normal jostling of the container 10 filled with a fluid and
attached to an object. For example, in the case of a baby bottle, when the fastener
72 is attached to a stroller, diaper bag, belt loop or the like, normal movement such
as briskly walking with the stroller would not cause the cover 70 to be disengaged
from the collar 30.
[0086]   Although the attachment mechanism 74 is shown as a projecting ledge 77
and mating recess 78, it is to be understood that the attachment mechanism 74
can be any attachment mechanism capable of fastening the cover 70 to the collar
30. For example, the attachment mechanism 74 can be embodied as: a threaded
fastener; a snap lock connection (such as shown in FIGS. 39-40) and/or any other
type of attachment mechanism in accordance with the subject disclosure.
Likewise, although the cover 70 is shown engaged with the collar 30, it is to be
understood that the cover 70 may make a suitable secured connection with any
                                          22

other component on the container system 100 such as the body of the container
10.
[0087]    FIGS. 39-40 depict a snap lock fastening mechanism 74. As before, a first
portion of the complimentary attachment mechanism 74 may include a projecting
ledge 77. The projecting ledge 77 may be disposed adjacent to the open end 76 of
the cover 70 as shown in FIG. 39.
[0088]    A second portion of the complimentary attachment mechanism 74 may be
disposed on the collar 30. The second portion of the complimentary attachment
mechanism 74 may include a slight recess 78 adapted to matingly receive the
projecting ledge 77.
[0089]      It is also to be understood that the cover 70 may be constructed and
adapted for use as a feeding container. That is, a caregiver 2 can use the cover 70
as a feeding bowl by turning it upside down so that the open portion of the cover 70
faces substantially upward forming a lower closed end 75 bowl into which various
edible items may be placed. A utensil, such as a spoon or fork may be used to
scoop the edible contents from the lower closed end 75 of the cover 70 when used
inverted as a bowl or similar container. In such a use, the fastener loop 72 may be
conveniently used as a finger hole into which a caregiver, or the like, can secure
the bowl in their hand by looping a finger through the loop 72 in the cover 70.
[0090]      The cover may include various level measurement indicia (such as
measurements in teaspoon, tablespoon, cup, liter or the like) so that when used as
a bowl-like container, the caregiver can visually identify the quantity amount of an
item disposed in the cover 70 when used as a bowl.
[0091]       The illustrations and examples provided herein are for explanatory
purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. It will be
                                           23

recognized by those skilled in the art that changes or modifications may be made
to the above described embodiment without departing from the broad inventive
concepts of the invention. It is understood therefore that the invention is not limited
to the particular embodiment which is described, but is intended to cover all
modifications and changes within the scope and spirit of the invention.

        21.   An expandable container system comprising:
                     a container;
                     an expandable nipple attached to the first end of the container;
                     and
                     a removable one-way valve attached to a second end of the
container,
                     wherein when the expandable nipple is extended, a first fluid is
drawn in through the valve and a counteracting bias force is generated by the
expandable nipple, so that when the expandable nipple moves in an opposite
direction toward an unextended state, an increase in pressure created by the
counteracting bias force urges a second fluid to flow out of an outlet in the
expandable nipple.
        22.   The expandable container system in claim 21, wherein the first fluid
may also be drawn in by an infant or animal sucking on the expandable nipple
drawing the second fluid out of eth outlet in the expandable nipple.
                                           30

       23.     An expandable container system comprising:
                     a container;
                     an expandable nipple attached to the first end of the container;
                     and
                     a removable one-way valve attached to a second end of the
container,
                     wherein when the expandable nipple is extended, a first fluid is
drawn in through the valve, and
                     wherein when the expandable nipple is moved in an opposite
unextended direction, a pressure within the container is increased and urges a
second fluid to flow out of an outlet in the expandable nipple.
        24.    The expandable container system in claim 23, wherein a mouth
movement of an infant latched onto the expandable nipple in an extended and
unextended direction causes the second fluid within the container to be urged out of
the outlet in the expandable nipple.
        25.    The expandable container system in claim 23, wherein a sucking
vacuum pressure caused by a mouth of an infant latched onto the expandable nipple
further causes the second fluid within the container to be urged out of the outlet in
the expandable nipple.
