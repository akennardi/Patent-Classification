                                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
             [0002]               This specification relates to the field of vascular treatment.
Description of the Related Art
             [0003]               Sclerotherapy can be used to treat blood vessels, blood vessel
malformations, and similar problems in other body systems, such as the lymphatic system,
and has been used in various forms for over 150 years.                          In its more modem form,
sclerotherapy has been used since the 1960's, in Europe, for treating various vein
conditions such as; varicose veins, reticular veins, spider veins of the leg, and also some
fine facial veins.
             [0004]               Sclerotherapy can be used to treat these conditions by instigating
vascular fibrosis and obliteration                    in response to irreversible       endothelial cellular
destruction and exposure of the underlying subendothelial cell layer. This destruction is
usually caused by the injection of a sclerosant into the vein. However, if the injected
sclerosant is too weak, there may be no endothelial injury at all. If the sclerosant is a little
stronger, the varicose vessel is damaged, but recanalization occurs and an incompetent
pathway for retrograde blood flow persists.                      Finally, if the injected sclerosant is too
strong, the varicose vessel endothelium is destroyed, but adjacent vessels that are not
targeted for treatment may also be damaged by the sclerosant.
             [0005]               The requirement for an ideal strength of the sclerosant is complicated
by the constant flow of blood through the vein that is being treated.                             This flow
simultaneously dilutes, and thereby weakens, the sclerosant, while also transporting the
sclerosant to other parts of the vascular system.
             [00061               Thus, improved methods and devices for treating the vascular system
are desired.

                                          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
             [0007]               In one embodiment, a vascular treatment apparatus comprises an
elongated intraluminal member shaped and dimensioned for passage through blood
vessels of a subject.                 The intraluminal member may include a proximal end and a distal
end, wherein the distal end comprises a vein wall disruptor. The vein wall disrupter may
be configured to scrape tissue off of the inner wall of a blood vessel, and retain that tissue
on the disruptor during use.
             [0008]               In another embodiment, a vascular treatment apparatus comprises an
elongated intraluminal member shaped and dimensioned for passage through blood
vessels of a subject, the intraluminal member including a proximal end and a distal end,
wherein the distal end comprises a vein wall disruptor.                   The vein wall disrupter is
configured to scrape tissue off of the inner wall of a blood vessel, and comprises
structures therein forming tissue storing regions.                The structures may be cavities or
through holes.
             [0009]               In some embodiments, these apparatus may comprise a source of
sclerosant and a fluid channel between the source of sclerosant and the distal end of the
elongated intraluminal member.
             [0010]               In another embodiment, a vascular treatment method comprises
advancing an elongated intraluminal member from an access site and into the vein,
damaging the inner vessel wall by performing a defined movement of the portion of the
intraluminal member against the vein's endothelium. The damaging comprises removing
endothelium tissue from the inner vessel wall and retaining endothelium tissue on the
portion of the intraluminal member while performing the defined movement.
             [0011]               In another embodiment, a method for permanently occluding a vein
through the combined disruption of a vein vessel wall and application of a sclerosant
comprises advancing an elongated intraluminal member from an access site and into the
vein, wherein the intraluminal member has a portion thereof configured to produce
damage to the inner vessel wall of the vein under user control when performing a defined
movement, damaging the inner vessel wall by performing the defined movement of the
portion of the intraluminal member against the vein's endothelium, injecting sclerosant
into the vein and onto the damaged inner vessel wall, observing sclerosant exiting from
the access site, and stopping injection of sclerosant in response to the observing.

             [0012]               In another embodiment, a method for permanently occluding a vein
through the combined disruption of a vein vessel wall and application of a sclerosant
comprises orienting a subject with at least one extremity below their head, advancing an
elongated intraluminal member from an access site and into a vein in the at least one
extremity, wherein the intraluminal member has a portion thereof configured to produce
damage to the inner vessel wall of the vein under user control when performing a defined
movement, re-orienting the subject with the at least one extremity approximately level
with or slightly above their head, damaging the inner vessel wall by performing the
defined movement of the portion of the intraluminal member against the vein's
endothelium, and injecting sclerosant into the vein and onto the damaged inner vessel
wall. The extremity may be an arm or a leg.

                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
             [0023]                The   following    description     and   examples    illustrate preferred
embodiments of the present invention in detail. Those of skill in the art will recognize
that there are numerous variations and modifications of this invention that are
encompassed by its scope.                      Accordingly, the description of a preferred embodiment
should not be deemed to limit the scope of the present invention. In this description,
reference is made to the drawings wherein like parts are designated with like numerals
throughout.
             [0024]                Figure 1 depicts a perspective view of one embodiment of exemplary
components of a vascular treatment device 10. These components can be configured to
provide a range of functionalities to the vascular treatment device 10.                            In some
embodiments, a vascular treatment device 10 can include features configured for
stimulating vascular ablation, such as, for example, an intraluminal member 22, a
motorized drive system, including, for example, a motor, and/or control features and/or
features configured for delivering liquid sclerosant.                     In some embodiments described
further below, the intraluminal member comprises a wire surrounded by a sheath, and the
wire is rotatable within the sheath. The space between the sheath and the wire can be
used as a passage to inject sclerosant as the wire rotates, and the distal end of the wire
forms a vein wall disruptor.
             [0025]               In general, the vascular treatment device 10 of Figure 1 is utilized by
introducing the intraluminal member into a vein of a subject, where the vein is to be
ablated in a treatment for varicose veins for example.                        The distal end of the wire is
extended from the distal end of the sheath, and the wire is rotated or otherwise moved to
damage the endothelium lining the inside surface of the vein. Sclerosant is also injected
to the region of damage through the sheath that forms an outer portion of the intraluminal
member 22.                 The combination of endothelium damage plus the sclerosant provides a
                                                            -4
9743121 1 (GHMatters) P93675.AU.1

highly effective vascular ablation procedure with a minimum amount of injected
sclerosant.
             [00261               As depicted in Figure 1, a vascular treatment device can include a
handle 12 and a cartridge 14. As explained below in greater detail, each of the handle 12
and cartridge 14 can include features configured for stimulating vascular ablation and/or
for delivering liquid sclerosant.                In one embodiment, and as depicted in Figure 1, the
handle 12 and the cartridge 14 can comprise separate pieces. In another embodiment, a
handle 12 and a cartridge 14 can comprise an integrated component. A person of skill in
the art will recognize that the present disclosure is not limited to a specific configuration
of the handle 12 and cartridge 14 but broadly includes the range of functions and uses of a
vascular therapy device.
             [00271               As further depicted in Figure 1, the cartridge 14 can be, for example,
sized and shaped to engagingly connect to the handle 12. In one embodiment, and as
shown in Figure 1, this engaging connection can be achieved by fitting features of the
handle 12 to features of the cartridge 14.
             [0028]               Figure 2 depicts a side cross-section view of the vascular treatment
device 10 of Figure 1. The vascular treatment device 10 depicted in Figure 2 comprises
the same features discussed in relation to Figure 1. Referring now to both Figures 1 and
2, the cartridge 14 may include a sheath 30 affixed to and extending from the cartridge 14,
a wire 32, and a coupling 34. The wire 32 can be, for example, fixed to the coupling 34.
A person of skill in the art will recognize that the wire 32 can be affixed to the coupling
34 through a variety of techniques and methods. A person of skill in the art will further
recognize that the wire 32 can be affixed to a range of features of a vascular treatment
device 10 configured for driving the wire 32.
             [0029]               The wire 32 (and surrounding sheath) can comprise a variety of
lengths.         In some embodiments, a wire 32 can have a length matching the needs of the
procedure. In some embodiments, a wire 32 can have a length, for example, of up to 10
cm, up to 25 cm, up to 75 cm, or up to 150 cm.
             [0030]               The sheath 30 can be configured to define a lumen through which the
wire 32 runs, and can be configured to allow independent motion of the wire within the
sheath.          The sheath 30 can have a variety of inner and outer diameters. In some
embodiments, the sheath 30 can have an inner diameter ranging from approximately 0.022
inches to 0.048 inches. In some embodiments, the sheath 30 can have an outer diameter
                                                          -5
9743121 1 (GHMatters) P93675.AU.1

ranging from approximately 0.025 inches to 0.051 inches. In some embodiments, the
outer diameter of the sheath 30 can be in the range that is, for example, consistent with
the inner diameter of standard needles or vascular sheaths used for used for insertion of
vascular catheters.
             [00311                The sheath 30 may also include external markings at regular intervals
which may guide the user to monitor the insertion or removal speed of the intraluminal
member 22.
             [0032]                Some embodiments       of a vascular treatment device      10 can be
configured for use with injectant.                     In some embodiments, the cartridge 14 can be
configured for holding an injectant such as sclerosant in a syringe 36 attached to the
cartridge 14 at a coupler 28. Some embodiments of a vascular treatment device 10 and/or
a cartridge 14 configured for use in connection with an injectant can be, for example,
configured with valves and connectors to facilitate such use. In some embodiments, a
syringe 36 can, for example, connect to a stopcock 38 on a cartridge 14. The stopcock 38
shown in Figure 2 can be configured to allow the removal and/or attachment of a syringe
to the vascular treatment device 10 during a procedure. In some embodiments, a stopcock
38 can be configured to allow reloading of fluid and/or exchanging of containers to, for
example,             change the injectant or the concentration              of the injectant.    In some
embodiments, the stopcock 38 can be configured to provide additional functionality, such
as, for example, mixing or aerating the injectant. The output of the coupler 28 is in fluid
communication with the space between the sheath 30 and the wire 32 so that the injectant
can be pushed along this space to the distal end of the wire and sheath where the injectant
(e.g. sclerosant) exits the sheath when installed in the vein.
             [0033]               In use, the sheath 30 with the wire 32 inside may be introduced into the
vein prior to coupling the cartridge 14 to the handle 12. At this time, the wire 32 may be
fully enclosed by the sheath 30 as shown in Figure 2B. After introduction, the cartridge
14 can be inserted into the handle 12, and the coupler 34 can engage a mating coupler 40
in the handle. The coupler 34 in the cartridge which is attached to the wire 32 may be
slidable within the cartridge 14, so that when the coupler 34 in the cartridge is forced into
engagement with the coupler 40, the distal end of the wire 32 is pushed out of the sheath
30, as shown in Figure 2C. This exposes a portion of the wire 32 that is configured to
damage the endothelium on the inner surface of the vein. The coupler 40 in the handle 12
is attached to the shaft of a motor 42 in the handle that may rotate the coupler 40, mated
                                                            -6
9743121 1 (GHMatters) P93675.AU.1

coupler 34, and attached wire 32 to scrape and damage the inner wall of the vein. During
this process, sclerosant may be forced down the sheath, to exit the sheath in the region
near the distal end of the wire 32, as shown by arrows 46 in Figure 2C.
             [0034]               Motor rotation may be controlled by a trigger 48 in the handle that
depresses and releases a switch 50 to start and stop motor rotation. The handle 12 may
further include a power source for the motor such as battery 52.
             [0035]               The tips of the wire 32 can have a variety of configurations.     As
illustrated in Figures 2B and 2C, the distal end of the wire 32 can have a spherical ball 46
at the tip.            During rotation, this ball is the feature that does the most damage to the
endothelium on the inner vessel wall. Embodiments of vascular treatment devices such as
illustrated in Figures 1 through 2C are further described in U.S. Patents 7,862,575 and
7,967,834 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
             [0036]               Although vascular ablation treatments using the above described
vascular treatment device have shown dramatic improvement over prior vascular ablation
methods, it has been found that the configurations of the distal ends of the wire are
sometimes not optimal.                    For example, it is advantageous if the wire 32 removes and
retains endothelium as it rotates within the vein. This retention of endothelium tissue on
the wire 32 appears to increase friction and result in more complete and faster damage to
the inner wall of the vein.                   Wire tips that are configured to retain endothelium are
described further below with respect to Figures 3A through 3C.
             [0037]               As shown in Figure 3A, one embodiment of a wire 32 can have a series
of sharp edged protrusions along an extended length of the distal end of the wire 32. This
length of extension along which the protrusions are provided may extend more than 1 cm
or more than 5 cm from the tip of the wire 32. At the tip of the wire 32, a larger sharp
edged protrusion 66 can be provided. If desired, although not illustrated in Figure 3A, a
larger sharp edged protrusion can advantageously be provided at one or more bends or
comers 68 provided in the distal end of the wire 32. These sharp edges can cut and scrape
the endothelium effectively, removing additional tissue.                     The spaces between the
protrusions can retain endothelium tissue during the procedure.
             [0038]               In the embodiment of Figure 3B, an extended length of the distal end
of the wire 32 (e.g. more than 1 cm or more than 5 cm) is provided with a roughened
surface. A roughened surface may be formed by subjecting an initially smooth steel to
abrasion, machining, blasting, chemical etching such as acid etching (for example, nitric
                                                          -7
9743121 1 (GHMatters) P93675.AU.1

acid, hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and/or sulfuric acid). A roughened outer
surface may also be created by rolling onto an irregularly shaped guide to create surface
irregularity. The wire 32 of Figure 3B also comprises relatively large cavities 70 that can
retain endothelium tissue scraped off the inner vessel wall by the roughened surface.
             [0039]               In the embodiment of Figure 3C, an extended length of the distal end
of the wire 32 (e.g. more than 1 cm or more than 5 cm) is provided with sharp edged
protrusions 76, which may be formed as vanes or flanges extending from the sides of the
wire 32. In this embodiment, cavities are provided as through holes 78 that can also
retain endothelium tissue removed by the protrusions 76. It will be appreciated that any
of the protrusions, cavities, roughened surface, etc. can be combined in a variety of
manners on a single wire so that the distal end of the wire 32 is configured to both scrape
away and retain endothelium tissue from the inner vessel wall during the procedure.
Advantageously, catching and retaining of the endothelium can, in some embodiments,
improve clinical results because scraping of tissue against tissue can cause significant
abrasion to the vessel wall by increasing friction.
             [0040]               As shown in Figures 3B and 3C, the very tip of the wire 32 can be
hemispherical. Alternatively, appointed tip can be used. A hemispherical tip can also be
roughened or textured.                     The distal end of the wire 32 can also incorporate curved
segments and straight segments. A straight segment can be distal to a curved segment.
             [0041]               An ablation method can further include steps to protect against over
injection of sclerosant, into the deep system. In some embodiments, an operator can
observe the insertion point of the ablation device, and upon observing exiting sclerosant,
an operator can stop injection of additional sclerosant. This is illustrated by the procedure
of Figure 4. In this method, at block 80, the physician first advances the intraluminal
member into the vein of the subject. At block 82, the physician damages the vein and
injects sclerosant to ablate the vein as described above. At block 84, the physician stops
injection of sclerosant in response to observing sclerosant exiting the vein through the
intrlauminal member access point.                     Injection can be stopped manually, for example,
stopping pushing on the plunger of the syringe 36 of Figure 1 when sclerosant is observed
exiting the access point.                     Advantageously, this protects against over-injection of
sclerosant into the deep system, thus reducing complications of deep vein thrombosis.
             [0042]               In addition, methods of performing vessel ablation can include creating
and maintaining specific patient positioning. A patient can be, for example, tilted to
                                                           -8
9743121 1 (GHMatters) P93675.AU.1

enable access to veins and then moved to a flat position for performing the vessel
ablation. This is illustrated by the method shown in Figure 5. In this method, at block 90,
the subject is oriented with the extremity to be treated positioned below their head. This
allows easy vein access for introducing the intraluminal member into the vein at block 92.
After the intraluminal member is inserted, at block 94 the subject is re-oriented with the
extremity being treated level with or above their head. The procedure is then continued at
block 96 where the inner vein wall is damaged and sclerosant is injected as described
above.             Advantageously, a flat or slightly inclined patient position allows blood and
injectant to spill toward the untreated vein as the treated area of the vein gradually
occludes. In one embodiment for treatment of leg veins, the patient can be tilted with legs
down to facilitate vein access. The patient is then moved into a flat or only slightly head
down position. Advantageously, use of such patient positioning increases success rates
for the procedure by allowing blood and sclerosant to spill toward the untreated vein
which increases vein ablation and decreases the risk of deep vein thrombosis. In prior
vein ablation procedures, the extremity being treated was maintained in a position below
the head. The combination of vessel damage with the injection of sclerosant, however,
allows the lifting of the extremity during the procedure with improved outcomes.
             [0043]               The foregoing description details certain embodiments of the devices
and methods disclosed herein.                   It will be appreciated, however, that no matter how
detailed the foregoing appears in text, the devices and methods can be practiced in many
ways. As is also stated above, it should be noted that the use of particular terminology
when describing certain features or aspects of the invention should not be taken to imply
that the terminology is being re-defined herein to be restricted to including any specific
characteristics of the features or aspects of the technology with which that terminology is
associated.
             [0044]               It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various
modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the
described technology. Such modifications and changes are intended to fall within the
scope of the embodiments. It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that parts
included in one embodiment are interchangeable with other embodiments; one or more
parts from a depicted embodiment can be included with other depicted embodiments in
any combination. For example, any of the various components described herein and/or

             [0045]               With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms
herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or
from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The
various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.
             [0046]               It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used
herein are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be
interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as
"having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited
to," etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of
an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the
claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an
aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the
introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations.
However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction
of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim
containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such
recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or
"at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should
typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for
the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a
specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the
art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the
recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers,
typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). It will be further
understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase
presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings,
should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either
of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase "A or B" will be understood to
include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B."
