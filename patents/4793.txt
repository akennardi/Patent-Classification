 5                                     FIELD OF INVENTION
             The present invention relates to a cable junction. Reference will be made in
   the specification to the use of the invention with respect to retaining cables or cable
   connections within a wall or a ceiling. The patent specification describes this use but
    it is by way of example only and the invention is not limited to this use.

                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
             Cable junction boxes are used to house cable connections when electrical
   equipment such as down lights and motors for blinds are permanently connected to
    power cables.
 5           The power cables are typically located behind walls or ceilings requiring a
    large hole in the wall or ceiling so that the cables can be joined and the junction box
   can be placed behind the wall or ceiling.
             One way of avoiding a large hole is to join the cables behind the wall or
   ceiling, however, this requires access behind the wall or ceiling. Having the junction
 O  box behind the wall decreases the size of the hole required and provides a visually
   appealing solution.       However, this solution makes it difficult to inspection for the
    presence of a junction box.
             Another solution is to mount the junction box on the wall or ceiling, this
   decreases the size of the hole required.          However, a problem with mounting the
25 junction box on the wall or ceiling is that this is an unsightly solution.
                                   OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
             It is an object of the present invention to overcome or at least alleviate one or
    more of the above mentioned problems with cable connections and/or provide the
30 consumer with a useful or commercial choice.
