   ELECTRIC BED WITH INDEPENDENT ADJUSTING DEVICE FOR
   WAIST REST
                       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    1. Field of the Invention
 5            The present invention relates to a bed and, more particularly, to an
   electric bed.
   2. Description of the Related Art
              A conventional electric bed comprises a back board that is pivoted to
   change its inclined angle, so that the inclined angle of the back board can be
10 adjusted according to a user's requirement to provide a comfortable sensation
   to the user when lying on the electric bed. However, when the user's back rests
   on the back board, the user's waist does not have any support, so that the user
   easily feels uncomfortable. Another conventional electric bed comprises a
   back board and a waist rest. When the back board is pushed and pivoted by an
15 electric cylinder to change its inclined angle, the waist rest is also pushed and
   moved by the electric cylinder. Thus, when the electric bed is disposed at an
   inclined state, the user's waist is supported by the waist rest. However, when
   the electric bed is disposed at a horizontal state, the waist rest is also disposed
   at a horizontal state, so that the user's waist does not have any support when
20 lying down.
                      BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

             The primary objective of the present invention is to provide an
