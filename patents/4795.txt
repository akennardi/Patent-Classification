                                        BACKGROUND OF THE        INVENTION
Field of the Invention
 [0001]
                The present invention relates                  to a wiper movement detecting
device.
Description of the Related Art
 [0002]
               A wiper is            installed       in  a vehicle to wipe off rain       droplets
attached on a glass surface of a window at the rainfall.                                 The wiper
is     configured in                 such a manner as to be able to step-by-step change
a movement speed or the like                           by an operation of a driver,      but there
is     proposed a technology of automatically controlling                             the movement
of the wiper in response to a change in a rainfall state without
the operation of the driver.                             For example,   a rain     droplet sensor
is installed on the glass surface to detect an amount of rain
droplets attached on the glass surface at raining and adjust the
movement speed or the like                          of the wiper corresponding to the amount
of the rain droplets                           (for example, refer to Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 04-349053 A).
 [0003]
               During the movement of the wiper,                   however,    the rain   droplets
wiped off by the wiper move on the glass surface.                                  There are some
cases where although it                          is  raining heavily,    the rain    droplets are
wiped off from a detection area of the rain droplet sensor, or
although the raining amount is reduced, the rain droplets
concentrate on the detection area.                             In  such a case,     the detection
result            of the rain droplet sensor does not reflect                     a change in     the
rainfall state accurately.

                                                          2
                Therefore there is proposed a technology in which a pulse
signal that                      is outputted from a wiper motor is                   acquired to detect
the movement of the wiper, and the detection result is used for
determination of a change in                         the rainfall         state      (for example,  refer
to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2009-090804 A).
                                         SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0006]
               However,             for detecting the movement of the wiper in                   response
to the pulse signal outputted from the wiper motor, components such
as connectors and harnesses for connection with the wiper motor
and a device equipped with hardware and software for analyzing the
pulse signal are required, leading to an increase in costs.
 [0007]
                The present invention has an object of providing a wiper
movement detecting device that can detect a movement of a wiper
with the configuration simplified and reduced in costs.
 [0008]
               A wiper movement detecting device according to the present
invention comprises an optical sensor that is installed to face
a glass surface in                      a vehicle and detect illuminance in                    an area of
the glass surface where the wiper that                              reciprocates          along the glass
surface passes through, and a movement detecting unit configured
to detect a reduction time in which the illuminance detected by
the optical sensor temporarily reduces due to the passing of the
wiper and determine the movement of the wiper from an interval                                      cycle
based upon an interval between the reduction times.
 [0009]
               According to the present invention, the reduction time of the
illuminance caused by the passing of the wiper through the detection
area of the optical sensor can be detected, and the movement of
the wiper can be determined from the interval                                      cycle based upon the
interval between the reduction times.                                   In many cases the optical
sensor is                preliminarily       installed      in    a vehicle for lighting          control
of a headlight.                       Therefore,      for example,         in    contrast    to a case of
detecting the movement of the wiper in                               response to the pulse signal
outputted from the wiper motor, introduction                                    of special components,

hardware and software is                         not required.      Thereby it     is possible to
provide the wiper movement detecting                            device simplified     and reduced
in      costs.                Further,      from the detection result        of the movement of
the wiper, the movement of the wiper can be changed in response
to a change in                     the rainfall      state   and abnormality of the wiper can
be detected, thus improving safety and comfortableness of a vehicle.

                                DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 [0011]
               Hereinafter,              an explanation will        be made of a wiper movement
detecting device according to an embodiment of the present invention.
The wiper movement detecting device detects                                   a movement of a wiper
installed                  in    a vehicle.      First,     the wiper installed         in  the vehicle
will be explained.
               Fig. 1 is            a schematic diagram illustrating              the configuration
and movement of a wiper installed in a vehicle.
               As illustrated               in  Fig.    1,  a wiper W in      a vehicle is       provided
with a wiper arm WA that wipes off a glass surface, and a wiper
motor WM that drives the wiper arm WA.                                The wiper arm WA performs
a reciprocal movement in such a manner as to move from an initial
position P1 to a reverse position P2 while wiping off the glass
surface,                 and thereafter,          return from the reverse position                P2 back
to the initial position Pl.
 [0012]
                The wiper has a plurality                  of movement modes.        A movement speed
and an intermittent                       time of the wiper are set to differ                  depending
upon the movement mode.                           The intermittent        time is     a time provided
as a period from a reciprocal                           movement of one time to the reciprocal
movement of the next time to set the movement of the wiper to "off".
A time of a combination of a time in the reciprocal movement of
the wiper of one time and the intermittent                             time after      that   is  defined
as one cycle of the movement of the wipe.
 [0013]
               A kind of the movement mode is not limited to a particular
one,         but may include,                 for example,      "an intermittent         driving mode"
in     which the wiper performs a low-speed drive and the intermittent
time is relatively long, "a low-speed driving mode" in which the
wiper performs a low-speed drive but the intermittent time is
relatively short, "a high-speed driving mode" in which the wiper
performs a high-speed drive and the intermittent time as well is
relatively                    short, and "a successive driving mode" in which the wiper
performs a high-speed drive and the intermittent                                   time is      very few.

                                                           5
 [0014]
               A driver operates an unillustrated wiper switch to specify
the movement mode.                       Control of the movement of the wiper is           performed
by an in-vehicle                     processor CP.       The in-vehicle        processor CP outputs
a driving signal to the wiper motor WM in accordance with the
movement mode specified                         by the driver     to control the movement speed
and the intermittent                       time of the wiper.         The wiper motor WM operates
the wiper arm WA in                      response to the driving signal.             The in-vehicle
processor CP performs control of the other in-vehicle                                    facilities
as well, such as head lights,                             a navigation device and the like,
but herein, an explanation thereof is omitted.
 [0015]
               Next,            an explanation will       be made of the configuration of the
wiper movement detecting device.
               Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the wiper movement
detecting device according to the embodiment of the present
invention.
               As illustrated               in  Fig. 2,  the wiper movement detecting            device
1 is provided with a communication unit 10,                                    a sensor unit 20,       a
movement detecting unit                          50,  a movement change determining unit            80,
and a warning unit 90.
 [0016]
                The communication unit 10 makes communications with the
in-vehicle processor CP by wired or wireless.                                     The in-vehicle
processor CP, at the time of starting and stopping the movement
of the wiper,                     transmits a movement start           notice and a movement stop
notice of the wiper to the communication unit                              10.   The movement start
notice of the wiper includes a notice of the movement mode for moving
the wiper.                       In addition, as in detail described later, the
communication unit 10 transmits the determination result of the
movement change determining unit 80 to the in-vehicle processor
CP.
 [0017]
                The sensor unit               20 is  provided with an optical         sensor 30 that
measures illuminance, and a rain droplet sensor 40 that detects
rain        droplets.                Fig. 3 is    a plan view illustrating        the configuration
of the sensor unit 20.                            Fig. 4 is a diagram explaining the

configuration                        of the optical           sensor 30.       Fig.     5A is   a diagram
explaining the configuration of the rain                                      droplet sensor 40.           Fig.
5B is          a diagram explaining a detection principle                                 of rain    droplets
by the rain                    droplet sensor 40.                It   should be noted that        Fig.    4 and
Fig.         5A are diagrams as viewed from a section direction                                    of a glass
surface G on which the sensor unit 20 is attached, but for easy
understanding, the optical sensor 30 and the rain droplet sensor
40 are schematically illustrated                                    and do not conform to the optical
sensor 30 and the rain                         droplet sensor 40 in           dimension as illustrated
in Fig. 3.
 [0018]
               As illustrated in Fig. 3, the sensor unit 20 integrally
accommodates the optical                              sensor 30 and the rain             droplet sensor 40
in     the inside of a housing 21.                            The housing 21 is       formed by combining
a plate-shaped bracket 22                                and a doom-shaped cover 23.                As
illustrated in Fig. 4, the optical sensor 30                                          is provided with a
lens 33 that                     collects     visible       light      from an exterior       of the housing
21, and a front light receiving element 32 and an upper light
receiving element 33 that                              respectively        receive the visible         lights
collected by the lens 31.                                 As illustrated in Fig. 5A, the rain
droplet sensor 40 is                        provided with a light             emitting element 41 that
emits infrared light, a light receiving element 42 that receives
infrared light, and a prism 43                                   (a plate-shaped portion 43a and a
light guiding portion 43b, which will be described later).                                                  The
prism 43 guides the infrared light emitted by the light emitting
element 41 onto the glass surface G and guides the infrared                                              light
reflected on the glass surface G to the light receiving element
42.
 [0019]
               As illustrated in Fig. 3, the sensor unit 20 is configured
such that the optical sensor 30 using the visible light and the
rain droplet sensor 40 using the infrared light are accommodated
in the same housing 21.                               Therefore the optical sensor 30 and the
rain droplet sensor 40 are arranged in the inside of the housing
21 for the visible                        light       or the infrared        light      used to each other
not to interfere with the respective movements.

               As illustrated                 in   Fig. 3 and Fig. 5A,         the prism 43 in       the rain

the light                guiding portion 43b.                A rectangular through hole is             formed
in the center of the bracket 22 of the housing 21,                                             and the
plate-shaped portion 43a is fitted in the through hole.                                                The
plate-shaped portion 43a is arranged such that the attachment
surface to the light guiding portion 43b faces the inside of the
housing 21 and the surface on which the black filter is attached
is exposed to an exterior of the housing 21.                                        The light emitting
element 41 and the light                             receiving element 42 in            the rain      droplet
sensor 40 are arranged right                              under the light         guiding portion 43b.
 [0021]
               An area in              the plate-shaped portion 43a of the prism 43                       that
is near a corner thereof and is away from an attachment section
thereof to the light guiding portion 43b is punched out in a
rectangle having rounded corners.                                    The lens 31 in  the optical       sensor
30 is         fitted             in  the area.        As illustrated        in  Fig. 4,   the front light
receiving element 32 and the upper light                                     receiving element 33 are
arranged right under the lens 31.                                     The periphery of the lens 31,
the front light                       receiving element 32 and the upper light                      receiving
element 33 is                     covered with a cover member 34.                Since the black filter
is attached on the prism 43 in the rain droplet sensor 40,                                                the
infrared light only transmits through the inside of the housing
21.          The visible                light     transmits through a section of the optical
sensor 30                   in which the lens              31 is fitted, but since the optical
sensor 30 is covered with the cover member 34, the visible light
does not reach the light                           emitting element 41 and the light                receiving
element 42 in the rain droplet sensor 40.

               As illustrated                  in   Fig.   4 and Fig.       5A,  the sensor unit         20 is
attached on the glass surface G of a front window in a vehicle.
At this time, an unillustrated adhesive sheet having optical
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

                                                                 8
transparency is attached on the plate-shaped portion 43a in the
prism 43.                    The plate-shaped portion 43a is                    arranged to be in            close
contact with the glass surface G inside of the vehicle through the
adhesive sheet and to be directed                                outward of the vehicle.             The sensor
20 is         arranged in                an area where any one of a set of two wipers passes
through and in                        a position         where a range of view of a driver                 is    not
blocked.                   For example,            the sensor unit      20 may be arranged above the
front window and near a rear view mirror.
 [0023]
               Next,            an explanation will             be made of a specific         configuration
of each of the optical sensor 30 and the rain droplet sensor 40.
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the lens 31 in the optical sensor 30
configures a front-light                               light   guiding portion 31a that              guides the
visible light to the front light receiving element 32 and an
upper-light                     light     guiding portion 31b that             guides the visible            light
to the upper light receiving element 33 integrally.                                               The lens 31
uses a lens having a refraction index equivalent to that of the
glass surface G.
 [0024]
                The front-light                  light      guiding portion 31a and the upper-light
light          guiding portion 31b each have an upper surface making close
contact with the glass surface G, the upper surface being formed
of a flat               surface.           A lower surface of the front-light                  light     guiding
portion 31a positioned in the inside of the housing 21 is formed
of a convex surface,                           and the front-light          light   guiding portion 31a
forms           a convex               lens.       An optical      axis of the      front-light           light
guiding portion 31a is incident to the glass surface G from the
front side of a vehicle and travels toward the rear side of the
vehicle in                  the inside of the housing 21.                   On the other hand,           a lower
surface of the upper-light light guiding portion 31b positioned
in the inside of the housing 21 is formed of a concave surface,
and the upper-light                          light      guiding portion 31b forms a concave lens.
When an optical                        axis of the upper-light             light    guiding portion 31b
is     incident to the glass surface G from the upper side of the vehicle
and enters the inside of the housing 21, the optical axis of the
upper-light                      light    guiding portion 31b travels               in   a direction           away
from the optical                        axis of the front-light           light    guiding portion 31a.

                The front light receiving element 32 is arranged on the
optical              axis of the front-light              light     guiding portion 31a.              Thereby
the front light                       receiving element 32 receives light                  from a visual
field           range ax            (0) formed in      a conical shape in           the front         side of
the vehicle.                       The upper light       receiving element 33 is              arranged on
the optical                     axis of the upper light            guiding portion 31b.               Thereby
the upper light                       receiving element 33 receives light                  from a visual
field           range            P  (0) formed in      a conical        shape in    the upper side of
the vehicle.                       The visual    field     range a and the visual              field     range
$ are set not to overlap.                          The front      light    receiving element 32 and
the upper light receiving element 33 generate light receiving
signals                (electrical         signals)      having a level          in accordance with a
light received amount.                          That is, the optical sensor 30 detects
illuminance in the front side and illuminance in the upper side
of the vehicle by the front light                            receiving element 32 and the upper
light receiving element 33.
 [0026]
               As illustrated                in Fig.    5A,    the light     emitting element 41 in
the rain              droplet sensor 40 is            arranged such that          the emitted infrared
light is incident at a predetermined angle to the glass surface
G.         The light               receiving element 42 is             arranged on an optical             path
of the reflected infrared light for receiving the infrared light
reflected                  on the glass surface G.               A pulse signal is           input to the
light emitting element 41 from an unillustrated light emitting
control unit.                        The light emitting element 41 emits light onto a
detection face D for each predetermined cycle defined by the pulse
signal.                 When rain        droplets S and the like            are not attached on the
detection face D, the infrared                            light     emitted by the light             emitting
element 41 is                      guided by the light          guiding portion 43b of the prism
43,        reaches the glass surface G through the plate-shaped portion
43a, and is reflected on the detection face D in a predetermined
size on the glass surface G.                            The reflective        light   reflected         on the
detection face D,                        travels through the plate-shaped portion 43a,
and is           guided to the light              receiving element 42 by the light                   guiding
portion 43b through the plate-shaped portion 43a.                                           The light
receiving element 42 generates a light                               receiving signal (electrical
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

signal) having a level                     in   accordance with the light       received amount.
 [0027]
               As illustrated in Fig. 5B, When the rain droplets S are
attached on the detection face D,                          since the light emitted by the
light emitting element 41 is partially dispersed by the rain
droplets S, the light                    received amount of the light          receiving element
42 reduces in accordance with the amount of the rain droplets S
attached on the detection face D.                          Accordingly the light        receiving
element 42 provides output of a level                          differing      depending upon the
rain droplets S attached on the detection face D.                                  At this time,
as the amount of rain droplets attached on the detection face D
is the larger, an output value of the light receiving element 42
is the smaller, and therefore the amount of the rain droplets
attached on the detection face D can be detected based upon the
output value of the light receiving element 42.
 [0028]
                It      should be noted that          since the sensor unit        20 integrally
provided with the optical sensor 30 and the rain droplet sensor
40 is used herein, the configuration of the rain droplet sensor
40 as well is                     explained.      However,  in   the embodiment,      an example
of using only the output value of the optical sensor 30 for the
processing of the wiper movement detecting device 1 will be
explained.                      Accordingly the sensor unit        20 may be configured to use
the optical sensor 30 alone.
 [0029]
               As illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5A, a substrate 24 is
installed in the inside of the housing 21 of the sensor unit 20.
Although omitted in illustration, a processor, a memory, a
communication circuit and the like are arranged on the substrate
24.          When the processor executes a program stored in the memory,
a functional configuration of the wiper movement detecting device
1 illustrated in Fig. 1 is realized.                               The memory further stores
information required for the processing of the wiper movement
detecting device 1.                     It    should be noted that       although herein omitted
in illustration, the processor of the sensor unit 20 may realize
a functional configuration other than the wiper movement detecting
device 1.                    For example,      the processor may determine necessity             for

the lighting of the headlight based upon the output value of the
optical sensor 30.                       In addition, the processor for realizing the
functional configuration of the wiper movement detecting device
1 is not necessarily the processor installed on the substrate 24
in the sensor 20, but may be a processor different therefrom or
may be composed of a combination of the processor in the sensor
20 and another processor.
 [0030]
                The movement detecting unit               50 in Fig.  2 detects    a movement
of the wiper based upon the illuminance detected by the optical
sensor 30.                       The movement detecting unit 50 uses the illuminance
detected by the front light                        receiving element 32 out of the front
light receiving element 32 and the upper light receiving element
33 in          the optical             sensor 30.    When the movement detecting unit      50
receives a movement start                      notice of the wiper from the in-vehicle
processor CP, the movement detecting unit 50                             detects a time
 (hereinafter, referred to as "reduction time") in which the
illuminance detected by the optical                         sensor 30 temporarily reduces
due to the passing of the wiper.                          The movement detecting unit 50
determines the movement of the wiper from an interval                             cycle based
upon an interval between the detected reduction times.
 [0031]
                Specifically the movement detecting unit 50 measures an
interval                cycle between one reduction time and a reduction time ahead
of two reduction times therefrom and calculates                        a difference between
the measured interval                      cycle and a reference movement cycle of the
wiper.                In     a case where the difference between the interval           cycle
and the reference movement cycle is                       equal to or less   than a threshold,
the movement detecting unit                       50 determines that    the wiper is  moving.
 [0032]
                In a case where the movement detecting unit                50 determines that
the wiper is moving, the movement detecting unit 50 inputs the
calculated difference to the movement change determining unit 80
as a delay time.                       In a case where the movement detecting unit 50
cannot determine that                      the wiper is    moving,  the movement detecting
unit 50 inputs the determination result to the warning unit 90.

                                                           12
               Also in            a case where the movement detecting unit            50 receives
the movement stop notice of the wiper from the in-vehicle                               processor
CP, the movement detecting unit 50 performs the determination of
the movement of the wiper.                          In   a case where the movement detecting
unit 50 performs the determination of the movement of the wiper
after          receiving the movement stop notice of the wiper, the movement
detecting unit 50 inputs the determination result to the warning
unit 90.
 [0034]
               When the warning unit 90 receives input from the movement
detecting unit                      50,    the warning unit      90 generates a warning signal
of communicating abnormality of the wiper.                                The generated warning
signal is transmitted to the in-vehicle processor CP through the
communication circuit.                           When the in-vehicle      processor CP receives
the warning signal, the in-vehicle processor CP communicates the
abnormality of the wiper to a driver.                             The form of the communicating
is not limited to a particular one, but, for example, a lamp may
be provided to communicate the abnormality of the wiper to switch
on the lamp.                      Alternatively,       the notice of the abnormality of the
wiper may be displayed on a display of the navigation device.
Further, instead of transmitting the warning signal to the
in-vehicle processor CP, the wiper movement detecting device 1
itself            may be provided with,               for example,     a lamp or a buzzer sound
as the warning unit                        90 to communicate the abnormality by lightening
on the lamp or sounding the buzzer.                                The lamp or buzzer may be
installed in the housing 21 of the sensor unit 20,                                  for example.
 [0035]
                The movement change determining unit                    80 determines necessity
of a change of the wiper movement based upon the delay time that
is input by the movement detecting unit 50.                                 The movement change
determining unit 80 transmits the determination result to the
in-vehicle                    processor CP.       The in-vehicle      processor CP performs the
change of the movement of the wiper,                               and the like   based upon the
determination result of the movement change determining unit 80.
The change in                    the movement may include a change in           a movement speed,
a change in                     a movement mode,       a stop of the movement of the wiper,
and the like.

wiper is received from the in-vehicle processor CP                                       (step S101),
the movement detecting unit                          50 starts      the processing of detecting
the movement of the wiper.
                The movement detecting unit 50 refers to the illuminance
outputted by the front light receiving element 32 of the optical
sensor 30 in                     the sensor unit       20 for detecting the movement of the
wiper.
 [0037]
               Fig.7 is a graph illustrating an example of a change in an
output value of the optical                         sensor 30 by the movement of the wiper.
A solid               line       in  the graph in     Fig.    7 indicates     the output value of
the optical sensor 30.                          A broken line in a lower side in Fig. 7
indicates                  a pulse signal outputted from the wiper motor WM at the
time of driving the wiper.                         When the pulse signal is         "on",   the wiper
performs a reciprocal                       movement indicated          in Fig. 1.   When the pulse
signal is "off", that period is an intermittent time in the
reciprocal movement.
 [0038]
               On the other hand, by referring to the output value of the
optical               sensor 30,        a time (t1, t2, t3,         t4) in   which the illuminance
temporarily reduces appears intermittently and repeatedly during
the movement of the wiper.                           As illustrated        in  Fig.  1,   at the time
the wiper moves, the wiper passes through the detection area DA
of the optical                      sensor 30.     At the passing of the wiper,             the light
in     the detection area DA is                     temporarily blocked,           which causes the
illuminance as well detected by the optical sensor 30 to be
temporarily reduced.                          When the wiper continues to move, the time
in which the illuminance temporarily reduces is intermittently
successive.

               Here,            by referring       to the pulse signal of the wiper motor WM,
a time by a combination of an "on" time ONT1 and an "off" time OFFT
of the pulse signal is                          equal to a movement cycle WT of the wiper.
On the other hand,                        by referring      to the output value of the optical
sensor 30,                    the reduction time of the illuminance appears twice
during the "on" time of the pulse signal.                                 The wiper passes through
the detection area DA of the optical                               sensor 30 twice during a period
of reciprocating between an initial position P1 and a reverse
position P2.                      Therefore the reduction time of the illuminance
appears twice during the "on" time of one time.                                 An interval    between
a first reduction time t1 appearing in one                                    "on" time ONT1 and a
first reduction time t3 appearing in the next "on" time ONT2                                          is
the same as the movement cycle WT of the wiper.
 [0040]
                That is,           the reduction time of the illuminance of the optical
sensor 30                   is detected, a cycle of the interval                   (interval cycle)
between a reduction time and a reduction time ahead of two reduction
times therefrom is                         measured,      and it    is  determined whether or not
the interval                     cycle corresponds to the movement cycle of the wiper,
thus making it possible to determine whether or not the wiper is
moving.
 [0041]
               As the specific               processing,        when the movement detecting unit
50 receives the movement start notice of the wiper                                        (step S101),
the movement detecting unit                             50 detects     the reduction time in     which
the illuminance temporarily reduces by the passing of the wiper,
based upon the output value of the optical                                  sensor 30     (step S102)
 [0042]
               An example of factors for causing a reduction of the
illuminance of the optical                            sensor 30 may include factors         other than
the passing of the wiper,                           such as a change in      the weather,     a travel
through a tunnel,                        or the like.        Therefore the reduction time          (for
example,                5ms) of the illuminance or the reduction rate                    (for example,
20%)         of the illuminance at the passing of the wiper,                              and the like
are preliminarily found by measurement experiments, simulations
or the like, which are                            stored as thresholds in a memory.              The
movement detecting unit                          50 performs detection of the reduction time

by comparing the illuminance outputted by the optical sensor 30
as needed with the threshold.
 [0043]
               When the movement detecting unit                50 detects    the reduction time
 (step S102:                     Yes),  an interval cycle in regard to the detected
reduction time is measured.                           When the movement detecting unit 50
measures an interval                       between the first    detected reduction time and
a reduction time ahead of two reduction times therefrom,                                 next the
movement detecting unit                        50 measures an interval       between the second
detected reduction time and a reduction time ahead of two reduction
times therefrom.                        In this way, the movement detecting unit 50
performs the measurement                          of the interval cycle by measuring the
interval                between the detected reduction time and the reduction time
ahead of the two reduction times therefrom sequentially.
 [0044]
                In      a case where the movement detecting unit                50 compares the
measured interval                       cycle with the reference movement cycle and the
difference is                      equal to or less     than a threshold      (step S104:      Yes),
it is        determined that               the wiper is moving (step S105) .       The reference
movement cycle is                       a reference    value of the movement cycle of the
wiper.                The reference movement cycle is preliminarily determined
by measurement experiments,                         simulations or the like,     which is    stored
in      the memory.                  Since the movement cycle of the wiper differs                 for
each movement mode,                       the reference movement cycle is         also provided
for each movement mode.                          The movement detecting unit 50 acquires
a reference movement cycle corresponding to the movement mode
indicated in the movement start                         notice of the wiper from the memory.
The threshold used for comparison in the difference between the
interval                cycle and the reference movement cycle indicates                a maximum
allowance value of an error between the reference movement cycle
and an actual movement cycle of the wiper.                                As described before,
the movement speed and the intermittent time of the wiper are
preliminarily                      set to constant values in accordance with the movement
mode.             When the movement speed and the intermittent                  time are always
constant,                  the interval       cycle becomes constant.         However an actual
movement speed of the wiper on the glass surface G is                           not necessarily
constant,                  and as a result,        in some cases the interval       cycle is      not
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

                                                        16
constant either.
 [0045]
               As a factor causing the above, there is a change in a state
of the glass surface G caused by a rainfall state.                                   For example,
when a rainfall                   becomes heavy and the glass surface G is           sufficiently
wet because of rain                      droplets,    there is   a tendency that         a friction
between the glass surface G and the wiper arm WA becomes smaller
and the movement speed of the wiper becomes faster.                                 In   this     case,
the interval cycle between the reduction times becomes shorter.
On the other hand,                      when a rainfall     becomes    lighter      and an amount
of rain              droplets on the glass surface G becomes                   smaller,      there is
a tendency that the friction between the glass surface G and the
wiper arm WA increases and the movement speed of the wiper becomes
slower.                 In this case, the interval cycle between the reduction
times is also longer.
 [0046]
                In      this     way,  the change in     the state    of the glass surface G
causes the error between the interval cycle and the reference
movement cycle.                     However,   abnormality of the wiper motor WM as well
possibly causes an increase in a difference between the interval
cycle and the reference movement cycle.                              When there occurs the
abnormality in the wiper motor WM, the wiper possibly moves in a
speed that is very different                          from the movement speed set in the
movement mode.                     Therefore a range in the change of the interval                cycle
caused by the change in the state of the glass surface G is
preliminarily measured to be found, and a maximum value of the
difference between the range of the interval                          cycle and the reference
movement cycle is                     set as a threshold.      In  addition,     in   a case where
the difference between the interval                        cycle and the reference movement
cycle is               equal to or less      than the threshold, the movement detecting
unit         50 determines that              the wiper is    moving.      By such a setting          of
the threshold, the movement detecting unit                            50 determines not only
whether or not the wiper is                     moving but also whether or not the wiper
is normally moving according to the movement mode.
 [0047]
                In addition, caused by a factor other than the movement of
the wiper, singly the difference between the interval cycle and

                                                           17
the reference movement cycle is                            possibly equal to or less           than the
threshold.                        Further,    in   such a case as to pass under a bridge beam,
the state                 where the difference between the interval                  cycle and the
reference movement cycle is equal to or less than the threshold
is     possibly successive in                        a short time.   Therefore the movement of
the wiper may be determined by performing the comparison between
the measurement of the interval cycle and the reference movement
cycle by a predetermined number of times                                (for example,      30 times).
In      the comparison of the predetermined number of times,                                 in   a case
where the difference between the interval                                cycle and the reference
movement cycle is all equal to or less than the threshold, the
movement detecting unit                           50 may determine that     the wiper is        moving.
In addition, in                     the predetermined number of times, when a percentage
in which the difference between the interval                              cycle and the reference
movement cycle is                      equal to or less     than the threshold is,       for example,
approximately 80%, the movement detecting unit 50 may determine
that the wiper is moving.
 [0048]
               At step S105, in a case where the movement of the wiper is
determined,                      the interval       cycle measured at step S103 indicates             an
actual movement cycle of the wiper.                            That is,   the difference between
the interval cycle and the reference movement cycle indicates a
delay time                     of the wiper.          However,  a  case where the       difference
between the interval cycle and the reference movement cycle
indicates                  the delay time of the wiper is             a case where the interval
cycle is                longer than the reference movement cycle.                    In    some cases
the interval cycle is shorter than the reference movement cycle
depending upon the state                           of the glass surface G, but in          that    case,
there occurs no delay in                            the movement of the wiper.        Therefore in
a case where the interval                         cycle is  longer than the reference movement
cycle (step S106: Yes),                          the movement detecting unit       50 outputs the
difference calculated at step S105 to the movement change
determining unit                       80 as the delay time       (step S107) .   In    a case where
the interval cycle is shorter than the reference movement cycle
 (step S106: No),                     the movement detecting unit           50 outputs the delay
time to the movement change determining unit                              80 as zero (step S108)

                In a case where the movement of the wiper cannot be determined
in     the movement detecting                  unit   50,  that   is,   in a case where at step
S102 the reduction time is                      not detected,       or in  a case where at step
S104 the difference between the interval cycle and the reference
movement cycle goes beyond the threshold, although the movement
start          notice of the wiper is             received from the in-vehicle          processor
CP, there is a possibility that the wiper does not move or does
not normally move according to the movement mode.                                   The movement
detecting unit                     50 outputs the determination result            to the warning
unit 90.
 [0050]
                The movement change determining unit                   80 determines a movement
change of the wiper based upon the delay time that                              is   input by the
movement detecting unit 50                          (step S109).
               As described before, when the rainfall becomes lighter and
the amount of rain                     droplets on the glass surface G becomes smaller,
there is a tendency that the friction between the glass surface
G and the wiper arm WA increases and the movement speed of the wiper
becomes slower.                      In  this case,   the delay time also becomes longer.
That is, a length of the delay time becomes a reference for
determination of stopping the wiper or reducing
   a speed of the wiper.
 [0051]
               A specific            determination reference of the movement change is
not limited to a particular one, but may be set optionally.                                    For
example,                in     a case where the delay time of the wiper is            longer than
a predetermined threshold,                       the wiper may be stopped.            Further,  by
step-by-step providing thresholds,                            determination of not only the
stop of the wiper but also the change in                              the movement mode or the
like may be performed.
 [0052]
                In      addition,       for example,    a delay time map as illustrated         in
Fig. 8 is                stored in      the memory, and the movement change determining
unit         80 may determine the change in                  the movement mode by referring
to the delay time map.
               As illustrated in Fig. 8, the delay time map defines a
relationship between a delay time of the wiper and a wiper delay

level.                The wiper delay level is an index for step-by-step
evaluating a level of the delay time in the wiper.                                       The movement
change determining unit 80 specifies to which wiper delay level
the delay time that is input by the movement detecting unit 50
corresponds in                      the delay time map.         The movement change determining
unit         80 specifies               the wiper delay level         as "1"  in    a case where the
delay time is                      20ms,  and specifies        the wiper delay level         as "5"    in
a case where                      the delay time is        90ms,    for example.        The movement
change determining unit 80 may determine, for example, stopping
the wiper in                     a case where the wiper delay level             corresponds to "8"
or more, reducing a speed of the wiper in a case where the wiper
delay level corresponds to from "4"                                to less than "8",        and not
changing the movement of the wiper in                              a case where the wiper delay
level corresponds to less than "3".
 [0053]
                The movement change determining unit                     80,   in   a case where the
stop of the movement of the wiper or the change in the speed of
the wiper is                     determined,   transmits the determination result               to the
in-vehicle processor CP through the communication unit 10.                                          The
in-vehicle processor CP performs control of stopping the output
of a driving signal to the wiper motor WM to stop the wiper.                                           In
addition, at the time of stopping the wiper,                               a movement stop notice
of the wiper is transmitted to the communication unit 10 in the
wiper movement detecting device 1.
 [0054]
                The movement detecting unit 50 repeats the processing from
step S102 to step S109 until receiving the movement stop notice
of the wiper                       (step S110: No).       The movement       detecting unit       50
executes the determination processing of the movement in                                    the wiper
for a predetermined time                         (step Sll)        upon receiving the movement
stop notice                      of the wiper     (step S110:       Yes) .   As    indicated in     the
movement stop notice of the wiper, this is because of confirming
that        the movement of the wiper is                  normally stopped.            The processing
of the determination is                       as similar        to step S102 to step S105.           The
movement detecting unit                        50,    in a case where it        is   determined that
the movement of the wiper is stopped                                 (step Sll:       No),  ends the
processing.                       On the other hand,        in   a  case where the movement

detecting unit                      50 determines that      the wiper is        moving   (step Sill:
Yes),           since the movement of the wiper is not                          stopped regardless
of receiving the movement stop notice of the wiper from the
in-vehicle processor CP, there is a possibility that abnormality
occurs in                 the wiper motor WM.         In this     case,     the movement detecting
unit 50 outputs the determination result to the warning unit 90.
 [0055]
                In step S102,             S104 or S111, in a case where the movement
detecting unit                      50 outputs the determination result              to the warning
unit         90,        the warning unit         90 generates a warning signal,             which is
transmitted to the in-vehicle processor CP through the
communication unit 10                         (step S112).
 [0056]
               As described above, the wiper movement detecting device 1
according to the embodiment is provided with:
                 (1)      the optical       sensor 30 that    is    installed     to face the glass
surface G in a vehicle and detect illuminance in an area of the
glass surface G where the wiper that                            reciprocates        along the glass
surface G passes through, and the movement detecting unit 50
configured to detect a reduction time in which the illuminance
detected by the optical                        sensor 30 temporarily reduces due to the
passing of the wiper and determine the movement of the wiper from
an interval cycle based upon an interval between the reduction
times.
 [0057]
               When the wiper passes through the detection area DA of the
optical sensor 30,                       the reduction time in which the detection
illuminance temporarily reduces appears intermittently.                                       This
reduction time is                      detected,    and the movement of the wiper can be
determined from the interval                        cycle based upon the interval            between
the reduction times.                         In many cases the optical sensor 30 is
preliminarily installed in a vehicle for lighting control of a
headlight.                       Therefore,   for example,       in   contrast     to a  case of
detecting the movement of the wiper from the pulse signal outputted
from the wiper motor WM, introduction of components such as
connectors and wire harnesses, hardware and software is                                 not required.
Thereby it is possible to provide the wiper movement detecting
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

                                                        21
device simplified                       and reduced    in  costs.   Further,     from the
detection of the wiper movement,                          the movement of the wiper can be
changed in response to a change in the rainfall                        state   and abnormality
of the wiper can be detected, thus improving safety and
comfortableness of a vehicle.
 [0058]
                 (2)      The movement detecting unit         50 performs the determination
of the movement in                     the wiper in  response to the movement start       notice
of the wiper that                    is  input from the in-vehicle     processor CP (control
device)               that        controls the movement of the wiper,          and is  provided
with the warning unit                       90 configured to communicate abnormality of
the wiper in                    a case where the movement of the wiper is       not determined
by the movement detecting unit 50.
 [0059]
                In a case where the movement detecting unit 50 cannot
determine the movement of the wiper although the movement start
notice of the wiper is                       input from the in-vehicle       processor CP,     the
abnormality of the wiper motor WM is                           assumed to occur.      In  such a
case,          a driver            can quickly recognize the abnormality of the wiper
by outputting a warning.
 [0060]
                 (3)       In    a case where the movement of the wiper is           determined
by the movement detecting unit 50 after the movement stop notice
of the wiper is input from the in-vehicle processor CP, there is
provided the warning unit                         90 configured to communicate the
abnormality of the wiper.
 [0061]
                In a case where the wiper is              moving although the movement stop
notice of the wiper is                       input from the in-vehicle       processor CP,     the
abnormality of the wiper motor WM is                           assumed to occur.      In  such a
case,          a driver            can quickly recognize the abnormality of the wiper
by outputting a warning.
 [0062]
                 (4) The movement detecting unit 50 determines the movement
of the wiper based upon an interval                         cycle between a reduction time
and a reduction time ahead of two reduction times therefrom.

                The wiper passes through the detection area DA twice in                            one
time of the movement cycle in                        which the wiper reciprocates              on the
glass surface G.                       Therefore an interval       cycle between a reduction
time and a reduction time ahead of two reduction times therefrom
becomes equal to the movement cycle of the wiper.                                  In  this   way,  it
is possible to easily determine the movement of the wiper based
upon the interval cycle between the reduction times
 [0064]
                 (5)      The movement detecting unit           50 determines that          the wiper
is     moving in                 a case where the difference between the interval               cycle
and the reference movement cycle is                         equal to or less      than a threshold,
and the wiper movement detecting device 1 is provided with the
warning unit                      90 configured to communicate the abnormality of the
wiper in a case where the difference between the interval cycle
and the reference movement cycle goes beyond the threshold.
 [0065]
                In a case where the difference between the interval cycle
between the calculated                       reduction times and the reference movement
cycle is                excessively large,        it  is    not due to the delay by a change
in a rainfall state, but there is a high possibility that the
abnormality occurs in                      the wiper motor WM.         In  such a case,      a driver
can quickly recognize the abnormality of the wiper by outputting
a warning.
 [0066]
                 (6)      The movement detecting unit           50 determines that          the wiper
is     moving in                 a case where the difference between the interval               cycle
and the reference movement cycle is                         equal to or less      than a threshold,
and the wiper movement detecting device 1 is                              further     provided with
the movement change determining unit                           80 that     determines necessity
of a change in a movement of the wiper based upon the difference
 (delay time) between the interval                         cycle and the reference movement
cycle.                Specifically the movement change determining unit 80
determines a stop of the movement of the wiper in                                 a case where the
difference (delay time) between the interval                             cycle and the reference
movement cycle is longer than a predetermined time.
 [0067]
               When the glass surface G is              fully   wet with rain      droplets, there
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

                                                       23
is a tendency that the movement speed of the wiper becomes fast
as a result of a function of water as a lubricant.                                 On the other
hand,          when the rain              droplets reduce in  amounts,      there is a tendency
that the movement speed of the wiper becomes slow as a result of
an increase in                     a friction    between the wiper and the glass surface
G.         That is,              when the amount of the rain      droplets attached on the
glass surface G reduces due to a change in the rainfall state or
the like,                 the interval        time gets longer in    response to the reduced
amount to make the difference between the interval time and the
reference movement cycle larger, thus increasing the delay time
of the wiper.
 [0068]
               Accordingly it is possible to determine a change in the
rainfall state that gives an influence on the amount of the rain
droplets to be attached on the glass surface G by calculating                                the
delay time of the wiper.                          It is possible to perform an accurate
control of the wiper by determining the necessity of the change
in      the wiper movement such as stopping or slowing the movement of
the wiper based upon the change in the rainfall state.
 [0069]
                 (7)      The reference movement cycle is         preliminarily      determined
in accordance with a plurality of movement modes each having a
movement speed and an intermittent                        time of the wiper differing       from
each other.                      The movement start     notice of the wiper that       is input
from the in-vehicle                        processor CP includes a notice of the movement
mode for causing the wiper to be moved.                        The movement detecting unit
50 calculates a difference between a reference movement cycle in
accordance with the movement mode indicated by the movement start
notice of the wiper and an interval cycle.
 [0070]
               By preliminarily               determining the reference movement cycle in
accordance with the movement mode,                         the movement detecting unit         50
can perform comparison with the interval                         cycle using the reference
movement cycle in accordance with the movement mode and can
accurately detect the abnormality of the wiper or can calculate
the delay time accurately.

                 (8) The optical sensor 30 is provided with the front light

vehicle and the upper light receiving element 33 that detects
illuminance above the vehicle,                            and the movement detecting unit         50
determines the movement of the wiper by detecting a reduction time
of the illuminance detected by the front light receiving element
32.
 [0072]
               As described before,                  in many cases the optical       sensor 30 is
preliminarily                      installed     in the vehicle for lighting      control of the
headlight.                       Some of the optical sensors 30 that are used for the
lighting control of the headlight each include the front light
receiving element 32 and the upper light receiving element 33.
Quick detection is made possible by using only the front light
receiving element 32 out of the two light receiving elements for
detection of the movement of the wiper.

                 [Modification 1]
                In the embodiment,               the necessity     of the change in  the movement
of the wiper is determined based upon only the delay time of the
wiper calculated from the output value of the optical sensor 30.
In     the modification 1,                     there will      be explained an example in      which
an amount of rain                         droplets  (water) wiped off by the wiper is          found
from an output value of the rain                              droplet sensor 40,    and necessity
of a change in the movement of the wiper is determined by a
combination with the delay time.                                The rain droplet sensor 40 is,
as explained in                       the embodiment,       accommodated in   the housing 21 of
the sensor unit 20 to be integral with the optical sensor 30.

based upon an output value of the light receiving element 42 of
the rain droplet sensor 40.

 [0075]
               Fig.           10 is  a graph illustrating        an example of a change in        the
output value of the light                       receiving element 42 in         the rain    droplet
sensor 40.
               When the wiper passes through the detection face D (refer                            to
Fig. 5B)               of the rain        droplet sensor 40 set on a surface of the glass
surface G, rain                     droplets attached on the detection face D are wiped
off by the wiper for a reflection                         condition of light     on the detection
face D to largely                     change.     Therefore the output value of the light
receiving element 42 largely                            changes at the passing of the wiper.
 [0076]
                In a case of Fig. 10,            a change in      the output value of the light
receiving element 42 within a dotted-line                              frame indicated in        each
of codes AandB shows the passingofthe                             wiper.    As described before,
the wiper reciprocates between the initial position P1 and the
reverse position                      P2.   The change in       the output value of the light
receiving element 42 within the dotted-line                              frame indicated in       the
code A is                 a change due to the movement             (forward movement)     from the
initial               position        P1 to the reverse position          P2 of the wiper.        The
change in                 the output value of the light            receiving element 42 within
the dotted-line frame indicated in the code B is a change due to
the movement                     (backward movement) from the reverse position P2 to
the initial position P1 of the wiper.
 [0077]
                The wiper moves while scraping together rain droplets
attached on the glass surface G.                             Therefore the output value of the
light receiving element 42 at the passing of the wiper on the
detection face D once reduces by the scraped water, and abruptly
increases at a point where the wiping-off of the rain                                 droplets is
completed by the passing of the wiper.                             Accordingly the output value
in     a point indicated by a code "a"                     is an output value when the scraped
water is                positioned on the detection face D.                 The output value in
a point indicated by a code "b" is                         an output value when the wiping-off
is completed.
 [0078]
               Here, since a difference                     (indicated in a code "C"       in the
figure) between the output value in                           a point "a"   and the output value

in a point "b"                       is substantially equivalent to the amount of the
water wiped off by the wiper,                            when the amount of rain      droplets is
found based upon the output value in                            a point indicated in       the code
"a",         the amount of the water wiped off by the wiper is                         found out.
 [0079]
                The wiper water measuring unit 70 determines the minimum
output value                     (indicated in       the code "a"   in the figure)      out of the
output values of the light receiving element 42 at the forward
movement of the wiper as an evaluation value, and compares the
determined evaluation value with an evaluation value at the forward
movement of the wiper performed one time before.
 [0080]
                In      a case where the evaluation value of this                time is       larger
than the evaluation value of the previous time                                (in a case where
the amount of the water wiped off by the wiper is reduced),                                        a
difference in the evaluation value is found by subtracting the
evaluation value of the previous time from the evaluation value
of this             time.          The wiper wiped water map stored in        an unillustrated
memoryunit is                     referred    to based upon the founddifference to specify
the amount of the water wiped off by the wiper.
 [0081]
               Fig.           11 is    an explanatory diagram explaining the wiper wiped
water map.
                In the wiper wiped water map, a relation between a change
amount of an evaluation value at the wiper passing and an amount
of water wiped off by the wiper is                            defined, and finding the change
amount of the evaluation value at the wiper passing enables a level
of the amount of water wiped off by the wiper                             (wiper water level)
to be specified.                          For example, in a case where the change amount
is 100, the wiper water level is specified as "3",                                 and in a case
where the change amount is                          300,   the wiper water level    is   specified
as "9".
 [0082]
                The wiper water measuring unit 70 generates wiped-water
information indicative                         of the wiper water level   when the wiper water
level         of the amount of the water wiped off by the wiper is                     specified.
The wiper water measuring unit                           70 outputs the generated wiped-water
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

                                                         27
information to the movement change determining unit 80.
 [0083]
                The movement change determining unit 80,                           as similar to the
embodiment,                     uses the delay time map illustrated              in Fig. 8 to specify
the wiper delay level from the delay time that is input by the
movement detecting unit 50.                           In the modification 1, the movement
change determining unit 80 further uses a correction coefficient
map stored in the memory to specify a wiper stop correction
coefficient from the wiper delay level.
 [0084]
               Fig 12 is an explanatory diagram explaining the correction
coefficient map.
                The correction coefficient                 map defines a relation                 between a
wiper delay level and a wiper stop correction coefficient.                                                The
wiper stop correction coefficient                           is a coefficient           for determining
necessity                  of the stop of the wiper movement.                   The movement change
determining unit 80                       specifies to which wiper stop correction
coefficient the specified wiper delay level corresponds in the
correction coefficient                        map.    The movement change determining unit
80 specifies                     the wiper stop correction coefficient                 as "1"      in a case
where the wiper delay level is "5",                              for example.
 [0085]
               Here, in the embodiment, a case where the wiper stop
correction coefficient is "3" indicates that the glass surface G
is      dry,         a case where the wiper stop correction coefficient                               is  "2"
indicates that the glass surface G is substantially dry, a case
where the wiper stop correction coefficient                                  is   "1"    indicates       that
the glass surface G is a little wet,                               and a case where the wiper
stop correction coefficient                        is  "0" indicates       that     the glass surface
G is sufficiently wet.
 [0086]
                In      a case where the delay time is               equal to or more than 64ms
 (the wiper delay level                    is  equal to or more than "4"),            it   is   determined
that         a substantial             delay is    generated in       the movement speed of the
wiper to set the wiper stop correction coefficient                                        to be equal to
or more than "1".                       It   should be noted that in the correction
coefficient map, in a case where the level of the delay time is
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

                                                                 28
less        than "3", the wiper stop correction coefficient                            is  set to become
"0".           This is              because of preventing an error            of the detection result
in the optical sensor 30 from affecting the determination in the
movement change determining unit 80.
 [0087]
                The movement change determining unit                         80 determines necessity
of a change in                       the movement of the wiper,            based upon the wiper stop
correction coefficient                            specified        based upon the delay time and the
wiped water information that                                is   input by the wiper water measuring
unit 70.                   In an example shown herein, the movement change
determining unit 80                          determines the necessity of a stop in the
movement of the wiper.                              The movement change determining unit 80
determines the necessity                             of the stop in       the movement of the wiper
by referring to a determination map stored in the memory.
 [0088]
               Fig. 13 is an explanatory diagram explaining the
determination map.
                The determination map defines a threshold of a wiper water
level           for determining the stop of the movement of the wiper,                                  for
each of wiper stop correction coefficients.
 [0089]
                In the determination map, as the wiper stop correction
coefficient                      is   the larger,        the threshold of the wiper water level
for determining the stop of the movement of the wiper is defined
to be the                   larger.        For example,            in a case where the wiper stop
correction coefficient is "0",                                    the threshold of the wiper water
level is "2",                        and in a case where the wiper stop correction
coefficient                      is   "1",  the threshold of the wiper water level                is  "4".
In      a case where the wiper stop correction coefficient                                    is "3",   the
threshold of the wiper water level is "16".
 [0090]
                The movement change determining unit 80                            refers to this
determination map to compare the wiper water level indicated by
the wiped water information that is input by the wiper water
measuring unit                        70 with the threshold defined in            the specified      wiper
stop correction coefficient.                                   The movement change determining unit
80 determines the stop of the wiper in                                  a case where the wiper water
9726863_1 (GHMatters) P107378.AU

                                                        29
level          is       less      than the threshold.      For example,       in  a case where the
wiper water level                      is "3"  and the wiper stop correction coefficient
is     "1", since the wiper water level                    is less than "4"       of the threshold
indicated in                     the determination map, the movement change determining
unit 80 determines the stop of the movement of the wiper.
 [0091]
               By defining the determination map in                  this       way, the amount of
the water to be attached on the glass surface G is reduced, and
as the delay time of the movement of the wiper is the longer                                        (as
the stop correction coefficient                         is  the larger),        even if  the amount
of the water to be wiped off by the wiper is                            the larger       (the wiper
water level                    is  the higher),   the stop of the wiper tends to be easily
determined.
 [0092]
                In a case where the movement change determining unit 80
determines the stop of the movement of the wiper, the movement change
determining unit 80 transmits the determination result to the
in-vehicle processor CP through the communication unit 10.                                         The
in-vehicle processor CP performs control of stopping output of a
driving signal to the wiper motor WM to stop the wiper.
 [0093]
                In this           way, in the modification 1, the necessity           of the change
in      the movement of the wiper is                    determined using the output value
of the rain droplet sensor 40 in addition to the output value of
the optical                   sensor 30.     Since the detection value of the rain           droplet
sensor 40                   as well reflects the change in the amount of the rain
droplets attached on the glass surface G, that is, the change in
the rainfall state, it is possible to perform the control of the
wiper in               response to the change in the rainfall             state    more accurately.
This control can improve comfortability of a driver.
 [0094]
                In the modification 1,              a case where the optical         sensor 30 and
the rain droplet sensor 40 are integrally accommodated in the
housing 21 of the sensor unit 20 is explained, but not                                     limited
thereto,                 the optical       sensor 30 and the rain       droplet sensor 40 may
be provided to be separated from each other.

                                                         30
                In addition, the optical element that emits infrared light
is     used as the sensor that                 detects       the amount of the rain             droplets
on the glass surface G, but the sensor is                               not limited      thereto.         As
long as the measurement of the amount of rain droplets and the
estimation of the rainfall                      state     are made possible,          it   is   possible
to adopt the rain droplet sensor 40 using an ultrasonic wave or
the rain                droplet sensor 40 using a pressure-sensitive                       system,       for
example.
 [0096]
                 [Modification 2]
                In      the embodiment,      the movement detecting unit                 50 uses only
the illuminance detected by the front light receiving element 32
in     the optical                sensor 30, but is      not limited       thereto.       Illuminance
detected by the upper light receiving element 33                                     instead of the
front light receiving element 32 may be used, or illuminances
detected by both of the front light receiving element 32 and the
upper light                    receiving element 33 may be used.               A use method of both
the illuminances is not limited                        to a particular        one, but, for example,
only when reduction times are detected from both the illuminances,
it     may be determined that                the wiper has moved.               The movement of the
wiper can be accurately detected by using the detection results
of both of the front light                    receiving element 32 and the upper light
receiving element 33.

of the wiper in a case where the difference between the interval
cycle and the reference movement cycle goes beyond the threshold.
                6. The wiper movement detecting device according to
any of claims 1 to 4,                  wherein the movement detecting unit            determines
that the wiper is moving in case where a difference between the
interval                 cycle and a reference movement cycle is               equal to or less
than a threshold, further comprising:
                a movement change determining unit configured to
determine necessity                     of a change in  the movement of the wiper based
upon the difference between the interval cycle and the reference
movement cycle.
                7. The wiper movement detecting device according to
claim 5 or                     6, wherein
               the reference movement cycle is               preliminarily         determined in
accordance with a plurality of movement modes each differing in
a movement speed and an intermittent time of the wiper,
               the movement start            notice of the wiper that           is  input from a
control device that controls the movement of the wiper includes
a notice of a movement mode                      for moving the wiper, and
               the movement detecting unit             calculates         a difference between
a reference movement cycle in accordance with the movement mode
indicated by the movement start                    notice of the wiper and the interval
cycle.
                8. The wiper movement detecting device according to
claim 6, wherein the movement change determining unit determines
a stop of the movement of the wiper in                        a case where the difference
between the interval cycle and the reference movement cycle is
longer than a predetermined time.
