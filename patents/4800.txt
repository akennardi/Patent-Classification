                                 Cover for a Roof Vent
Technical Field
[001]    The invention relates to a cover for a roof vent. More specifically, the
invention relates to a fire resistant cover or bag for a whirlybird roof vent and an
associated method of use.
Background
[002]   Roof vents are arranged to provide ventilation into and out of a roof cavity.
Accordingly, roof vents, in one form or another, allow communication of air from the
external environment into or out of a building such as a house.
[003]    One type of roof vent is called a "whirlybird" that includes a rotating head
with vanes that spins to suck air out the house, such as a roof cavity of the house.
During a bushfire a house is exposed to high winds and air carrying burning embers.
[004]   During the high winds of a bush fire the roof cavity of the house may become
negatively pressured due to the pressure differential across the house and air having
burning embers may be sucked into the house. In particular, in such high wind roof
vents such as a whirlybird may spin quickly and generate excess suction internally of
the roof cavity to further draw burning embers into other sections of the roof cavity or
house. In other scenarios, burning embers may become entrained by a rotating head of
the whirlybird and enter the roof cavity.
[005]   Accordingly, a problem with current roof vents such as whirlybirds it that such
vents may provide an entry point and/or provide suction for embers or the like to enter
the house and potentially start a fire.
[006]   The invention disclosed herein seeks to overcome one or more of the above
identified problems or at least provide a useful alternative.

vent, the cover including a bag body with an open end adapted to fittingly receive the
roof vent and a retaining arrangement fitted to the open end adapted to retain the bag
body with the roof vent in a fitted condition, wherein the bag body and the retaining
arrangement are substantially formed of a fire resistant material.
[008]    In one form, the open end includes a sleeve and wherein the retaining
arrangement includes a tether arranged to pass through the sleeve so as to be retained
tight in the fitted condition by a retaining device.
[009]    In another form, the bag body is substantially formed from a fire resistant

covering a roof vent in the event of a fire, the method including the steps of: fitting an
open end of a bag body of a cover over the roof vent such that the roof vent is

                                            -3
substantially received therein; and actuating a retaining arrangement of the cover
associated with the open end to substantially secure the open end of the bag body to
the roof vent, the bag body and the retaining arrangement being substantially formed
from fire resistant materials such that the cover remains in place during the fire.
[0015] In accordance with a fourth broad aspect there is provided, a method of
covering a whirlybird having a rotating head and a neck in the event of a fire, the
method including the steps of: fitting an open end of a bag body of the rotating head
such that the rotating head is substantially received therein with the open end about
the neck; and actuating a retaining arrangement of the cover associated with the open
end to substantially secure the open end of the bag body to neck with the bag body
engaged with the rotating head so as to inhibit rotation thereof, the bag body and the
retaining arrangement being substantially formed from fire resistant materials such
that the cover remains in place during the fire.

Detailed Description
[0023] Referring to Figures 1 to 6, there is shown a cover 10 in the form of a bag 12
for covering a roof vent 14 in the form of a whirlybird 16. The cover 10 includes a
bag body 18 having a first end 20 with an opening 22, an opposing closed second end
24 and a skirting side wall 26. The first end 20 defines an opening 28 into which the
roof vent 14 is received and the bag body 18 is shaped to fittingly receive and
substantially cover the roof vent 14.
[0024] The opening 28 is fitted with a retaining arrangement 29 adapted to retain or
secure the cover 10 with the vent 14 in a fitted condition. The first end 20 includes a
rim 30 having a skirting sleeve 32. The retaining arrangement 29 includes a tether 34
that passes through skirting sleeve 32 and one or more securing devices 36. The
sleeve 32 includes one or more breaks or apertures 33 through which the tether 34 is
accessible to tighten the opening 28 in a fitted condition and secure the cover 10 over
the roof vent 14. The securing devices 36 are located at and accessible at the apertures
33.
[0025] The cover 10, more specifically the bag body 18, is substantially formed from
a fire resistant material similar to that used for fire-blankets that may include various
types and combinations of materials such as woven fibreglass fire resistant fabric, a
basalt fibre material, and a woven silica material. Of course, any suitable fire resistant
material may be utilised. The tether 34 may be formed from a metal chord (or other
suitable fire resistant material). The one or more securing devices 36 may be provided
in the form of hand operable toggles 38 adapted to retain the tether 34 tight in the
fitted condition. The toggles 38 are also preferably formed from metal (or other
suitable fire resistant material). Any threads or glues used to form the cover 10 are
also fire resistant.
[0026] In use, the cover 10 is fitted over the vent 14 and the tether 34 is drawn tight
and secured in place with the securing devices 36. In the example of a whirlybird 16,
the tether 34 may be drawn tight about a neck 40 that supports a rotating head 42 of
the whirlybird 16. Accordingly, the cover 10 stops or inhibits the rotating head 42

                                            -5
from spinning and therefore reduces or eliminates any suction of air internally of the
roof 44. Further, the cover 10 restricts the passage of any burning embers (or similar
material) into the building roof 44.
[0027] Advantageously, the cover provides a means to stop or reduce the rotation of
the roof vent to inhibit the generation of excess suction within the roof cavity that may
draw burning embers into a building such as a house such as under the eaves of the
house. In addition, the cover provides a means to inhibit the passage burning embers
into a roof of a building such as a house. The cover is shaped and adapted to securely
fit with a roof vent so that the cover is retained in high wind and extreme heat of a
bush or forest fire. The cover is robust, inexpensive to manufacture, as well as rapid
and easy to install.
[0028] Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context
requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and
"comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or
group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of
integers or steps.
[0029] The reference in this specification to any known matter or any prior
publication is not, and should not be taken to be, an acknowledgment or admission or
suggestion that the known matter or prior art publication forms part of the common
general knowledge in the field to which this specification relates.

without departing from the scope of the invention disclosed or evident from the
disclosure provided herein.
