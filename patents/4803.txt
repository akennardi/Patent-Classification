                                                ABSTRACT
            One object is       to detect a sheet with high precision by using
ultrasonic waves.              A   sheet processing apparatus detects                         a paper
sheet based on a change                in    ultrasonic           waves.    The sheet processing
apparatus includes a support member that                           supports a sheet.       A through
part     is  formed in    the support member.                 The sheet processing apparatus
further      includes a transmitting                unit     that    transmits ultrasonic        waves
from a transmitting surface; a reflecting unit that reflects the
ultrasonic       waves,     which were transmitted from the transmitting                          unit
and passed        through        the through            part;      and    a  receiving    unit    that
receives on a receiving surface the ultrasonic waves reflected by
the reflecting        unit.        The receiving surface faces downward,                       and the
transmitting surface is parallel to a vertical direction or faces
downward,        or  the     transmitting             surface          faces   downward,     and   the
receiving       surface       is    parallel         to     a   vertical      direction    or    faces
downward.

                         SHEET PROCESSING APPARATUS
                        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
 [0001]         The present       invention      relates         to a   sheet     processing
apparatus capable of detecting a sheet by using ultrasonic                                waves.
2. Description of the Related Art
 [0002]         Conventionally, in a paper sheet handling apparatus that
performs recognition and counting of paper sheets, an optical                             sensor
is    used to detect a paper sheet transported by a transport                         unit   and
a paper sheet stored in       a storing    unit.         The optical      sensor includes
a light    source and a light       receiving unit         that     receives a detection
light    output from the light        source.      The light         source and the light
receiving unit     are arranged such that          the detection light            is    blocked
when a paper sheet is       detected.       Accordingly,            a paper sheet can be
detected based on whether a detection light                   is   received by the light
receiving unit.
 [0003]         Some paper sheets have a transparent region made of resin
and the like.      Because the detection light passes through such a
transparent region,       the paper sheet cannot be detected by using the
detection     light.      To    detect    a   paper         sheet      having     a     partial
transparent region, an ultrasonic            sensor that          uses ultrasonic          waves
instead of a detection light can be used.
 [0004]         For example,       Japanese Patent No.             4812114 and Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No. H5-213480 disclose an apparatus
capable of detecting a paper sheet by using a transmitting                           unit   that
transmits     (outputs)    ultrasonic       waves       and     a   receiving      unit     that

                                   2
receives the ultrasonic waves transmitted by the transmitting unit.
The transmitting unit and the receiving unit are arranged opposing
each other.   When a paper sheet is present between the transmitting
unit and the receiving unit, the transmitted ultrasonic waves are
blocked by the paper sheet so that weak ultrasonic waves are received
by the receiving unit.    While the detection light passes through a
transparent region, the ultrasonic waves become weak when passed
though the transparent region.     By replacing the light source and
the light receiving unit of the optical sensor with the transmitting
unit and the receiving unit of the ultrasonic sensor, a paper sheet
having a transparent region can be detected based on a reception
state of the ultrasonic waves in the receiving unit.
[00051       An apparatus that detects a paper sheet by measuring a
distance by an ultrasonic     sensor is  also known  in  the art.   By
transmitting the ultrasonic waves from the ultrasonic sensor toward
an object,  a distance to the object can be measured based on a time
duration required to receive the ultrasonic waves reflected from
the  object.    For  example,  Japanese  utility  model   No.  3010662
discloses an apparatus that detects a banknote bundle stored in a
storing unit based on a distance measured by the ultrasonic waves.
A banknote bundle is   formed by bundling a predetermined number of
banknotes.   In this apparatus, the ultrasonic waves are transmitted
from an ultrasonic sensor arranged above the storing unit toward
a bottom surface of the storing unit to measure the distance.     When
the banknote bundles have been stored in the storing unit in a stacked
manner,  the distance measured by the ultrasonic       sensor changes
depending on a height of the stacked banknote bundles.    The banknote
bundles present in the storing unit are detected based on the change

                                            3
in the measured distance.
 [00061          However,   the      detection       result      of     the     paper       sheet
obtained     with the    conventional        ultrasonic         sensor     is      not     always
correct.     For example,    when the transmitting             unit     and the receiving
unit   of the ultrasonic      sensor are arranged opposing to each other
on a top surface and on a bottom surface of a paper sheet storing
unit,   dust and/or trash      on a surface of the sensor arranged on the
bottom    surface    can  lead     to   wrong      detection.          In   some       banknote
handling apparatuses that          stacks banknotes in           a stacking unit            after
recognizing andcounting thebanknotes,                  the stackingunit            isprovided
with an opening for removing the stacked banknotes.                              Dust and/or
trash can enter into the stacking unit from this opening, and it
leads    to wrong     detection.        Even    in    the   apparatus         like      the     one
disclosed     in   Japanese    utility      model       No.    3010662       in      which      the
ultrasonic sensor is arranged on the top surface of the stacking
unit and the ultrasonic waves are transmitted toward the bottom
surface, and the banknote is          detected based on the detected distance,
trash   and/or dust accumulated on the bottom surface can be wrongly
detected as a banknote.
                          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

                                EMBODIMENTS
[0010]        Exemplary embodiments of a sheet processing apparatus

                                               6
according to the present invention are explained in detail below
with reference to the accompanying drawings.                  The sheet processing
apparatus    includes         a   sheet      detection    apparatus.           The     sheet
processing    apparatus         can  detect,        by using  the    sheet      detection
apparatus, the presence or absence of a sheet in a storing unit,
a transport path, and the like of the sheet processing apparatus;
however, an explanation of a detection method of the sheet in the
storing unit will be mainly given in the present embodiment.                              The
type of the sheet as a target of detection by the sheet detection
apparatus is   not particularly           limited; however,      an explanation will
be given below by taking a banknote as the target of detection by
a paper sheet detection apparatus in the present embodiment.
 [0011]        At first,       an explanation will       be given about a banknote
handling apparatus         (sheet handling apparatus)           in  which a banknote
detection apparatus          (paper sheet detection apparatus)              is    arranged
inside a storing      unit.       FIGS.    1A and 1B are views for explaining a
structure  of a banknote handling apparatus 1 including the banknote
detection apparatus.            FIG. 1A is a schematic external view of the
banknote handling apparatus 1 when seen from the front side.                             FIG.
1B is a schematic block diagram of an internal                     structure of the
banknote handling apparatus 1.                 The banknote handling apparatus 1
includes four stackingunits            (storingunits)      40 for storing       banknotes
in a stacked manner.            A banknote detection apparatus is arranged
inside each of the stacking units 40.                  Each of the stacking units
40 is provided with an opening on a front surface side of the apparatus
for removing the banknotes stacked inside the stacking unit 40.
 [0012]        As shown in        FIG.   1A,   the banknote handling apparatus 1
includes a feed unit        50,   an operation/display unit         60,   a reject       unit

                                      7
70,  and the stacking units 40.      The operation/display unit 60,     for
example, is constituted by a touch-screen liquid crystal display
device.   The operation/display unit 60 displays one or more buttons
on a screen thereof and functions as an operation unit by accepting
input of various information by operation of the button.        For example,
when   an  instruction   to perform     banknote   handling  is   given  by
operation of the operation/display unit 60,         the banknotes placed
in the feed unit 50 are taken inside the apparatus one by one and
recognized, and the banknotes are sorted and stacked in the four
stacking units 40 based on the recognition result of each banknote.
Moreover, the operation/display unit 60 functions as a display unit
that displays on a screen thereof various setting information and
various other information such as denomination, number, amount, and
the like of the banknotes stacked in the stacking units 40.
[0013]        An operator operates the operation/display unit 60 to
perform   the  banknote   handling     and  places  the  handling    target
banknotes in the feed unit 50.     The feed unit 50 takes the banknotes,
which have been placed therein by the operator, inside the apparatus
one by one.   For example, a reject banknote, such as a banknote that
could not be recognized by the banknote handling apparatus 1, is
stacked in the reject unit 70, and a banknote that could be recognized
is stacked in the stacking unit 40.         The operator can remove the
banknotes stacked in the stacking unit 40 from the opening of the
stacking unit 40.
[0014]        As shown in   FIG. 1B,   the feed unit 50,  the reject unit
70,  the stacking units 40,    and a recognition unit 80 are connected
by a transport unit 90.    The recognition unit 80 includes a plurality
of sensors such as a line sensor that acquire an image of the banknote,

                                                8
a thickness detection sensor that detects a thickness of the banknote,
and       a      magnetism       detection       sensor     that    detects     magnetic
characteristics            of the banknote.      The recognition unit    80 recognizes
the     banknote         based     on   optical    characteristics,      the    magnetic
characteristics,            the thickness, and the like       of the banknote obtained
by these sensors.             The recognition unit       80 recognizes denomination,
authenticity, fitness,                direction    (face side up/back side up and
portrait normal/portrait reverse),                   and the like of each banknote
taken in         by the feed unit       50 and transported by the transport            unit
90.     The banknote transported by the transport unit 90                     is passed
through the recognition unit               80 and then stacked either     in the reject
unit     70 or in       one of the stacking units        40 based on the recognition
result obtained by the recognition unit 80.
 [0015]               The banknote detection apparatus arranged in each of the
stacking          units     40  is    explained    below.      Because   the    banknote
detection apparatus having the same configuration is arranged in
each of the stacking units 40,                  only one stacking unit 40 will be
explained below.
 [0016]               FIG.    2   is   a   schematic      cross-sectional     view      for
explaining a configuration of the banknote detection apparatus.                         FIG.
2 is    a view when a part           inside the stacking unit       40 of the banknote
handling apparatus 1 shown in FIG. 1A is seen from the opening on
the front surface side of the apparatus.                  In FIG. 2, X axis represents
the horizontal direction               corresponding to the left-right        direction
of the banknote handling apparatus 1,                 Z axis represents the vertical
direction,           and   Y   axis    (see  FIG.   3)   represents    the   horizontal
direction         corresponding to the front-back direction            of the banknote
handling apparatus 1.

                                                      9
 [0017]                As shown in      FIG.   2,   the banknote detection apparatus is
arranged inside the stacking unit                       40 that    includes a right        wall 42,
a left wall 43,               and a stage 41 for stacking a banknote 100.                         The
banknote detection apparatus includes a transmitting unit 10 for
transmitting            ultrasonic       waves,     a reflecting         unit  30 for reflecting
the ultrasonic              waves transmitted by the transmitting                    unit    10,  and
a receiving unit 20                 for receiving the ultrasonic waves reflected
by    the      reflecting          unit    30.      The    banknote         detection     apparatus
performs transmission and reception of the ultrasonic                                   waves via a
through part            41a formed in       the stage 41.          The stage 41 functions as
a support member that                 supports from below the banknote 100 stacked
in the stacking unit 40.
 [0018]                Although not shown in FIG. 2, the banknote 100 recognized
by the recognition unit                 80 is     transported by the transport               unit  90
and sent to the stacking unit                40 from above the stage 41.              The banknote
100 sent to the stacking unit                     40 is    stacked on the stage 41,             which
is like a thin plate, between the right wall 42 and left wall 43.
 [0019]                The stacking unit          40, which has the opening on the front
surface side of the apparatus, has a side wall                                (back wall) on the
back surface side of the apparatus.                          Movements of left          edge,   right
edge, and back edge of the banknote 100 sent to the stacking unit
40 are regulated by the three side walls,                           i.e.,     the right    wall 42,
the left wall 43,                and the back wall, and the banknote is stacked
on the stage 41 such that               a banknote face thereof sits             on a top surface
of the stage 41.
 [0020]                The stage 41 can be fixed inside the stacking unit                         40.
Alternatively,              the stage 41 can move in            an up-down direction          (Z-axis
direction)           inside the stacking unit                40 depending on the number of

                                                        10
the banknotes 100 stacked on the top surface of the stage 41.                                              For
example,        the movement of the stage 41 can be automatically achieved
by machine controlling                   a position        of the stage 41,             which is      movable
in the up-down direction, depending on the number of the stacked
banknotes.            Alternatively,              for example,             the    stage       41,  which    is
movable in the up-down direction, can be held at a predetermined
height by using an elastic                     member,        such as a spring,              such that     the
stage 41 moves down because of the weight of the stacked banknotes
and the stage 41 returns to its                        original         position       when the stacked
banknotes are removed.
 [0021]              As shown in FIG. 2, the stage 41 is provided with the
through part           41a for passing the ultrasonic                       waves through the stage
41 from the top surface side to a bottom surface side of the stage
41.      The through part              41a is   formed in        the stage 41 at such a position
that,      irrespective             of where        the banknote             100   is     stacked      in  the
left-right           direction           (X-axis      direction)            of   the      apparatus,       the
through part             41a     shall     be blocked by               the    stacked banknote            100.
Specifically,            assume that        a width in the left-right                 direction       (X-axis
direction)         of the banknote 100,                 that      is,    a width of the short edge
is    w (mm) .      Then,       as shown in        FIG.    2,   the through part              41a is   formed
within a range defined between a position                                P1 and a position           P2.   The
position P1 is a position of a left edge of the banknote 100 when
the banknote 100 is               stacked such that            a right      edge thereof is        touching
the right wall 42 of the stacking unit 40.                                      The position P2           is a
position of the right edge of the banknote 100 when the banknote
100 is      stacked such that              the left       edge thereof is             touching the left
wall 43 of the stacking unit                      40.     Moreover,         the through part            41a is
formed such that             it    contains a position                P3 from where the ultrasonic

                                              11
waves transmitted and received between the transmitting                      unit 10 and
the receiving unit 20 pass.
[0022]           FIGS.     3A and 3B are views for explaining a shape of the
through part 41a.           In an upper part of each of FIGS.              3A and 3B is
shown a view of a partial          region on a front surface side of the stage
41 when seen from above, and in a lower part of each of FIGS. 3A
and 3B is    shown a view of a cross section passing through the position
P3 when seen from the front surface side.                  The banknote 100 stacked
on the stage 41,         with the back edge of the banknote 100 touching
the back wall of the stacking unit               40,   is shown with a dotted line.
[0023]           For example,       as shown in      FIG.  3A,  the through part      41a
is formed by cutting the stage 41 from the front surface side.                          A
cutout portion is         formed in    the front surface side of the stage 41.
This cutout portion makes it             easy to grasp the stacked banknote 100
from above and below when inserting the hand from the opening on
the front surface of the stacking unit                 40 and removing the banknote
100 that     has been stacked on the stage 41.                This cutout portion is
used as the through part 41a for passing the ultrasonic waves.
[0024]          Alternatively,          as   shown    in  FIG.   3B,   for   example,   a
through-hole passing from the top surface to the bottom surface of
the stage 41 can be formed as the through part                  41a.     A shape of the
through-hole is not limited.                The through-hole, other than being
circular,     as shown in      FIG.   3B,  can be oval,     elongated,    rectangular,
polygonal, and the like.
[0025]           The position P3 has been shown schematically shown in
FIGS.     3A and 3B.     The position      P3 is   the position      through which the
ultrasonic waves pass.             The ultrasonic waves are transmitted and
received between the transmitting unit 10 and the receiving unit

                                    12
20.   The position P3 is a position that is blocked by the stacked
banknote 100 irrespective of the position where the banknote 100
is stacked in the front-back direction          (Y-axis direction) on the
stage 41.   Specifically, when the banknote 100 is       stacked such that
the back edge of the banknote 100 is       touching the back wall of the
stacking unit 40, as shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the position P3 through
which   the  ultrasonic    waves  pass   is   a   position  that   is    at  a
predetermined distance L (mm)    toward the back surface side from the
front edge of the banknote 100.    To allow distinguishing between when
the banknote 100 is on the stage 41 and when the banknote 100 is
not on the stage 41 from a change in      the ultrasonic waves received
by the receiving unit 20, the distance L is suitably determined based
on   a  diameter    of  the  ultrasonic     sensor    constituted     by   the
transmitting unit 10 and the receiving unit 20,         characteristics of
the ultrasonic wave transmitted by the transmitting unit 10,               and
the like.
[0026]        The through part 41a is arranged at such a position that
at least a part of the ultrasonic waves that pass through the through
part 41a is blocked by the banknote 100 irrespective of the stacked
position of the banknote 100 stacked on the stage 41.        Moreover, the
through part 41a is    arranged at such a position that at least a part
of the ultrasonic waves that pass through the through part 41a is
blockedby the banknotes 100 irrespective of the size of the banknotes
100 when the banknotes 100 of various types having different sizes
are stacked on the stage 41.   That is,  the through part 41a is arranged
at such a position that the ultrasonic waves that pass through the
through part    41a   and received by the       receiving unit   20    change
irrespective of which type of the banknotes is stacked at which

                                                       13
position       on the stage 41 among the banknotes that                             are the handling
target in the banknote handling apparatus 1.
 [0027]              The transmitting           unit     10 transmits the ultrasonic                  waves
having a straightness.                  As shown in FIG. 2, the transmitting unit
10 is arranged above the stage 41 so that it is not in the way of
the banknote transported by the transport unit 90 to the stacking
unit 40.
 [0028]              The   transmitting            unit        10   is   arranged        such      that     a
transmitting          surface 10a for transmitting                   the ultrasonicwaves faces
downward and the ultrasonic                  waves transmitted from the transmitting
surface        10a     pass    through        the      position        P3.      Specifically,            the
transmitting          unit   10 is    arranged such that              the circular       transmitting
surface 10a, for example,                is   parallel         to the XY plane, and a straight
line that joins a center of the transmitting surface 10a and the
position P3 is parallel to the Z-axis direction.
 [0029]              The transmitting           unit     10 transmits the ultrasonic                  waves
downward toward the stage 41 and the reflectingunit                                30.     Forexample,
the transmitting unit 10 transmits the ultrasonic waves downward
in   the Z-axis direction.                If   no banknote 100 has been stacked on the
stage 41,       the ultrasonic          waves transmitted by the transmitting                           unit
10 reach the reflecting unit 30 after passing through the through
part 41a.
 [0030]              The reflecting unit 30 reflects the ultrasonic waves
transmitted           by the     transmitting            unit      10   and passed         through       the
through part 41a.              For example, a part of a bottom surface of the
stacking unit 40 can be formed as,                            as shown in FIG. 2,             a surface
inclined with respect to the XY plane,                            and this    surface can be used
as     the   reflecting         unit     30.       However,         the    configuration           of    the

                                    14
reflecting   unit  30  is  not particularly     limited  as  far   as  the
ultrasonic   waves received   from the transmitting unit       10 can be
reflected toward the receiving unit 20.    For example, it  is allowable
to provide the reflecting unit 30 independently from the stacking
unit 40,  and the reflecting unit 30 can be fixed to a side wall or
the bottom surface of the stacking unit 40.
[0031]        The receiving unit 20 receives       the ultrasonic waves
reflected by the reflecting      unit  30.   As   shown in  FIG.   2,  the
receiving unit 20 is   arranged such that a receiving surface 20a for
receiving the ultrasonic waves is either parallel to the vertical
direction   (Z-axis direction)   or the receiving surface      20a faces
downward.   Specifically, the receiving unit 20 is arranged such that
the receiving surface 20a is    inclined by an angle a (a       0 degree)
with respect to the vertical direction but outside of the stacking
unit 40.
[0032]        The receiving unit 20 receives at the receiving surface
20a the ultrasonic waves that are transmitted by the transmitting
unit 10 and reflected at a position P4 of the reflecting unit 30
after passing through the position P3 of the through part             41a.
Specifically,   the receiving unit 20 is   arranged such that an angle
made by a straight line that joins a center of the circular receiving
surface 20a and the position P4 of the reflecting unit 30 with a
surface of the reflecting unit 30,     and an angle made by a straight
line that joins the positions P3 and P4 with the surface of the
reflecting unit 30 are equal      (angle P shown in FIG. 2).
[0033]        The orientation of the reflecting unit 30 is adjusted
based on the arrangement angle a of the receiving surface 20a so
that the ultrasonic waves transmitted from the transmitting unit

                                    15
10 are incident perpendicularly on the receiving surface 20a.             For
example, when the transmitting surface 10a of the transmitting unit
10  is  parallel   to  the  XY plane   and  the   ultrasonic     waves    are
transmitted downward in    the Z-axis direction,     and the arrangement
angle a of the receiving surface 20a of the receiving unit 20 is
30 degrees, the reflecting unit 30 will be a plane inclined by 30
degrees with respect to the XY plane.
[0034]        In the banknote detection apparatus,     if   no banknote 100
has been   stacked   on the stage   41  of the stacking       unit   40,  the
ultrasonic waves transmitted from the transmitting unit 10 pass
through the through part 41a of the stage 41,      are reflected by the
reflecting unit 30 and received by the receiving unit 20.           When the
banknote 100 is stacked on the stage 41, at least a part of the through
part 41a is blocked by the stacked banknote 100.           As a result, at
least   a  part   of  the  ultrasonic    waves   transmitted       from   the
transmitting unit 10 is blocked by the stacked banknote 100, and
ultrasonic   waves   received  by  the  receiving    unit     20 have    been
attenuated as compared to a case in which there is no stacked banknote.
The banknote detection apparatus detects stacking of the banknote
100 on the stage 41 based on the attenuation of the ultrasonic waves.
[00351        Some banknotes have a transparent region made of resin
and the like.     As shown in FIG. 2, when the banknote           100 has a
transparent region 100a, light passes through the transparent region
100a.   On the other hand, the ultrasonic waves also pass through the
transparent region 100a, but the ultrasonic waves are attenuated
when passing through the transparent region 100a.            Based on this
attenuation,    the banknote   100  can be   detected     by the banknote
detection apparatus even when a part of the banknote 100 stacked

                                               16
on the stage 41         is transparent.
 [00361           If dust, trash,      and the like     is   stuck to the transmitting
surface      10a and/or       the receiving surface            20a, this may cause an
adverse effect       on the transmission and reception of the ultrasonic
waves leading to wrong detection of the banknote 100.                        Dust and/or
trash, such as paper dust produced from the banknote 100 present
in   the   stacking     unit    40  falls     down  in     the   stacking   unit     40    and
accumulates on the bottom surface thereof.                      Also, dust and/or trash
entering in      the stacking unit        40 from the opening on the front surface
of the apparatus falls           down in    the stacking unit        40 and accumulates
on the bottom surface thereof.                Therefore,      if  the receiving unit        20
is   arranged on the bottom surface of the stacking unit                   40 and facing
toward the transmitting unit 10, dust, trash, and the like sticks
to the receiving surface 20a leading to wrong detection.                         However,
in the banknote detection apparatus, the transmitting unit 10 is
arranged such that         the transmitting       surface 10a faces downward,              and
the receiving unit           20 is  arranged such that           the receiving surface
20a is either parallel to the vertical direction or the receiving
surface 20a faces downward.               With this    configuration,       dust,    trash,
and the like do not easily stick to the transmitting surface 10a
and the receiving surface 20a.               Accordingly,        wrong detection can be
prevented and the banknote 100 on the stage 41 can be detected with
high precision.
 [0037]           FIGS.    4A and 4B are views of an arrangement example of
the transmitting         unit   10 and the receiving unit            20 of the banknote
detection apparatus.            FIG. 4A shows an example in which the receiving
unit   20 is  arrangedbelow the stage 41 such that                the receiving surface
20a is parallel to the YZ plane.                 Moreover, the transmitting unit

                                       17
10 is arranged above the stage 41 such that the transmitting surface
10a is parallel to the XY plane and facing downward.        The reflecting
unit 30 is arranged below the stage 41 and it has a surface that
is  inclined by 45 degrees with respect to the XY plane so that the
ultrasonic    waves   transmitted    from the transmitting     surface  10a
downward in the Z-axis direction and passed through the through part
41a of the stage 41 travel further in       the positive X-axis direction
and are received at the receiving surface 20a.
 [00381        FIG. 4B shows an example in which the receiving unit 20
is  arranged below the stage 41 such that the receiving surface 20a
is  inclined and faces downward.       Moreover, the transmitting unit 10
is arranged above the stage 41 such that the transmitting surface
10a is   inclined and faces downward.      The reflecting unit 30,    which
is   arranged   below    the   stage  41, is   arranged  by   adjusting  an
arrangement position and angle thereof so that the ultrasonic waves
emitted from and perpendicularly to the transmitting surface 10a
are perpendicularly incident on the receiving surface 20a after
passing through the through part 41a of the stage 41.
 [00391        As far as it  is possible to transmit the ultrasonic waves
from the transmitting unit 10 with the transmitting surface 10a
facing downward,    reflect with the reflecting unit 30 the ultrasonic
waves that have passed through the through part 41a of the stage
41, and receive the ultrasonic waves with the receiving unit 20 either
with the receiving surface 20a parallel to the vertical direction
or with the receiving surface 20a facing downward,         the arrangement
positions and angles of the transmitting unit 10,       the receiving unit
20, and the reflecting unit 30 are not particularly limited.
 [0040]        FIG. 5 is a schematic cross-sectional view of an example

                                             18
of the banknote detection apparatus arranged in                       the stacking unit
40 of the banknote handling apparatus 1.                     The banknote transported
by the transport      unit   90 is   sent,    as shown with a hollow arrow, from
the top right corner to the inside of the stacking unit 40.                            The
banknote sent in       the stacking unit         40 enters between two blades of
a stacking wheel 49 rotating           in  the counterclockwise direction,             the
banknote is      transported in      the left     direction,        and the banknote is
stacked on the inclined stage 41 such that the banknote face sits
on the stage 41 in a state where the banknote face is parallel to
the surface of the stage 41.              The stacking unit 40 is constituted
by the right wall 42,         the left wall 43,             an upper wall 44,     a base
wall 45,   and a back wall 46 and has the opening on the front surface
side of the apparatus.
 [0041]          A support member 41b having a vertical                 through-hole is
formed in a right       edge of the stage 41.              The support member 41b is
on the   right      outer-side     of   the right       wall    42.    The  stage  41    is
supported by a coil        spring 48 in       a state     where a cylindrical      slide
shaft 47 fixed to the banknote handling apparatus 1 is                   passed through
the coil    spring 48 and the through-hole of the support member 41b.
The coil spring 48 passed through the slide shaft 47 supports the
stage 41 such that the stage 41 is held at a predetermined height
when no banknote has been stacked on the stage 41.                      When a banknote
is  stacked on the stage 41,          the stage 41 descends due to the weight
of the stacked banknote.           When the stacked banknote is            removed from
the stage 41,       the stage 41 returns to its original predetermined
height by the action of the coil spring 48,.
 [0042]          To allow the banknote stackedon the stage 41 tobe easily
removed by grasping with fingers from the up-down direction, the

                                                   19
cutout portion           is  formed in the           stage 41 by partially cutting a
portion from the front surface side to the back surface side as shown
in   FIG.    3A.    This cutout portion constitutes                 the through part          41a.
 [0043]            The transmitting unit 10 of the ultrasonic sensor is
fixed on a surface outside of the upper wall 44.                           The transmitting
unit     10 is   fixed in    an inclined manner with the transmitting                   surface
10a facing downward.              The receiving unit 20 is fixed on a surface
outside of the right          wall 42 in       an inclined manner with the receiving
surface 20a facing downward.                    A through-hole corresponding to the
transmitting          surface     10a   is     formed in     the upper wall         44,     and a
through-hole corresponding to the receiving surface 20a is                                formed
in   the right       wall 42.      The base wall 45 includes horizontal planes
and inclined planes.              One of the inclined planes functions as the
reflecting unit 30.
 [0044]            The ultrasonic        waves transmitted from the transmitting
unit    10 when no banknote has been stacked on the stage 41 pass without
being changed through the through part                      41a of the stage 41 and are
reflected      by the reflecting         unit     30.   The ultrasonic      waves reflected
by the reflecting unit 30 are received by the receiving unit 20.
In contrast, when the banknote has been stacked on the stage 41,
at    least     a   part    of   the    ultrasonic        waves     transmitted       from      the
transmitting unit            10   is blocked by the stacked banknote that is
blocking       the     through     part     41a     of  the   stage    41.    As    a   result,
attenuated ultrasonic              waves are received by the receiving unit                      20
as compared to a case in which there is no stacked banknote.                                    The
banknote detection apparatus detects the presence or absence of the
banknote 100 stacked on the stage 41 based on the attenuation of
the ultrasonic waves.

                                       20
 [0045]         The transmitting unit 10, the reflecting unit 30, and
the receiving unit 20 are arranged by adjusting the arrangement
positions    and     angles   thereof   such  that   the   ultrasonic   waves
transmitted from the transmitting surface 10a and traveling straight
are not blocked by any other structural element.            For example,   the
transmitting unit 10, the reflecting unit 30, and the receiving unit
20 are arranged, as shown in       FIG. 5,  such that the ultrasonic waves
pass outside of the stacking wheel 49 in a diameter direction thereof.
Specifically, the transmitting unit 10,         the reflecting unit 30,    and
the receiving unit 20 are arranged such that the stacking wheel 49
is  located outside a cylindrical region (region shown with a dotted
line    in FIG.   5)   obtained   by parallel    movement   of the circular
transmitting surface 10a in a direction that is orthogonal to the
transmitting surface 10a.
 [0046]         In the banknote detection apparatus,        instead of using
a transmission-type ultrasonic sensor including the transmitting
unit 10 and the receiving unit 20,           a reflection-type ultrasonic
sensor can be used.        A banknote detection apparatus including the
reflection-type ultrasonic sensor is         explained below.    Because the
configuration of the stacking unit 40 and the stage 41 is            the same
as the configuration explained by using FIG.         2,  only the difference
in  the configuration when the transmission-type ultrasonic sensor
is used is explained below.
 [0047]         FIGS.   6A and 6B are schematic cross-sectional views of
an   example     of   a   banknote   detection    apparatus    that   uses   a
reflection-type ultrasonic sensor 110.          For example, as shown in FIG.
6A,  the banknote detection apparatus includes the reflection-type
ultrasonic sensor 110 and the reflecting unit 30 that are arranged

                                    21
facing   each  other.   The  reflection-type     ultrasonic     sensor   110
includes a transmitting unit and a receiving unit.       The transmitting
unit   and  the   receiving  unit   are   provided   integrally     in   the
reflection-type     ultrasonic    sensor   110.     In    an   alternative
configuration,    for example,   as shown in   FIG.  6B,   the ultrasonic
sensor 110 and the reflecting unit 30, which are facing each other,
can be arranged in an inclined manner.      As far as it    is possible to
pass the ultrasonic waves transmitted from the transmitting unit
of the ultrasonic sensor 110 through the through part 41a of the
stage 41, pass the ultrasonic waves reflected by the reflecting unit
30 through the through part 41a again, and receive the ultrasonic
waves with the receiving unit of the ultrasonic sensor 110,              the
arrangement positions and angles of the ultrasonic sensor 110 and
the reflecting unit 30 are not particularly limited.
[0048]        Specifically, theultrasonic sensor 110 is arrangedsuch
that a transmitting and receiving surface 110a thereof,           including
a transmitting surface for transmitting the ultrasonic waves from
the transmitting unit and a receiving surface for receiving the
ultrasonic    waves  in  the receiving    unit,   faces   downward.      The
ultrasonic sensor 110 transmits the ultrasonic waves downward from
the transmitting and receiving surface 110a.        When no banknote has
been stacked on the stage 41,    the ultrasonic waves pass through the
through part    41a of the stage    41 without being changed and are
reflected by the reflecting unit 30.     The ultrasonic waves reflected
by the reflecting unit 30 pass through the through part 41a of the
stage 41 again and are received by the transmitting and receiving
surface 110a.
[0049]        The   banknote   detection    apparatus    having     such   a

                                    22
reflection-type ultrasonic sensor 110 can measure a distance by using
the ultrasonic sensor 110.     When there is   no banknote on the stage
41, the banknote detection apparatus measures a distance from the
transmitting and receiving surface 110a to the reflecting unit 30
based on a time duration and a speed of the ultrasonic waves.       The
time duration is from a time point at which the ultrasonic waves
are transmitted from the transmitting and receiving surface 110a
to a time point at which the ultrasonic waves are received in the
transmitting and receiving surface 110a again after being reflected
by the reflecting unit 30.
 [00501       When the banknote is   stacked on the stage 41,  at least
a part of the ultrasonic waves transmitted from the transmitting
and receiving surface 110a is     reflected from the banknote present
on the stage 41.    Even if the banknote stacked on the stage 41 has
a transparent region, the ultrasonic waves are reflected from this
banknote.    As  a result,  the distance    from the transmitting   and
receiving surface 110a to the banknote on the stage 41 is      measured
by the banknote detection apparatus.      The measured distance will be
shorter when the banknote is   stacked on the stage 41 than when there
is  no banknote on the stage 41.    Based on the change in the measured
distance between when there is no banknote and when there is a stacked
banknote on the stage 41,   the banknote detection apparatus detects
the banknote stacked on the stage 41.
 [0051]       Because  the transmitting and receiving surface      110a
faces downward,   the ultrasonic sensor 110 is    not affected by dust,
trash, and the like.    Moreover,  the through part 41a is  provided in
the stage 41, and the presence or absence of the banknote on the
stage 41 is  detected based on a change in the measured distance when

                                       23
the banknote is    stacked on the stage 41 by taking the distance from
the ultrasonic sensor 110 to a reflecting unit 30 arranged below
the stage 41 as a reference distance.            When even only one banknote
is stacked on the stage 41, the measured distance becomes shorter
than the reference distance from the ultrasonic sensor 110 to the
top surface of the stage 41.        Because the measured distance greatly
changes depending on the presence or absence of the banknote, the
banknote stacked on the stage 41 can be detected with high precision.
[0052]        The reflection-type        ultrasonic     sensor usable    in the
banknote detection apparatus is not limited to the ultrasonic sensor
110  in  which the     transmitting unit       and the receiving      unit  are
integrated together.        As   far as   it  is   possible  to transmit    the
ultrasonic    waves    from   the   transmitting      unit  and   receive   the
ultrasonic waves reflected by the reflecting unit 30, as shown in
FIGS. 7A and 7B,   it  is allowable to use a reflection-type ultrasonic
sensor 111 in which the transmitting unit 10 and the receiving unit
20 are arranged separately.
[00531        In the present embodiment,         the transmitting unit 10 is
arranged above the stage 41 and the receiving unit 20 is arranged
below   the  stage    41;  however,   the    arrangement    positions   of  the
transmitting unit 10 and the receiving unit 20 can be interchanged.
Specifically, as shown in FIGS.        8A to 8C,    the receiving unit 20 can
be arranged at the position of the transmitting unit 10 and the
transmitting unit 10 can be arranged at the position of the receiving
unit 20 shown in FIG. 2 and the like.
[0054]        Moreover, an example is explained above in which the
banknote face sits    on the top surface of the stage 41 when the banknote
100 is  stacked; however,      for example,    a configuration is    allowable

                                      24
in which the structure shown in      FIG.  2 is rotated counterclockwise
around the Y-axis by less than 90 degrees.         Specifically,    as shown
in FIGS. 9A and 9B, even if the stacking unit is configured such
that the banknote 100 is stacked therein with the short edge thereof
toward the front side of the apparatus and the long edge thereof
touching the bottom surface of the stackingunit 40 while the banknote
100 is  in  a standing state or is    in an inclined standing state with
the banknote face sitting    on one surface of the stage 41, the stacked
banknote    100   can be  detected    by using   the  above  method.     The
transmitting unit 10 is    arranged on one side and the receiving unit
20 is   arranged on the other side of the stage          41 with both the
transmitting     surface  10a   and  the  receiving   surface    20a either
parallel to the vertical direction or facing downward so that it
is possible to transmit and receive the ultrasonic waves between
the transmitting unit 10 and the receiving unit 20.          Moreover,   the
through part 41a is    provided in the stage 41 so that the ultrasonic
waves transmitted and received between the transmitting unit 10 and
the receiving unit 20 change depending on the presence or absence
of the banknote 100 stacked with the banknote face sitting on the
stage   41.    By  transmitting    and  receiving   the  ultrasonic    waves
between the transmitting unit 10 and the receiving unit 20 through
this throughpart 41a, the presence or absence of the stackedbanknote
100   can   be   detected.     Alternatively,     in   a  case   where   the
reflection-type ultrasonic sensor 110 is        provided in    the stacking
unit 40,   as shown in FIG.   9C, the presence or absence of a banknote
100 stacked in a standing state or in an inclined standing state
with the banknote face sitting on one surface of the stage 41 can
be detected.

                                        25
 [00551       Moreover,     an example of detecting a banknote           in   the
stacking unit 40 is      explained in     the present embodiment; however,
the above banknote detection          apparatus     can be used to detect a
banknote    that  is   transported     on the    transport     path inside    the
banknote handling apparatus.           Specifically, for example,         assume
that FIG. 2, FIGS. 4A and 4B, and FIGS. 6A and 6B show schematic
cross-sectional      views    of  the  transport     path   when   seen  from   a
transport direction       (Y-axis direction) .       Moreover,    assume that a
member shown with a reference numeral 41 in these drawings represents
a support member 41 that supports the banknote 100 on the transport
path for transporting the banknote 100 in the Y-axis direction.             That
is,  a top surface of the support member 41 constitutes a transport
surface of the transport path for transporting the banknote 100 in
the Y-axis direction.        In this case,    the through part 41a shown in
these drawings represents a through-hole formed in the support member
41 at a position corresponding to a detection position of the banknote
100.    As mentioned earlier, the banknote 100 that is           transported on
the transport path and passes the detection position can be detected
by arranging the transmitting unit 10, the receiving unit 20, and
the reflecting unit 30 corresponding to the through part 41a formed
in  the support member 41.       If  there is   a requirement to detect the
banknote at a plurality of positions on the transport path, a through
part can be formed at each of the detection positions,                  and the
transmitting unit 10, the receiving unit 20,           and the reflecting unit
30 can be arranged corresponding to each of the through parts.              This
configuration allows detection of the banknote at the plurality of
positions.     For example,      as  shown   in   FIGS.   10A,   10B  and 11,   a
transport path constituting the transport unit 90 supports a banknote

                                    26
100 being transported in the direction 200.         The bottom part of the
transport path functions as the support member 41.              The support
member 41 is located in the same way as that in the stacking unit
40,   such that the support member 41 separates a space above the
support member from the other space below the support member4l.             As
shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, the transmitting unit 10 is arranged
on one side of the transport path and the receiving unit 20 is arranged
on the other side of the transport path. The transmitting unit 10
and the receiving unit 20 are shifted in a transport direction of
the   banknote    100.   Alternatively,    as    shown  in   FIG.     11,  the
reflection-type ultrasonic sensor 110 arranged on one side of the
transport path can be used with the reflecting unit 30 arranged on
the other side of the transport        path.   In  these  structures,      the
banknote 100 can also be detected by using the above method.
 [00561        An example is  explained in which the banknote handling
apparatus 1 includes the stacking unit 40 having the opening for
removing stacked banknote therein; however the structure is not
limited to this example.      For example,   as shown in   FIG.   12,   in the
storing unit 40 of the banknote handling apparatus 1, which is             one
of bank teller   machines used in financial institutions such as bank,
a banknote stored in the storing unit 40 inside the apparatus can
be   detected   by using the   above  method.      The banknote     handling
apparatus 1 shown in FIG.    12 includes a container 51 for collecting
banknotes from the banknote handling apparatus 1.         The container 51
is  a cassette-type storing unit detachably attached to the banknote
handling apparatus 1.     As shown in FIGS. 13A to 13C, the banknote
detection apparatus is provided in the container 51, and the banknote
stored in the container 51 can be detected by using the above method.

                                    27
[0057]         As  explained   above,   with   the   banknote   detection
apparatus    according  to the present    embodiment,    the presence   or
absence of the banknote stacked in the stacking unit and/or the
presence or absence of the banknote transported on the transport
path can be detected by using the ultrasonic waves.        When using the
transmission-type ultrasonic sensor, for example, the transmitting
unit  10  is  arranged such that the transmitting surface          10a for
transmitting the ultrasonic waves faces downward and the receiving
unit 20 is arranged such that the receiving surface 20a is either
parallel to the vertical direction or the receiving surface 20a faces
downward.    With this configuration, dust, trash, and the like do not
easily stick to the transmitting        surface  10a   and the receiving
surface 20a.     Accordingly, the presence or absence of the banknote
stacked in   the stacking unit and/or the presence or absence of the
banknote transported on the transport path can be detected with high
precision.
[00581         For example, the ultrasonic waves transmitted from the
transmitting unit 10 arranged above the stage 41 of the stacking
unit 40 pass through the through part 41a formed in the stage 41,
the ultrasonic waves are reflected by the reflecting unit 30 arranged
below the stage 41, and the ultrasonic waves are received by the
receiving unit 20 arranged below the stage 41.     When the through part
41a is blocked by the banknote stacked on the stage 41, at least
a part   of   the  ultrasonic   waves  is  blocked   whereby   attenuated
ultrasonic waves are received by the receiving unit 20.      The banknote
detection apparatus detects the banknote based on the attenuation
of the ultrasonic waves.    Therefore, even when a part of or the entire
banknote stacked on the stage 41 is      made of a transparent material

                                   28
through which light can pass, the banknote can be detected.   Moreover,
the banknote stacked on the stage 41 can be detected in a structure
in which the stage 41 is fixed inside the stacking unit 40, or in
a structure in which the stage 41 moves in the up-down direction
inside the stacking unit 40 depending on the number of the stacked
banknotes.   Moreover,  for example,   the banknote   can be detected
similarly by providing the through part 41a in     the support member
41 for supporting the banknote that is   transported on the transport
path and arranging the banknote detection apparatus corresponding
to the through part 41a.
[00591       When using the reflection-type ultrasonic sensor 110,
the ultrasonic sensor 110 is arranged, with the transmitting and
receiving surface   110a facing downward,    above the stage 41 that
supports the banknote in the stacking unit 40 and/or above the support
member 41 that supports the banknote on the transport path.       With
this configuration, dust, trash, and the like do not easily stick
to the transmitting and receiving surface 110a.      Accordingly, the
presence or absence of the banknote stacked in the stacking unit
and/or the presence or absence of the banknote transported on the
transport path can be detected with high precision.
[00601       For example,  the ultrasonic waves transmitted from the
transmitting   unit of  the reflection-type    ultrasonic   sensor 110
arranged above the stage 41 of the stacking unit 40, pass through
the through part 41a formed in the stage 41, the ultrasonic waves
are reflected by the reflecting unit 30 arranged below the stage
41, and the ultrasonic waves pass through the through part 41a again
and are received by the receiving unit of the ultrasonic sensor 110.
When the through part 41a is  blocked by the banknote stacked on the

                                   29
stage 41,   because at least a part of the ultrasonic waves does not
reach the reflecting unit 30, as the part of the ultrasonic waves
is reflected from the stacked banknote, a time duration from the
transmission of the ultrasonic waves to the reception thereof changes.
The banknote detection apparatus detects the banknote based on such
a change in the time duration.      That is, the banknote is detected
by using the fact that the distance from the ultrasonic sensor 110
to the reflection position becomes short.       Therefore, even when a
part of or the entire banknote stacked on the stage 41 is made of
a transparent material through which light can pass,       the banknote
can be detected.    Moreover, the banknote stacked on the stage 41 can
be detected in a structure in which the stage 41 is fixed inside
the stacking unit 40,   or in a structure in which the stage 41 moves
in the up-down direction inside the stacking unit 40 depending on
the number of the stacked banknotes.       Moreover, for example, the
banknote can be detected similarly by providing the through part
41a in the support member 41 for supporting the banknote that is
transported    on  the transport   path  and  arranging   the  banknote
detection apparatus corresponding to the through part 41a.
[0061]        As explained above,   a paper sheet detection apparatus
according to one aspect of the present invention detects presence
or absence of a paper sheet in    a storing unit based on a change in
ultrasonic waves transmitted toward and received from the storing
unit.   The paper sheet detection apparatus includes a stage arranged
inside   the storing unit;   a through part    formed in  the stage;  a
transmitting unit that has a transmitting surface for transmitting
the ultrasonic waves and that is arranged above one side of the stage
with the transmitting surface facing downward; a receiving unit that

                                                 30
has a receiving surface for receiving the ultrasonic                                   waves and that
is arranged on other side of the stage with either the receiving
surface parallel to a vertical direction or the receiving surface
facing downward; and a reflecting                   unit     that     reflects        the ultrasonic
waves,      which were       transmitted        from the          transmitting             surface     and
passed through the through part,                  toward the receiving surface.                        The
through part       is   formed at such a position                   that,      when a paper sheet
is stored in the storing unit, at least a part of the ultrasonic
waves transmitted from the transmitting unit and passing through
the through part is blocked by the paper sheet.
 [0062]           A paper sheet detection apparatus according to another
aspect of the present invention detects presence or absence of a
paper sheet in        a storing      unit    based on a change in                 ultrasonic         waves
transmitted toward and received from the storing unit.                                         The paper
sheet      detection     apparatus         includes        a   stage        arranged         inside    the

transmitted from the transmitting                       surface,         so that      the ultrasonic
waves pass through the through part                     and reach the receiving surface.
The through part is            formed at such a position that, when a paper
sheet is supported by the support member, at least a part of the
ultrasonic      waves reflected          by the reflecting              unit  and passing through

 [0071]           A paper sheet detection apparatus according to still
another aspect of the present invention detects presence or absence
of a paper sheet based on a change in                        ultrasonic        waves transmitted
and     received.        The   paper       sheet       detection          apparatus          includes   a
support member that supports a paper sheet;                                a through part formed
in    the support member; a transmitting                      unit     that   has a transmitting

                                     34
surface for transmitting the ultrasonic waves and that is          arranged
above one side of the support member with the transmitting surface
facing downward; a receiving unit that has a receiving surface for
receiving   the   ultrasonic   waves   and   that   is  arranged   with  the
receiving surface facing downward on the same side on which the
transmitting unit is arranged with respect to the support member;
and a reflecting unit that reflects the ultrasonic waves, which were
transmitted from the transmitting surface and passed through the
through part,    so that the ultrasonic waves pass again through the
through part and reach the receiving unit.       The through part is formed
at such a position that, when a paper sheet is supported by the support
member, at least a part of the ultrasonic waves transmitted from
the transmitting unit is reflected from the paper sheet.
[0072]        In   the  above  paper   sheet   detection    apparatus,   the
support member supports the paper sheet in a transport path for
transporting the paper sheet.
[0073]        In   the  above  paper   sheet   detection    apparatus,   the
support member supports the paper sheet in a storing unit for storing
the paper sheet.
[0074]        In   the  above  paper   sheet   detection    apparatus,   the
transmitting unit and the receiving unit that performs transmission
and reception of the ultrasonic waves for detecting the paper sheet
are arranged such that one of the transmitting surface              and the
receiving surface faces downward and the other is           either parallel
to  the  vertical    direction   or  facing    downward.     Moreover,   the
transmitting unit and the receiving unit are arranged such that,
by using the reflecting unit, the ultrasonic waves transmitted and
received therebetween pass through the through part formed in            the

                                    35
support member for supporting the paper sheet such as the stage of
the storing unit and a transportation surface of the transport path.
In the paper sheet detection apparatus, because the ultrasonic waves
received by the receiving unit has changed when the through part
is  blocked by the paper sheet supported by the support member such
as the paper sheet stored in the storing unit and the paper sheet
transported on the transport path, the paper sheet can be detected
based on that change.     Because both the transmitting surface and the
receiving surface are parallel to the vertical direction or facing
downward, dust, trash, and the like does not easily stick to the
transmitting surface and the receiving surface.        Accordingly, the
paper    sheet  can  be  detected  with high precision     by using  the
ultrasonic waves.
 [0075]        As explained above, the paper sheet detection apparatus
according to the present invention is      useful in detecting with high
precision a paper sheet stored in a paper sheet storing unit and/or
a paper sheet transported on a paper sheet transport path.

specific    embodiments   for  a  complete   and clear  disclosure,  the
appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed
