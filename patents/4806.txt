  ABSTRACT
  The invention relates to crop netting materials, crop cover materials, and ground cover materials
  that transmit solar radiation in the visible wavelength range of about 420 to 720 nm at a level
  similar to the level that the materials transmit solar radiation in the infra red wavelength ranges of
5 about 700 to about 1000 nm and 1500 to about 1600 nm. The materials also absorb solar
  radiation in the UV wavelength range of about 300 to about 380 nm.

              'NETTING, CROP COVER, AND GROUND COVER MATERIALS'
   FIELD OF INVENTION
 5 The invention relates to netting materials, particularly but not exclusively to netting materials for
   use as bird netting, insect netting, shadecloth netting, windbreak netting, or hail protection
   netting for example or in other agricultural applications, and also to crop cover materials and
   ground cover materials.
10 BACKGROUND
   Bird netting, insect netting, shadecloth netting, windbreak netting, or hail protection netting may
   be placed near plants to protect for example annual plants, perennial plants, fruit trees, or grape
   vines, from birds, insects, excessive sun, wind, or hail. Typically the netting is supported over the
15 plant(s) and/or as a vertical and/or angled wall or walls near the plant(s), by for example cables
   or wires between posts positioned along the rows of plants in a garden, field crop, orchard or
   vineyard, or is draped over the plant(s) or is laid on the ground.
   A crop cover material such as film, or a woven material optionally coated with a film layer on one
20 or both sides is placed above the plant crop to protected it from birds, insects, rain, hail, wind
   and excessive sun. The addition of materials to the cover may occur to add in its properties, such
   as sun protection by increasing the level of shade.
   Woven or film ground cover materials are used in agriculture for a number of purposes including
25 weed suppression and/or soil warmth retention and/or moisture retention and/or for light
   reflecting and/or for soil cooling.
   Typically where a material is used primarily as a reflective ground cover for light enhancement,
   the material is rolled out in lengths onto the ground, and secured in place, beneath or between
30 rows of trees, vines, or plants, to increase the amount of light to which the plants and in
   particular fruit are exposed by reflection of light from the material towards the fruit above. The

                                                   -2
   material may also aid soil warmth retention and moisture retention. The material may also be
   used for reducing or control soil temperature to an optimum range for plant growth.
   It is an object of the present invention to provide improved netting, crop cover, and ground
 5 cover materials; and/or to at least provide the public with a useful choice.
   SUMMARY OF INVENTION
   In broad terms in one aspect the invention comprises a crop netting material which is knitted,
10 woven, or non-woven, from a synthetic monofilament,               multifilament yarn, or tape or
   combination thereof, formed from a resin comprising at least one pigment such that the
   monofilament, multifilament yarn, or tape:
        e  across a UV wavelength range about 300 to about 380 nm:
                   absorbs at least about 55% solar radiation on average, and
15                 transmits less than about 30% solar radiation on average;
        *  across a visible wavelength range about 420 to about 700 nm:
                   transmits at least about 10% solar radiation on average, and
                   reflects at least about 10% of solar radiation on average;
        e  across an infrared     wavelength range about 700 to about 1000 nm: transmits between
20         about 15% and about 80% of solar radiation on average;
        e  across an infrared wavelength range of 1500 to 1600 nm: transmits at least about 15% to
           about 90% solar radiation on average; and
        *  across an infrared wavelength range about 700 to about 1000 nm:
                   transmits not more than about 9% on average, and
25                 transmits not less than about 9% on average,
            of transmission across said visible wavelength range about 420 to about 700 nm; and/or
        e  across an infrared wavelength range about 1500 to about 1600 nm:

                                                    -3
                   transmits not more than about 9% on average, and

 5 Netting of the invention may be suitable for use in relation to plants which in the environment in
   which they are growing, without the netting of the invention, may suffer overheating (and
   reduced photosynthesis plus excessive plant repiration) and fruit sunburn. Netting of the
   invention also or alternatively may be suitable for use in providing an improved or controlled
   growing and/or fruit development environment.
10
   The netting across a UV wavelength range about 300 to about 380 nm absorbs at least about
   55% solar radiation on average. This may reduce fruit sunburn.
   The netting across this UV wavelength range transmits less than about 30% solar radiation on
15 average. This reduction in UV this assists in reducing sunburn effects on fruit. It also reduces the
   UV stress effects on the plant itself and aids in supporting lower temperatures.
   In some embodiments, the crop netting material across a UV wavelength range about 300 to
   about 380 nm:
20                 absorbs at least about 60% solar radiation on average, and
                   transmits less than about 30% solar radiation on average.
   The netting across a visible wavelength range about 420 to about 700 nm transmits at least about
   10% solar radiation on average. Visible light is required for plant photosynthesis.

   between about 15% to about 80% of solar radiation on average; and 1500 to about 1600 nm
   transmits between about 15% and about 90% of solar radiation on average. And the netting in
   the range of about 700 to about 1000 transmits not more than about 9% on average, and
 5 transmits not less than about 9% on average, of transmission across said visible wavelength range
   about 420 to about 700 nm. And the netting in the range of about across an infrared wavelength
   range of about 1500 to about 1600 nm transmits not more than about 9% on average, and
   transmits not less than about 9% on average, of transmits not less than about 9% on average, of
   transmission across said visible wavelength range about 700 to about 1000 nm. The netting
10 therefore may reduce heating beneath the netting relative to certain prior art netting.

                    transmits not less than about 8% on average or not less than about 7% on
                    average,
25           of transmission across said visible wavelength range about 700 to about 1000 nm.
   The netting and crop cover material across the UV wavelength range indicated transmits less than
   about 30% solar radiation on average. This reduction in UV assists in reducing sunburn effects

                                                   - 12
   on fruit. It also reduces the UV stress effects on the plant itself and aids in lower support lower
   temperatures.
   The ground cover material in the UV wavelength range indicated transmits less than about 20%
 5 solar radiation on average. This reduction in the UV assists in reducing the damage effects high
   UV transmission has in the plastic polymers plus reduce any soil warming effects it may have.
   In some embodiments, the monofilament, yarn, or tape has a total solar absorption of greater
   than about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, or about 75% or about 80% or about 85%.
10
   In some embodiments, the monofilament, yarn, or tape has a total solar reflectance of greater
   than about 45%, about 40%, about 35%, about 30%, or about 25% or about 20% or about 15%.
   Typically the netting is supported over the plant(s) and/or as a vertical and/or angled wall or
15 walls near the plant(s), or on the ground itself, by for example cables or wires between posts
   positioned along the rows of plants in a garden, fieldcrop, orchard or vineyard, or is draped over
   the plant(s),as bird netting, insect netting (for repelling for example mosquitoes, or as for
   example bee exclusion netting), shadecloth netting, windbreak netting, or hail protection. Netting
   may be placed near plants to protect for example annual plants, perennial plants, fruit trees, or
20 grape vines, vegetable plants, from birds, insects, excessive sun, wind, or hail. The netting has
   some reflective due to the white pigment(s) referred to above, visible light incident on the netting
   i.e. on the monofilament, yarn, or tapes thereof, is reflected. A portion of incident light hits the
   netting such that it is reflected away but some light although undergoing a change in direction
   due to reflection from the netting nonetheless enters the plants but is diffused and hence more
25 favourable for more even light distribution of the plant, and hits the plants and particularly fruit
   or vegetables below or adjacent the netting canopy and creates an environment that is favourable
   for plant growth and/or fruit or vegetable development, and an environment suited to beneficial
   organisms (insects, bacteria and fungi etc) and less favoured by some non beneficial organisms of
   the plant or fruits or vegetables. Light not hitting the netting passes directly through the netting
30 air space to the plants and fruit. Light hitting the sides of the net yarn will be reflected in part to
   the space above the net and in part to the plants below the net which will contribute to the light
   diffusion properties of the net.

                                                    - 13
   As described above, the netting material of the present invention has increased reflectivity in the
   infrared wavelength range in proportion to the visible or photosynthetic active solar radiation. In
   nets placed over plants to give some heat reduction typical involves also reduction in visible light
 5 as well. In some cases the amount of the visible light reduction is excessive just to obtain a
   certain amount of heart reduction. The advantage of the heat reduction comes at a cost of
   reduced photosynthetic active light. Hence is a net that reduces more heat with less reduction of
   photosynthetic active light then this is an advantage. Accordingly, heating of the surface of the
   netting material and heat transfer through the netting material is reduced.               This can be
10 advantageous, for example, where it is desirable to provide lower temperature environments for
   the growth of certain plants under canopies of the netting material or for soil covered by the
   netting material or with ground covers material of the present invention. The reflection of the
   heat is preferable to heat absorption in the case of heart absorbing pigments such as carbon black
   or others as it places the heat away from the plant zone, as absorbing material gives the
15 unfavourable opportunity for the heat to be transferred to the plant environment by conduction
   or convention.
   Also as described above, the netting material has increased transmittance of light in the visible
   wavelength region, due to reduced scattering. In some cases with direct unfiltered light the parts
20 of the plant in the top part of the tree received visible light such that the leaves are light saturated
   and the parts of the plant in the lower part are not working optimal due to insufficient visible
   light. The creation or the increasing the amount of diffuse light enables the light to be used more
   efficiently by the plant. Hence by providing a plant with a net that gives heat reduction but also
   increased diffuse light then this gives an advantage over a net that gives the same heat reduction
25 but with less diffused visible light. Accordingly, increased amounts of light in the visible
   wavelength region can pass through, for example, canopies of the netting material to plants and
   fruit beneath. This may assist in growth of the plants and the growth and/or ripening of fruit.
   The transmission, absorbance, and reflection properties of the netting, crop cover, and ground
30 cover materials of the invention may achieved by the inclusion of at least one pigment in the
   resin from which monofilament, multifilament yarn, or tape from which the netting, crop cover,
   or ground material are formed. The pigment or combination of pigments selected will depend

                                                  - 14

   pigment or a combination of two or more pigments that together provide the desired
   transmission, absorbance, and reflection properties.

20 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
   Netting, crop cover, or ground cover material of the invention may be knitted, woven or non
   woven from a synthetic monofilament, yarn (multifilament and non-multifilament), or tape or a
   combination thereof, formed from a resin comprising sufficient of at least one pigment the
25 desired light transmission, reflection, and absorption properties described herein.
   In one embodiment the monofilament, yarn, or tape is formed from a resin comprising at least
   one pigment, which resin has been formed by mixing a masterbatch consisting essentially of 10
   or 20 to 90% by weight of the pigment(s) and a first polymer, with a second polymer. The first
30 polymer may be a mixture of polymers as may the second polymer. The masterbatch may be in
   the form of thermoplastic granules. The pigment(s) may be added to the first polymer or mix of
   polymers when heated to be liquid or flowable and is vigorously mixed to distribute the pigment

                                                   - 27
   evenly, and the first polymer comprising the mixed pigment(s) is then formed into solid granules
   on cooling. The first polymer or polymers acts to bind the pigment(s) into granules enabling solid
   granulation of the mixture, the masterbatch; for ease of handling in a subsequent monofilament,
   yarn, fibre, or tape manufacturing process. The masterbatch is then mixed with a second polymer
 5 and may be mixed in a letdown range of 4 or 5 to 50% of the masterbatch to the second polymer
   or polymers, to form the mixture from which the monofilament, yarn, or tape is then
   manufactured. Monofilament may be extruded; synthetic yarn may be formed by known methods
   including extrusion of individual fibres which are then twisted to form a yarn. Tape may be
   extruded directly or the resin may be extruded into sheet form which may then be cut to tapes
10 suitable for knitting or weaving into netting. Nonwoven netting may be formed by random
   binding at numerous irregular crossing points, of thermoplastic monofilament, yarn, or tape, by
   application of heat and pressure.
   The first polymer and the second polymer may be the same or different and may be any suitable
15 polyolefin such as polyethylene or polypropylene, for example, or a mixture thereof, or an
   ethylene alpha-olefin, or a polyester, or a biopolymer, or a blend of any of the foregoing. Certain
   plastics are particularly useful when present as minor or major components.          Ethylene vinyl
   acetate (EVA), ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA) and ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA) are useful for
   imparting elasticity and other properties.     Polyesters and polystyrene, styrene-butdienie (SB),
20 acrylonitrile-butadienie-styrene  (ABS), styrene-aciylonitrile (SAN), polyethylenie terephithialate
   (PET), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polycarbonate are useful as dye carriers and also for
   influencing radiation (reflecting, absorbing and transmission) properties and also other properties
   on the materials.     Starch and other plant polymers are useful to increase biodegradability.
   Alternatively the material may comprise in part or whole of paper, wood or cellulose fibre, starch
25 based polymers, casein, latex or in any combination of the above and/or with petroleum derived
   plastic polymers.    In addition to the pigment the polymer or polymer blend may incorporate
   other agents such as a UV stabiliser or combination of stabilisers and processing aid or aids.
   The at least one pigment in the resin from which the netting or ground cover material is formed
30 provides the material with improved transmittance of visible light relative to the amount of
   infrared light transmitted by the material, and increased absorption of UV light.

                                                    - 28
   In some embodiments, the at least one pigment is a single pigment that provides improved
   transmittance of visible light relative to the amount of infrared light transmitted by the material,
   and increased absorption       of UV light.     In some embodiments, the at least one pigment
   comprises two or more individual pigments that provide the desired transmission and absorption
 5 properties.
   In one embodiment, the at least one pigment comprises a particulate material. The particulate
   material may be white, coloured or colourless. In some exemplary embodiments, the particulate
   material comprises at least one white pigment. In some embodiments, the particulate material is
10 a microvoiding pigment, as described herein.
   In some embodiments the at least one pigment comprises at least one white pigment. In some
   embodiments, the at least one white pigment comprises an inorganic white pigment.
15 In certain embodiments the at least one white pigment comprises a white zirconium, strontium,
   barium, magnesium, zinc, calcium, titanium, or potassium pigment or a combination thereof.
   In some embodiments, the white pigment comprises zirconium dioxide, magnesium zirconate,
   calcium zirconate, strontium zirconate, barium zirconate, zirconium silicate, zinc sulphide,
   calcium carbonate, barium sulphate, magnesium oxide, strontium carbonate, barium carbonate,

   tin oxide, titanium dioxide, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, zinc sulphide, zinc sulphate, dipotassium
   titanium trioxide, potassium oxide, potassium titanate, magnesium carbonate, aluminium oxide,
   aluminium hydroxide, or a combination thereof.
25 In some embodiments, the at least one white pigment comprises zirconium dioxide, magnesium
   zirconate, calcium zirconate, strontium zirconate, barium zirconate, zirconium silicate, zinc
   sulphide, calcium carbonate, barium sulphate, magnesium oxide, strontium carbonate, barium
   carbonate, titanium dioxide, potassium oxide, potassium titanate or a combination thereof.
30 In certain embodiments, the white pigment comprises a white zirconium, strontium, barium,
   magnesium or calcium pigment, or a combination thereof.

                                                 - 29
   In certain embodiments, the white pigment comprises zirconium dioxide, magnesium zirconate,

   barium sulphate, magnesium oxide, strontium carbonate, barium carbonate, dipotassium titanium
   trioxide, and potassium titanate, magnesium carbonate, aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide,
 5 or a combination thereof.
   In some embodiments, the white pigment is selected from the group consisting of zirconium
   dioxide, barium sulphate, calcium carbonate, and titanium dioxide.
10 In some embodiments, the white pigment is selected from the group consisting of zirconium
   dioxide, barium sulphate, calcium carbonate.
   In some embodiments, the white pigment is selected from the group consisting of barium
   sulphate, calcium carbonate, and titanium dioxide.
15
   In some embodiments, the white pigment is selected from the group consisting of barium
   sulphate and calcium carbonate.       In some embodiments the barium sulphate or calcium
   carbonate is provided in an amount of 12% to 30% by weight.            In some embodiments said
   barium sulphate or calcium carbonate is in the form of particles of size 0.5-3 microns.
20
   In some embodiments, the white pigment is selected from the group consisting of calcium
   carbonate and titanium dioxide.
   In some embodiments, the white pigment comprises a titanium pigment, a calcium pigment, or a
25 combination thereof.
   In one exemplary embodiment, the white pigment is titanium dioxide. In some embodiments,
   the titanium dioxide is present in an amount of 0.1% to about 4% by weight of the material. In
   some embodiments, the titanium dioxide is present in an amount of 1% to about 4% by weight
30 of the material. In some embodiments, the titanium dioxide is conventional titanium dioxide. In
   some embodiments, the titanium dioxide is non-conventional titanium dioxide, as described
   herein.

                                                   - 30
   In some embodiments, the white pigment is calcium carbonate.
   In some embodiments, the at least one white pigment comprises a UV absorbing pigment or a
 5 UV reflecting pigment.       In some embodiments, the at least one pigment comprises a UV
   reflecting white pigment and UV absorbing pigment; or a UV absorbing white pigment.
   In some embodiments, the at least one white pigment comprises a microvoiding pigment as
   described herein.    In some embodiments, the microvoiding pigment is a UV reflecting white
10 pigment.     In some embodiments, the at least one pigment comprises a microvoiding UV
   reflecting white pigment and a UV absorbing pigment.
   As described herein, the UV absorbing pigment reduced the amount of UV light reflected within
   the material, which may cause photodegradation, and reduced the amount of UV light
15 transmitted by the material.     Reduced transmission of UV light in netting and crop cover
   materials can also reduce sunburn on, for example, fruit and vegetables beneath the canopy of
   the netting or crop cover, and other UV related stress on plants.
   The at least one white pigment may comprise one or more white pigments in the form of
20 particles. In some embodiments, the at least one white pigment is a particulate material.
   In some embodiments, the at least one pigment comprises titanium dioxide substantially in the
   rutile crystal form. Titanium dioxide in rutile crystal form is capable of scattering near-infrared
   light while also providing low scattering and low absorbance of visible light. Such properties may
25 be obtained when the titanium dioxide has an average particle size as defined above.
   Titanium dioxide substantially in the rutile crystal form and having a large average particle size, as
   defined herein, is distinct from conventional pigmentary titanium dioxide and may be referred to
   herein as non-conventional titanium dioxide.
30
   Titanium dioxide in the rutile form having an average particle size as defined above reflects
   significantly more near-infrared light and less visible light than conventional titanium dioxide

                                                     -31
   pigment. The reflection in the visible spectrum as a percent of incoming radiation is more similar
   to the infrared spectrum, while convential titanium dioxide reflects more visible light in
   proportion to the infrared spectrum.         Such non-conventional titanium dioxide is commercially
   available, for example, from Huntsman Corporation under the trade name Altiris® 550 and
 5 Altiris® 800 and from Tayca Corporation under the trade name JR-1000.
   WO 2011/101657 Al, WO 2011/101658 Al, and WO 2011/101659 Al, each of which is
   incorporated herein by reference, describe titanium dioxide in the rutile crystal form having a
   large average particle size, relative to conventional pigmentary titanium dioxide.
10
   As described therein, crystal size is distinct from particle size. Crystal size relates to the size of
   the fundamental crystals which make up the particulate material. Crystals may aggregate to form
   larger particles. For example, conventional titanium dioxide in the rutile crystal form has a crystal
   size of about 0.17 vm - 0.29 vm and a particle size of about 0.25              m - 0.40      ym,  while
15 conventional titanium dioxide in the anatase crystal form has a crystal size of about 0.10 vm
   0.25 [m and a particle size of about 0.20 im - 0.40 im. Particle size is affected by factors such
   as the crystal size and milling technique used during production.
   In some embodiments, the particle size of the titanium dioxide is greater than the crystal size. In
20 other embodiments, the particle size of the titanium dioxide is about equal to the crystal size. In
   one embodiment, the average particle size is about equal to the average crystal size. In another
   embodiment, the ratio of the average particle size to the average crystal size ratio is less than 1.4.
   The crystal size and particle size of the titanium dioxide may be determined by methods well
25 known to those skilled in the art. For example, the crystal size may be determined by
   transmission electron microscopy on a sample and analysis of the resulting image.
   The particulate material comprises titanium dioxide substantially in the rutile crystal form because
   of its high refractive index. In sone embodiment, greater than 90% by weight of the titanium
30 dioxide, greater than 95% by weight of the titanium dioxide, or greater than 99% by weight of the
   titanium dioxide, is in the rutile crystal form. In some embodiments, the particulate material may
   further comprise titanium dioxide in the anatase crystal form.

                                                   -  32
   The titanium dioxide may by prepared using natural ores such as ilmenite and mineral rutile,
   enriched ores such as titanium slag and beneficiated ilmenite, or both as the starting raw material.
   The titanium dioxide may be prepared by modifying known processes for the preparation of
 5 titanium dioxide.    Examples of known processes include but are not limited to the sulfate,
   chloride, fluoride, hydrothermal, aerosol and leaching processes. To provide the desired titanium
   dioxide, each of these processes is modified by: (a) treating at a higher temperature, for example,
   900'C or higher; (b) treating for a longer period of time, for example, 5 hours or more; (c)
   increasing or reducing typical levels of growth moderators present during the process; and/or (d)
10 reducing the typical level of rutile seeds.       In some embodiments, the titanium dioxide is
   commercially available.
   In some embodiments, the titanium dioxide comprises doped titanium dioxide. As used herein,
   "doped titanium dioxide" refers to titanium dioxide that includes one or more dopants which
15 have been incorporated during preparation of the titanium dioxide.            The dopants may be
   incorporated by known processes. Examples of dopants include, but are not limited to, calcium,
   magnesium, sodium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, aluminum, antimony,
   phosphorus, niobium or cesium.        In some embodiments, the dopant is incorporated in an
   amount of no more than 30% by weight, no more than 15% by weight, orno more than 5% by
20 weight, based on the total weight of the titanium dioxide. In some embodiments, the dopant is
   incorporated in an amount of from 0.1 to 30% by weight, or 0.5 to 15% by weight, or I to 5% by
   weight, relative to the total weight of the titanium dioxide. Typically, the doped titanium dioxide
   issubstantially in the rutile crystal form because of its high refractive index. In some
   embodiments, the particulate material may further comprise doped titanium dioxide in an anatase
25 crystal form.
   In one embodiment, the doped titanium dioxide is nickel antimony titanate or chromium
   antimony titanate. In another embodiment, the doped titanium oxide is chromium antimony
   titanate.
30
   In certain embodiments, the dopant is incorporated by adding a salt of the dopant to the pulp
   during preparation of the titanium dioxide. In some embodiments, the dopant is manganese,

                                                  -33
   aluminium or potassium.         In certain embodiments, manganese sulphate is added at a
   concentration of < 0.2% by weight (wt/wt). For example, manganese sulphate may be added at a
   concentration of from 0.01 to 0.2% by weight (wt/wt). In other embodiments, A12 0        3 and K 20
   are added to the pulp. For example, from 0.01 to 0.5% by weight of A12 0      3 (wt/wt) and 0.01 to
 5 0.5% by weight of K20 (wt/wt) may be added to the pulp. In a particular embodiment, 0.05%>
   by weight of A12 0   3 (wt/wt) and 0.2%> by weight of K2 0      (wt/wt) are added to the pulp. In
   another particular embodiment, 0.2%> by weight K 2 0         (wt/wt) and 0.2%> by weight A12 0      3
   (wt/wt) are added to the pulp.
10 In some embodiments, the particulate material comprises coated titanium dioxide.
   In some embodiments, the coated titanium dioxide provides UV light protection without also
   increasing UV light activated photocatalytic effects, which are generally observed with
   conventional titanium dioxide. Such coated titanium dioxide can provide netting material with
15 improved durability/longevity to UV light exposure. In some embodiments, the coated titanium
   dioxide also has low visible scattering.
   In some embodiments, the coated titanium dioxide comprises coated doped titanium dioxide. In
   certain embodiments, the titanium dioxide is doped with a dopant that can act as recombination
20 centres for holes and electrons. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that increased
   recombination provides decreased UV stimulated photocatalytic activity. In one embodiment,
   the dopant is chromium, manganese, and/or vanadium.
   The coated titanium dioxide is prepared by depositing an effects coating material onto the
25 particles surface. With such coating, the titanium dioxide exhibits increased UV light protective
   capability as compared to conventional pigmentary crystal size titanium dioxide. It also exhibits
   reduced photocatalytic activity and improved dispersibilty.
   The titanium dioxide may be milled, since the optical performance depends on reducing the
30 average particle size so that it tends towards the crystal size. The titanium dioxide may be wet
   milled (e.g. sand or bead milled) and may be subsequently separated from the aqueous medium by
   coating the particles with, for example, aluminium oxyhydroxide. The titanium dioxide must be

                                                    - 34
   dispersed prior to milling. A crude alumina coating renders the titanium dioxide flocculent at
   neutral pH, facilitating filtration and washing prior to drying.
   The coatings may be used to impart, for example, dispersibilty, photocatalytic inertness, or
 5 photostability.
   Coating materials suitable for use include those commonly used to coat an inorganic oxide or
   hydrous oxide onto the surface of particles. Typical inorganic oxides and hydrous oxides include
   oxides and/or hydrous oxides of silicon, aluminum, titanium, zirconium, magnesium, zinc,
10 cerium, phosphorus, or tin, for example,        A12 0 3 , SiO 2 , ZrO 2 , CeO 2 , P20 5 , sodium silicate,
   potassium silicate, sodium aluminate, aluminum chloride, aluminum sulphate, and                 mixtures
   thereof. The amount of coating coated onto the surface of the titanium dioxide or doped
   titanium dioxide may range from about 0.1% by weight to about 20% by weight of the inorganic
   oxide and/or hydrous oxide relative to the total weight of the titanium dioxide or doped titanium
15 dioxide.
   Coating materials suitable for use also include, silica, dense amorphous silica, zirconia, aluminium
   phosphate, titania, tin, antimony, manganese and cerium. In some embodiments, the coating is
   white or colourless.
20
   Particles of the titanium dioxide may be coated with any suitable amount of coating material. In
   some embodiments, the particles are coated with the coating material at a level of up to about 7%
   by weight. In certain embodiments, the level is from about 0.1% to about 7% by weight or from
   about 0.2% to about 7% by weight, relative to the total weight of titanium dioxide.
25
   In some embodiments, the particles comprise a dense silica coating, an alumina coating, a
   zirconia coating or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the particles comprise a
   coating of from 1-3% alumina and/or 2-4% silica.
30 In some embodiments, two or more coating materials may be used to coat the particles. The
   coatings may be applied simultaneously to produce a single layer or successively to produce two
   or more layers, wherein each layer may have a different composition. In one embodiment, the

   particles are coated with silica, such as dense silica, to produce a first layer, and also with zirconia
   to produce a second layer.
   Coated titanium dioxide may be prepared by treating titanium dioxide with a coating material, as
 5 known in the art. For example, the titanium dioxide may be dispersed in water along with the
   coating material, and the pH of the solution adjusted to precipitate the desired hydrated oxide to
   form a coating on the surface of the particulate material. After coating, the coated material may
   be washed and dried before being ground, for example, in a fluid energy mill or micronizer, to
   separate agglomerates formed during coating. At this milling stage, an organic surface treatment,
10 may also be applied.
   The titanium dioxide particles may be milled prior to coating.            In some embodiments, the
   particles may be dry milled, for example with a Raymond mill, or they may be wet milled, for
   example with a fine media mill or sandmill, or both. Generally, to wet mill, the particles are
15 dispersed in water and ground into sub micrometer sized particles to form an aqueous slurry.
   In another embodiment, the particles may be dry milled using a Raymond mill and then wet
   milled in a fine media mill containing Ottawa sand. During wet milling, the particles may be
   slurried to 350 grams/litre and milled for 30 minutes. After wet milling, the sand may be
20 separated from the slurry, such as by settling or any other suitable means to form the aqueous
   slurry.
   Particles may be coated by adding a suitable coating material to the aqueous slurry prior to or
   during a pH adjustment to effect precipitation. For example, the effect coating material may be
   added to the aqueous slurry first, followed by pH adjustment; alternatively, the pH of the
25 aqueous slurry may be adjusted while the effect coating material is being added to the aqueous
   slurry.
   Suitable coating materials include, but are not limited to, salts such as zirconium sulphate,
   phosphoric acid, and sodium silicate. In the case of zirconium sulphate, zirconyl oxy hydroxide
30 may be precipitated onto the surface of the particles to coat the particles; in the case of sodium
   silicate, silica may be precipitated onto the surface of the particles to coat the particles.

                                                   - 36
   In one exemplary embodiment, the aqueous slurry comprising particles of titanium dioxide is
   introduced into a tank for stirring. The temperature of the aqueous slurry may then be adjusted
   to 75 0 C and its pH adjusted to 10.5. The coating material may then be introduced into the stirred
   tank in an amount sufficient to produce the desired coating. For example, to produce a 1% by
 5 weight dense silica coating, 1% silica (%wt/wt on titanium dioxide) is added to the stirred tank
   over 30 minutes and mixed for 30 minutes. Similarly, to produce a 3% by weight dense silica
   coating, 3% silica (%wt/wt on titanium dioxide) is added. In one embodiment, the coating
   material used to provide a silica coating is sodium silicate.
10 To precipitate a dense silica coating onto the particles, the pH may be adjusted by adding
   sulphuric acid to the stirred tank. In a particular embodiment, sulphuric acid is added over 60
   minutes to bring the pH to 8.8 and then over 35 minutes to further adjust the pH to 1.3.
   The particles of titanium dioxide or doped titanium dioxide coated with dense silica may then be
15 coated with an alumina coating to, for example, assist onward processing such as filtration. In
   one embodiment, the particles are further coated with 0.6% by weight alumina by adding caustic
   sodium aluminate to the stirred tank over 25 minutes to bring the pH to 10.25, at which point the
   contents of the tank are mixed for 20 minutes. Sulphuric acid can then be added to the tank to
   adjust the pH to 6.5.
20
   After coating, the coated titanium dioxide or doped titanium dioxide may then be washed and
   dried before grinding in, for example, a micronizer or fluid energy mill. Generally, this grinding
   step separates particles that have aggregated during the coating and/or drying procedures.
25 During this grinding step the coated material may be treated with a surface treatment. Surface
   treatments include, for example, organic surface treatments such as treatment with polyols,
   amines, and silicone derivatives. In one embodiment, the organic surface treatment comprises
   treatment with trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, triethanolamine, n-octyl phosphonic acid,
   trimethylolethane, or a combination thereof.        Organic surface treatments may improve the
30 dispersibilty of the coated titanium dioxide.

   In one embodiment, the coated titanium dioxide particles are treated to selectively remove
   particular size fractions. In one embodiment, particles greater than or equal to 5 vm in diameter
   are removed.     In another embodiment, particles greater than or equal to 3 um in diameter are
   removed.     Any suitable method for removal may be used.        In some embodiments, selective
 5 removal may be performed by centrifugation.
   The titanium dioxide may be dispersed within suitable vehicle for incorporation into the resin.
   In certain embodiments, non-conventional titanium dioxide is incorporated into the netting
   material in an amount from about 0.5% to about 4.0% by weight of the material.          In certain
10 embodiments non-conventional titanium dioxide is incorporated into the netting material in an
   amount from about 1% to about 4.0% by weight of the material. In certain embodiments non
   conventional titanium dioxide is incorporated into the netting material in an amount of 0.2%,
   0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5%, 5%, or 6%.
15 In some embodiments, the at least one pigment consists essentially of non-conventional titanium
   dioxide. In certain embodiments, the at least one pigment is non-conventional titanium dioxide.
   As shown, in the Figures such non-conventional titanium dioxide advantageously has the desired
   absorbance, reflectance, and transmittance profile.
20
   In one embodiment, the at least one pigment comprises conventional titanium dioxide. Such
   titanium dioxide is readily commercially available.
   Conventional pigmentary titanium dioxide is typically used in the netting material in combination
25 with at least one additional pigment. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the at least one
   pigment comprises conventional titanium dioxide and at least one additional pigment.
   In certain embodiments, the additional pigment comprises a particulate material that forms
   microvoids on stretching the monofilament, yarn, multifilament yarn, or tape from which the
30 netting material is formed or a film material from which tape is cut. In some embodiments, the
   microvoiding pigment is barium sulphate and/or calcium carbonate.

                                                    - 38
   In some embodiments, the netting material comprises microvoids in the material. In some
   embodiments, the microviods have been formed by stretching monofilament, yarn, or tape from
   which the netting material is formed or a film material from which tape is cut.
 5 In some embodiments, the at least one pigment comprises a particulate material that forms
   microvoids when monofilament, yarn, or tape from which the netting material is formed or a film
   material from which tape is cut is stretched. Such particulate materials may be referred to herein
   as microvoiding pigments.       Stretching monofilament, yarn, or tape from which the netting
   material is formed which comprises microvoiding pigments causes the pigment to to at least
10 partially debond or separate from the polymer(s) of the resin from which the monofilament, yarn
   or tape of the netting material is formed. In some embodiments, the microvoids are formed by
   stretching mono-axially or bi-axially. For many applications mono-orientation is preferred with
   tapes being stretched to a length of at least 5 times greater or more.
15 The microvoids create areas in which the difference in refractive index between the air and the
   polymer(s) results in light scattering. The presence of microvoids in the material contribute to
   the reflectance and transmittance properties of the material. In some embodiments, stretching
   monofilament, yarn, or tape from which the netting material is formed or a film material from
   which tape is cutto create microvoids increases the opacity of the monofilament, yarn, tape or
20 film material.
   In some embodiments, the microvoiding pigment is at least partially debonded or separated from
   the polymer(s) of the resin to create the microvoids is an inorganic pigment.
25 In some embodiments, the microvoiding pigment is a is a white pigment. In some embodiments,
   the white microvoiding pigment is an inorganic pigment.           In some embodiments, the white
   inorganic pigment is a metal salt or oxide. In some embodiments the white inorganic pigment
   that create micro voids is barium sulphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium zirconate, calcium
   zirconate, strontium zirconate, barium zirconate, zirconium silicate, or a combination thereof.

   In exemplary embodiments, the white pigment that creates microvoids is zirconium dioxide,
   barium sulphate and/or calcium carbonate. In exemplary embodiments, the white pigment that

                                                  -39
   creates microvoids is barium sulphate and/or calcium carbonate.        In one embodiment, the
   microvoiding pigment is calcium carbonate.
   The stretching or orienting the polymer/pigment mixture also assists the development of thermic
 5 properties of the material.
   In some embodiments, the microvoiding pigment is barium sulphate or calcium carbonate, as a
   mineral obtained from mining or as a precipitate from manufacturing. In one embodiment, the
   pigment is processed to a fine micron size in the range 0.05 to 10 microns.              In some
10 embodiments, the size is in the range 0.5-3 microns or 0.7-1.0 micron. Other useful white
   pigments for use as microvoiding pigments are described above.
   In some embodiments, the material comprises comprises microvoids that have been formed by
   stretching monofilament, yarn, or tape from or a film material from which the tape is cut, formed
15 from a resin comprising at least one microvoiding pigment. In some embodiments, the resin
   further comprises a UV absorbing pigment. In some embodiments, the UV absorbing pigment is
   an inorganic pigment. In some embodiments , the UV absorbing pigment is titanium dioxide or
   zinc oxide.
20 In some embodiments, the at least one pigment comprises at least one UV absorbing pigment.
   In some embodiments, the UV absorbing pigment is an organic UV absorbing pigment or an
   inorganic UV absorbing pigment.
   In some embodiments the at least one pigment comprises an organic UV absorbing pigment. In
25 some embodiments the organic UV absorbing pigment is chosen from the group consisting of
   benzotriazole, cyanoacrylates, phenylacrylate, oxanilides, benzophenones, hydroxyphenyltriazines,
   hyrdoxyphenylbenzotriazole, tri and octyl methoxycinnamate, aminobenzoic acid, aminobenzoate
   and oxybenzone.
30 In some embodiments the organic UV absorbing pigment is added at a rate of 0.01% to 5% by
   weight.

                                                    - 40
   In some embodiments the at least one pigment comprises an inorganic UV absorbing pigment.
   In some embodiments, the UV absorbing pigment is a white pigment or colourless pigment. In
   some embodiments the inorganic UV absorbing pigment is clear or substantially clear. In some
   embodiments the inorganic clear or substantially clear UV absorbing pigment is chosen from the
 5 group consisting of nano zinc oxide and cerium dioxide.
   In some embodiments the inorganic clear UV absorbing pigment is added at a rate of 0.1% to
   5% by weight.
10 In some embodiments the at least one pigment comprises an inorganic white UV absorbing
   pigment. In some embodiments the inorganic white UV absorbing pigment is chosen from the
   group consisting of barium titanate, magnesium titanate, strontium titanate, neodymium titanate,
   tin oxide, titanium oxide, titanium dioxide, silica, alumina, zinc oxide, zinc sulphide, zinc sulphate,
   zirconium silicate and magnesium oxide.          In some embodiments, the inorganic white UV
15 absorbing pigment is titanium dioxide.
   In some embodiments the inorganic white UV absorbing pigment is added at a rate of 0.1% to
   5% by weight.
20 The at least one UV absorbing pigment is present in the monofilament, multifilament yarn, or
   tape in an amount such that the material has the desired absorbance profile. The UV absorbing
   pigment decreases the reflectance in the 280-400nm or 300-380nm range by increasing UV
   absorbance.      Increasing the absorbance in the UV range improves the life of the polymer by
   protecting the polymer from UV light, and reduces plants exposure to excessive amounts of UV
25 light, which may cause sunburn.       The UV absorbing pigment absorbs UV light before free
   radicals can be produced by interaction of the UV light waves with the polymer.
   In some embodiments, the at least one pigment comprises an UV absorbing pigment and one or
   more additional pigments. In one embodiment, the additional pigment is an inorganic pigment,
30 an organic pigment, or a mixture thereof.

   zirconate, zirconium silicate, zinc sulphide, calcium carbonate, barium sulphate, magnesium
   oxide,  strontium carbonate, barium carbonate, potassium oxide, conventional pigmentary
   titanium dioxide, and combinations thereof.
10
   In some embodiments, the additional pigment is a white or colourless organic pigment.
   In some embodiments, the additional pigment is coloured. Including a coloured pigment in the
   resin can provide the netting or ground cover material with a coloured tint. The pigment selected
15 depends on the desired colour.
   In some embodiments, the coloured pigment is a single coloured pigment or a mixture of two or
   more coloured pigments that provide the desired colour.
20 In some embodiments, the coloured pigment is an inorganic or organic coloured pigment.
   Examples     of coloured     organic   pigments   include   azo,  anthraquinone,   phthalocyanine,
   perinone/perylene,    indigo/ thioindigo,  dioxazine,   quinacridone,  isoindolinone,  isoindoline,
   diketopyrrolopyrrole, azomethine and azomethine-azo pigments.
25 In some embodiments, the additional pigment(s) decreases the amount of infrared light
   transmitted and/or increases the amount of visible light transmitted.
   In embodiments where the at least one pigment comprises two or more individual pigments, the
   individual pigments may be combined by any suitable method known in the art. In one
30 embodiment, the pigments are combined by mixing. In some embodiments, the pigments are
   combined before addition to the polymer(s) of the resin. In some embodiments, the pigments

                                                    - 42

   In some embodiments the material is of denier 50 to 2000 or 100 to 1000 and most typically 300
   to 800 or 400 to 600.
   The material may be constructed to have a higher knitted or woven or non-woven density in

30 Typically reflective netting of the invention has a cover factor of 50% or less. Where the netting
   is knitted shade cloth however, for example, it may have a higher cover factor, up to 95% but

                                                  - 44

   In some embodiments reflective netting of the invention may comprise air space apertures
 5 through the material of widest dimension about 30mm. In other embodiments reflective netting
   of the invention may comprise air space apertures through the material of widest dimension
   about 20mm. In some embodiments reflective netting of the invention may comprise air space
   apertures through the material of widest dimension in the range 10-30mm and also in the range
   of 1 to 10mm.

   In some embodiments, the netting material has a form substantially as depicted in any one of the
   accompanying Figures.
   As referred to previously the netting may be knitted or woven or formed in a non-woven
15 construction, from monofilament, yarn, or tape or a combination. Yarn may comprise multiple
   synthetic fibres twisted together (multifilaments). Tape may for example be formed by extruding
   synthetic sheet material from the resin, and then cutting the extruded sheet material to form long
   tapes of typically I to 5mm of width.
20 The yarn or tape from which the netting, crop cover, or ground cover is formed has reflectance
   in the near infrared wavelength range, and reflects at least 10%, or 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%,
   45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, or 90% or more light within this wavelength
   range.
25 In some embodiments the material is a ground cover material, which may be a woven material
   woven from flat warp and weft tapes of a plastics material. The tapes may be formed by
   extruding a film material from a polymer resin and then cutting the film into tapes which are in
   turn used to weave the material, or by extruding individual tapes. Optionally a woven material
   may be coated on at least one side with a coating which closes any porosity in the woven
30 material. Alternatively the ground cover material may be a film material.
   TRIALS

                                                  - 45
   Trial 1 - Crop cover effect on temperature
   A field trial was carried out on Blackberries in Oregon, United States of America to determine
   the effect of crop cover material according to the invention on temperature under the cover over
 5 time.
   Rain cover fabric (RCF) was installed over a hoop structure that measured 14 foot at the apex.
   The RCF was approximately 12 feet in height where it crossed the row of blackberry bushes
   which were pruned to approximately 6 foot at the start of the trial. Data was collected from the
10 east row of the coverage. Distance of the RCF above the bushes started at 6 feet above the
   bushes and moved higher to the apex of the hoop which is between the two covered rows.
   The RCF panel covering the blackberries was comprised of 4 individual 40' panels sewn together
   for an overall length of 160'.
15
   The temperature sensor was a TempRecord Multi-Trip MK III combination sensor/data logger
   unit. The loggers were placed directly over the east row of the two rows covered by the RCF
   panels. Loggers were placed at 78 inches above ground level.
20 The RCF material was woven non-pigmented polymer material plus stabilisers, with a plastic
   coating on the top and on the bottom, as follows:
   Top coating:            LDPE 25gsm
   Woven polymer:          HDPE 105gsm
   Bottom coating:         LDPE 25gsm.
25
   RCFI had 0% Altiris 800@ added to the coating
   RCF2 had 1% Altiris 800@added to the coating
   RCF3 had 2% Altiris 800@added to the coating
   RCF4 had 3% Altiris 800@added to the coating.

   Tables I and 2 below show the percentage of time at certain temperatures under the RCF1,
   RCF2, RCF3, and RCF4.

                                                 - 46
  As can be seen from the data below, the addition of Altiris to the coating of the RCF material
  provides a reduction in the period of time that high temperatures of over 30'C were reached.

   Trial 2 - Crop cover material effect on sunburn
   A field trial was carried out on Blackberries in Albany, Oregon, United States of America to
   determine the effect of crop cover material of the invention on sunburn.
 5
   The rows were 10 feet wide with two rows covered by each RCF panel. The rows were running
   from North to South.
   A RCF was installed over a hoop structure that measures 14 foot at the apex. The RCF was
10 approximately 12 feet in height where it crossed the row of blackberry bushes which were pruned
   to approximately 6 foot at the start of the trial. Data was collected from the east row of the
   coverage. Distance of the RCF above the bushes started at 6 feet above the bushes and moved
   higher to the apex of the hoop which is between the two covered rows.
15 The RCF panel covering the blackberries was comprised of 4 individual 40' panels sewn together
   for an overall length of 160'.
   The control material, RCFI, was woven non-pigmented polymer material plus stabilisers, with a
   plastic coating on the top and on the bottom, as follows:
20 Top coating:             LDPE 25gsm
   Woven polymer:           HDPE 105gsm
   Bottom coating:          LDPE 25gsm.
   Four different variations of trial material were used:
25 RCF4 - 3% Altiris 800® added to the coating
   RCF3 - 2% Altiris 800® added to the coating
   RCF2 - 1% Altiris 800® added to the coating
   RCF1 - 0% Altiris 800® added to the coating.

   DIFFUSE TRANSMITTANCE
   The diffuse transmittance of a series of the monofilament or tape or yarn that make up netting,
   crop cover or ground cover materials were measured by spectrophotometry to determine the
 5 effect of netting or crop cover or ground cover materials of the invention compared to
   conventional netting crop cover, or ground cover materials.
   The monofilament or tape material was a prepared by (i) mixing the pigments into a masterbatch
   (ii) mixing the masterbatch with polymer (iii) extruding the mixture into a water bath for cooling,
10 and (iv) then drawing though air or a water bath to orientate the mixture. A sample of the
   resulting is used for measuring the properties.
   Conventional netting materials were prepared using conventional pigmentary titanium dioxide or
   mirco void generating pigment in the amount specified below. Netting materials of the invention
15 were prepared using Altiris 800@, a combination of Altiris 800@ and micro void generating
   pigment, or a combination of micro void generating pigment and zinc oxide or a combination of
   micro void generating pigment and conventional titanium dioxide in the amount specified below.
   The spectrophotometer was based on a GSA/McPherson 2051                    1 metre focal length
20 monochromator fitted with a prism predisperser and also stray light filters. The light source is a
   current regulated tungsten halogen lamp. The bandwidth is adjustable up to 3 nm. The
   monochromatic beam from the monochromator is focused onto the sample or into the
   integrating sphere using off-axis parabolic mirrors. The integrating spheres are coated with
   pressed halon powder (PTFE powder). Halon powder is also used as the white reflectance
25 reference material. The detector is usually a silicon photodiode connected to an electrometer
   amplifier and digital volt meter. The whole system is controlled using software written in
   LabVIEW. The detectors used can be photomultiplier tubes, silicon diodes or lead sulphide
   detectors.
30 The integrating sphere has an internal diameter of 120 mm and is coated with pressed halon
   powder. The sample is mounted on one port and the incident light port is at an angle of 900
   around the sphere. The sphere rotates by 90' in the horizontal plane to allow the focused

                                                - 67
   incident light to enter the sphere through the incident light port or the incident light to be
   transmitted through the sample and enter the sphere. The detector is mounted at the top of the
   sphere.
 5 Diffuse transmittance over the 280-2,500nm wavelength range was measured for monofilament
   or tape or yarn. The graphs are for 100% coverage.
   Graphs of the diffuse transmittance are shown in Figures 15-47.
10 Figures 15-22 show diffuse transmittance graphs for prior art netting material.
   Figures 23-35 show diffuse transmittance graphs for netting material of the invention.
   Figures 36-38 show diffuse transmittance graphs for prior art crop cover material.

   Figures 39 shows diffuse transmittance graphs for crop cover material of the invention.
   Figures 40-43 show diffuse transmittance graphs for prior art ground cover material.
20 Figures 44-47 show diffuse transmittance graphs for prior art ground cover material of the
   invention.
   Data from which the graphs in Figures 15-47 were created are shown below in Figures 48-80,
   each of which contains a table showing the transmittance for each wavelength, a table showing
25 transmittance average for each wavelength range, and a table showing transmittance difference
   each wavelength range.
   The graphs show that netting, crop cover, and ground cover materials of the invention have
   advantageous UV, visible and heat transmission profiles.

                                                 - 68
   Conventional titanium dioxide is currently used in the netting industry has limitations in that it
   blocks some of the light that plants use in the 400-700nm range, and transmits heat rather than
   absorbing or reflecting it.
 5 The graphs show that non-conventional titanium dioxide, as described herein, such as Altiris
   800® transmits less heat and more visible light, which is used by plants for photosynthesis, than
   conventional titanium dioxide. The graphs also show that Altiris 800® has relatively low UV
   transmission.
10 The graphs show that the combination of Altiris 800® and a microvioding pigment and also the
   combination of a microvoiding pigment and a UV absorbing pigment, such as zinc oxide or
   conventional titanium dioxide have similar transmission properties.
   The graphs demonstrate that use of a microvoiding pigment in combination with Altiris 800®
15 allows the use of lower amounts Altiris 800®, while providing transmission profiles comparable
   to those obtained when Altiris 800® is used alone in comparatively higher amounts. This is
   useful as microvoiding pigments can be comparatively less expensive.
   Several of the graphs are compared below.
20
   2% Standard titanium dioxide vs 10% Micro void pigment
   In the UV region standard TiO2 transmits less UV light than the micro void pigments. Adding
   organic UV absorbers will reduce this transmittance in the UV region.
25 In the infrared region the micro void pigment transmits less heat than standard titanium dioxide.
   The micro void pigments transmittance is more similar to Altiris than standard TiO2 from
   400nm to 2500nm, but not exactly the same. The micro void pigment is allowing more light for
   plants though from 400 to 700 nm and reflecting more heat than TiO2.

                                                    - 69
   2% Standard titanium dioxide vs 2.5% Micro void pigment
   The micro void pigments is a lower % than in the comparison above, therefore the transmittance
   is proportionally higher.
 5 2% Standard Titanium dioxide vs 1% Altiris + 5% Micro void pigments
   In the UV region the combination of 1% Altiris and 5% micro void pigments has similar
   transmittance to 3% Altiris. Adding organic UV absorbers will reduce this transmittance in the
   UV region.
10 In the infrared and visible region the Altiris/ micro void pigments combination has flattened the
   transmittance over the 400nm to 1660nm range, compared to TiO2, so that it is similar to 3%
   Altiris.
   The Altiris/ micro void pigments combination allows more light for plants through from 400 to
15 700 nm and reflects more heat than TiO2.
   This combination of micro void pigments and Altiris reduces the costs of the formula.
   10% Micro void pigments vs 3% Altiris
20 Over the 1150nm to 2500nm wavelength range 10% micro void pigments has similar
   transmittance to 3% Altiris. But Altriris is allowing more plant light and reducing more heat.
   In the UV range the Altiris has significantly less transmittance than the micro void pigments so it
   would need less organic UV absorbers to reduce this compared to the micro void pigments.
25
   2.5% Micro void pigments vs 3% Altiris

                                                   - 70
   Over the 280-2280nm wavelength range 2.5% micro void pigments has greater transmittance
   than the 3% Altiris.
   At around 420-500nm the 2.4% micro void pigments and 3% Altiris have similar transmittance.
 5
   In the UV range the Altiris has significantly less transmittance than the micro void pigments. So
   it would need less organic UV absorbers to reduce this compared to the micro void pigments.
   2.5% Micro void pigments vs 10% Micro void pigments
10 In the UV region the 10% micro void pigments is blocking more UV light than the 2.5% micro
   void pigments. The transmittance has increased for 2.5% micro void pigments compared to 10%
   micro void pigments.
   The micro void pigment generally has slightly increasing transmittance with increasing
15 wavelength from 300nm to 1660nm.
   2.5% Micro void pigments allows more light through for plants, but also allows more heat and
   UV through than 10% micro void pigments.              10% Micro void pigments has higher heat
   reflectance than 2.5% micro void pigments.
