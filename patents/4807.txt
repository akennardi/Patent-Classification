                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]     The invention relates to a truss. In particular, the invention relates, but is
   not particularly limited, to a truss for bracing a building wall.
                      BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002]     Reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
   admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge.
[0003]     Across their lifetime's, buildings are subjected to many forces, such as
   gravity, seismic forces and wind.
[0004]     In anticipation of these forces, many countries enforce specific building
   codes relating to the bracing of a building which set out minimum allowable
   standards in an effort to ensure any new buildings will be able to withstand the
   forces they are likely to be subjected to.
[0005]     In one example of bracing provided to withstand strong forces, plywood
   panels are fixed to two or three adjacent studs to brace the wall in the plane of
   the wall.
[0006]     In another example, an L-shaped metal strip has a first flange received
   in aligned slots cut in the studs and a second flange secured to the exposed
   faces of the studs.
[0007]     However, these       proposed     solutions can be cumbersome,           time
   consuming and difficult to install.
[0008]     A further proposed solution lies in a diagonally cross-braced truss frame.
   However, the diagonal cross-brace renders it difficult for an installer to insert

                                         2
   and tighten bolts used to secure the truss frame to the wall frame and therefore
   are not ideal.
                          OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
[0009]     It is an aim of this invention to provide a truss which overcomes or
   ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages or problems described above, or
   which at least provides a useful commercial alternative.
[0010]     Other preferred objects of the present invention will become apparent
   from the following description.
                         SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0011]     In one form, although it need not be the only or indeed the broadest form,
   there is provided a truss for bracing a building wall, the truss comprising:
           a frame having two substantially parallel stiles interconnected by at least
   one horizontal brace and at least one cross-brace extending diagonally
   between the two stiles; and
           at least one diaphragm portion connected to the frame.
[0012]     Preferably, the diaphragm portion is connected to and extends between
   the two stiles of the frame.
[0013]     Preferably, each diaphragm portion comprises:
           a first horizontal brace;
           a second horizontal brace parallel to the first horizontal brace; and
           a reinforcing panel connected to the first and second horizontal braces,

                                         3
           wherein the first horizontal brace is parallel to the second horizontal
       brace, and
           wherein the first and second horizontal braces connect the two stiles of
   the frame.
[0014]     More preferably, the second horizontal brace of the diaphragm portion
   extends between a distal end of each of the stiles of the frame.
[0015]     Preferably, the reinforcing panel is connected to the first and second
   horizontal braces of the diaphragm portion and the two stiles of the frame.
[0016]     Preferably, each of the horizontal braces and stiles have a substantially
   C-shaped profile. Preferably, the first horizontal brace of the frame is connected
   at a distal end of the stiles.
[0017]     Preferably, each of the horizontal braces of the frame and the diaphragm
   portion are substantially parallel.
[0018]     Preferably, the diaphragm portion is integrally formed and has a
   substantially C-shaped profile.
[0019]     Preferably, the diaphragm portion is fixedly attached to the vertical stiles.
   More preferably, the diaphragm portion is welded to the vertical stiles. Even
   more preferably, the diaphragm portion is received within a channel of the
   vertical stiles and welded to the vertical stiles.
[0020]     Preferably, the diaphragm further comprises one or more apertures for
   receiving bolts therethrough. More preferably, a webbing of the second
   horizontal brace of the diaphragm portion comprises one or more apertures
   therethrough for receiving a bolt to secure the truss to a frame and/or a
   structural foundation.

                                           4
[0021]     Preferably, the truss further comprises a reinforcing member extending
   between the first and second horizontal braces of the diaphragm portion. More
   preferably, the reinforcing member is located halfway along a length of each of
   the first and second horizontal braces of the diaphragm portion.
[0022]     Preferably, the frame further comprises a plurality of cross-braces and a
   plurality of horizontal braces. More preferably, each cross-brace is adjacent to
   a horizontal brace.
[0023]     Preferably, the truss further comprises a second diaphragm portion
   connected to the frame, wherein the second diaphragm portion is connected to
   the frame at an end of the frame opposite an end of the frame connected to a
   first diaphragm portion.

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0032]     Referring to Figure 1, there is illustrated a perspective view of a truss 10
   for bracing a building wall against lateral forces configured to fit within a typical
   rectangular wall frame (not shown). The truss 10 comprises a frame 100 and a
   diaphragm portion 200.
[0033]     The frame 100 has a pair of vertical stiles 105, 110 interconnected by a
   perpendicularly extending first horizontal brace 115 at a distal end of each of
   the stiles 105, 110. The frame 100 also includes a diagonal cross-brace 120
   extending between the two stiles 105, 110 which creates a triangulation within
   the frame 100 formed by the horizontal brace 115 and vertical stiles 105, 110.
   Advantageously, the triangulation of the frame 100 provides improved strength
   and rigidity to the truss 10 when compared to a truss having no diagonal cross
   member.
[0034]     Attached to the vertical stiles 105, 110 of the frame 100 at an opposite
   end relative to the first horizontal brace 115 is the diaphragm portion 200 which
   is received within a channel of each of the vertical stiles 105, 110. The
   diaphragm portion 200 comprises a second horizontal brace 205 and a third

                                         6
   horizontal brace 210 which interconnect the vertical stiles 105, 110 of the frame
   100.
[0035]    In addition, the diaphragm portion 200 includes a reinforcing panel 215
   extending between the space defined by the vertical stiles 105, 110 of the frame
   100 and the second and third horizontal braces 205, 210 of the diaphragm
   portion 200. In combination, the horizontal braces 205, 210 and the reinforcing
   panel 215 give the diaphragm portion 200 a substantially C-shaped cross
   section.
[0036]    While the diaphragm portion 200 may be formed by welding the
   horizontal braces 205, 210 and the reinforcing panel 215 together, as can be
   seen in Figure 2, it will be appreciated that the diaphragm portion 200 can also
   be integrally formed as a single component. Distinct advantages are provided
   by both options. As a single component, the integrally formed diaphragm
   portion reduces the number of pieces required to form the truss and thereby
   reduces the overall amount of welding to be performed to assemble the truss.
   However, if the diaphragm is formed from individual components, the
   components can be more easily stored. For example, horizontal braces can be
   stacked atop one another, saving space.
[0037]    In Figures 2 and 3, it can be seen that there are two apertures 220, 225
   located along the webbing portion 230 of the third horizontal brace 210 for
   receiving securing threaded bolts 235 (shown in Figure 4) therethrough to
   secure the truss to a frame and/or a structural foundation.
[0038]    While the illustrated embodiment only includes two apertures, it is
   envisioned that the truss can include more apertures, preferably four, so that

                                         7
   more bolts can be used and thereby improve the structural integrity of the truss
   and frame.
[0039]    The diaphragm 200 helpfully provides a space for an installer to insert
   the bolts and the tools necessary to secure the bolts to the frame. Such a task
   can be quite difficult in existing trusses having a diagonal cross-brace as the
   cross-brace typically ends adjacent one of the apertures, thus limiting the
   amount of space for an installer to insert and manoeuvre the bolt. To improve
   accessibility, the aperture can be moved toward the centre of the bottom
   horizontal brace. However, this negatively impacts the effectiveness of the tie
   down bolt and may cause the truss to fail when subject to substantial forces,
   during cyclonic winds for example.
[0040]    With reference to Figure 5, a second embodiment of a truss 20 is shown.
   Truss 20 includes a frame 300 and two diaphragm portion 400, 500.
[0041]    The frame 300 is substantially similar to frame 100 described above,
   having two parallel, vertical stiles 305, 310, a horizontal brace 315 and a first
   diagonal cross-brace 320. However, frame 300 includes an additional, second
   diagonal cross-brace 325 arranged such that the horizontal brace 315 is located
   between the first and second diagonal cross-braces 320, 325.
[0042]    The two diaphragm portions 400, 500 are also substantially similar to
   diaphragm portion 200 described above, each having two horizontal braces
   405, 410, 505, 510 and a reinforcing panel 415, 515, respectively.
[0043]    Turning to Figure 6, a third embodiment of a truss 30 is shown. Truss 30
   is substantially similar to truss 20 including a frame 600 but only a single
   diaphragm portion 700.

                                         8
[0044]     The frame 600 is substantially similar to frame 300 described above,
   having two parallel, vertical stiles 605, 610, a horizontal brace 615 and a first
   diagonal cross-brace 620. The frame 600 also includes a second horizontal
   brace 625 attached at the end of the stiles 605, 610 and a second diagonal
   cross-brace 630 arranged such that the horizontal brace 615 is located between
   the first and second diagonal cross-braces 620, 630.
[0045]     The diaphragm portion 700 is also substantially similar to diaphragm
   portion 400 described above, having two horizontal braces 705, 710 and a
   reinforcing panel 715.
[0046]     It is envisioned that in some embodiments, the frame (not including the
   diaphragm portion) includes n diagonal cross-braces and n+1 horizonal braces
   to allow the truss to be extended to fill the available space in the wall frame,
   where n represents any number greater than 0. In these embodiments, each
   diagonal cross-brace is connected adjacent to and located between two
   horizontal braces (of any of the frame or the diaphragm portion) such that a
   quadrilateral frame (of a substantially square or rectangular shape) separated
   into two triangular portions is formed by the two vertical stiles, two horizontal
   braces and a diagonal cross-brace extending between the two vertical stiles.
   The arrangement described could be repeated ad infinitum to achieve a truss
   of a desired height.
[0047]     In some embodiments, the diaphragm portion includes a reinforcing
   member extending between the horizontal braces of the diaphragm portion to
   provide additional structural integrity. The reinforcing member is preferably
   located halfway along a length of each of the second and third horizontal
   braces.

                                          9
[0048]     It will be appreciated that two or more reinforcing members could be
   included in the diaphragm portion to provide additional strength to the truss.
[0049]     Each of the stiles and the braces are formed from C-section steel, which
   of course may be galvanised, powder-coated or otherwise treated to be
   resistant to corrosion.
[0050]     The components of the truss may be screwed or riveted together but are
   preferably welded together or integrally formed.
[0051]     It will be appreciated that the height and width of the truss can be varied
   to suit available space in a wall frame, as required.
[0052]     Advantageously, as mentioned above the diaphragm allows easier
   access to the bolt holes.
[0053]     Further advantageously, the diaphragm provides increased structural
   integrity and improved resistance to forces to prevent instability in the wall.
[0054]     In use, the frame and diaphragm portion are joined together, by welding
   for example, at a manufacturing facility to form a truss as described herein. The
   truss is subsequently delivered to a building site for installation.
[0055]     At the building site, once the structural foundations of the building are
   established, including the wall frames, the truss is then placed vertically within
   the wall frame whereby the webbing of the horizontal brace of the diaphragm
   are aligned with the frame. Due to the additional space provided by the
   diaphragm portion, the bolts are then easily aligned with and passed through
   the apertures of the diaphragm into the wall frame. A nut can then be attached
   to the bolt and tightened against the diaphragm to secure the truss to the wall
   frame and/or a structural foundation. Advantageously, the truss provides lateral
   bracing against lateral forces, such as those imparted by wind, for example.
