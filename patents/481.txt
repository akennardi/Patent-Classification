10 Field of Invention
   The present invention relates to a computer-readable storage medium for storing an
   executable set of software instructions; For example, the disclosure is directed to a media
   enhanced shopping cart system, and more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a
15 system and method for providing information such as advertising to a consumer as a
   shopping cart is navigated within a store.
   Background of Invention
20 In today's media market, measuring efficacy of advertising is difficult. Advertisers are
   spending billions of dollars on television, radio, and print with little return on investment,
   and they have little assurance that consumers will actually see advertisements, much less
   make purchasing decisions impacted by them. Thus, advertisers and stores are constantly
   searching for new and related advertising venues, and in particular those positioned at, or
25 in close proximity to, the point of purchase location. To wit, the traditional shopping cart is
   an underutilized advertising medium. The shopping cart is the one venue that continually
   moves with the consumer as they navigate the store. Thus, the shopping cart provides an
   advertising venue with opportunity to improve the shopping experience of the consumer.
30 The present disclosure is aimed to address needs of advertisers, retailers, and consumers.
   Advertisers wish to 1) display ads at the most effective location and time, at the consumer's

   point of purchase, 2) specifically measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and
   3) improve return on advertisement investment dollars. Retailers wish to 1) increase sales,
   2) share in advertising revenue, 3) reduce labor costs, 4) create a consumer friendly
   environment with less advertisement clutter, 5) enhance their store image and 6) make
 5 improvements that are compatible with existing solutions. Consumers wish to 1) have a
   pleasant and efficient shopping experience, and 2) save money on items that they need or
   want.
   It is generally desirable to overcome or ameliorate one or more of the above described
10 difficulties, or to at least provide a useful alternative.

15 content (such as advertising) as well as the software (i.e. applications and operating
   system). One of the many functions of the Cart Coordinator is to allow the cart 10 to
   communicate with a store's in-store server ("ISS") 330. In various embodiments, the Cart
   Coordinator performs some or all of the functionality while the cart 10 is in the cart corral
    110. The Cart Coordinator also maintains communication with the ISS 330 while the cart
20  10 is out of the cart corral 110, e.g. during a shopping session. The Cart Coordinator
   checks the status and version of content and software, and upon finding an item (i.e.
   content or a piece of software) that needs to be updated, the Cart Coordinator starts a
   download via the wireless connection.
25 The Deployment Manager is another application running on the ECM 200 of the cart 10
   that is responsible for installing the software downloaded by the Cart Coordinator on the
   cart 10. The Deployment Manager includes the ability to determine whether a change is a
   minor change such that a simple update may be installed, or a more significant change
   requiring installation and restart, or a major change, calling for installation of the software
30 followed by rebooting the cart 10.

                                                               - 12
   In various embodiments, the Cart Coordinator and the Deployment Manager are functional
   for synchronizing and updating only when the cart 10 is present in the corral 110, while in
   other embodiments, the Cart Coordinator and the Deployment Manager are functional for
   synchronizing and updating while the cart 10 is not in use but not necessarily present in the
 5 corral 110.
   In various embodiments, the Deployment Manager functions when the cart 10 is located in
   the cart corral 110, because it is desirable to make major changes to the cart when the cart
    10 is located within the best network coverage, which in some embodiments may be in the
10 cart corral 110. Additionally, it is undesirable to encumber the cart's 10 assets by
   downloading while the cart is in use for shopping. Furthermore, the cart 10 has unlimited
   power when located in the corral 110, making the corral 110 the preferable location for
   synchronizing because synchronizing uses a significant amount of power.
15 In various embodiments, the Cart Coordinator is additionally responsible for uploads from
   the cart 10 to the ISS 330. For example, shop events such as time spent with a certain ad
   displayed, the path of the cart 10, items purchased, and the like may be scheduled for
   upload from the cart 10 to the ISS 330 by the Cart Coordinator.
20 In various embodiments, the Cart Coordinator may additionally provide periodic real time
   updates for items such as new product prices, store specials, and the like that are displayed
   and/or used by the cart 10.
   In an embodiment, the ECM 200 may enter a hibernation or sleep mode when the cart 10 is
25 nested with one or more other cart 10, when the cart 10 is stored, or when the cart 10 is not
   in motion for a predetermined period of time. In an embodiment, the hibernation or sleep
   mode may involve powering the ECM 200 down entirely, or partially. In an embodiment,
   the cart 10 may further comprise one or more motion sensors 36 operable to detect when
   the cart 10 is in motion. The motion sensor(s) 36 may be located anywhere on the cart 10.
30 The motion sensor(s) 36 may be located in or on the handle 22 (for example in pod 150) as
   shown in Fig. 3 A, the base 35, or the base tray 50. Alternatively, the motion sensor(s) 36

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 13
   may be coupled to wheels 37, 38 and detect motion of the cart from turning of one or more
   wheels. Alternatively, the motion sensor(s) 36 may be integrated with a scanner 215,
   wherein the motion sensor may serve as a proximity sensor 216 for the scanner and/or a
   proximity sensor 216 for the scanner may serve as a motion sensor for activating
 5 components of the cart. Alternatively, the motion sensors(s) may be located in the ECM
   200, for example a mercury switch or equivalent that detects movement of the cart. The
   motion sensor(s) activate the ECM 200, bringing it out of hibernation, when the cart 10 is
   selected by a consumer 85 from a nested position with one or more other carts, from a cart
   corral 110, or when a consumer 85 begins to move an abandoned cart 10 that has not
10 moved for a predetermined length of time. Each of the components operably coupled to or
   comprising components of the ECM 200, as described below, may also be re-activated or
   hibernated along with the ECM 200 when the motion sensor(s) 36 detects that the cart 10
   is in motion.
15 In an embodiment, the motion sensor(s) 36 may comprise mercury switches placed on the
   cart 10, such as in a location on a wheel 38 or caster, or on the basket 20 of the cart 10,
   such that when the cart 10 is in motion, the mercury in the switch tilts with the motion of
   the cart 10 to connect and disconnect the control of the ECM 200 or the various other
   components.
20
   In still another embodiment, the motion sensor(s) 36 may comprise one or more magnetic
   reed switches in addition to or in lieu of mercury switches. In such an embodiment as
   shown in Fig. 3B, a magnetic reed switch 180 is located in the frame or caster 182 above
   each wheel 38, and an associated magnet 184 is located on the wheel 38 hub, allowing
25 sensing of tire rotation about axle 183 for motion detection. As is well understood in the
   art, by placing a magnet on a rotating wheel, a "heartbeat" reflecting the rotational speed of
   the wheel may be determined, with one "beat" each time the magnet rotates past the reed
   switch, opening or closing it. By placing a pair of these switch and magnet groupings, one
   at each wheel, the ECM 200 may receive a signal from the magnetic reed switch via cable
30 or wire 181 running through frame 30 and determine the rotation speed of each wheel
   when in motion. By comparing rotational speed of adjacent wheels (for example, the two

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 14
   back wheels having a fixed, known position relative to each other), the ECM 200 may
   additionally determine when the cart turns as well as the speed and direction of turns,
   providing additional data for use in accurate determination of the location of the cart
   within the store. Further discussion of the use of magnetic reed switches in locating the
 5 cart 10 within the store is included below.
   In an embodiment, the shopping cart system further comprises a correlation component
   comprising software, hardware or a combination of hardware and software operable to take
   various data gathered by components of the cart, and correlate one or more of the different
10 types of data. The correlation component may, in an embodiment comprise hardware
   affixed to the cart with software incorporated therein, or may, in an embodiment, comprise
   hardware affixed to the cart with software stored in and/or executed from the ECM 200. In
   an embodiment, the correlation component may be integrated within the ECM 200.
15 For example, the correlation component is operable to correlate data from the inventory
   component (discussed in greater detail below) regarding the inventory contained by the
   shopping cart, with the unique identity of the shopping cart. In such an exemplary
   embodiment, the correlation component is operably coupled to the inventory component
   and the ECM 200, such that as the inventory of the cart 10 is updated, the correlation
20 component correlates the current inventory with the unique identity of the cart 10 and
   stores the correlation (preferably in the ECM 200), such that, at the Point of Sale 300, the
   ECM 200 may wirelessly communicate the correlation of the inventory and the unique
   identity of the cart 10. The correlation component may be further operably coupled to the
   locationing component, such that the correlation component may correlate the inventory,
25 the unique identity, and the location of the cart, over the course of a shopping trip, store the
   correlation, and wirelessly communicate the correlation to the Point of Sale 300.
   For example, the correlation component is operable to correlate data from the inventory
   component (discussed in greater detail below) regarding the inventory contained by the
30 shopping cart, with data relating to the shopping list component (discussed below). In such
   an exemplary embodiment, the correlation component is operably coupled to the inventory

                                                               - 15
   component, the shopping list component, the ECM 200, and the video display 75, such that
   as the inventory of the cart 10 is updated, the customer shopping list may be updated, as
   well as the shopping list displayed in the video display 75. The correlation may be stored
   in the ECM 200, or stored elsewhere in the network, associated with a specific consumer,
 5 and used to generate shopping lists in the future.
   For example, the correlation component is operable to correlate data from the inventory
   component (discussed in greater detail below) regarding the inventory contained by the
   shopping cart, with data relating to which advertisements are displayed to a consumer by
10 the cart. In such an exemplary embodiment, the correlation component is operably coupled
   to the locationing component, the video display 75 and the ECM 200, such that the
   correlation component receives the inventory from the inventory component, correlates it
   with advertisements that are stored or streamed to the ECM 200, and stores the correlation.
   The correlation may then be used in selecting which advertisement chosen from a plurality
15 of advertisements are displayed based on the location of the cart. For example, if the
   inventory is known to include items for hosting a party, the correlation of the inventory
   with the advertisements and the location of the cart may be used to display one or more
   advertisements for additional items used for hosting a party.
20 The shopping cart system may further comprise a shopping list component for listing one
   or more products of a customer shopping list for purchase by the consumer. The shopping
   list component is operably coupled to the video display 75 of the cart 10 such that the
   shopping list may be displayed, either prominently, or as a less prominent display, with,
   for example, a menu of options or advertisements. In an embodiment, the shopping list
25 component may comprise hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software
   operable to carry out the function of maintaining, updating, and/or displaying a customer
   shopping list. In an embodiment, the hardware and software are co-housed and affixed to
   the cart 10, while in another embodiment, the hardware may comprise a unit affixed to the
   cart 10 (as will be discussed below) and the software may be stored and/or executed from a
30 separate unit, such as the ECM 200, the ISS 330, POS computer 326 at the Point of Sale
   300 or other networked system component, in conjunction with the hardware affixed to the

   cart.
   In an embodiment, the shopping list component comprises the ECM 200 in conjunction
   with software operating thereon, populated with a customer shopping list. In an
 5 embodiment, the customer shopping list comprises historical data associated with the
   consumer 85 by way of the consumer's loyalty card, pin code, telephone number or other
   customer identifier associated with the consumer 85. The historical data relates to products
   that the consumer has purchased in the past or products that the consumer has listed in a
   customer shopping list previously. Consumer identifiers comprise a data reference that is
10 unique to the consumer or their household. For example, a customer loyalty card may be
   associated with an identification number that is unique to the consumer or their household.
   Stores often offer customer loyalty cards to consumers, which consumers use in order to
   enjoy coupons, discounts and other advantages provided by the store to its loyal
   consumers. The loyalty card may additionally be linked with store services, such as a
15 pharmacy, in-store deli, automotive service station, and the like, to track and record the
   consumer's needs relating to that service. A consumer may additionally identify themselves
   to the store using a pin code assigned by the store or their telephone number in order to
   receive discounts, coupons, and track usage of the store's services. The store may use the
   identifiers to track shopping of consumers for inventorying purposes as well as targeting
20 advertisements and discounts to consumers based on what they actually buy.
   In an embodiment, the customer shopping list for future shopping trips is generated by the
   inventory in the cart 10 during a present shopping trip. In such an exemplary embodiment,
   the shopping list component is operably coupled to the inventory component and the ECM
25 200 (or other networked component) to store the inventory of the cart 10 during a shopping
   trip, and store the purchases made based on the inventory at the Point of Sale 300. In such
   an embodiment, the stored inventory may be associated with a particular consumer by way
   of their customer loyalty card, pin code, telephone number or other consumer identifier.
   The stored inventory may then be used by the shopping list component to generate a
30 customer shopping list.

   In an embodiment, the customer shopping list may be downloaded from a store website
   and associated with the consumer's identity, such that when the loyalty card is scanned or
   other identifier is entered, the customer shopping list becomes available in the cart 10 to
   the consumer 85. In such an embodiment, when the consumer identifier is entered or
 5 scanned, the list downloaded from the store website may be streamed or wireless
   communicated from the ISS 330 via the access points to the ECM 200, and displayed.
   Alternatively, in an embodiment a shopping list stored in a PDA, handheld computer,
   mobile telephone or other electronic device may be downloaded to the ECM 200 through
   wireless, infrared, Bluetooth, and like known techniques, the details of which are not
10 material herein, and the shopping list component will display the downloaded list, and
   enable the functions described herein. Alternatively, in an embodiment a shopping list may
   be emailed to the store system for transfer to a cart 10.
   In still another embodiment, the customer shopping list is generated based one or more
15 products selected by the consumer; wherein the one or more products are selected by the
   consumer by scanning a bar code on a product, placing a RFID tagged product in the
   shopping cart 10, and downloaded by the consumer in a list. In such an embodiment, the
   ECM 200 is operably coupled to the inventory component to store the identity of products
   purchased by the consumer before to generate a list. In such an embodiment, the ECM 200
20 is operable to store the identity of products previously placed in the cart 10 by the
   consumer to generate a list.
   In an embodiment, the shopping list component is operably coupled to the correlation
   component in conjunction with the ECM 200 (as discussed above) for correlating the
25 inventory contained by the shopping cart 10 with the shopping list to determine which
   products on the list are present in the shopping cart 10.
   In an embodiment, the shopping list component is operably coupled to the ECM 200, the
   locationing component and the video display 75 for displaying an advertisement on the
30 video display 75 for a product on the shopping list when the cart 10 is located proximate to
   the product. In such an exemplary embodiment, the locationing component determines

                                                               - 18
   where the cart is located in the store, the shopping list component determines which
   products on the customer shopping list are located nearby the cart based on its location,
   and the ECM 200 displays in the video display 75 at least one advertisement based on the
   cart 10 being located near to products on the shopping list.
 5
   In use, in an embodiment, the customer shopping list may be displayed in the video display
   75 as a less prominent display with advertisements, or as a prominent display when
   selected by a consumer. By prominence, it is meant that the shopping list may be displayed
   as a larger, primary display on the video display 75 while advertisements are displayed in
10 smaller, secondary display(s) on the video display 75 adjacent to the shopping list. As will
   be described further below, and as shown in Fig. 16, in an embodiment, the screen 77 of
   the video display 75 may be divided into a plurality of screen segments 308, such that one
   of the plurality of stored advertisements 307 may be displayed in various screen segment
   308 while a shopping list may be displayed in a screen segment 308. In an embodiment,
15 one of the plurality of screen segments 308 may be designated for display of consumer
   specific information, such as the customer shopping list.
   The shopping list component may organize the products on the customer shopping list with
   locations in the store for each product on the list, and display the customer shopping list
20 according to location. For example, the shopping list component may organize all the
   products on the customer shopping list according to a department of the store, or according
   to which aisle the products are located on, in order to facilitate shopping by the consumer.
   In use, in an embodiment, the shopping list component, coupled to the correlation
25 component, correlates the customer shopping list to the inventory of the cart 10, such that
   when a RFID tagged product from the customer shopping list is scanned by the basket
   RFID reader 227 or scanned by the scanner 215, the product is checked off the customer
   shopping list. In an embodiment, the consumer may check off a product from the customer
   shopping list. In the video display, the product may appear as checked off, or may be
30 removed from the shopping list once added to the inventory of the cart.

                                                                    - 24
   comprises a scanner 215, for example a bar code scanner. In an embodiment, the scanner
   215 is inset in the handle 22 and/or in pod 150 of the cart 10. In an embodiment, the
   scanner 215 may be attached to or incorporated with any portion of the basket 20, such as
   the side wall 23 or 24, the front side wall 28 or the rear side wall 31, in a manner that is
 5 accessible to the consumer 85 who is using the cart 10. Various attachment devices and
   means for attaching as described herein may be used with the scanner 215. The scanner
   215 enables optional self-scanning of products for purchase, coupons, loyalty cards, and
   any other object having a bar code or Universal Product Code ("UPC") by the consumer
   85. In an embodiment, the scanner 215 may be activated by the consumer 85 by bringing
10 any product with a barcode symbol within a set proximity of the scanner 215. In an
   embodiment, the scanner 215 may be activated by a proximity sensor 216, which may
   comprise a portion of the scanner 215 or may be operably coupled to the scanner 215. Like
   the scanner 215, the proximity sensor 216 may likewise be integrated with pod 150. The
   scanner 215 may be any suitable scanner such as a laser scanner, CCD scanner, 2D imager,
15 and the like. In an embodiment, the scanner 215 may comprise a linear imager scanner
   commercially                   available               from HAND HELD PRODUCTS TM or an equivalent or
   improvement thereof. The scanner 215 may, in an embodiment, scan symbols, such as a
   UPC or European Article Numbering ("EAN") System codes, in an omnidirectional
   manner.
20
   In an embodiment, the inventory component may comprise the scanner 215, in conjunction
   with the ECM 200 and software operating thereon. In an embodiment, the inventory
   component is operable to determine the contents of the shopping cart based on what
   products the consumer 85 has scanned and placed in the shopping cart. In an embodiment,
25 the scanner 215 is operably coupled to the ECM 200, such that as products are scanned and
   placed in the cart 10, the ECM 200 stores in local memory 202 a running total of the
   products in the cart 10 for purchase. Upon arriving at the checkout counter, known as the
   Point of Sale 300, the ECM 200 may communicate information regarding the products that
   were scanned by the consumer 85 to a POS computer 326 at the Point of Sale 300 or other
30 networked system component, to be discussed in greater detail herein.

   In an embodiment, the scanner 215, operably coupled to the ECM 200, may be hibernated
   or reactivated from hibernation along with the ECM 200 when the motion sensor(s) 36
   detects that the cart 10 is in motion or stopped. Specifically, in an embodiment, the scanner
   215 may be hibernated, or powered down, for power conservation purposes, when the cart
 5 10 is in motion. When the consumer 85 stops pushing the cart 10 and the cart 10 becomes
   still while the consumer 85 is selecting products to purchase, the scanner 215 is re
   activated such that the consumer 85 may scan products for purchase and place them in the
   cart 10. The motion sensor(s) 36 alone or in combination with other locator or positioning
   systems/ data (for example, RFID scans and/or other locator/positioning means) enable this
10 hibernation/reactivation function of the scanner 215. In alternative embodiments, other cart
   systems may be activated or deactivated based upon detection of motion or stoppage of the
   cart in order to conserve power and maximize battery life. For example, the bar code
   reader may be turned off when the cart is moving, the RFID reader/antennae may be turned
   off when the cart is stopped, the video display may be turned off when the cart is nested or
15 is immobile for an extended time, or combinations thereof. Again, motion of the cart may
   be detected for example via a motion sensor such as a reed switch and/or mercury switch
   alone or in combination with other sensing means such interpreting read data from the
   RFID tags.
20 In an embodiment, the shopping cart system may further comprise a navigation device, for
   example a five-way navigation device 123. In alternative embodiments, other navigation
   devices may be used in addition to or in lieu of the five-way navigation device 123, for
   example hard or soft hot buttons, a joystick, touch panel/screen, or combinations thereof.
   As an additional user interface to the ECM 200 and other features of the cart 10, in an
25 embodiment, a five-way navigation device 123 may be inset in the handle 22 or in the pod
   150. The five-way navigation device 123 typically allows for input (e.g., navigation of a
   menu) via up, down, left, right, and enter functions. In an embodiment, the five-way
   navigation device 123 may be used to activate the microphone array 121 for voice
   recognition features, or may be used to navigate through a menu of options 124 shown on
30 the video display 75. In an embodiment, the menu of options 124 may comprise such
   selections as: 1) a "Help" option, enabling the consumer 85 to request the location of a

   particular product, 2) an interface with an in-store pharmacy for the consumer 85 to request
   the status of their prescription or receive notification of prescription availability, 3) an
   interface with an in-store deli for the consumer 85 to make a deli order or receive
   notification of order availability, 3) an interface for notification to the consumer 85 of
 5 completion of in-store auto servicing, 4) an interface for interaction between the consumer
   85 and customer service personnel for services such as rain checks, and other functions for
   in-store services.
   In an embodiment, the shopping cart system may further comprise theft and tamper
10 deterrence design features. The shopping cart, due to the nature of the electronic
   components used as well as the programming in the computer, may be targeted for theft
   and tampering. To this end, the various electronics assemblies for the components
   discussed herein are designed such that if a given cart is disassembled without customized
   tools and/or in an improper sequence of disassembly, the electronics assemblies are
15 rendered non-functional by virtue of damage incurred by improper disassembly.
   For example, the main logic board of the ECM 200 may be designed having the printed
   circuit board traces laid out with critical circuit traces residing in close proximity to
   mounting holes, such as within a few thousands of an inch from the mounting hole. The
20 logic board then would be mounted to the casing and ECM 200 frame using a screw with a
   customized head, thereby requiring a customized tool for putting in or removing the screw.
   If the board is subsequently forced from the casing by someone lacking the customized
   tool, the critical traces would be damaged, and the board would be non-functional to a
   degree beyond repair without design schematics for the printed circuit board.
25
   In another example, the video display 75, which is described in more detail below and that
   may comprise a liquid crystal display ("LCD"), includes theft deterrence and tampering
   design features. The video display 75 may include two primary physical elements, namely
   the LCD display screen and the LCD controller board that interfaces the LCD display
30 screen via a flex circuit. The flex circuit connections to the LCD display screen are fragile
   and will not withstand flexing or pulling. A thin, insulating metal retaining bar may be

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 27
   added that runs the length of the flex circuit between the LCD display screen and the LCD
   controller board, and secured in place by a screw or screws with a customized head,
   thereby requiring a customized tool for removal. If the metal retaining bar is not removed
   using the appropriate customized tool and in a particular sequence that avoids flexing or
 5 pulling the flex circuit connections, the LCD assembly would be rendered non-functional
   to a degree beyond repair.
   In an embodiment, the cart further comprises a battery 135 operably coupled to the ECM
   200, the video display 75, voice activated interface 120, the bar code scanner 215, and any
10 other component of the cart requiring power. In an embodiment, the battery 135 is a
   standard Lithium-Ion battery or other similar battery. In an embodiment, the battery 135
   may be attached to the underside of the cart 10, by means of attachment to, for example,
   the bottom 21 of the basket 20, or to the base tray 50. Various attachment devices and
   means for attaching as described herein may be used with the battery 135. In an
15 embodiment, the battery 135 may be integrated with the ECM 200. For example, a battery
   housing or compartment may be integrally molded from plastic with the ECM 200 housing
   199 such that the battery is part of the ECM 200. In an embodiment, the battery 135 is
   rechargeable.
20 Referring to Figs. 6, 7, and 8, in an embodiment, the cart 10 may further comprise one or
   more battery charger contact plates 105. Fig. 6 is a front view of a cart 10 recharging in a
   recharge stall 111. In an embodiment, the battery charger contact plate 105 may be located
   on the base side member 32 and/or 33, the side member 16 and/or 17, or the side wall 23
   and/or 24. For example, as shown in Figs. 1 and 6, a single battery charger contact plate
25 105 may be disposed on each side of cart 10, thereby providing a pair of battery charger
   contact plates for each cart. In an embodiment, the battery charger contact plates may be
   positioned adjacent the rear wheels 38, for example on the base side members 32, 33
   slightly above the real wheel mount. Given that the rear wheel span is typically about the
   widest part of the cart, as can be seen in Fig. 6, positioning of the battery charger contact
30 plates near the rear wheels places them in a low, outboard position on the cart that is useful
   in engaging a charge rail system 106 for recharging the battery. In an embodiment, the

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017

   battery charger contact plate 105 may be spring-loaded to aid in contacting the contact
   plate with a charge rail.
   Fig. 8A is a side view of charge rail system 106 for recharging the battery 135 of one or
 5 more carts 10. The charge rail system 106 comprises a cart corral 110 having a plurality of
   recharge stalls or lanes 111, with each recharge lane having charge rails 107 and 108. In an
   embodiment, the recharge stalls 111 comprise a plurality of charge rail segments 109. In a
   store, the plurality of charge rail segments 109 comprised of charge rails 107 and 108 may
   be arranged in a cart corral 110. The plurality of charge rail segments 109 may be arranged
10 in one or more rows of recharge stalls 111.
   Fig. 8B is a side view of two charge rail segments 109 forming a single recharge stall 111.
   Each charge rail segment 109 comprises a floor section 113, a charge rail wall 114, and
   optionally a stall wall 115, which may be transparent as shown in the Figures or may be
15 non-transparent. Charge rails 107, 108 are disposed on either side of charge rail wall 114,
   as is shown more clearly in Fig. 6. In an embodiment, a plurality of charge rail segments
    109 may attach together in an end-to-end fashion (as indicated by reference arrows 116) or
   in a side-to-side fashion (as indicated by reference arrows 117) to form the recharge stalls
    111 and cart corral 110. As shown in Fig. 8B, the side edge 118 of the floor section 113
20 may be configured to mate or interlock with the side edge 119 of charge rail wall 114 of an
   adjacent charge rail segment 109. Likewise, front and rear edges 129, 130 of the floor
   section 113 may configured to mate or interlock with corresponding front and rear edges
   from adjacent charge rail segments 109.
25 In an embodiment, the charge rail system 106 further comprises a power supply 112 which
   may be mounted on a wall or other permanent fixture for providing power to the carts 10.
   The power supply 112 may be plugged in and operably connected to the charge rails 107
   and 108. Likewise, the plurality of charge rail segments further comprise connections such
   that power is supplied to the entire cart corral grid via the connection of adjacent charge
30 rail segments 109.

   In operation, a cart 10 may be fed into a cart corral 110 by a consumer 85 or store
   employee placing it in a recharge stall 111. In an embodiment, the recharge stall 111 may
   be sized such that the charge rail segments 109 are spaced apart adequately (e.g., about
   equal to the rear wheel span of the cart 10) such that the cart 10 fits between the charge rail
 5 segments 109 securely enough for the battery charger contact plate 105 to come into
   contact with the charge rails 107 and 108, as shown in Fig. 7. Contact between a battery
   charger contact plates and charge rails 107 and 108 forms a flow path for electrical current
   between power source 112 and the battery 135 such that the battery is charged.
   Rechargeable batteries are well known in the art, as are methods of charging such
10 rechargeable batteries from a power source. In an embodiment, a first contact plate 105
   and a first charge rail (e.g., 107 or 108) form a positive terminal of the electrical
   connection and a second contact plate 105 and a second charge rail (e.g., 107 or 108) form
   a negative terminal of the electrical connection. While dual contact plates and charge rails
   are shown, the charge rail system may be configured to operate using a single contact plate
15 105 on the cart and/or a single charge rail 107 or 108.
   In an embodiment, each charge rail 107 or 108 may be spring loaded, each battery charger
   contact plate 105 may be spring loaded, or both may be spring loaded. In an embodiment
   shown in Fig. 7, the charge rail 107 further comprises a spring 140 biasing a rail plate 141
20 outward for contact with the battery charger contact plate 105 located on the cart. The rail
   plate 141 may be surrounded by rail guard 142. The rail guard 142 may be configured to
   allow contact between the contract plate 105 and the rail plate 141 while preventing
   unwanted contact with rail plate 141 which might lead to electrical shock. In an
   embodiment shown in Fig. 7, the rail guard 142 has a concave shape with the rail plate 141
25 extending outward a portion of depth of the concave cavity, but not beyond the outer edges
   144 of the rail guard 142. The contact plate 105 may have a corresponding convex shape,
   thereby allowing contact between the contact plate 105 and the rail plate 141. When a cart
   10 is fed into a recharge stall 111, the cooperative shapes and spring loaded nature of the
   battery charger contact plate 105 and/or the charge rail 107 or 108 cause them to be in
30 contact with each other, creating an electrical conductor between the battery 135 and the
   power source 112. While Fig. 7 is shown with a single charge rail 108 (for example, for

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017

   use as an end rail assembly for attachment on end 118 of Fig. 8B to form a complete stall
    111), it should be understood that typically two charge rails 107 and 108 will be used in a
   back-to-back or mirror configuration, as is shown in Fig. 6. The components of the two
   charge rails 107 and 108 will be similar to the components shown in Fig. 7 for charge rail
 5  108.
   In an embodiment, the plurality of charge rail segments 109 are further configured to form
   a cart corral 110 such that a plurality of carts may be nested and stored therein, and each of
   the plurality of carts may be charged at the same time by the contact between each battery
10 charge contact plate 105 of each cart with the charge rails 107 and 108. For example, some
   or all of the carts in a store may be placed in the recharge stalls 111 of the cart corral 110
   during off-hours or hours when the store is closed in order for the battery 135 of each cart
    10 to be recharged for the next day or busy period of time.
15 In alternative embodiments, the contact plates 105 may be positioned at other locations on
   the cart 10 and the charge rail system 106 may be modified accordingly to provide contact
   with such plates as described previously. In an embodiment, contact plates 230, 231 are
   positioned adjacent to and/or integral with ECM 200 as shown in Figs. 6 and 12, which
   may be advantageous in simplifying and shortening the flow path between the charge
20 plates and the battery 135, especially when the battery 135 in integrated in ECM 200.
   Contact plates 230, 231 would typically be used in lieu of contact plates 105, as shown in
   Fig. 12, provided however that dual sets of contact plates 105 and 230, 231 could be used
   if desired as shown in Fig. 6. The location of charge rails 107 and 108 would be modified,
   for example raised and/or extended, to engage with contact plates 230, 231 positioned
25 adjacent to and/or integral with ECM 200. Likewise, the contact plates 230, 231 could be
   mounted in a position extending outward from the ECM 200 as needed to facilitate
   engagement with the charge rails 107 and 108. For example, contact plates 230, 231 may
   be mounted on protruding or bulbous ECM 200 side plates 235, as shown in Fig. 12.
30 An alternative charge rail configuration is shown in Figs. 8C-E. The recharge stall
   embodiment shown in Figs. 8C-E may likewise be modular in nature as described herein.

   Fig. 8C is a partial front view of cart 10 recharging in a recharge stall 111. A charging
   module 190 is mounted to the wheel yoke 191 of rear wheels 138, for example via one or
   more bolts or other connectors. In an alternative embodiment, the charging module 190
   may be mounted to the frame 30 or the underside of base tray 50. Preferably, the charging
 5 module 190 is mounted inboard of the rear wheels 38 and outboard of the front wheels 37,
   and more preferably on the interior side of rear wheel yoke 191. A battery charger contact
   plate 105 extends downward from the charging module 190. The battery charger contact
   plate 105 may be spring loaded to aid in contacting the contact plate with a charge rail.
10 Charge rails 107 and 108 extend upward from the floor section 113 of recharge stall 111.
   As shown in Fig. 8C, when a cart 10 is positioned in a recharge stall 111, the charge rails
   107, 108 are positioned inboard of the rear wheels 38 and outboard of the front wheels 37
   and serve to guide the cart into the proper position for recharging. While positioned in
   recharge stall 111, the battery charger contact plates 111 enter slots 192 on charge rails
15 107, 108 and make contact with rail plate 141 such that electricity may pass from the
   recharge stall 111 and charge battery 135. Rail plate 141 may be spring loaded in addition
   to or in lieu of spring-loading the battery charger contact plate 105 to aid in contact there
   between. The slots 192 in charge rails 107, 108 may be fully or partially covered by a
   flexible material such as plastic or a nylon brush to prevent debris from entering the slots
20 192. Such flexible material may be pushed aside by the battery charge plate 105 as it enters
   the slots 192.
   As shown in Figs. 8D and 8E, the charging module 190 may further comprise a contact
   plate cover 195. As shown in Fig. 8D, when the cart is not in a charge stall 111, the contact
25 plate cover 195 extends downward to cover and protect the battery charge plate 105. As
   shown in Figs. 8D and 8E, the contact plate cover 195 may comprise a generally U-shaped
   member having a gap or protective arm extending there from for receipt of the battery
   charge plate 105 in a closed position. The contact plate cover 195 may be biased in a
   closed position, for example with a spring. When a cart is positioned inside a recharge stall
30 111, the contact plate cover 195 is pushed upward via contact with an upper portion 196 of
   charge rails 107, 108, thereby placing the contact plate cover 195 in an open position as is

   shown in Fig. 8E.
   In still further embodiments, the charge rail system 106 is operable to accept a cart 10 in
   both directions, and fully charge the cart 10. That is, the charge rail system 106 allows for
 5 DC charging voltages to be accepted in either direction (positive to ground or ground to
   positive). A Power Management Unit (referred to herein as the "PMU") of the charge rail
   system 106 senses the presence of a cart 10 on the charge rails 107 and 108. Upon DC
   power contact, the PMU determines battery 135 capacity from previous battery readings
   prior to charging. The PMU may then initiate LED status indicators on the charging device
10 (here, a cart 10) to indicate a level of charge and when charging has commenced.
   In an embodiment, the PMU comprises a PIC processor in the charging unit and firmware.
   The PIC processor of the PMU communicates with the processor in the ECM 220 on the
   cart 10. The PMU monitors the communication control between the host cart ECM 200
15 and the PMU communication interface. If loss of communication occurs, default protocols
   may be executed. For example, the charge rails of the host system (i.e., cart) are shut down
   and reset or power to the system (e.g., cart) may be otherwise cycled, thereby preventing
   lockup conditions with the host ECM 200 and other subassemblies.
20 The PMU calculates the appropriate charging algorithm to charge the battery 135. In
   various embodiments, the calculation of the appropriate charging algorithm may be based
   upon voltage and/or temperature calculations. In various embodiments, the PMU uses
   measurement averaging routines to determine the charge routines, such as trickle charge,
   full charge, or over/low voltage fault conditions. Averaging helps to mitigate the effects of
25 contact chatter when the device being charged (i.e., the cart 10) traverses the charge rails
    107 and 108 (i.e., impedance fluctuations and the like). In an embodiment, the PMU
   imposes a delay (e.g., 5 or 10 seconds) from first contact to allow time for the cart to
   become fully nested and stop moving prior to commencing charging.
30 Additionally, the PMU senses error conditions for voltage levels or if the PMU loses
   communication with the host (i.e. the cart ECM 200), then the PMU initiates a self-reset to

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-16 /t12017
                                                               - 33
   recover and reestablish communication with the cart 10. Error conditions may include for
   example too low a voltage, or a very high voltage. Either case could indicate a bad cell in
   the battery 135, which would indicate that the battery 135 should not be charged with full
   charge. Error conditions are set in the PMU.
 5
   To prevent deep battery discharge of the cart 10, the PMU in still further embodiments,
   senses voltage level of the cart 10 and calculates remaining charge capacity. If the capacity
   approaches a predetermined threshold (such as 20% of remaining capacity, or in an
   illustrative system 11 volts), a warning message is issued via the communications port for
10 system action. If the low voltage condition persists after a predetermined period of time,
   the PMU may automatically shut down the entire system, thereby preserving the PMU
   power needed for subsequent operation (i.e. reboot) and allowing the device (i.e., cart 10)
   to be charged without replacing the battery 135.
15 In additional power management features, the PMU may be operable to shut down certain
   functions of the device to conserve system power during charging. For example, while the
   cart 10 is within the corral 110, the LCD is not needed, the RFID is not needed, and the
   like, while the wireless connection is still needed. By shutting off cart features that
   consume significant amounts of power while charging, faster charging is enabled.

                                                               - 36
   visual images to the consumer 85. The visual images may be transmitted to the video
   display 75 by any suitable means known in the art such as via a wireless transmission. In
   an embodiment, the video display 75 is of a type commonly referred to as a flat screen
   display, for example an LCD. The video display 75 may be powered by a rechargeable
 5 battery 135 attached to the cart 10 and operatively coupled to the video display 75.
   In another embodiment, the video display 75 is attached to the basket 20 and is foldable or
   retractable for storage. For example, the video display 75 may fold or retract into the
   interior 54 of the basket 20 for storage when the cart 10 is not in use. In an embodiment,
10 the video display 75 is configured to fold or retract such that a plurality of carts 10 may be
   nested for storage as shown in Fig. 12 without damaging the video display 75. For clarity,
   the outer cart in Fig. 12 is shown without rear side wall 31, with the understanding that rear
   side wall 31 would typically be present in carts used by a consumer 85.
15 In an embodiment, the base 76 of video display 75 forms a housing in which screen 77
   may retract. Such housing receives screen 77 in a retracted position and protects the screen
   77 from damage. The screen 77 may be retracted into such a base housing (comprising a
   front base housing 96 and a rear base housing 97) by known means such as rails, slides,
   rollers, telescoping members, and the like, which may be further biased, for example by
20 springs, as needed. The screen 77 may be retracted to a closed position by pushing on the
   top 71 of screen 77 where the screen 77 is biased up, or by releasing a latch or lock where
   the screen 77 is biased in a retracted position. In an embodiment, the screen 77 is folded
   down by contact with another cart when nested therewith as shown in Fig. 12 and is biased
   up such that the screen flips up upon unnesting of the carts.
25
   In another embodiment as shown in Fig. 13, the video display 75 comprises a hinge 79
   between the base 76 and the screen 77, which allows the screen 77 to fold downward
   toward the interior 54 of the basket 20 into a folded position as shown in Figs. 10 and 11.
   In an embodiment, the screen 77 folds at about a 90 degree angle with respect to the base
30 76 (or alternatively folds such that the screen 77 is about within the plane defining the
   upper edges of the cart), which clears the nose 45 and exterior of the cart for nesting with a

   second cart while also keeping the interior of the cart 10 clear such that the rear side wall
   31 may swing upward into the interior 54 of the basket 20 to receive the front side wall 28
   of a third cart.
 5 With reference to Fig. 14, the screen 77 of video display 75 may further comprise a shock
   absorber 94 protecting an electronic display 95 such as an LCD screen, each of which are
   disposed between front and rear screen housings 92, 93. The base 76 of video display 75
   may further comprise a hinge 79 disposed between front and rear base housings 96, 97.
   The hinge 79 may further comprise a gear assembly 91 comprising gears, springs,
10 dampeners, or combinations thereof for biasing the hinge in a folded or unfolded position.
   The gear assembly 91 may be used to control the force required to fold the screen 77 into a
   folded position, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11, in response to a force applied to a rear screen
   housing 93 of the video display 75. Likewise, the gears assembly 91 may be used to
   control the speed with which the screen 77 unfolds into an unfolded position such as
15 shown in Figs. 1-3. In an embodiment, the screen 77 unfolds in a slow, controlled manner
   to avoid damaging the screen 77. In an embodiment, the unfolding of the screen is
   dampened via dampeners in the hinge 79 and/or gear assembly 91.
   In another embodiment, the video display 75 is attached to the basket 20 and may be
20 swiveled such that the viewable area 78 may be viewed from various locations relative to
   the cart 10. A swivel may be positioned between the base 76 and the screen 77 such that
   the screen 77 may rotate or swivel about the base. The swivel may be integrated with the
   hinge 79, or alternatively may be a separate component, for example positioned between
   the hinge 79 and the screen 77. In embodiments where the video display is mounted on a
25 side edge 26, 27, the video display 75 may further comprise a swivel such that the
   viewable area 78 may rotated to face rearward toward the consumer 85 while the consumer
   85 is pushing the cart using handle 22. Alternatively, in embodiments where the video
   display 75 is mounted on the nose 45 of the cart, the video display 75 may swivel such that
   the consumer 85 may see the viewable area 78 from locations other than at the rear of the
30 cart. For example, a consumer 85 may wish to swivel a nose-mounted screen 77 sideways
   such that the viewable area 78 is readily viewable while standing at the side or front of the

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-16 /t12017
                                                               - 38
   cart 10. In an embodiment, the video display 75 may swivel about 180 degrees such that
   the viewable area 78 faces forward rather than facing rearward toward a consumer 85
   pushing the cart 10 via handle 22. From a forward facing position, the video display 75
   may further fold into a folded position such that the screen 77 is on the exterior of the
 5 basket 20 in a folded position, wherein the viewable area 78 is protected via mating with
   the base 76.
   In another embodiment, the video display 75 is attached to the basket 20 and may be
   heated such that the screen 77 is readily operable in cold environments. For example, the
10 video display of Fig. 9 may further comprise a heating element, which may be positioned
   internal or external to the screen housing 92, 93. Alternatively, the base housing 96 and 97,
   as described previously, may be heated such that the screen 77 is kept warm while in a
   retracted position. Any suitable heating element that is compatible with the screen
   components and operation thereof may be used, for example a resistive electrical heating
15 element. The heating element may be powered during storage and/or charging of other
   components of the cart 10, for example during charging of the battery 135 for video
   display 75.
   Referring to Fig. 15, in an embodiment, the cart 10 further comprises a read component
20 comprising at least one aisle Radio Frequency Identification ("RFID") reader 225 with
   RFID antennas 226, in conjunction with the ECM 200 and software operating thereon. The
   read component performs a proximity scan of the cart 10 that reads the area surrounding
   the cart 10. The number and position of the antennas 226 may be selected as functionally
   needed, as would be apparent to one of skill in the art. The aisle RFID reader 225 and the
25 antennas 226 may be an integrated component or may be separate components. In an
   embodiment, the aisle RFID reader 225 may be integrated with the ECM 200, for example
   located within housing 199. Alternatively, the aisle RFID reader 225 or may be located at
   other positions on the cart, for example integrated into the video display 75 or
   base/housing 76 or alternatively located on the underside of the cart 10, secured by means
30 of attachment to, for example, the bottom 21 of the basket 20, or to the base tray 50. In an
   embodiment, the RFID antennas 226 are located on either side of the housing 199 of the

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-16 /t12017
                                                               - 39
   ECM 200. Alternatively, the RFID antennas 226 may located at other positions on the cart,
   for example on side walls 23, 24; on edges 26, 27; on base side members 32, 33; on the
   sides of the video display 75; or any other position suitable for carrying out their intended
   function.
 5
   In an embodiment, the aisle RFID reader 225 and/or RFID antennas 226 may be integrated
   with the video display, for example one or both located on the side edges of the video
   display 75. In such a placement, the aisle RFID reader 225 and/or RFID antennas 226 are
   in a location to maximize the effectiveness of the reader distribution pattern and
10 encompass RFID tags located at various heights and locations along the shelves, when the
   video display is not retracted and the cart 10 is not nested. Placement on the video display
   is advantageous as the RFID reader/antenna are positioned at approximately the middle of
   the shelf height, thereby allowing an about equidistant scan pattern above and below the
   position of the RFID reader/antenna to cover the complete height of the shelf.
15
   In an embodiment, RFID antennas 226 are placed on the side edges of the video display
   75. In some embodiments, patch antennas may be used for the RFID antennas 226. In
   alternative embodiments, the RFID antennas 226 comprise bowtie and/or slot antennas,
   which narrow the field of broadcast for the antenna and have a more focused radiative
20 pattern. As illustrated for a bowtie-shaped aperture 211 of antenna 212 in Figure 20A and
   for a slot-shaped aperture 213 of antenna212 in Figure 20B having an approximate
   radiative patterns 207 and 208 of Figures 20C and 20D, respectively. In an embodiment, a
   bowtie or slot antenna having a beam approximately eighteen (18) inches wide and
   approximately six (6) to eight (8) feet high is used for the RFID antennas 226, and are
25 placed in vertical alignment parallel with the LCD video display (and/or at other suitable
   mounting locations on the cart) such that the radiative pattern of the antennas provides a
   narrow slice of broadcast in the direction perpendicular to each side of the cart for reading
   RFID tags located on the shelves or on items on the shelves on each side of an aisle. In an
   alternative embodiment, a bowtie or slot antenna having a radiative pattern of plus/minus
30 45 degrees (90 degrees total) in a vertical plane covering shelf height and plus/minus 15 to
   22.5 degrees (30 to 45 degrees total) in a horizontal plane covering shelf width is

   positioned on each side of the cart, for example mounted on or integrated with the video
   display 75. The use of slot and/or bowtie antennas provides a more focused field of view
   for the RFID reader to acquire specific tags, and thus may assist in eliminating unwanted
   interference, echos, reflections, and the like. Thus, the more focused field of view may also
 5 aid in more accurately determining position/location of the cart, and in particular in
   combination with other positioning/locating techniques described herein.
   Various means for attaching and attachment devices may be used as described herein. In an
   embodiment, the aisle RFID reader 225 with RFID antennas 226 may comprise a standard
10 or customized RFID configuration commercially available from for example ThingMagic,
   Alien TechnologyTM or an improvement or equivalent thereof. The aisle RFID reader 225
   and RFID antennas function to read a plurality of active or passive RFID tags positioned
   throughout a retail establishment (e.g., along shelves), as will be discussed in more detail.
   In an embodiment, the cart 10 is a plastic cart as described herein which lessens or
15 eliminates interference associated with the aisle RFID reader 225 and RFID antennas 226.
   In an embodiment, the cart 10 is a traditional cart comprising metal, plastic, or a
   combination of metal and plastic, retrofitted with the aisle RFID reader 225 and RFID
   antennas 226 and other media enhancements.
20 In or about a store, a consumer 85 may select a cart 10 from the cart corral 110 upon
   entering the store. The motion sensor(s) 36 detect that the cart 10 is moving when the
   consumer 85 begins to push the cart 10, and will activate the ECM 200, video display 75,
   and the aisle RFID reader 225. As previously noted, various components of the cart 10
   may be hibernated or re-activated based on motion by the cart to preserve power. In an
25 embodiment, the video display 75 may initially show the consumer 85 a welcome display
   that includes information about the store, explains the media enhancements to the cart 10,
   and/or announces in-store promotions. As shown in Fig. 15, as the consumer 85 pushes the
   cart 10 through the store, such as between two shelves 301 and 302, a plurality of RFID
   tags 303 and 304 (which may be active or passive RFID tags) located on or near the
30 shelves 301 and 302 respectively, will communicate with the aisle reader 225 via the
   antennas 226.

                                                               - 41
   In an embodiment, the RFID tags 303 and 304 may be distributed and affixed to objects
   throughout the store premises. For example, RFID tags 303 and 304 may be attached (i) at
   a shelf or fixture level, which refers to placement of tags at about regularly spaced
 5 intervals along a shelf or other product display areas such as kiosks, pillars, freezers,
   refrigeration units, walls, bins, and counters; (ii) at a SKU level, which refers to placement
   and/or incorporation of the tags with or near the standard SKU label, with a given product
   typically having one corresponding SKU tag positioned on the shelf adjacent the product;
   (iii) at a product level, which refers to having a tag on each individual product or package
10 of products, or (iv) combinations thereof. The aisle reader 225, operably connected to the
   ECM 200, will convey a signal comprising informational data to the ECM 200, causing the
   video display 75 to present location-based content to the screen 77. The RFID enablement
   of the cart permits advertisers and retail stores to interact with the consumer 85 as she
   navigates the store.
15
   The location-based content is determined as follows. In an embodiment, the aisle reader
   225 with antennas 226 reads any RFID tag 303 or 304 that comes within a cone-shaped
   pattern defining an electromagnetic zone 305 (of the aisle RFID reader 225) on either side
   of the cart 10. As noted previously, the shape of the electromagnetic zone or radiative
20 pattern may be adjusted based upon the type and positioning of the RFID components on
   the cart, for example use of bowtie and/or slot antennas. The shape of the electromagnetic
   zone 305 read by the aisle RFID reader 225 may be another shape, other than a cone,
   according to the particular aisle RFID reader 225 employed, and the range (i.e. proximity
   within which tags may be read by the reader) is likewise determined by the particular aisle
25 RFID reader 225 and antenna 226 array employed.
   When an RFID tag 303 or 304 passes through the electromagnetic zone 305, the tag is
   activated and communicates with the aisle RFID reader 225 according to known RFID
   techniques. A locationing component (which in an embodiment comprises the aisle RFID
30 reader 225, in conjunction with the ECM 200 and software operating thereon) determines
   the location of the cart 10 in the store by processing signals from any number of RFID tags

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 42
   303 or 304 that are within range of the aisle RFID reader 225. The location of the cart 10
   relative to specific RFID tags 303 or 304 is determined according to well known RFID
   positioning techniques. In an embodiment, location may be determined based on the
   strength of the signals coming from the RFID tags 303 and 304 (i.e. highest number of
 5 scans read by the aisle RFID reader 225 indicates which tag or tags 303 and 304 are
   closest).
   In an embodiment, the process of locating the cart 10 begins by creating an electronic
   representation of the store configuration including fixtures, aisles, and other relevant data
10 using the location of a number of reference or anchor RFID tags (e.g., shelf or fixture level
   tags) placed around the store in known locations. This electronic representation provides a
   base map of the store. The base store map may be built using the cart 10 by placing the
   anchor RFID tags in the known locations around the store, taking the cart 10 through
   various routes throughout the store to read each of the anchor RFID tags, and correlating
15 the read data with the known data. The base store map is materialized as either database
   entries or an xml document generated from the correlated data. The base store map
   provides reference data for determining the location of other goods or items in the store.
   As fixtures, items, and/or anchor tags are moved within the store, the base store map may
   be updated by taking the cart 10 through the store again to obtain fresh data and correlate it
20 with the updated known anchor RFID locations.
   Against the backdrop of the anchor RFID tags, a series of virtual locations are created and
   positioned within the defined framework of the store, i.e., the base store map. Each
   location, such as for example a shelf, freezer fixture, aisle, or produce bin, can then be
25 defined as associated with one or more anchor RFID tags, which may be active or passive
   tags, as previously noted. Such known locations may be used to determine the location of
   the cart, for example using the RFID locator service software routine described below.
   Furthermore, the known locations may be correlated to specific products, for example via
   use of additional SKU level and/or product level RFID tags. For example, a given product
30 such milk may be correlated to a specific refrigerator having a known location within the
   base store map. Via such correlation, the location of specific products can be provided

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 43
   relative to the known location of the cart within the store, and the consumer may be
   provided directions to such products.
   In various embodiments, subcategories may be used for product positioning instead of
 5 positioning every single product with a location in the store. Using subcategories simplifies
   store deployment. Each product is tied to a subcategory, and each subcategory is in turn
   associated with a location in the store. Thus, milk may be assigned to dairy or milk may be
   a subcategory including all brands and varieties of milk (e.g., whole, skim, etc.).
10 As discussed herein, the aisle RFID reader 225 is located upon the cart with the RFID
   antennae 226 oriented facing outward from the cart. Given that the cart and associated
   RFID reader is mobile within the store whereas the RFID tags are typically stationary
   within the store, various RFID data along with other positioning information (for example,
   motion sensor data) may be gathered and analyzed using software algorithms, for example
15 operating on ECM 200 or a remote location such as a store server and provided to the cart.
   The antennae configuration (position, orientation, type) is made known in inputs to the
   software processes involved in locating the cart in the store, as well as performing useful
   tasks such as shelf management for tasks including inventory, price changes, and the like.
   The RFID are evaluated using the known antenna orientation and configuration in order to
20 determine cart orientation.
   For instance, at a recurring interval, the aisle RFID reader 225 may perform an inventory
   by recording RFID information for products located on the shelves and correlating the
   recorded information with the store's system. The results of the inventory may then be
25 analyzed and used in decisions regarding orders for additional products and product
   placement in the store.
   In locating the cart (which may then be used for determining the placement of
   advertisements in the video display 75, store purposes, or data mining for external or
30 internal uses), for each antenna, the RFID tags "in view," or located within the radiative
   pattern of the antenna 226, are evaluated. The evaluation process uses several pieces of

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-16 /t12017
                                                               - 44
   information to determine the location of the cart within the store, and specifically within
   the electronic base store map defined above.
   The RFID locater service software routine that encompasses these functions performs
 5 location inventory and store mapping that is used to determine what any given cart is doing
   within the store, and provides an added level of accuracy in addition to the RFID location
   determination. The intelligence involved in the RFID locater service intelligently links
   what is read by the aisle RFID reader 225 with information known about the store based on
   the base store map and the known locations of anchor RFID tags. In an embodiment, the
10 anchor RFID tags may be located at regular intervals, such as every 2 feet along the
   shelves, or on each side of fixtures such as produce bins, and the like. The RFID locater
   service additionally incorporates knowledge about RFID dead zones, such as foyers or the
   locations surrounding large metal fixtures that may interfere with RFID signals, so that
   locating the cart 10 is smooth and continuous regardless of where the cart is located in the
15 store. For example, metal refrigerators tend to generate a lot of reflections such that RFID
   readings in the vicinity of a refrigerator are full of noise. The RFK) locater service can
   account for known reflections in such an area, and adjust what the RFID reader 225 reads
   in such an area.
20 In an embodiment, location is determined via a scan to determine what products and items
   are in proximity to the cart (i.e., an inventory of tags read by the scanner) and correlating
   same to the cart's determined position to check the accuracy of the determined position and
   correct same as needed. The ECM 200 issues a read command to the aisle RFID reader
   225. The locator software process then evaluates the read RFID tags (e.g., SKU and/or
25 product level tags) to eliminate tags generating spurious reads, i.e., those included in the
   read that are not RFID tags associated with a location as established via the anchor RFID
   tags (e.g., shelf level tags). The remaining tags are then converted to locations indicated in
   the map. All of the locations (e.g., all RFID tag data) may then be evaluated to determine
   the cart location and orientation relative to the locations defined in the base store map.
30 Such RFID data may be further correlated with other locationing means and data such as
   motion sensors such as the reed switch described herein. In this process, the software

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 45
   assumes and takes into account the anticipated read zone of the two antennae. If evaluated
   individually, each tag indicates the orientation of the cart. The overall orientation is
   determined by evaluating the orientation differential of each tag location from the
   orientation indicated by the complete location inventory. The "outlying" locations
 5 providing an orientation that is substantially out of correlation in comparison with the
   others within the inventory are removed, given that they represent spurious locations
   derived from spurious tag reads.
   In some cases, RFID reads during inventory will be non-deterministic. Inconsistencies in
10 the RF environmental (e.g., reflections, nulls, false reads, signal collisions, etc.), physical
   obstructions, technology failure and other factors may cause unpredictable inventory
   responses. Spurious reads are defined as those that are inconsistent with the results
   expected for the cart in a given position and orientation. For example, one spurious read
   would occur for a tag that shows up in the inventory that is outside the maximum expected
15 read range of the aisle RFID reader 225. Furthermore, transient reads are defined as those
   that are consistent with the expected results for a given cart position and orientation, but
   that do not consistently appear in a set of inventory reports collected over an arbitrary
   period of time.
20 With the inventory of locations in the system, locations may then be evaluated to
   determine cart position as a relative x,y coordinate within store map. The system employs
   a location buffer to smooth out errors introduced by transient tag reads. The remaining
   locations are evaluated, and an average x,y position is calculated. The nearest location
   (among the inventory locations) to the calculated location is determined and the cart
25 position is adjusted according to which location is nearest. This adjusted position is then
   compared to the map and further adjusted as necessary to position the cart accurately
   within the map. Such positions and data may be further compared to known/mapped routes
   or paths within the store to further assist in determining the location of the cart. For
   example, if may be know that a consumer will likely travel a certain path based upon the
30 position within the store and same may be used to help track and position the cart as it
   traverses the anticipated path.

                                                               - 46
   A number of rules may be applied in the evaluation of the inventory location to improve
   the accuracy of locating the cart, and therefore also the efficacy of the cart 10 as a shelf
   management tool. For example, a temporal rule may be applied such that recent tags reads
 5 are prioritized above older reads into determining cart position. Additionally, recent
   location reports may be used in determining if a particular tag represents a spurious read.
   Similarly, a volume rule may be applied, such that a large volume of tag reads occurring
   during a given time frame are prioritized above smaller volumes of tag reads for
10 determining cart position. For example, a RFID tag "seen" by the aisle RFID reader 225
   twenty times during the last second is prioritized above a RFID tag "seen" only one time
   during the last second. Likewise, a proximity rule may be applied, wherein RFID tags in
   the inventory that are proximate to one another are prioritized above RFID tags in the
   inventory that are not proximate. In such a case, proximity is based upon the base store
15 map and business rules.
   In various embodiments, the accuracy of the determination of cart location is improved by
   the addition of the magnetic reed switch, discussed previously as an embodiment for the
   motion sensor(s) 36. The rotational speed of each wheel may be determined based on the
20 "heartbeat" signal generated each time the magnet opens or closes the magnetic reed
   switch, preferably without physical contact thereof, when the wheel turns. By placing a
   magnet and reed switch assembly on two wheels, such as, for example, on both back
   wheels, the ECM 200 may determine when the cart 10 is turning as an added factor in
   accurately determining the location and orientation of the cart 10. Specifically, when the
25 cart 10 is turning, such as around a comer or to enter a next aisle in the store, the wheel to
   the inside of the turn will not rotate as much as the wheel to the outside of the turn, and by
   comparing the difference in rotational speed of each wheel, the ECM 200 locationing
   component may incorporate the knowledge that the cart 10 is turning a corner or turning
   around to supplement the locationing performed by the aisle RFID reader 225 and antenna
30 226.

                                                               - 47
   In various embodiments, the locationing component further includes an integrated compass
   for additional optimization of locationing for the cart. In some embodiments, the integrated
   compass is a digital compass. The compass provides various functions, including enabling
   the provision of an enhanced path layout for precise data reporting of shopping events.
 5 Another function of the compass is to provide directionality or a heading for the cart 10 in
   a store map. For example, the directionality provided by the compass enables display of a
   direction icon in a store map to identifiable areas of the store. For example, the point of
   sale (i.e., check out) area of the store, restrooms, store exits, and store departments. Such
   directionality is relative to the present location of the cart based on the proximity scan as
10 described herein.
   In various embodiments, the accuracy of the determination of cart location is improved by
   the addition of an Automatic Gain Control ("AGC") module. The use of an AGC module
   to control the transmit power and/or antenna attenuation of the aisle RFID reader 225
15 provides still another means of improving the accurate determine of cart location and,
   therefore, product awareness. In operation, the AGC module, which may be implemented
   in a software routine and executed from the ECM 200, automatically controls each antenna
   226. Specifically, the AGC may be used, as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art,
   to either increase the transmit power or adjust attenuation. By doing so, sensitivity to tags
20 may be controlled so that tags that are "unexpectedly" read, in that they are not located
   within the expected radiation pattern of the antenna 226 and aisle RFID reader 225 yet still
   are read, may be avoided. For example, the cart 10 may be located on aisle 4, but
   unexpectedly is reading tags from adjacent aisles 3 and 5. Tags from the adjacent aisle are
   "unexpected" based on the presently determined cart location. To correct for the
25 unexpected tags, the AGC adjusts the attenuation or power of the read signal, such that the
   tags from the adjacent aisles are no longer read. In another example, the cart 10 may be
   located on aisle 4, but is not reading all of the "expected" tags for aisle 4. In order to
   correct for the missing, but expected tags, the AGC adjusts the transmitted power until the
   expected tags, based on the cart's presently determined location, are read by the aisle RFID
30 reader 225. The AGC module may particularly be useful for improving accuracy of cart
   location in areas with higher interference or when many carts are in close proximity. By

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               -48
   adjusting transmit power and/or attenuation (i.e., providing automated, real-time, dynamic
   power control from the RFID reader/antennae), the AGC module provides the additional
   advantage of conserving power by adjusting the power such that an appropriate and
   efficient amount of power is used in reading the RFID tags.
 5
   In testing, it has become clear that as there are more RFID tags broadcasting, it becomes
   more and more complex to discern whether there is a good transmit and receive from a
   particular RFID tag among the group. The present system presents a special challenge in
   that other applications do not use as many readers as close together. The present system
10 has a uniquely high number of RFID readers in close proximity to one another, and the
   number of readers in close proximity to one another is constantly changing as carts move
   around.
   Two things happen when the number of RFID readers in close proximity to another is a
15 large number and constantly changing. First, passive RFID tags become saturated by all
   the RF energy. Second, each reader becomes saturated by too much interference, resulting
   in a phenomenon referred to as dense reader mode. Dense reader mode is when multiple
   RFID readers are broadcasting and receiving RFID information and the resulting RFID
   read performance is fluctuating and/or decreasing from the available number of RFID tag
20 reads within the useable read range of the RFID tags. Specifically, dense reader mode is a
   mode of operation that prevents readers from interfering with one another when many are
   used in close proximity to one another.
   As discussed previously, it is possible to partially optimize RFID reader performance by
25 increasing or decreasing the gain until an optimal number of tags are detected. However,
   upon further testing, it has become apparent that additional optimization may be achieved
   by increasing or decreasing other characteristics in addition to power. For example, in
   addition to adjusting power up or down, RFID reader performance is optimized by
   increasing or decreasing the duty cycle (i.e. the transmit on and off time such as broadcast
30 on for 2 seconds, and off for 8 seconds for a 20% duty cycle). Additionally, RFID reader
   performance may be further optimized by adjusting the antennas themselves. As there is an

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 49
   antenna directed to both sides of the cart (or alternatively, a single bidirectional antenna),
   each can be adjusted individually such that the antennas (or directions for a single antenna)
   are not matched, until an optimal number of tags are detected. For example, it is possible to
   alter the sleep time (i.e., the duty cycle for one antenna or antenna direction as relative to
 5 other antenna or antenna direction respectively).
   Such optimization allows a greater number of readers to function with a limited RF
   domain. Such optimization also allows a large number of readers to co-exist within a small
   fixed area, such as in the Point of Sale (i.e. check out) area of a store.

   In an embodiment, the locationing component is similarly operable to determine the
   location of a given product relative to the shopping cart 10 based on signals from the read
   component. The locationing component then displays on the video display 75 the location
   of the given product in relation to the cart 10. In an embodiment, the locationing
15 component may comprise software, hardware or a combination of hardware and software
   operable to determine the location of the shopping cart or a product in the store. The
   locationing component may, in an embodiment comprise hardware affixed to the cart with
   software incorporated therein, or may, in an embodiment, comprise hardware affixed to the
   cart operably coupled with software stored in and/or executed from the ECM 200 or
20 another networked component. In an embodiment, the locationing component may be
   integrated within the ECM 200.
   In an embodiment, the location of the given product in relation to the location of the cart
   10 may be graphically displayed on the video display 75 on a floor plan of the store, using
25 an indicator to show the location of the cart 10 on the floor plan of the store and another
   indicator to show the location of the given product on the floor plan of the store. In an
   embodiment, the indicators may comprise directional arrows 309, as will be discussed
   further below. In an embodiment, the location of the given product in relation to the
   location of the cart 10 may be described using words relative to a floor plan of the store.
30 For example, such a written direction may be provided in the video display 75 by
   indicating "You are on Aisle 2, the Product you are looking for is on Aisle 9 to your left."

   In an embodiment, the locationing component is operable so as to locate a given product
   being displayed in an advertisement on the video display 75 relative to the shopping cart
    10. In an embodiment, the locationing component then displays on the video display 75 the
 5 location of the product being advertised in relation to the cart 10. In an embodiment, the
   location of the product being advertised in relation to the location of the cart 10 may be
   graphically displayed on the video display, using an indicator, such as an arrow, displayed
   adjacent to or as part of the advertisement to point towards the location of the product
   being advertised. In an embodiment, the location of the product being advertised in relation
10 to the location of the cart 10 may be described using words to indicate to the consumer
   where she may find the product being advertised. For example, in or adjacent to an
   advertisement for laundry detergent, an indicator reading "Laundry Detergent ahead on the
   right" may be displayed based on the location of the cart.
15 Referring now to Figs. 16, 17 and 18, upon determining the proximity of the cart 10 to any
   particular tag or tags 303 or 304, the ECM 200 causes at least one advertisement 306 to be
   displayed to the consumer 85 on the video display 75. The advertisement 306 displayed
   may be selected from a plurality of stored advertisements 307, and the advertisement 306
   may be selected based on the proximity of the cart 10 to a particular tag or tags 303 or 304.
20 In an embodiment, the plurality of stored advertisements 307 may be stored in the ISS 330,
   streamed to the ECM 200 via a wireless LAN (e.g., transceivers 205 mounted in the store
   communicating with the network transceiver 204 in ECM 200), and displayed on the video
   display 75 according to the location of the cart 10. In an embodiment, the plurality of
   stored advertisements 307 may be stored in local memory 202 in the MOD, accessed, and
25 displayed on the video display 75. When the cart 10 enters a different area of the store and
   the aisle RFID reader 225 detects different RFID tags 303 or 304, the location of the cart
    10 is updated, and the advertisement 306 is changed to reflect a different one of the
   plurality of the stored advertisements 307 based on the updated location of the cart 10.
30 As shown in Fig. 16, in an embodiment, the screen 77 of the video display 75 may be
   divided into a plurality of screen segments 308, such that one of the plurality of stored

   advertisements 307 may be displayed in each screen segment 308. In an embodiment, one
   of the plurality of screen segments 308 may be designated for display of consumer specific
   information, such as the running total of the products in the cart 10, loyalty card or other
   consumer identifying information, product information pertaining to a specific product
 5 recently placed in the cart 10, and the like.
   Referring again to Fig. 16, an exemplary display of advertising is shown. In an
   embodiment, a selected number of the plurality of stored advertisements 307 (equal to the
   number of screen segments 308) are displayed in the screen segments 308. Directional
10 arrows 309 may be provided as an indication to point in the general direction of the
   advertised product on adjacent shelves. In an embodiment, one screen segment 308a may
   be more prominently sized than the other screen segments 308b, such that one of the
   plurality of stored advertisement 307 is displayed in the more prominently sized screen
   segment 308a, while others of the plurality of stored advertisements 307 are displayed in
15 the less prominently sized screen segments 308b. This division of the screen 77 into screen
   segments 308 may be analogized to advertisements in a newspaper, wherein various of the
   advertisements may use one half, one quarter, one third of a page, etc. to fill a page with
   advertisements, and the cost of running an advertisement in each portion of a page may
   relate to the size of the advertisement relative to the rest of the page, the prominence of the
20 advertisement on the page, the duration of time the advertisement is on the page, or
   combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the selected plurality of stored advertisements
   307 may rotate being displayed on each screen segment 308, such that the most prominent
   screen segment 308 displays each of the selected ones of the plurality of stored
   advertisements 307, one after another, based on the time each one of the plurality of stored
25 advertisements 307 has been displayed, or based on the location of the cart 10 between the
   shelves 301 and 302 in proximity to tags 303 and 304, which may be further correlated to
   the proximity of the cart to the advertised product on the shelf.
   Rather than showing multiple advertisements in various screen segments, a single
30 advertisement at a time may be displayed in a screen segment generally reserved for
   advertising. A multi-tier approach may be used to determine pricing of advertisements

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-16 /t12017
                                                               - 52
   when a single screen segment is devoted to advertising, given that the newspaper analogy
   may not apply. For example, advertising may instead be sold for zones of the store,
   whether based on what types of products will be shelved there, or based on consumer
   traffic patterns in the store. For example, pricing may be different and the types of
 5 advertisements that will be effective will vary based on whether the advertisement segment
   is purchased for advertisements to be displayed along high traffic routes such as the front
   aisle of the store, or the lower traffic areas, such as the pharmacy or deli. Selling
   advertising based on when and where it will be displayed may permit advertising
   companies to make decisions to effectively market products even while only one
10 advertisement is displayed at a time in the video display 75.
   In an alternative embodiment, no one screen segment is sized more prominently than the
   other, but rather, a simplified, unique split screen Graphical User Interface ("GUI") is
   shown, as is illustrated in Figure 21 A. The unique attributes of the GUI are associated
15 with cart operation and LCD display position. The GUI provides the consumer with user
   friendly easy access to cart functionality while maintaining readability and utility as
   viewed from the nose-mounted position at the opposite end of the cart from the consumer.
   The GUI may be adjusting to one of a plurality of user levels, providing basic,
20 intermediate, or advanced functionalities of the enhanced cart 10 based on how the
   consumer prefers to use the cart 10. The GUI shown in Figure 21A enables the consumer
   to access the basic level of functionality, and does not require the use of any identifying
   information associated with the consumer to carry out the functions. In an embodiment, the
   video display defaults to the basic level of functionality when the cart 10 is powered on.
25 The basic level of functionality displayed in the menu includes "Find Item," "Store
   Specials," and "View Help," each of which may be displayed in the form of a button,
   textual link or the like for selection by the consumer. In the segment below the menu,
   space is reserved for display of an advertisement that is placed there when so indicated by
   the ECM 200, as discussed herein. Upon selection of a menu item, the GUI changes for
30 each functional menu item.

                                                               - 53
   Upon selecting "Store Specials," the GUI reflects the view of Figure 21B. In Figure 21B,
   the Store Specials are shown, along with a button or link to show a full screen view of the
   store specials (which eliminates the space below reserved for display of advertisements), or
   return to the main menu. If the "Full Screen" is not selected, the space for display of
 5 advertisements remains displayed.
   Upon selecting "View Help," the GUI reflects the view of Figure 21C. In Figure 21C, a
   menu appears that presents to the consumer the choices of "find item," "store specials,"
   "price check," and more, according to the desires of the store for which the cart is
10 configured. A link for a tutorial on the use of the cart 10 may be provided, along with a
   button or link to return to the main menu.
   From the "View Help" view of the GUI, when "Find Item" is selected, the GUI provides
   the view of Figure 21 D, wherein the user may scroll and select letter or number characters
15 using the five-way navigation device 123. Additional links for returning to the main menu
   or viewing a store map may also be provided. The store map provided by the link, as
   shown in Figure 2 IE, may graphically indicate where in the store the cart is located as well
   as the location of an item for which the consumer is searching using the "Find Item"
   feature.
20
   From the "View Help" view of the GUI, when "Price Check" is selected, the GUI provides
   the view of Figure 21F, which displays a price (or prices, if a sale price is additionally
   available, or if a discount price is available for loyalty consumer 85s). In the price check
   view, the consumer may scan a product using the scanner 215, and the price is displayed.
25 Also, as seen in Figure 2 IF, an advertisement may be displayed in the space reserved for
   advertisements. The price check feature may be activated via a price check button as
   described herein.
   Referring now to Figure 23, an exemplary scrolling menu for a user interface is shown in
30 accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, content
   displayed on the video display 75 is navigated and controlled by way of a scrolling menu

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 54
   1100. The scrolling menu 1100 includes a plurality of functions that may be selected, each
   function represented by a graphical icon 1 102a-d. The scrolling menu 1100 rotates the
   functions, represented by icons 1102a-d, as directed by a user, for example when the user
   indicates an upward scrolling motion, a downward scrolling motion, or sideways scrolling
 5 motion with the five-way navigation device 123. The scrolling menu 1100 may present the
   functions in a horizontal or a vertical presentation (as shown in Figure 23), which may be
   navigated using the relevant directional controls of the five-way navigation device 123.
   The scrolling menu 1100 may additionally include indicators of direction 1104 in order to
   help users determine how to use the directional control to scroll through the scrolling menu
10 functions. In various embodiments, each function may alternatively or additionally be
   represented by text that easily identifies the function to a user. The text indicating a
   function may likewise be scrolled around within the scrolling menu.
   The scrolling menu includes a selection position 1106, such that when a particular function
15 icon (1 102b as shown) is scrolled into the selection position 1106, content associated with
   the function icon is displayed in some or all of the remaining space visible in the video
   display 75. The video display 75 dynamically magnifies the content associated with
   whatever function icon is presently in the selection position 1106, in order for the user to
   see and use the associated content to achieve an objective that the function offers.
20
   In various embodiments, the selection position 1106 is indicated by an icon 1108 that
   differentiates the selection position 1106 from the other positions in the scrolling menu
   1100. As shown in Figure 23, the selection position 1106 is indicated by a right-facing
   arrow (i.e., the icon 1108), indicating that the associated content for the function in the
25 selection position 1106 is magnified in the area of the video display 75 to the right of the
   selection position 1106. In alternative embodiments, any icon may be used to indicate the
   selection position 1106, such as a magnifying glass or other attention-getting graphical
   icons or text such as the box 1106 shown in Figure 23.
30 In the video display 75, the available display space may be apportioned into at least two
   areas, though in various embodiments, the available display space may be apportioned into

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 55
   more than two areas. As shown in Figure 24, in a first area 1200 of the available display
   space, the scrolling menu 1100 may be presented, while in a second area 1201 of the
   available display space, content 1110 is displayed, wherein the content 1110 is associated
   with the particular function presently displayed in the selection position 1106 of the
 5 scrolling menu 1100. As the scrolling menu 1100 scrolls, the content 1110 displayed in the
   second area 1201 of the display space dynamically changes, preferably as rapidly as the
   user is scrolling the scrolling menu. As such, when each function icon is within the
   selection position 1106, the content 1110 associated with that function is displayed, and the
   instant that the function within the selection position 1106 changes, so does the content
10 1110 displayed in the second area 1201.
   Thereby, the user is presented with a real-time graphical display that changes according to
   her wishes and comfort level with using the user interface. For example, an elderly
   consumer who is not accustomed to using a computer or a first time user of the media
15 enabled shopper cart may scroll the scrolling menu slowly, and the associated content is
   displayed at the same rate, as she scrolls the menu, affording her as much time as she needs
   to look at and become familiar with the content. By comparison, a shopper who is more
   familiar with using the media enabled shopping cart may scroll the menu quickly to use
   functions that she is already familiar with, and will be displayed the selected feature
20 dynamically, in real time.
   In embodiments having the available display space apportioned into more than two areas,
   additional space may be used to display, for example, advertisements, a help function in
   addition to the function in the selection position, a store map, instructional photographs
25 (for example, a photograph showing the user how to scan a product for a price check), and
   retailer sales, promotions, or logos. As may be seen in Figure 25, the first area 1200 is used
   to display the scrolling menu 1100, the second area 1201 is used to display the content
   1110 associated with the function in the selection position 1106, and a third area 1202 of
   the available display space is used to display an advertisement, which may be selected
30 based on the location of the cart within the store, or based on historical information known
   about the consumer's purchasing habits.

   The scrolling menu 1100 may include any number of different functions, including, for
   example, a "Price Check" function, enabling the consumer 85 to scan an item to see the
   item's price, a "Store Special" function, enabling the consumer 85 to review (and
 5 optionally find on a store map) reduced or special price items, an "Item Finder" function,
   enabling the consumer 85 to request the location of a particular product, and a "Help"
   option, enabling the consumer 85 to receive helpful tips for use of the media enabled
   shopping cart. Additional optional functions may include various service functions, such as
   an interface with an in-store pharmacy for the consumer 85 to request the status of their
10 prescription or receive notification of prescription availability, an interface with an in-store
   deli for the consumer 85 to make a deli order or receive notification of order availability,
   an interface for notification to the consumer 85 of completion of in-store auto servicing, an
   interface for interaction between the consumer 85 and customer service personnel for
   services such as rain checks, and other functions for in-store services.
15
   Some or all of these functions may be included in the basic level of functionality. In
   addition to these functions, additional functionality of the cart 10 is available to users who
   desire to additionally enhance their shopping experience at an intermediate level of
   functionality and at an advanced level of functionality. At the intermediate level of
20 functionality, the consumer may scan products at the cart 10 using the scanner 215, view
   the scanned cart contents and a running total, and remove an item from the cart by
   scanning an item that has already been placed in the cart 10. The intermediate level of
   functionality may be accessed by a consumer by simply starting to use the scanner 215. To
   use the intermediate level of functionality, the consumer is not required to identify himself
25 or herself, but may do so using a loyalty card associated with his or her identity, or by
   simply using a PIN. The consumer has the option to use a consumer created Personal
   Identification Number (PIN) which is unique to the consumer, but may or may not be
   associated with any consumer information such as name, address, and the like, in the same
   manner as a loyalty card identifier. Using a PIN, the consumer may retrieve saved
30 electronic shopping lists, favorite recipes, and nutritional information in some advanced
   features, but does not have to identify him or herself with a name and address. In an

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017

   embodiment, the PIN comprises a phone number, optionally with a security code.
   In an embodiment, the level of functionality selected and the resultant display screens and
   features made available to a consumer 85 is based upon existing data entered by the user or
 5 gathered from previous use of the cart 10 by the consumer 85. For example, upon scanning
   of a loyalty card or entry of a PIN, a database may be consulted to determine what level of
   functionality the consumer 85 has selected or previously used, and then the appropriate
   functionality and display screens are presented to the user. Such data can be tracked over
   time and functionality adjusted to correspond to preferences and usage by the consumer
10 85. For example, as the consumer 85 becomes experienced in using the system, more
   detailed information and functionality may be provided to the consumer 85. Alternatively,
   tutorials or other help functions may be provided for inexperienced users.
   At the advanced level of functionality, the consumer may additionally perform a cart level
15 express check out, when products for purchase have already been scanned, view nutritional
   information and recipes, and view lists according to store departments. The consumer may
   also create, save, and retrieve electronic shopping lists, and obtain loyalty card prices and
   promotions.
20 In various embodiments, when the consumer identifies himself or herself to the cart 10 by
   way of a loyalty card, a consumer privacy notice may be displayed. The privacy notice
   may be displayed upon the first use of the cart 10 by a particular user who has identified
   himself or herself by way of a loyalty card, and thereafter, when the consumer identifies
   himself or herself via a loyalty card, the privacy notice will not be displayed since it has
25 been displayed and accepted by the consumer before.
   The unique attributes of the GUI are associated with cart operation and LCD display
   position. The GUI provides the consumer with user-friendly easy access to cart
   functionality while maintaining readability and utility as viewed from the nose-mounted
30 position at the opposite end of the cart from the consumer.

   Referring now to Figure 24, when the function icon for "Price Check" is scrolled in the
   scrolling menu 1100 to the selection position 1106, content 1110 associated with the price
   check function is displayed in the second area 1201. Specifically, the content 1110 may
   include instructions to a user, either textually or graphically, for how to carry out a price
 5 check. In various embodiments, the instructions indicate that to check a price of an item,
   the consumer 85 presses a particular one of the buttons of the five way navigation device
    123, and scans the item's UPC code using the scanner 215.
   The content 1110 associated with the price check function may additionally include, as
10 shown in Figure 24, a helper icon 1205 to offer the consumer 85 an additional way to seek
   information, or a tutorial, on the use of the price check function. Although not shown in
   Figure 24, but discussed above, an advertisement, such as an advertisement for the item for
   which the price is being checked, another product made by the same company, or a
   competing product, may be displayed in a third area reserved for advertisements 1202.
15
   Upon a scan of an item by the consumer 85 while the content associated with the price
   check function is being displayed, the user interface dynamically changes to display the
   results of the price check, i.e., a price (or prices, if a sale price is additionally available, a
   discount price if available for loyalty consumer 85s, or a per unit price) as shown in Figure
20 25. The results of the price check may be displayed in a full screen, consuming all
   available display space not used for displaying the scrolling menu, or may be displayed in
   one area, such as a second area 1201, while a third area 1202 is used for displaying other
   content, such as an advertisement for the item for which the price is being checked, another
   product made by the same company, or a competing product.
25
   Additionally, as shown in Figure 25, a Price Check History may be displayed including
   each item for which the consumer 85 has performed a price check during the particular
   shopping trip. The Price Check History may be used by the consumer 85 to perform
   comparison shopping, or to decide which items to keep for purchase, and which items to
30 return to a store shelf. An icon may be provided for clearing the Price Check History.

   Referring now to Figure 26, when the function icon for "Store Specials" is scrolled in the
   scrolling menu 1100 to the selection position 1106, content 1110 associated with the store
   specials function is displayed in the second area 1201. Specifically, the content 1110 may
   include an item description 1401 and a feature price 1402 for each item priced for Store
 5 Specials (such as weekly specials). The item description 1401 may include a product name
   brand (e.g., PringlesTM) and type (e.g., Original), as well as a size (e.g., 6 ounces)
   purchased for the feature price 1402. In various embodiments, the content 1110 associated
   with the store specials function may include instructions to indicate that to view a location
   for a particular item from the list displayed for store specials, the consumer 85 may press a
10 particular one of the buttons of the five way navigation device 123 while highlighted the
   particular item in which she is interested, and a location of the product relative to the
   present location of the cart may be displayed in a store map.
   The list of store specials items may be displayed in a full screen, consuming all available
15 display space not used for displaying the scrolling menu 1100, or may be displayed in one
   area, such as a second area 1201, while a third area 1202 is used for displaying other
   content, such as an advertisement, which may be selected based on the location of the cart
   within the store, or based on historical information known about the consumer's 85
   purchasing habits.
20
   The content 1110 associated with the store specials function may additionally include, as
   shown in Figure 26, a helper icon 1205 to offer the consumer 85 an additional way to seek
   information, or a tutorial, on the use of the store specials function.
25 Referring now to Figure 27, when the function icon for "Find Item" is scrolled in the
   scrolling menu 1100 to the selection position 1106, content 1110 associated with the item
   finder function is displayed in the second area 1201. Specifically, the content 1110 may
   include a keyboard 1500 in the second area 1201 and a list of items in store inventory 1502
   pertaining to the search may be displayed in a third area 1202. The graphical keyboard
30 1500 displayed in the second area 1201 may be navigated by the consumer 85 using the
   five way navigation device 123. Specifically, the consumer 85 may use arrow buttons of

   the five way navigation device 123 to scroll through the letters in the keyboard 1500, and
   press the center button or "*" button in order to select a character. Using the keyboard, the
   consumer 85 may spell out the brand name or the item name for a product.
 5 Upon the consumer 85 typing a first letter of the brand name or item name of a sought after
   product 1508, the list of items in store inventory 1502 pertaining to the search may be
   narrowed to items in the store inventory that start with the letter that was typed. For
   example, as shown in Figure 27 A, when the letter "T" is entered in the keyboard 1500, the
   list of items in store inventory 1502 is narrowed to only items with a brand name or item
10 name in store inventory that start with the letter "T." Upon the consumer 85 typing a
   second letter of the brand name or item name of the sought after product 1508, a narrowed
   list 1504 of the items in store inventory pertaining to the search may be displayed. For
   example, as shown in Figure 27B, when the letter "A" is entered in the keyboard 1500, the
   list of items in store inventory 1502 is narrowed to the narrowed list 1504 to include and
15 display only items with a brand name or item name in store inventory that start with the
   letter "T" and the next letter is the letter "A."
   Likewise, upon the consumer 85 typing a third letter of the brand name or item name of the
   sought after product 1508, a further narrowed list 1506 of the items in store inventory
20 pertaining to the search may be displayed. For example, as shown in Figure 27C, when the
   letter "C" is entered in the keyboard 1500, the list of items in store inventory 1502 is
   narrowed again to the further narrowed list 1506 to include and display only items with a
   brand name or item name in store inventory that start with the letter "T," having the second
   letter as the letter "A," and having the third letter as the letter "C," and so on. The
25 consumer 85 may enter as few or as many letters of the brand name or item name of the
   product he or she seeks to find, such that if all letters of the name are entered, the list 1502
   is narrowed to only the item he or she seeks to find. The consumer 85 may enter fewer than
   all of the letters of the name, and once the list is narrowed sufficiently to display in the list
   the sought after item, the consumer 85 may select the item from the list 1502, 1504, 1506,
30 or so on.

   Upon selection of the item from the list 1502, 1504, 1506, or so on, the result of the "find
   item" is displayed, identifying the sought after product 1508. Specifically, the location of
   the sought after item 1508 is displayed on a store map 1600 relative to the present location
   of the cart as shown in Figure 28. The present location of the cart may be indicated with an
 5 icon representing the cart 1602, and the location of the sought after item 1508 may be
   indicated with an icon representing the item 1604. In various embodiments, an icon
   representing "zoom" 1608 may enable the consumer 85 to zoom in on the map for an
   additional level of detail to find the sought after item 1508.
10 The content 1110 associated with the item finder function may additionally include, as
   shown in Figures 27A-C and 28, a helper icon 1205 to offer the consumer 85 an additional
   way to seek information, or a tutorial, on the use of the item finder function.
   In some embodiments, a link for a tutorial on the use of the cart 10 may be provided, along
15 with a button or link to return to the main menu. In some embodiments, a user may enter a
   question by way of a keyboard such as that described above with respect to the item finder
   function, and an answer, if one exists in a database of frequently asked questions, may be
   displayed. In some embodiments, an index of topics pertaining to frequently asked
   questions may be displayed, enabling the user to select any one relevant to her question for
20 review.
   Referring now to Figure 29, a method is shown for navigating the scrolling menu functions
   with a user interface in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The user
   interface displays the scrolling menu in the first area of the available display space (block
25  1700). The user interface also dynamically displays in the second area of the available
   display space content associated with a menu option in the selection position of the
   scrolling menu (block 1702). The term "dynamic display" is intended to indicate that as the
   scrolling menu is scrolled in any direction (e.g., up and down for a vertical scrolling menu
   or right and left for a horizontal scrolling menu), the content displayed in the second area is

   associated with that particular function is displayed, and the instant that the function within
   the selection position changes (i.e., due to movement of the scrolling menu by the user),
   the content displayed in the second area is also updated.
 5 If the user is scrolling the menu (at block 1704), the user interface dynamically updates the
   content displayed in the second area to show different content (i.e., the content associated
   with the menu option presently shown in the selection position) (block 1706). As described
   previously, the scrolling menu may be scrolled by the user at any rate, based on the
   comfort level of the user with the media enabled shopping system.

   If the user is not scrolling the menu at block 1704, then if the user is manipulating the
   content associated with the menu option in the selection position (at block 1708), the user
   interface dynamically displays in the second area the result of manipulation of the content
   (block 1710).

   In the method described with respect to Figure 29, one menu option of the plurality of
   menu options may include the price check function. As such, the content associated with
   the menu option for the price check function dynamically displays a prompt to the user to
   scan an item at the cart to determine a price for the item, and upon detecting that an item
20 has been scanned, dynamically displays the result of the manipulation of the content, i.e.,
   displays a price for the item.
   In the method described with respect to Figure 29, one menu option of the plurality of
   menu options may include the store special function. As such, the content associated with
25 the menu option for the store special function dynamically displays at least one sale item
   (and preferably a list of the store's regular specials), and a price for the sale item. Upon
   selection of a particular sale item by the user to view a location for the sale item (i.e.,
   manipulation of the content), the result of the manipulation of the content is displayed, that
   is the location for the sale item in a store map.

   menu options may include the item finder function. As such, the content associated with
   the menu option for the item finder function dynamically displays an alphanumeric
   keyboard display, enabling entry of an item name. Upon entry of letters (resulting in
   dynamic display of valid combinations of the entered letters), and listing products of the
 5 valid combinations of the entered letters, and selection of an item from the list by the user
   (i.e., manipulation of the content), the result is dynamically displayed, that is the location
   for the entered and selected item in a store map. Generating the list of products of the valid
   combination of entered letters may include accessing a database of items in the store to
   display each item containing each letter or number successively entered in the
10 alphanumeric keyboard, narrowing the list of items contained with each letter entered.
   In the method described with respect to Figure 29, one menu option of the plurality of
   menu options may include the help function. As such, the content associated with the menu
   option for the help function dynamically displays a step-by-step explanation of use of the
15 menu option to which the user most recently scrolled. Alternatively, the content associated
   with the menu option for the help function may display an index of topics for frequently
   asked questions, and upon selection of a topic from the index (i.e., manipulation of the
   content), the result is dynamically displayed, that is the answer to the selected topic.
20 With the content associated for each menu option, the user interface may additionally
   display advertising associated with the content associated with the menu option. In the
   sense used here, the "associated" advertising may include advertising for an item in the
   associated content (such as advertising for an item entered in the item finder function
   associated content), advertising for a competing item (such as advertising for an item that
25 competes with an entered in the price check function associated content), or advertising
   simply relevant based on the location of the cart within the store.
   Optionally, prior to display by the user interface, the user interface may generate a prompt
   to a user to perform an action, such as a prompt to the user that instructs the user to scan a
30 loyalty card. Upon the user scanning a loyalty card, the plurality of menu options available
   for that user to choose in the scrolling menu may be broadened (if an advanced user), or

   In various embodiments, a price check may be performed locally, without accessing the
   store server to obtain a price for a particular item. In such embodiments, as in earlier
 5 described embodiments, the consumer 85 scans a product using the scanner 215. A price
   database may be maintained locally in the ECM 200 of the cart 10, such that a price check
   accesses the local database of prices, rather than obtaining the price wirelessly from the
   store server. Prices in the price database may be regularly updated, such as each night, or
   each time a cart is placed in the cart corral, in order for prices to stay up-to-date. Prices
10 may alternatively be updated in real time, by wireless downloads of price changes to the
   price database at any time.
   As mentioned above, the scrolling menu 1100 may include a number of different functions,
   including, for example, enabling a consumer 85 to remotely request and secure a place in a
15 store department's service queue. In one embodiment as shown in Figure 30, a consumer
   85 can navigate the scrolling menu 1100 with the five way navigation device 123 and
   scroll the store's deli function icon 310 into the selection position 1106. Once the deli
   function icon 310 has been scrolled into the selection position 1106, the content associated
   with the deli function icon 310, including a request for a queue number assignment icon
20 311 is displayed in some of the remaining space visible in the video display 75. The
   consumer 85 may then use the five way navigation device 123 to move the selection
   position 1106 from the deli function icon 310 to the displayed content associated with the
   deli function icon 310 and scroll the queue number assignment icon 311 into the selection
   position 1106 and activate the queue number assignment icon 311 to request a deli queue
25 number 360. This would be the equivalent of going to the deli and tearing off a paper tag to
   enter the deli queue.
   In an embodiment, as shown in Figure 30, when the consumer 85 activates the queue
   number assignment icon 311, this authorizes the ECM 200 to generate a queue number
30 request signal with a cart specific identifier 312 that is communicated to a queuing number
   processor 313 via the network transceiver 204. The network transceiver 204 is one of a

   number of electronic queue number-related information receivers employed in this
   electronic queuing system. Other electronic queue number-related information receivers
   include a queue number request signal receiver 364, a queue number receiver 366, and a
   queuing system transceiver 368. Transmit and receive functions may be carried out by
 5 separate components or a common component (e.g., transceiver) as will be understood by
   those skilled in the art. The network transceiver 204 transfers the queue number request
   signal with a cart specific identifier 312 to the queuing number processor 313 via a
   wireless link between the network transceiver 204 and the queuing number processor 313.
   The queue number processor 313 may generally analogized to, or recognized as, a typical
10 queue number dispenser that may be found in various automotive, pharmacy, photo lab,
   and deli service areas. These dispensers, like the queue number processor 313 of the
   instant disclosure, may be configured to provide hard and/or electronic notice of the queue
   number place assigned to a requesting customer. Additionally, these devices may be
   networked so that direct requests for queue positions, e.g., physically pulling a tab from a
15 dispenser, and remote requests for queue positions, e.g., the cart based request described
   below, may be coordinated and allocated in the most efficient and customer friendly
   manner. The queuing number processor 313 is configured with a queue number request
   signal receiver 364 to receive the queue number request signal with a cart specific
   identifier 312. The queuing number processor 313 is also configured to generate successive
20 queue number signals with a cart specific identifier 365 in response to queue number
   request signals 312. The queuing number processor 313 communicates the queue number
   signal with a cart specific identifier 365 to the ISS 330 via the queuing number processor
   transmitter 367 and the store's WLAN. The ISS 330 receives the queue number signal with
   a cart specific identifier 365 via its queuing system transceiver 368. The ISS 330
25 determines where in the service queue to place the cart 10 associated with the queue
   number request signal with a cart specific identifier 312. The ISS 330 is configured with a
   queue number generator 369 for generating a queue number 360. The ISS 330 is also
   configured with a queue number provider 361 that operates to communicate the assigned
   queue number 360, to the cart 10 and to the queuing number processor 313, via the
30 queuing system transceiver 368 and the store's WLAN. The cart 10 receives assigned
   queue number 360 by way of the network transceiver 204. The queuing number processor

   313 receives the assigned queue number 360 by way of the queue number receiver 366.
   When determining where in the queue to place the cart 10 associated with the queue
   number request signal with a cart specific identifier 312, the ISS 330 may consider: the
   distance the cart 10 has to travel to reach the service queue; the number of requests for
 5 queue numbers, both non-remote and direct (e.g., walkups), over a period of time; the
   items contained on the consumer's 85 shopping list that has been uploaded onto the cart 10;
   the loyalty or preferred status of the consumer 85; allowing for the availability of sufficient
   and efficient queue numbers for store consumer 85 s choosing to directly obtain a queue
   number from the service queue; and any other factors relating to placing the cart 10
10 associated with the queue number signal with a cart specific identifier 312 into the service
   queue, other than mere sequential requests for queue numbers. The ISS 330 may also
   generate and communicate an estimated time to service signal 362 to the cart 10 via
   queuing system transceiver 368 and the store's WLAN which is received by the cart 10 by
   the network transceiver 204. The ISS 330 may also generate other queue number-related
15 information 363, such as the current queue number being served, and communicate that
   other queue number-related information 363 to the cart 10 via the store's WLAN which is
   received by the cart 10 by the network transceiver 204.
   While the above details one embodiment of the remote service queuing functionality of the
20 cart 10, Figure 31 represents another embodiment whereby the consumer 85 activates the
   queue number assignment icon 311, this authorizes the ECM 200 to generate a queue
   number request signal with a cart specific identifier 312 that is communicated to the ISS
   330 by the network transceiver 204 via the WLAN. The network transceiver 204 is one of
   a number of electronic queue number-related information receivers employed in this
25 electronic queuing system. Other electronic queue number-related information receivers
   include a queue number request signal receiver 364, a queue number receiver 366, and a
   queuing system transceiver 368. The ISS 330 receives the queue number request signal
   with a cart specific identifier 312 by way of the queuing system transceiver 368 and
   utilizes the queuing system transceiver 368 to query the queuing number processor 313 for
30 a queue number 360. The queuing number processor 313 is configured with a queue
   number request signal receiver 364 to receive the queue number request signal with a cart

   specific identifier 312. The queuing number processor 313 is also configured with a queue
   number generator 369 to generate successive queue numbers with cart specific identifiers
   322 in response to queue number request signals 312. The queuing number processor 313
   communicates a generated queue number with a cart specific identifier 322 to the ISS 330
 5 via the queuing number processor transmitter 367. The ISS 330 receives the queue number
   with a cart specific identifier 322 by way of the queue number receiver 366. The ISS 330 is
   also configured with a queue number provider 361 that operates to communicate the
   assigned queue number 360 to the cart 10 via the queuing system transceiver 368 and the
   store's WLAN. The ISS 330 may also generate and communicate an estimated time to
10 service signal 362 to the cart 10 via the store's WLAN which is received by the cart 10 by
   the network transceiver 204. The ISS 330 may also generate other queue number-related
   information 363, such as current queue number being served, and communicate that other
   queue number-related information 363 to the cart 10 via the store's WLAN which is
   received by the cart 10 by the network transceiver 204.

20 embodiment, the aisle RFID reader 225 with antennas 226 may scan, identify, and count
   each individual product by means of the individual RFID tag, and convey this information
   via the ECM 200/network transceiver 204 to other network components to be discussed
   herein in greater detail below, enabling retailers to manage the store inventory to an
   exacting degree of accuracy on a continuous basis. Furthermore, all or a portion of the aisle
25 tags 303 and 304 may be replaced via products labeled with individual RFID tags, and the
   system may otherwise function as described herein.
   The aisle RFID reader 225 and antennas 226 may assist the store management with store
   planograms and inventory. A planogram is a diagram of fixtures and products that
30 illustrates how and where retail products should be displayed, usually on a store shelf, bin
   or counter in order to influence                            consumer selection. Consumer packaged goods

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 72
   manafacturers often release a suggested planogram with their new product, to show how it
   relates to existing products in the same category, though stores also develop planograms of
   their own. Because a planogram involves the location of products within the store, the aisle
   RFID reader 225 and antennas 226 can detect the location of products at the Stock Keeping
 5 Unit ("SKU") level. Many inventory management systems assign a unique SKU for each
   product and also for its variants, and SKUs are assigned and serialized at the merchant
   level.
   In use, when a cart 10 is moved through the store, the aisle RFID reader 225 and antennas
10 226 scan the SKU assigned to product lines or product bundles on the shelves 301 and 302
   that are labeled with individual RFID tags, each RFID tag being associated with a SKU. In
   this embodiment, the aisle RFID reader 225 with antennas 226 may scan, identify, and
   locate each product line or bundle by means of the RFID tag, and convey this information
   via the ECM 200/network transceiver 204 to other network components to be discussed
15 herein in greater detail below, enabling retailers to locate products throughout the store to
   manage, update and design the store planogram in an efficient and consistent manner.
   The cart 10 enables re-mapping of the store. As discussed above, taking the cart 10 through
   various paths in the store following rearrangement of products will result in the cart 10
20 reading the RFID tags (e.g., SKU and/or product level tags) marking the new locations of
   each moved product relative to the anchor RFID tags (e.g., shelf level tags that have not
   moved), and convey the new locations to the system, such that the location of products in
   the store readily updated in relationship to the base store map.
25 Additionally, the cart 10 enables inventory that may be performed on an on-going basis
   with real-time updates for stores that sell products identified at the product level by an
   RFID tag. When any cart 10 reads no product level RFID tags at a location (marked by an
   anchor) where products are expected to be, the cart 10 may convey this information to the
   store system to update the inventory for the products that are no longer filling the shelves
30 where expected. This allows real-time product inventory and restocking.

                                                               -73
   An employee is enabled by the cart 10 to quickly reshelve products that are misplaced,
   such as when a consumer decides not to purchase a product and leaves it at the Point of
   Purchase or in a location other than where the product is shelved. By using the shelf
   management system of the cart 10, the employee may scan the misplaced product, and
 5 according the map, be directed to the location in the store where the scanned product is
   supposed to be shelved. The employee may even confirm that he or she is putting the
   product back in the appropriate location by scanning the sticker located on the shelf,
   because the sticker, usually with a price indicated, is associated with a specific location for
   a specific product.
10
   When the store implements price changes for a list of products, an employee or group of
   employees usually must go around the store, find all the products with changed prices, and
   swap out signs and labels, which can be a time consuming task that occurs at regular
   intervals (e.g., weekly specials). The cart 10 enables an efficient process for dynamically
15 changing prices for products accurately and quickly.
   Specifically, for the price change process enabled by the cart 10, price changes, such as for
   weekly specials and the like, are entered in a database of prices in the store system. An
   employee may then use a cart in shelf management mode to go throughout the store to
20 change labels. A battery powered, wireless printer may be placed in the cart 10, such as in
   the child seat 60, and operably coupled (e.g., wired or wireless, such as Bluetooth, wi-fl, or
   infra red) to the ECM 200 for printing new price labels when the cart is located in the right
   location for a given product. The employee identifies himself or herself to the cart 10 by
   scanning an employee badge, much like scanning a loyalty card, that enables access to the
25 shelf management features unavailable to consumers. The price changes entered into the
   database are conveyed to the cart's ECM 200 from the store system. Based on known
   locations of the products listed, the cart 10 displays to the employee a map, as shown in the
   view of Figure 22. The view of Figure 22 shows the list of products for which a price
   change is being implemented, a location of each product on the list, the old price, the new
30 price, and permits the employee to check a product off the list once the price has been
   changed.

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-16 /t12017
                                                               -74
   The employee moves the cart to the location of a product on the list, and when the
   employee has found the location of the product, he or she may scan one item of the product
   to confirm that the shelf location is actually the right shelf location for the product on the
 5 list. Once the location is confirmed as correct for the product, the employee prints a new
   label on the wireless printer placed in the cart, and places the new label with the new price
   over the old label with the old price on the shelf. Once the new label is in place, the
   employee checks the product off the list, and the cart 10 conveys to the store system that
   the price change has been implemented at the shelf level. The store system may then
10 charge the new price at the Point of Purchase, thereby allow real-time pricing updates.
   In a large store, or in a store holding many specials such as for a holiday weekend, the
   process of updating for price changes is greatly sped up using one or more carts 10 as
   discussed herein. Additionally, the price changes are dynamic, in that they take effect as
15 soon as a new price label is in place on the shelf. With the scanning ability of the cart 10 to
   confirm that the new price label is being placed in the proper location, price changes are
   also more accurate than relying on any given employee's knowledge of product placement
   within the store.
20 As the consumer checks out (i.e. renders payment) at the Point of Sale 300, the POS
   computer 326 (e.g., computerized register) or POS server 325 may record the purchases
   made by that consumer 85 using that particular cart 10. The POS computer 326, the POS
   server 325, and other systems such as security systems or consumer loyalty systems may
   be referred to generically as retailer systems. Retailer systems provide automated,
25 computerized services with respect to consumer or store needs. In an embodiment, retailer
   systems may comprise components of the overall store network. In an embodiment, retailer
   systems may be stand-alone functional units operating separately from the store network.
   In an embodiment, a retailer system may comprise a point of sale system to interact with
   individual carts or consumers for processing payment at the conclusion of a shopping trip.
30 In an embodiment, a retailer system may comprise a consumer loyalty system for
   rewarding consumer loyalty with discounts and other advantages, while tracking shopping

   history for advertising purpose. In an embodiment, a retailer system may comprise a
   security system for tracking the location of carts within the store or areas outside the store,
   such as, for example, alerting the store management to the location of carts when
   abandoned or broken, whether carts have left the store premises or when carts remain in
 5 the parking lot to be returned to the store.
   In an embodiment, the cart 10 includes a cart RFID tag that may be read by a POS RFID
   reader coupled to the POS server computer 326 or POS server 325. The cart RFID tag may
   be located anywhere on the cart, and in an embodiment is located on or in video display
10 75, for example in the screen housing 92, 93. In an embodiment, the cart RFID tag is
   located on or in the video display 75 along with the network transceiver 204. The POS
   RFID reader may read the cart RFID tag, thereby identifying a specific cart, for example
   via the cart RFID tag associated with a serial or identification number. Alternatively, the
   POS system may use a bar code scanner to scan a bar code on the particular cart that
15 uniquely identifies the cart and correlate the bar code with the serial or identification
   number. Alternatively, the particular cart may be identified and correlated manually at the
   POS, for example via entry of the serial or identification number labeled on the cart into
   the POS computer 326. The information obtained, both by checkout (e.g., via bar code
   and/or basket RFID scanning) and/or by the cart 10 during shopping (e.g., via bar code
20 and/or basket RFID scanning), may be correlated to a particular cart (based on the cart's
   unique identity) and/or transferred to the ISS 330 and the Host Central Server 340. Such
   correlation may occur anonymously, for example, without reference to the identity of the
   consumer. Such information may further be correlated with a specific consumer, for
   example via scan or entry of a loyalty card, a pin code, a telephone number, or other
25 consumer identifier. Such information may further be correlated with specific advertising
   displayed during the particular use of the shopping cart.
   The basket RFID reader 227 in conjunction with the ECM 200 may have identified and
   stored the identity of each product placed in the cart 10 during shopping, such that upon
30 approaching the Point of Sale 300, the POS computer 326 may initiate checkout services
   based on the products for purchase known to be in the cart 10 by the ECM 200, as

                                                       11l2017

   communicated to the POS computer 326 via the network transceiver 204. Thus, the RFID
   enablement of the shopping cart and the application of RFID tags at the individual product
   level will facilitate the shopper's Point of Sale checkout efficiency. Alternatively, the
   consumer 85 may use the scanner 215 to scan each product placed in the basket, such that
 5 upon approaching the Point of Sale 300, the POS computer 326 may initiate checkout
   services based on the products for purchase known the be in the cart 10 by the ECM 200,
   as communicated to the POS computer 326 via the network transceiver 204.
   In various embodiments, certain features may be additionally available at the Point of Sale.
10 In one embodiment, the cart maintains a running total for items for purchase by the
   consumer 85 (i.e., the inventory of the cart). The total may be conveyed from the cart to
   the Point of Sale computer, and confirmed by the consumer 85 for completing the purchase
   transaction without requiring the inventory of the cart to be scanned over again at the Point
   of Sale. Upon displaying the cart total from the cart on the Point of Sale computer, the
15 consumer 85 verifies that the amount is accurate, and completes the transaction (i.e.,
   swipes a credit or debit card, completes her check, or provides a sufficient amount of
   cash).
   In other embodiments, at the Point of Sale, the actual cart weight for the inventory of the
20 cart is measured and compared for example to the known, expected weight for the
   inventory of the cart. Specifically, the cart and the contents are weight and compared to the
   weight for the cart that is known, and the weight for the contents, known based on the
   inventory of the cart. A difference between the actual cart weight for the inventory and the
   known, expected weight indicates a potential problem of theft, and may generate an alert to
25 the store server and/or an employee.
   Implementing the improvements described herein, an assisted self-checkout may be
   performed at a "regular" checkout lane (i.e., a Point of Sale computer equipped for
   purchase transaction). The consumer 85 proceeds with a shopping trip, scanning items for
30 purchase as she goes, and placing the items in her cart. Upon her approach to the Point of
   Sale, the ECM 200 on her cart communicates the cart inventory and total from the cart to

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 77
   the Point of Sale computer. When consumer's 85 turn comes to complete the purchase
   transaction, the consumer's 85 cart 10 and its contents are weighed. In various
   embodiments, the cart or an employee may instruct the consumer 85 to remove personal
   items such as a handbag, as well as any child present in the child seat, in order for an
 5 accurate measurement of the weight of the cart and its contents. The actual weight of the
   cart and its contents are compared to the known, expected weight for the cart and the
   contents: the weight of the contents is calculated based on known weights for each item
   sold in the store and the inventory of the cart communicated when the consumer 85
   approached the Point of Sale. If the actual weight exceeds the known, expected weight, an
10 alert may be generated to notify store security or a store employee to assist the consumer
   85 with removing personal items that should not have been included in the actual weight.
   In various embodiments, the alert is only generated if the weight difference exceeds a
   predetermined threshold amount.
15 Upon confirmation of the actual weight relative to the known, expected weight, the Point
   of Sale computer displays the cart total to the consumer 85 for verification. In an
   embodiment, the Point of Sale computer asks the consumer 85 "Does the total below equal
   the total for your cart? If so, press 1, and if not, press 2 for assistance." When the consumer
   85 selects "2" if the total does not equal the cart total, a store employee may assist in
20 finalizing the purchase, while when the consumer 85 selects "1," the Point of Sale
   computer further prompts the consumer 85 to complete the purchase transaction using her
   preferred method of payment (i.e., a credit card, check, cash, or debit account associated
   with consumer). The Point of Sale computer accepts the consumer 85 's payment, provides
   any cash back requested by the consumer 85, and the transaction is complete. In
25 embodiments, the entire purchase transaction from the time the consumer 85 enters the
   Point of Sale transaction is limited only to the amount of time necessary for the consumer
   85 to carry out her payment option, with only negligible time used to weigh the cart and
   contents for comparison and verify the cart total.
30 In use, the consumer 85 may also use the cart for services that in the related art would
   require the consumer to find a store employee. Via voice commands delivered to the voice

                                                               -78
   activated interface 120 operably coupled to the ECM 200 and the in-store network, the
   consumer 85 may request the location of a specific product or request information
   pertaining to a particular product such as nutritional information, whether any specials for
   that product are available, and recipes that may incorporate a product. By activating the
 5 voice activated interface 120 by way of the five way navigation device 123, the consumer
   85 may also contact various in-store services, such as a pharmacy, deli counter, or
   automotive service station to initiate an order or check on the status of their order. The
   consumer 85 may additionally contact customer services within the store without waiting
   in line at a counter, by calling the customer service desk from the voice activated interface,
10 enabling activities such as requesting a rain check or reporting a safety hazard in the store.
   In other embodiments, the consumer 85 may use the voice activated interface as a means
   of calling a person or service outside of the store, by using the ECM 200' s communication
   abilities to connect to the Internet, enabling Voice Over Internet Protocol ("VoIP")
   technology. For example, a consumer 85 may wish to check with their spouse regarding
15 which product to buy or for shopping list products, and may use the VoIP enablement and
   voice activated interface 120 to call home.
   Another in-store use is the bar-code scanning. A consumer 85 may choose to scan their
   own products with the scanner 215 inset into the handle 22 or pod 150, enabling him to
20 view a running total for the products in the cart 10 for purchase. By scanning the products
   during the shopping trip using the scanner 215, the scanner 215 enables the consumer 85 to
   avoid waiting in the checkout lanes, as the ECM 200 may communicate the products being
   purchased, the price of each product, and the running total, as well as the value of any
   coupons used and scanned by the consumer 85 to the POS computer 326 upon arriving at
25 the Point of Sale 300. Bar-code scanning during shopping, in conjunction with the cart 10
   communicating the scanned inventory to the Point of Sale 300, facilitates more efficient
   check out services for consumers.
   In addition to the voice activated interface 120, the consumer 85 may use a number of the
30 media enhancements of the cart 10 via the five way navigation device inset in the handle
   22 or pod 150. The consumer may press the voice activation button 122 (which preferably

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 79
   is a center button of the five way navigation device 123) to activate the voice recognition
   system as well as to navigate other applications to access certain functions and information
   on the cart 10 such as product location and other product information. The five way
   navigation device 123 may be used to maneuver through the menu of options 124
 5 displayed on the video display 75.
   As the cart supports voice recognition and additionally connects to the store server
   wirelessly (and thereby a connection to the Internet is provided to the cart), the cart may be
   enabled for communication via VoIP. VoIP on the cart offers the ability to call, for
10 example, customer service within the store (for example, to report a spill or ask for
   assistance), store personnel (i.e. to reach the store manager for a complaint or compliment),
   and between carts (e.g., for store employees to use in set up, inventory, and the like). In
   one embodiment, a "call" icon may be provided on the screen of the cart. The user may
   select the icon either by a voice command or using the five way navigation device, and
15 communicate via VoIP using the wireless internet to the store server, which is tied in turn
   to the customer service desk or the Internet generally to communicate by VoIP with
   individuals outside of the store (e.g., call home to check for an ingredient).
   With the media enhancements, a consumer 85 will have the capability to formulate a
20 shopping list at home on the Internet, forward the list to the store via email, and upon
   registering with a cart 10 with a loyalty card or other consumer identifier in the store, have
   their shopping list displayed on the video display 75 and be guided through the store in
   aisle and product order, showing specials, promotions, and product location for products
   on their shopping list.
25
   In various embodiments, the cart provides the consumer 85 with shopper features to
   enhance the shopping experience. In one shopper feature, the consumer 85 is enabled to
   save and name shopping lists. In one embodiment, saving and naming shopping lists may
   be performed from a web site, while in other embodiments, saving and naming shopping
30 lists may be performed directly on the cart. In further embodiments, saving and naming
   shopping lists may be performed on a mobile device, such as a handheld computer, a

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                                    - 80
   BlackberryTM, or a mobile telephone, and transferred to the cart wirelessly, by infrared, or
   by BluetoothTM enabled technology. Saved shopping lists may be tied to a user identifier,
   and retrieved upon scanning a loyalty card or other identifying card.
 5 In some embodiments, an additional shopper feature provides a course directing the
   consumer 85 to each item on the shopping list. A shopping list that comprises, for
   example, a wedding or baby registry, may include a course providing directions for the
   consumer 85 to find each item on the list within the store, enabling faster and easier
   identification of list items for purchase. In various embodiments, the course may be
10 displayed in a graphical representation of the store. In various other embodiments, the
   course may be generated by displaying at the top of the shopping list the items from the list
   closest in proximity and in the direction in which the cart is moving, constantly updated as
   the cart moves.
15 In another shopper feature, the consumer 85 is enabled to email a recipe or a link to a
   vendor's web site with a recipe to an email address. The email address may include an
   email address on file or an email address entered on the cart. In various embodiments, the
   email address is verified before sending.
20 In another shopper feature, the consumer 85 is enabled to scan and use coupons at the cart,
   such that the cart total accurately reflects the price discount provided by the coupons
   during the shopping trip. In such embodiments, the amount of savings for coupons, and
   identity of coupons and products for which the coupons are used are conveyed to the Point
   of Sale computer.
25
   In another shopper feature, a folder of personalized reminders for the consumer 85 is
   stored. As with the shopping lists, the folder of personalized reminders may be tied to a
   user identifier, and retrieved upon scanning a loyalty card or other identifying card.
   Personalized reminders may include greeting card reminders for birthdays, anniversaries,
30 and other holidays.                             Personalized reminders may additionally include prescription
   reminders for an in-store pharmacy. In various embodiments, when a reminder is generated

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-l6/ I/2017
                                                               - 81
   by the cart to alert the consumer 85 with a prescription reminder, the consumer 85 may
   select the reminder to automatically place the prescription order (i.e., refill) with the in
   store pharmacy, and another alert may be provided to the consumer 85 via the cart when
   the prescription order is ready to be picked up. Other personalized reminders may also be
 5 available, such as monthly refills for standard pantry items, pet items, and the like.
   In various embodiments, any saved personalized items, such as lists or reminders, may be
   uploaded to the enterprise server, enabling the consumer 85 to access the items in the
   premises of any retailer that employs the overall system, making the items portable from
10 retailer to retailer, assisting with comparison shopping and easier use of lists without the
   consumer 85 having to maintain different lists for the various stores where she shops.
   Furthermore, stored items may be automatically updated in real time when the consumer
   85 makes additions or changes.
15 The cart 10, by way of the media enhancements discussed above captures real-time
   purchasing behavior at the individual consumer level and provides back end data mining
   and analytical reporting. The cart 10 captures information that is specific down to the
   second about the cart 10 and a consumer's movement and interactions with the cart, and
   records it for use by retailers and advertisers. For example, consumer shopping patterns
20 may be collected, anonymously if preferred by the consumer, for analysis and use by
   advertisers, consumer goods manufacturers, and retailers. Retailers may use the cart
   information for store operations, as discussed herein with respect to shelf management.
   Additionally, service and maintenance information provides timely information to cart
   maintenance personnel regarding cart usage and problems.
25
   In an embodiment, when the consumer 85 brings the cart 10 to the Point of Sale 300 at the
   conclusion of the shopping trip, the ECM 200 may communicate data to the ISS 330, a
   POS server 325, a POS computer 326, or combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the
   ECM 200 communicates with ISS 330, which in turn communicates with POS server 325,
30 which in turn communicates with POS computer 326, and vice-versa. Typically, the POS
   server 325 and the POS computer 326 are part of an existing local area network in a given

   store, and the ISS 330 typically would be added as a new component to the existing local
   area network upon implementation of the media enabled shopping cart at a particular
   location. While not required, communication with the ECM 200 may be facilitated by
   directing such communication through the ISS 330, rather than directly with ECM 200.

   In an embodiment, the cart 10 communicates the identity of the products being purchased
   to the POS computer 326 or POS server 325 via the ISS 330, as the identity of each
   product was obtained during shopping when the consumer 85 scanned the product with the
   scanner 215 or the basket RFID reader 227 identified the product when it was placed in the
10 cart 10. Alternatively, the POS computer 326 or POS server 325 may obtain the identity of
   the products being purchased by the consumer 85 or a store employee scanning the bar
   code on each product at the Point of Sale 300.
   As the consumer checks out (i.e. renders payment) at the Point of Sale 300, the POS
15 computer 326 or POS server 325 may record the purchases made by that consumer 85
   using that particular cart 10 as described herein. The information obtained, both by
   checkout and by the cart 10 during shopping, may be transferred to/from the ISS 330
   and/or the Host Central Server 340. Using data mining advances enabled by the cart 10 and
   its media enhancements, advertisers can individually track the effectiveness of advertising
20 and pricing campaigns without compromising the personal identity of the consumer,
   alleviating privacy concerns of consumer groups. Alternatively, the information can be
   correlated to a specific consumer, for example via a loyalty card program, where the
   consumer is agreeable to such.
25 The data communicated by the ECM 200 may include data programmed to its memory, or
   data collected and stored in the memory over the course of the consumer's 85 shopping
   trips (initiated when the consumer 85 first moved the cart 10). In an embodiment, such data
   may include any of the following: 1) the identity of the cart, 2) where in the store the cart
   has been, 3) which advertisements have been displayed to the consumer using the cart, 4)
30 the length of time spent with each advertisement displayed and the length of time spent in
   specific areas or aisles of the store, 5) what products are in the cart 10 for purchase, 6) if

   age, spending and purchasing habits), 7) store traffic patterns such as time, day, period,
   duration, etc., and 8) cart usage patterns (e.g., number used, typical user, functions
   accessed, etc.). Such data may be correlated to determine the effectiveness of advertising
 5 presented via the media enable cart to the consumer at the point of purchase (i.e.,
   proximate the point in time when the consumer is selecting a particular product to be
   placed in the basket and purchased).

   In particular advertising data may be correlated or integrated with sales data to determine
   the effectiveness of the ad on an anonymous purchaser, or alternatively on an identifiable
   consumer such as via further correlation of data provided via a loyalty program. Where the
 5 consumer is identified, purchasing data may be tracked over time to determine the
   effectiveness of advertising and to determine whether additional and/or modified
   advertising is desired. Such correlations may further provide a wealth of useful data such
   purchasing patterns based upon consumer demographics;              geographic    or regional
   preferences or variations; product placement; ad content, style, timing, etc. For example,
10 reports could be generated indicating store traffic patterns; ad impact; product volume,
   market share by consumer 85/household/group/store/region,           repeat purchases, etc.;
   consumer purchasing trends (products, dollar amounts, etc.); average size and content of
   total purchase per time, day, season, etc.; purchases by product category or segment,
   household, store, region, etc.; consumer survey results; etc.

   The data mining capabilities of the media enhanced cart 10 described herein enable access
   to metrics unique to advertising as used in conjunction with the media enhanced cart 10.
   The communications features of the cart 10 enable advertisers to remotely download to the
   ISS 330 (and subsequently to each cart 10, in some embodiments) changes in advertising.
20 Changes in advertising may be made in response to information obtained through data
   mining, as discussed herein. The media enhancements described herein enable advertisers
   to test advertisements in various demographic or geographic groups, and see the
   effectiveness in an immediate fashion, in that new statistical data is continuously being
   generated and reported. Such advertising may then be modified as needed and/or rolled out
25 on in a large scale campaign.
   The media enabled shopping cart system described herein provides a number of
   advantageous features including the ability to (a) target anonymous consumers with
   specific product promotions and information at the exact point of purchase and product
30 selection in a retail store aisle; (b) provide specific promotions to loyalty card consumer
   85s who have opted into the program; (c) provide shopping enhancement tools to the

   system to electronically manage product location and pricing in the store, and (h) modify
   shopper traffic patterns, for example redirecting consumers to low traffic aisles and/or to
   high margin products.
10 Referring to Figs. 4 and 17, the cart 10 may receive Wireless Local Area Network
   ("WLAN") signals including video streams in 802. Hx format. In an embodiment, a
   plurality of wireless access points 320 may be located throughout the store to provide
   network coverage to each cart 10 located in the store, communicating by way of the
   network transceiver 204 (e.g., a wireless modem) in ECM 200. The network transceiver
15 204 may be located anywhere on cart 10 and is operably coupled to ECM 200. In an
   embodiment, the network transceiver is integrated with display 75, or alternatively is
   integrated with ECM 200. Data may be transferred to and from the cart 10 via the wireless
   link between the network transceiver 204 and the POS Server 325. Data may be transferred
   to and from the cart 10 via the wireless link between the network transceiver 204 and the
20 ISS 330. The ISS 330 may store cart 10 data and act as an intermediary between the
   retailer's store systems and each cart 10. The ISS 330 may also connect over a firewall 332
   through a broadband modem/router 333 via a network (in an embodiment, the Internet or
   VPN 335) to a Host Central Server ("HCS") 340 located at a host company's hosting
   facility. Advertising data and media may be transferred at regular intervals, such as daily,
25 between each store's ISS 330 and the HCS 340. Data transferred from each store's ISS 330
   may be processed by the host company. In an embodiment, both the ISS 330 and HCS 340
   utilize standard Microsoft server configurations or equivalents thereof along with
   supporting database management tools.
30 The Cart Explorer is an application that runs on the store server that is responsible for
   keeping track of all of the carts in the store. The Cart Explorer functions similar to

                                                               - 87
   Windows Explorer for keeping track of computers in a network or other system browser
   technology. The Cart Explorer maintains a status of each cart (e.g. systems, processes, etc.)
   in the fleet via the wireless connection to each cart: the health of each cart, the software
   version running on each cart, disk space cart has available, the location of each cart, the
 5 charging status, and the like. The Cart Explorer enables an individual (such as a trouble
   shooting employee or an employee trained in the setup and use of the overall system) to
   find and control each cart remotely, thereby keeping a store running while performing
   preventative and proactive maintenance. The individual may employ the Cart Explorer to
   display a selectable icon representing each cart in the fleet, such that when selected, a
10 detailed cart status is magnified. The cart status may include an indication of battery life
   remaining, an indication of damage detected, and an indication of data corruption. The cart
   status may also include an indication of a present operating system, an indication of
   present displayable content, and an indication of a version of each supplemental executable
   program. The cart status may further include a graphical representation of the location of
15 the cart in a store map.
   In various embodiments, the Cart Explorer further includes a Cart Pager system. The Cart
   Pager system allows a particular cart or group of carts to be identified or notified from
   within an entire pool or fleet of carts. In one embodiment, when a cart is paged from the
20 Cart Explorer, the cart issues an audible page alert, such as a beep. In another embodiment,
   when a cart is paged from the Cart Explorer, the cart displays a visible page alert, such as a
   message appearing on the cart screen to notify a user. In various embodiments, the Cart
   Explorer Cart Pager system may be used to issue a page to just one cart, or all carts in the
   store. In various embodiments, the Cart Explorer Cart Pager system may be used to issue a
25 page to the computer interface, or to the human interface (i.e., the screen). In various
   embodiments, the Cart Explorer Cart Pager system may include one way paging or two
   way paging.
   In an embodiment, the host company is a parent company for a plurality of retail merchant
30 stores which are networked as described herein. An advertising company or product
   manufacturer may be granted access to the HCS such that product advertising may be

   H:\td\Interwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16016503_l.docx-16 /t12017

   remotely and centrally downloaded to the host company for further dissemination to the
   various individual stores. Likewise, information such as product information, inventory,
   advertising effectiveness, etc. may be accessed from the HSC and uploaded by the
   advertising company or product manufacturer. In this way, an advertising company or
 5 product manufacturer may have a centralized access point for the upload and download of
   advertising or other product data, thereby allowing real-time access and adjustment to
   business activities based upon the effectiveness of a particular activity. For example, a new
   advertising campaign can be downloaded remotely to the HCS, disseminated on a large
   scale or small scale (e.g., a pilot run), and the results of the advertising campaign can be
10 closely monitored in real or about real-time to determine if any adjustments need to be
   made.
   The HCS server is operable to coordinate activity between all the various stores, keeping
   track of all the data from between stores. In various embodiments, a plurality of HCS
15 servers may be implemented. In various embodiments, an HCS server may be dedicated to
   a particular chain of stores that are commonly controlled. The HCS server manages all data
   going to the carts (i.e., digital content management, passing ads, recipes, nutritional
   information, and the like to carts through stores) as well as all the data coming back from
   the carts (i.e., coordination of shop events). The HCS server keeps track of campaigns,
20 banners, and subcategories for product placement and advertising, as well as the placement
   of ads and/or content according to Neilson-like categories or retailer defined categories.
